"A moving and sensitive picture about an Australian father who attempts to find his sons , being Russell Crowe's directorial debut.","After the Battle of Gallipoli, in 1915, an Aussie farmer called Connor (Russell Crowe), travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli to attempt locate his three sons , allegedly missing in action . At a hotel he meets a beautiful widow (Olga Kurylenko who learned Turkish for her character), and later on he tries to find out a way in arrive to Gallipoli , where reportedly died his children . As he must travel across the war-torn landscape with the help of a British Lt Colonel called Hughes (Jai Courtney) and a Turkish Officer (Erdogan) . Meanwhile , there takes place the Greek-Turkish war and the invasion of Smirna by the Greeks . As it is set during the Turkish War of Independence, in revolutionary days during fall of the Ottoman Empire . The War resulted the defeat of Greece in Western Turkey (Greco-Turkish war), on the East, Armenian state and Britain, France and Georgia.This is a family story in which is treated thought-provoking issues with a tough man holding onto hope, fighting for a desire , and bringing to life a promise . Australian Russell Crowe gives an acceptable actiing as the Aussie father who goes out to find his 3 missing sons and while staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he falls in love with a gorgeous widow. The charming Olga Kurylenko is good as the attractive widow mistreated by his brother-in-law who wants to marry her . Support cast is pretty well , such as Jai Courtney , Isabel Lucas and Jacqueline McKenzie who also starred with Crowe in the 1992 hit Romper Stomper . And some fine Turks actors as Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan who are both comedy actors in Turkey .
 It displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Oscar-winning cameraman Andrew Lesnie , being his final movie . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by David Hirschfelder , helped by Lisa Gerard .The motion picture was stunningly acted/produced/directed by Russell Crowe .The picture gives an interesting portrayal about the bloody campaign and battle of Gallipoli . There happened the following : The Gallipoli Campaign, also known as the Dardanelles Campaign, the Battle of Gallipoli, or the Battle of Çanakkale , was a campaign of the First World War that took place on the Gallipoli peninsula (Gelibolu in modern Turkey) in the Ottoman Empire between 17 February 1915 and 9 January 1916. The peninsula forms the northern bank of the Dardanelles, a strait that provided a sea route to the Russian Empire, one of the Allied powers during the war. Intending to secure it, Russia's allies, Britain and France, launched a naval attack followed by an amphibious landing on the peninsula, with the aim of capturing the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (modern Istanbul).The naval attack was repelled and after eight months' fighting, with many casualties on both sides, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force was withdrawn to Egypt.The campaign was the only major Ottoman victory of the war. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand national consciousness; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as ""Anzac Day"", the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing Remembrance Day , Armistice Day .The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Turkey eight years later, with Mustafa Kemal (Kemal Atatürk) as President, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli. Mustafa Kemal, Attaturk commanded the Turkish national movement in the war of independence. His successful military campaigns led to liberation of the country and to the establishing of Turkey. He transformed the former Ottoman Empire into a democratic, modern, secular nation-state , his reforms are referred as Kemalism. Ankara became the new capital and Kemal abolished the Caliphate and Sultanate. .",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Exquisitely-Acted and Heart-wrenchingly Sentimental,","Right from the beginning, Russel Crowe's directorial debut, THE WATER DIVINER, is already sweeping with unfathomable amount of emotions, gathering affection the moment it flashes grim representations of war and what follows at its heels. From there, it treads through compassionate subjects of ambitious scale, stumbling upon its own entanglements at times, but gets saved by towering affectionate performances from its actors.The film follows the story of miraculous farmer (he knows where to find water underneath the arid earth) Joshua Connor (Crowe), whose three sons were sent to the war in Turkey. Years later and none of them has ever come home. His wife mourns over their presumed death, and succumbs to fatal depression. Swearing at his wife's grave to bring their sons' remains home, Connor voyages to Turkey, not even knowing what exactly to expect and see.There is much to admire in Crowe for helming such historical romance, teeming with bold themes about love, family, and war. His directorial inexperience screams with some odd choices he made, like the forced romance between Connor and Olga Kurylenko's widow character, and the mostly ill-woven narrative his screenwriters knitted, but the sentimental performances of his actors and himself, are overwhelming enough to make up for the narrative inconsistencies. These solid heart-shattering performances summon the affection they truly deserve, and make the film, amid of its script's evident flaws, able to relay its sincere intentions, to the audience. Also a key factor for its effective delivery, is an exquisite cinematography that is able to capture the dreadfulness of the war, the sorrow of a grieving and longing father, and the breathtaking sceneries of countryside Australia, assuming incredibly toned palettes that shifts along the landscapes of the story.This movie could have been perfect with an excellently-written script, but considering it's just Crowe's first directorial assignment, I'd say this is one hell of an epic job. Sincere, heart-wrenching, and beautifully-acted, THE WATER DIVINER, packs an incredible wallop of searing emotions, sending the most striking of sentiments, despite the faults in its storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Reasonably promising premise which ultimately falls short,"Set in 1919 The Water Diviner tells the story of an Australian father of three young men all of whom have enlisted with the ANZAC's in the Gallipoli campaign in World War 1. Subsequent to the battle in which the Allied forces were defeated all three have failed to return home and are now presumed dead. Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) their father, a Victorian Outback farmer with a gift for divining water makes a promise to his wife to bring them home and heads off on a quest to Gallipoli to find them.This is the reasonably promising premise laid out in the first 20 minutes of the film. I didn't envisage a swash-buckle fest at this stage; nor is it true to say it becomes this, but the film does veer in that direction once or twice over the ensuing hour and thirty minutes. It seems like a betrayal of the seriousness of the subject matter because of this.The Water Diviner is relatively entertaining but it falls short of what I was hoping for and I think this is because it neither all-out delivers as a full on ravages of war redemption story or as an all- out high-spirited adventure. Having said that some of the battle- scenes (shot in flashback) are unflinching and are probably the best scenes in the film.The cinematography is beautiful to the eye but the end effect here is that it feels too sanitised at times. There are other things that rankle as well- a burgeoning love story which comes over as too shoe-horned and heavy handed for my liking and in my view steals the central story of its import. There are two scenes in particular where the viewer is required to make the jump from believing in the power of the diviners hand to believing in altogether more mystical powers or insights divined by the same hand (also to do with powers of location). Another thing to watch out for; the film plays host to a stock character or two- witness the very officious English officer who speaks in stereotypical clipped tones, previously seen in countless other films.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Well-intentioned but clumsy,"Well-intentioned but clumsy.It is 1919 and, after his wife's death, an Australian man, Connor (played by Russell Crowe), goes to Turkey to find the graves and remains of the three sons he lost at Gallipoli in World War 1.The movie is a bit of a hit-and-miss affair. The search for his sons (which turns out to be much more complicated than anticipated) is quite an emotional journey. Along the way we see how they died, and experience the wastefulness and futility of war. We also see the war from the eyes of Turkish people, who also lost many loved ones in the war, often to Australians.On the other hand, many of the scenes don't seem written or staged well, giving the movie a rickety sort of feel. The whole romance angle seems out of place too.Overall, a decent and watchable attempt by Russell Crowe on his directorial debut. A bit more tightness in the script and polish in direction and this would have been a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, beautiful scenery but could have been historically more complete","Great movie although Russell does not look old enough to have adult sons. The water diviner title is also rather weak and not really anything to do with the story as far as I can tell.What is good is the scenery in Turkey is stunning. Its a beautiful country and this movies does it justice. The story as well is entertaining and well told. Russell has done a good job with such serious and heavy going subject matter.Movie goes out of its way to acknowledge and show the Turkish side. Full credit for that especially coming from Australia which often brushes over this. Sadly failed to acknowledge the other allies that were fighting alongside the Anzacs which suffered terrible casualties as well. I appreciate this was about the Anzacs but it made out as though they were the only ones involved so an opportunity missed to truly educate everyone as to exactly what happened. The token British toff thrown in to rub salt into the wound of the thousands of British, french, canadians, kiwis etc that died in the campaign as well.The overall casualties were shown at the end but no mention that they were not all Anzacs. I appreciate its Hollywood and historical accuracy is not their strong point. But given the outstanding efforts made to show the Turkish side fairly I think this was poor. Likewise the nationalist uprising taking place in Istanbul was not really explained very well and little mention of Ataturk.Otherwise entertaining. Enjoyed it and recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Cross-Cultural Jewel, Incredibly Powerful Message","First of all, I am neither Australian nor Turkish. I'm from Rio, as far away as it can get from either country - not only in terms of geography, but also, and most importantly, in culture. I enjoyed ""The Water Diviner"" enormously nonetheless (watched it in Mediterranean Turkey on a trip), for this jewel of a movie is built upon universal themes of common appeal to our shared humankind.This is the first film from an English-speaking country with a huge budget and world-famous actors that thoroughly succeeds in overcoming jingoism and achieving a perfectly harmonious, cross- culture balance of fairness that I have ever watched in my entire life.The story has an amazing soul, a mesmerizing spiritual power, and a refreshing perspective on History. As a scholar of History, I'd say it treats a noble Turkish nation victim of absolutely unprovoked aggression from all sides during World War I with long-overdue justice after a 100 years, while retaining the dignity of ANZAC soldiers who fought with great bravery and loyalty for a dubious British cause.""The Water Diviner"" is not only a cinematographic masterpiece of rare beauty. It is a powerful statement of tolerance, a testimony of endless hope and love.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"To the genius ""read some history"" fans","Well, why did I give 6 stars? Cause it was a good film, the flow of the movie was somehow forced, different pieces of the movie could not constitute a whole in my opinion, and it was due to the need to tell as much as possible in a limited amount time. But still acting, the story, scripts were above average. Now, lets talk about haters ""read some history"" propaganda. I am not gonna say Turks were the complete victims, genocide claims are totally empty and so forth. All of these arguments have some valid points from academic point of view.Ottoman Empire had harbored many nations; although the word ""nation"" and what it represents are very newly formed concepts in history (depends on the nationalism movement in 18th history). Moreover, just read and accept this, nationalism is a sociologically constructed human made concept, it has absolutely no biological foundation. And OK, Ottoman Empire had its faults and different practices during its time history, but seriously consider Europe between 1400-1800, just to say ""the world is a sphere"" was enough to spend you life in jail. So, saying something like ""for like years we were crushed and forced into sudden and unexpected practices"" does not justify brutish approach and it certainly does not mean Turk cannot be victims after.OK you know International Institute of Social History; it is an archive on social history and an independent scientific Institute founded in 1935. Read ""Turkey. A Modern History"" by Erik-Jan Zürcher if you somehow manage to spare your precious time, he was the head of the institute for 15 years. It is one of the most objective approaches you can find for Turkish history. There, apart from everything else (including Genocide claims of Armenians), you would see that the events in gallipoli war was not really that different from what you see in the film. So, instead of ranting on saying things like ""I am oh so so angry, cannot write, so angry, cannot see, crap this is, ohh very angry, Greeks and Armenians are the victims always, Turks are always the oppressors always, ohh angry"", get out of your high school history books and make real research for once in your incredibly valuable life.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Just a really terrific movie.  Great job, Russell Crowe.","Not going to give it 10 out of 10 stars, because you should always save your 10. However, this movie is close to perfect. Very loosely based on what might have been a true story (a war record that mentioned that 'only one father came looking for his sons' at Gallipoli after the war). Really well acted. The war scenes conveyed some of the horror without being gratuitous in the violence or gore. There was some shown, but only briefly, and really just enough to set the scenes. The movie is well- paced, well edited and doesn't drag. The lead actors (including the young Turkish boy) were all perfectly cast. At the start of the 100th anniversary year of the Gallipoli landings, this is a story that was well worth telling. Great job, Russell Crowe.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely not a very impressive directorial debut for Crowe.,"'THE WATER DIVINER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Russell Crowe makes his directorial debut, with this war drama film; about a farmer searching for his missing sons, who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli, four years earlier. Crowe also stars in the movie, as the farmer, and it costars Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan, Cem Yilmaz, Dylan Georgiades, Ryan Corr (of 'WOLF CREEK 2' fame), Jaqueline McKenzie and Jai Courtney. It was written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight; and it's based on the book, of the same name, by Anastasios and his wife, Dr. Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios. I found it to be pretty slow-paced, and clichéd (at times), but it comes to a pretty rewarding conclusion; that almost redeems the rest of the film.The story begins in Australia, in 1919 (four years after the end of World War I). Joshua Connor (Crowe) is a farmer, and water diviner, that's still obsessing over his three missing sons; who never returned home from the Battle of Gallipoli. His wife, Eliza (McKenzie), commits suicide; due to the presumed death of their boys. After the loss of Eliza, as well, Joshua decides to travel to Turkey; and bring back his sons.The film starts out promising, while setting up it's story (and characters), then it becomes really slow-moving (and dull). The movie really takes a turn for the worse, when a war-widowed love interest is introduced, for Crowe (played by Kurylenko). That's when the film gets really clichéd (and corny). It does come to an exciting, and pretty emotionally charged, conclusion though; that almost makes it all worthwhile. Crowe is good in the lead performance, but his directing skills can definitely use some work. I've also read that the movie is incredibly historically inaccurate, and insulting to some (many it appears, actually). The film is definitely not a very impressive directorial debut for Crowe; to say the least.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE",6.0,Anonymous,History
The best movie we've seen this year,"The preview did not hint at the complex and gripping tale in store for us, beyond that of a father seeking his sons' fate on the battlefields of Gallipoli. Crowe clearly sought to make a powerful statement about war (my wife was moved to tears during the battlefield scenes) but did not overdo it at the expense of an engaging plot. We left the cinema with a new insight to the Gallipoli story, that being the cost to the Turkish people.Crowe was very convincing in his role of the grieving, relentless father. Fantastic support role by Yilmaz Ergodan and, although brief, Ryan Corr was very moving.Don't wait for this to come to DVD, it is best appreciated on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This film would be better placed under the category of science-fiction,"So, we have an Australian superhero who, being a humble peasant and family man in his homeland travels to Turkey in the years after WWI in search for his disappeared sons, and once there he manages to: 1) get to the place of the Gallipoli battle and find the exact place where two of his sons were killed and lie under ground, all thanks to the seeming extrasensorial faculties he possesses, 2) again with some extrasensorial help (intuition will say some...) find his third son alive in a remote village, 3) allow the escape of a foe-turned-friend Turkish military official from a fully armed squad of Greek soldiers using a wicket to fight them, and 4) beat up a group of members of a Turkish family clan one of whose members had been previously insulted by our protagonist (this time he was barehanded and the ones using sticks were the rivals).Why the surviving son never returned home when he was not badly injured or affected in his mental faculties after the battle (and is now living a miserable life in a small remote village) is not coherently explained, being this the triggering point of a family tragedy that prompted the trip of the protagonist.Apart from all this... pretty photography in evocative sepia colors, a ravishing Olga Kurylenko playing a Turkish widow soon-to-marry as second wife a rich man (but making googly eyes to our hero now and then), and a playful smart boy intermingling occasionally in the story, may keep you mildly entertained if you do not take the story too seriously.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Not quite a masterpiece,"The Water Diviner is a very interesting and beautifully-made film, giving an unusual post-war aspect of the well-known Gallipoli story. The production design, cinematography and acting are all excellent and the story (based on an actual event) is a powerful and moving one. Russell Crowe proves himself to be an able director, and the film is well structured and edited. I agree with other reviewers here that it also offers a sensitive and respectful view of Turkish culture. There is rather a lot of violence, both in the 'present' and in the flashbacks, although I realise that it is difficult to make a movie about war without depicting violence.But unfortunately the whole film is deeply marred by the schmaltzy, unrealistic and frankly unbelievable 'love story' between the Aussie farmer Connor and an impossibly glamorous Turkish woman at the hotel. For me, this completely ruined an otherwise very good film. Sorry, Russell, but you have caved in to the Hollywood demand for soppy romance at the expense of verisimilitude.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Crowe's solid directorial debut,"Quickie Review:After the death of his three sons in the WWI Battle of Gallipoli, devastated by the loss Connor's (Russell Crowe) wife takes her own life. To fulfill her last wish, Connor travels to Turkey to return their sons' bodies back to Australia, their home. The Water Diviner is both well-acted and filmed. The movie fully develops its character while fairly showing the perspectives from both sides affected by the war. It is not without flaws in that it occasionally adds melodrama to the war drama. Still as a whole this is a solid directorial debut by Russell Crowe.Full Review:To be honest, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I rarely heard people talk about it and I only found out this movie even existed about a month or so ago. Nevertheless, I went in curious to see what Russell Crowe delivers as a director and mostly I liked what he achieved.The performances in The Water Diviner are really good. That's not surprising from the talented Russell Crowe but Olga Kurylenko did some of her best work here as well. I always thought Kurylenko was a serviceable actress but in this movie she actually shows some range. Asides from the performances, I appreciated the different perspectives that were shown from the people involved in the war. War dramas can at times fall into the trap of painting the different sides black or white. Fortunately The Water Diviner recognizes and presents the fact that both sides have their guilty executioners and innocent victims just caught in the middle of a senseless war. So the delicate handling of such a subject matter should be commended. Also the cinematography of the movie was quite impressive, capturing the life and landscape of the early 1900s Turkey.What hindered the movie from being great for me were the moments where the movie got a bit too melodramatic. I can't say much without revealing some of the plot points but these were scenes that clearly Crowe wanted the audience to be emotionally affected. However, the scenes are repeated so often or prolonged for so long that they started to lose their effect on me and felt like I was being begged to shed a tear. On top of that, all too often there are so many coincidences, the movie almost becomes a fantasy rather than a serious war drama. These series of coincidences solve many of the problems that Crowe's character faced, wrapping up in a nice little bow. It diminishes any sense of struggle and as a result I ended up being less invested whenever the characters were in danger.All in all The Water Diviner is a good movie. I just wish the movie wasn't pandering to our emotions and instead let the story unfold more organically. Nevertheless, considering this is the first feature length film as a director for Russell Crowe I am interested to see what he takes on next.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
Film Diviner: Crowe's Directorial Debut Proves to Be An Extremely Successful One,"Russell Crowe can direct. The Australian actor has transformed himself in one of Hollywood's best, after consecutive roles for which he was Oscar nominated in The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind (he won for Gladiator). He's continued to cement himself as a quality actor with more recent roles in films such as Cinderella Man, Noah, and most recently The Water Diviner. With The Water Diviner Russell Crowe took on the extra role of directing, for the first time. With Crowe's leadership The Water Diviner turns out to be a quality, greatly paced, and very entertaining film.The Water Diviner is inspired by actual events. It tells the story of an Australian farmer named Connor (Russell Crowe), who lives with his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenize). The couple lives in an extremely dry part of the 1919 Australia, (Region of Victoria) where it rains every so many years. In order to survive and maintain his crops, Connor resorts to a divine ritual that helps him locate underground pockets of water, which he later transforms into wells. At night we see Eliza persuade Connor to ""read to the kids"" after Crowe finishes a chapter of Arabian Nights the camera pans to three empty beds. We soon learn that Connor's three children volunteered to fight for the British in World War I, but they never came back. The last that Connor had heard of them was from the bloody battle of Gallipoli in Turkey; the army had given them up for dead. However, after a drastic turn of events in Australia, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his sons.What surprised me most was the incredible balance that the film had, it doesn't rely on one facet to carry out its story: the acting was great, the script was witty, and the length and pace were perfect. A first time director is expected to fall on a cheesy and ""safer"" route; inexperienced directors also tend to make longer movies to ""have more to show."" Crowe, however, managed to put together a great team that stayed true to Crowe's and their cinematic beliefs.The acting is exceptional. What I most appreciated about it was that it came from lesser- known actors. Apart from Russell Crowe, the rest of the cast was comprised mainly of Turkish and Australian actors, amongst which Cem Yilmaz and Yilmaz Erdogan shine out by playing Turkish military officials. We also have notable performances from Jai Courtney, who adds a bit of star power (is known for Divergent, Jack Reacher, A Good Day to Die Hard, and is in the upcoming Terminator: Genysis) but plays a more minor role, and a fantastic Olga Kurylenko (known for Oblivion) who holds her ground against Crowe with a challenging role of a hotel owner who believes her husband (who was also in Gallipoli) is still alive. The actors give each other space, and Crowe resists hogging the screen, this gives the cast and the film the great balance mentioned before.The script really surprised me. It could have been easy to take this true story and make it extremely cheesy and tacky for the general audiences (like Unbroken did), but the dialogue ended up being extremely smart, daring even to crack a few original jokes. Historically it's also accurate, which gives me a relief since period pieces sometimes sloth over history research. But what worked really well was the unpredictability that the script maintained. At first you start guessing (""oh he's gonna end up with her,"" or ""oh he's going to find his sons and its gonna be all great""), but the script pulls you this way and that so that you end up doubting your predictions and are on the edge of your seat for nearly the whole film. The script also took a bold move in combining a war story with a road story. The film could have messed up the scale and abused one story theme too much, but, again, the film was able to achieve a great balance that ends up being the key to its success. What I especially liked about the script was how it never takes on one biased perspective. It doesn't frame all the English as good and all the Turks as bad. There is a mix of each (just like in real life), and that balance of perspective not only allows for a more believable story, but it also gives proper respect to both historical sides, something not normally seen in Hollywood films.Overall the film gives us a peek at Russell Crowe's possible directing career. Could he be the next Clint Eastwood? It's a little too early to make such bold predictions but, nonetheless, he's on the right path.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Film from A Great Man,"If this is Russell Crowe's first film I can't wait to see what is to come. The Water Diviner takes you an an impossible, heart warming journey of a father looking for his sons after the tragedy of Gallipoli. What this film does well is captures both sides of the battle, the Turkish and the ANZAC's. It is visually stunning, emotionally charged and does more than most movies to pry open your empathetic side.The cast are amazing but I think my praise would have to go to Ryan Corr, Yilmaz Erdogen and Olga Kurylenko for three beautiful performances. All three of them aid Crowe's performance in a highly emotional way and create depth and love within the film.I highly recommend giving this film a go if you appreciate a film with a good story and good talent and I hope it receives the praise and attention it deserves. It is definitely worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"I'm disappointed, everything here is so familiar and full of clichés - the film just don't have the resonance it so desperately strives to find","For me, directorial debut of Russell Crowe and his attempt to tell a tale of war, tragedy, loss, romance and healing was quite long, clichéd, uneven and unsatisfying movie experience. He also, as a main character, seems to be blessed with some mystical power. Really??? The use of flashback confuses the issue, leaving us scratching our heads as to whether we are sharing his psychic visions or it's simply a matter of clumsy editing. In general, movie is too unfocused, while the film has none of expected dramatic tension or emotional depth. Ukrainian-born Olga Kurylenko is miscasted here, and no matter she tries her best, it's difficult to accept her as valid character. Actually, whole this (an extraneous romance) aspect of the story is awkwardly introduced and never especially credible. Movie runtime is too long (111m). Also, no matter that the story develops complex characters such as Turkish Major Hasan, it also contains some unfortunate, to say stereotypes or today political correctness such as the Turks as noble and heroic, the British as pompous and arrogant, the Greeks as savages and marauding bandits (Satan's army, says one of the film's characters), Aussie soldiers as a raging blood thirsty killers, while the priest is being presented as quite 'unholy' man. With its tendency towards such ... oversimplification (who produced this movie I wonder), this 'water' may not taste right. Because of so many clichés, the movie barely emotionally touched me, while most of its runtime I was bored. Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"", starring a very young Mel Gibson, is much better option for an iconic image of Aussie WWI heroism, if ever there was one. At the end, Russell Crowe is much better actor than he is director. Disappointed so much, I even disliked the font used for the titles.Rating: 6-/5+ Just 'cos of nice scenography",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A beautiful, heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.","One does not have to be Turkish or an ANZAC descendant to be interested and touched by this film.. doesn't need to be necessarily interested in history, either. The Water Diviner offers something for everyone who carries a heart and soul. It offers a beautiful yet heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.If I were asked ""what is this movie about?"" I'd say it's an epic tale of love and hope, a beautifully crafted story inspired by real life, and a breath-taking masterpiece that makes you forget where you are, or what time/day/year it is. It really is a captivating film. The story itself may sound rather simple to some, but in my opinion it's a spectacular mix of reality and art. Hats off to Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight for their great work, the Water Diviner tells a magical tale and reminds us what wars do to people, to families.. and to our humanity. I cannot imagine anyone who won't be touched by this film, touched very deep inside, that is. Whoever that ever loved somebody or lost a beloved one –sibling, parent, child, significant other, or friend, you name it– may have their heart shattered during certain scenes of the Water Diviner.Apart from the story, the characters too felt so ""real"", and the cast performances were nothing short of what one would expect from such brilliant names. Russell Crowe, as always, seemed to ""live"" the role, not ""just act"" it.. and I'm so very glad that Cem Yilmaz has been in such a special project. In an attempt to keep my review as short as possible, and choosing to comment on acting after I see the movie more than once, I won't go into detail of each and every name. But.. I have to say that Ryan Corr's performance was outstanding! He and James Fraser certainly nailed it, causing a flood of tears among the audience –during a certain scene of this duo, I could hear sniffles and see shoulders shaking among the audience.. and I'm not exaggerating one bit. Speaking of the scenes that certainly leave a mark on the viewer, I'd like to say that certain scenes from the battle field were spectacular – both technically and artistically. The scenes are so ""real"" that they take you from your seat and put you on Lone Pine battlefield , feeling scared.. helpless.. angry.. and questioning what a war is.. and if it's even worth it. And then, there is a specific scene which reflect how a war can make people lose their humanity and surface the ferocity of human nature. As my favorite scene from the epic Noah, the creation scene, reminded us all: ""Brother against brother. Nation against nation. Man against the creation. We murdered each other. We broke the world, we did this. Man did this.""The fascinating art is not limited to battle scenes, though. Andrew Lesnie simply works miracles, turning the movie into a feast for the eyes –from the dust storm in Australia to the breath-taking views of Istanbul, the Water Diviner presents top-quality cinematography *thumbs up* Before I wrap up my words on this beautiful piece of art, I'd like to mention two of the many special scenes which may well be extra-touching for the Turkish: i) The scene where Jemal (portrayed by Cem Yilmaz) raises a toast to Mustafa Kemal: During the screening at the Istanbul premiere, the audience responded to this by loud and clear applause, and it certainly will remain an unforgettable scene for many, many Turks. ii) Another special part of the movie that I really loved is the old Turkish folk song Jemal sings –an old song called ""hey fifteen year olds"", telling the story of 15 year old boys leaving home to join the battle of Gallipoli.Taken together, the Water Diviner tells a tale of love mingled with adventure, delivers a sea of emotions from grief to hope, and works the magic of cinema, reaching the viewers' heart and mind in a way that crosses all barriers of language, different cultures, politics, and history.PS: the Water Diviner was rewarded standing ovation, and I believe this was not only because it's a great movie, it was also a heart-felt ""thank you"" to the director for such an honest story which the Turkish audience isn't used to seeing in foreign films about Turkey and its history.Kudos and hats off to Russell Crowe & the entire cast and crew. The Water Diviner (Turkish title: Son Umut, i.e. 'the Last Hope') is a spectacular movie, a must-see, a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"An earnest, but flawed, first entry for Crowe.","One cannot watch this movie without experiencing mixed emotions.This is a well-meaning and earnest film which flaws are the consequence of poorly considered and unbalanced writing and character construction, as well as somewhat simplistic stereotypes.it is not an issue that only 3 women feature in substantial roles in the film; my issue is the positioning of these women. The first is Connor's wife, the mother of his sons, and crucial to the motivation of the plot; we can't expect much of her, given that all we need to know is that the loss of her children understandably induces the loss of her sanity. It is tragic but brief; She rarely features even in flashbacks. The second, Olga Kurylenko's character, is a strong-willed but socially subjugated widow obsessed with her MIA husband; the entirety of her screen time is expended either discussing her missing spouse, the pressure to marry her brother- in-law, her obligations to her son and flirting with Connor; while her character contributes to the story by providing a window into Ottoman Turkish household culture, she really is little more than a love interest for Russel Crowe; the third character is the inn's resident Circassian prostitute - need i say more. It possibly sounds worse than it is. While the female characters are far from purely objectified, they seem to provide little more than support to an otherwise predominantly male film. While failing the Bechdel test, it still manages to be sensitive and relatively respectful, at least at a tertiary level.like almost all Australian films that feature British characters, practically every Briton in this film is a cartoon-like, two-dimensional stereotype; the most prominent of which is of course the absolute favourite of Aussie filmmakers: the stuffy, pompous, and insensitive martinet army officer. The only broadly sympathetic British character is a junior naval officer about the right age for a midshipman, but who is bizarrely addressed as a lieutenant, which is very weird. Perhaps predictably for an Australian film about Gallipoli, the real enemy is the Pommie. This adds a two-dimensional and callow aspect to a story which attempts to address a particularly complex period of history; there is absolutely no consideration for depth in relation to any of the British characters whatsoever.-the treatment of the Turkish characters, and Turkish history in this period, is probably the biggest issue,with this film. Australian historiography relating to the Turks at Gallipoli tends towards the respectful and the positive, which may explain the political position of the film, and which by itself is not a problem; but it is the treatment of the Turkish political position in the post-war period that becomes galling; without exception, the Turks are portrayed as the innocent victims of foreign imperialism and aggression; simple, decent and patriotic; every Turkish soldier, for example, is noble and honourable. They are shown as the victim of atrocities committed by the invading Greeks, who feature only sufficiently to identify them as bloodthirsty and murderous monsters bent on genocide and rapine; no mention whatsoever is made of Turkish atrocities against the Greeks, or the Armenians, or anyone else. I don't mean to detract from the quantity of undoubtedly upstanding and decent Turkish men who served their country at this time, but neither do i think that this film's portrayal represents anything like a well- rounded perspective of the period. As a comparison, it would literally be impossible to find a contemporary German film about ww2 which did not feature at least one Character who was a Nazi.For all its faults, it still manages to project a sense of charm, even while featuring anything as dubious as water-divining. The photography is generally appropriately attractive, the scenery is often enchanting, and the standard of acting is relatively high. The Turkish landscape is wonderfully showcased and the Turkish actors are all competent if not outstanding. If Crowe intends a transition into directing, then this is a strong, albeit flawed, starting point.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An absolute masterpiece,"Russell Crowe has absolutely outdone himself with this film; it had me entranced from the start. Beautifully shot, amazing casting and the time and effort put into the making of this film really shone through. I feel the costumers deserve an Oscar nomination for this one - everything was spot on which for a period drama is almost impossible:) Flawless casting and great character development leads the viewer through the story; this film will bring out emotions and provoke thought. I loved the perspective of the film; it is an exceptional sensitive retelling of an historical story from both perspectives and I think this is one of the absolute highlights of this film.See it - you won't be disappointed!Take the tissues though...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good overall but too slow at times,"'The Water Diviner' is a good movie with many positives aspects - the plot has depth, it is well acted out and Russell Crowe did a reasonably good job as director. You do, however, have to be patient and make an effort to stick with this movie because, in parts, it's very slow.I also wasn't keen on the many flashbacks/flashforwards which didn't really add anything to the movie and just made the storyline harder to follow. There's nothing wrong with the plot itself but I felt it could have been executed better on screen.Overall though I thought 'The Water Diviner' was a good movie with a plot with enough depth to keep it interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Simple minded and loses its point,"Good British, good Australians, good Turks and bad Greeks in a simple minded approach of the really turbulent and complicated post WWI period in Asia Minor. War is a crime committed by the ruling classes of societies so they can pursue their own interests sacrificing their own people.The movie has all the ingredients needed to become a good movie about how people independent of their nationalities can keep their humanity even in brutal periods (like a war) forgive, respect and help each other. But since it chooses to depict only one of the nations involved in this war (the Greeks) as the bad guys it looses completely its point.And no this didn't bother me as you may think , because I am Greek. I like Turkish people and I see them as a brother nation and it's true that in this specific period they did a defensive war against an encouraged by UK and France Greek imperialism. So I would do the same criticism if any other people was depicted negatively.",5.0,Anonymous,History
nice epic style,"Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) is an Australian farmer who lost his three sons in the Battle of Gallipoli. Four years later, his wife Eliza dies and he vows to bring his sons home to be buried next to their mother. In Istanbul, he rents a room from war widow Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) who is under pressure. Connor sneaks into Gallipoli despite the British military. Major Hasan commanded Turkish troops during the battle and decides to help Connor find his dead sons.There is a sense of the great epic. I really like the movie going to Gallipoli. However, it goes on a little too long with a few twist that is less believable. It would be better to not have those turns. It also tries to make the Turks victims and the Greeks villains which doesn't necessarily sit well. I do have a few problems with the story in the second half. It's Russell Crowe's theatrical directing debut and his visual efforts are impressive. He is able to keep flow of the story and shows some solid skills as a director.",6.0,Anonymous,History

During the screening it was very clear to me the audience was won over and totally engrossed in the movie, just as I was. Watched allot of movies in 2014, but this one is of a higher standard all round. This movie has the potential to be nominated for awards and any it wins would be well deserving.

"""The Water Diviner"" is a good (but not great) directorial debut for Russell Crowe.","World War I and its immediate aftermath is the backdrop for Russell Crowe's ""The Water Diviner"" (R, 1:51), a story about a father's love. You don't need to know much about The Great War to appreciate this film. The script tells you what you need to understand about the history of it all, but if you'd like to appreciate the film even more, you might want to read the next paragraph. (If not, you could just skip to the third paragraph.)One of the most famous battles in World War I (1914-1918) was the Gallipoli Campaign (1915-1916). It was fought on a peninsula which overlooks the entrance to the Dardanelles. Beyond those straits lay Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. What's left of the Ottoman Empire is now the nation of Turkey and its capital is Ankara, but in late 1915, those changes were several years away and the Ottoman Turks were fighting for their empire against foreign invaders. As a member of ""The Central Powers"" (the Ottoman, the Austro-Hungarian and the German empires), the Ottomans fought against ""The Allies"" which included Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, and, starting in 1917, the U.S. At the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turks eventually forced the invading troops from France and Britain and the colonies of the British Empire, including ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers, to abandon their Gallipoli Campaign, but not before over 100,000 men lay dead and twice that many had been injured.In this film, Russell Crowe plays an Australian farmer named Joshua Connor. It's 1919, the year after World War I ended, and four years since his sons went off to fight but never returned. Connor busies himself trying to make a living off of the land of rural Australia. Part of that process involves digging wells. He uses a pair of divining rods to help him decide where to dig. It's not an exact science. In fact, much like a Ouija board, a divining rod probably only works because the user wants it to work NEEDS it to work. Finding water with divining rods probably has as much to do with the instinct of the user than anything else. Fortunately for Connor, he has VERY good instincts. Yet, Connor's wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), teetering on the brink of insanity, berates him for being able to find water, but being unable to find his sons. Connor promises Eliza that he will indeed find their boys (Ryan Corr, James Fraser and Ben O'Toole) and bring them home for a proper burial.Connor makes the three-month journey from Australia to Turkey, which only represents the beginning of his hardships. Upon arriving in Constantinople, a young boy runs off with Connor's only bag. Connor chases Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) and doesn't catch up to him until Orhan has led Connor to the hotel that Orhan's family runs. It is a nice place, but Connor is met with thinly veiled hostility from Orhan's mother, Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), whose Turkish husband died in the war, likely at the hands of one of Connor's countrymen or their allies. Ayshe's brother-in-law, Omer (Steve Bastoni) – and, if he gets his way, her second husband – welcomes Connor and he checks in. The family (especially Orhan), warms to Connor but figuring out how to find his sons is even tougher. The British consul's office won't give civilians permission to go to Gallipoli, so Conner has to find his own way. When he finally makes it there, he meets an Australian officer (Jai Courtney) and his Turkish counterpart (Yilmaz Edrogan) who are working together on a graves detail at the massive cemetery that is Gallipoli. Connor first has to convince these men to help him, or at least allow him, to look for his sons. Then, it's going to take all his divining talents to find their remains and even more than that to solve the mystery he uncovers.""The Water Diviner"" is Crowe's feature film directorial debut, and he handles the job well mostly. The flashbacks of the battle scenes are as meticulously staged and gut wrenchingly real as anything this side of ""Saving Private Ryan"". It's also nice to see mostly real Turks playing the parts of Turks and mostly Aussies playing the parts of Australians (although Crowe was actually born in New Zealand and some of the Turkish characters are played by actors from Down Under). The script and the editing tell a very personal story, keep it interesting, and skillfully reveal the film's secrets.Unfortunately, this film may not be the most accessible in terms of its setting and its general story. The events depicted all took place 95-100 years ago and the Battle of Gallipoli doesn't mean much to most Americans, while in Australia and New Zealand, the date the invasion began is a holiday akin to our Memorial Day. Also, the movie gets a bit off track with some plot points that feel contrived and by making too much of Connor's special abilities, without ever explaining why he's special. Are his talents supernatural? Is he lucky? Or is he just really, really good? And, why doesn't Crowe make the answer clear? Between Connor's vaguely divine talent for divining and a highly improbable romance, this movie almost seems as much a fantasy as a drama ""inspired by true events."" It's a good first effort, Mr. Crowe, but keep working at it. ""B""",6.0,Anonymous,History

Self Indulgenges rubbish and and insult to our Gallipolli hero's,"Just another of Russell Crowe's self indulgent movies. The Ottoman Empire picked the wrong Allie during WW1 (Germany) and we are expected to feel that we Australians were the aggressors. From 1915 to 1921 the Ottoman Empire eliminated 1,000,000 of their neighbor's namely Assyrians and Greeks yet in Crowe's movie the Greeks are type cast as the bad guys. What a load of crap! The final escape by Crowe and his last surviving son was ludicrous with the invading Greeks mortaring the hillside just to blow up two non military and non Turkish individuals. Prior to that, in the train scene, Crowe managed to escape his Greek captives by hitting them with a cricket bat despite the fact that he had numerous weapons at his disposal. It is disappointing that in the 100th year anniversary of the Gallipolli campaign this over rated New Zealander can muddy the water and try to change the facts for the sake of making a few cheap bucks.",3.0,Anonymous,History

"A technically good film, but fell flat for me","Russell Crowe is great in this film about personal loss, the horror and futility of war and about friendship that transcends borders and sides. Everything was spot on: acting, directing, sets, editing, soundtrack. Yet it all felt artificial and heavy handed, akin to The Hundred- Foot Journey, if you saw it, albeit with a completely different subject.There was some interesting commentary about why people fight in wars and what they feel and do when the wars are seemingly over. Also one can learn more about an almost forgotten part of history, when Turkey was still the Ottoman Empire and was fighting Australians and New Zealanders, then Greeks while the British were lording around. But the rest... I felt like someone was taking feelings in bulk and throwing them at me, containers and all, like so many brick in one's face.Suffering? We haz it! Stoic hopefulness? Tons of it! Cardboard villains? One for each occasion. Love story that made little sense in the plot, especially at the end? Yup. And so on and so on. If it weren't for Crowe, who acted brilliantly, I would have considered this film a failure. As such, I would have to give it an average rating, although I personally didn't like it.Bottom line: it felt like a movie made by an accountant.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Kept promises (?),"Russell Crowe has been directed by many good and qualified directors, so by now he must have picked up on many of things. Which I reckon can be seen in his directorial debut. Would it have been better if he had just concentrated on one thing though? Tough to say, especially because it does not seem to affect his acting in the movie at least. The direction on he other hand ... that's up for discussion, unless you argue it was the script that needed improvements.Having said all that, the movie is emotional and it does take you on a (literal) journey. It also seems very strong on making a point in showing gray areas in war and laying out blame. To a certain degree that is, because you do get some ""bad people"" to, which is a shame and not consistent to what the message should be about. Not to mention an overly dramatic ending, that really was unnecessary. Other than that, this was more than a decent film debut",6.0,Anonymous,History
A 'Must See' on the Big Screen!,"I've just come back from the cinema after seeing this movie and will now be emailing everyone on my contact list that it is a 'must see' on the big screen. Not just for Australians, but for everyone, as it deals with universal themes. The cinematography is stunningly beautiful, the casting and acting is superb and the story is fascinating and never lags. A great blend of emotion and action, and the occasional bit of humour. Last August marked the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WW1, which influenced all our lives. It is so important for people everywhere, and especially young people to learn about what has happened in the past and to gain an understanding of history from the point of view of others, and to learn about their cultures too. This movie, set mainly in Turkey, about 4 years after the end of the war, is one small story of one man's search, set within a much larger story of the meaning and consequences of war.

"Meh, rather forgettable film.**** Mild spoilers.","First off I'll say that I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews of this film (9's and 10's). This movie was quite predictable, and seemed it lacked serious drama and emotion. I did like the feel of the movie as far as how it looked and felt like early 1900s era, world war 1 turkey. It also has some nice shots of the Hagia Sophia and some beautiful scenes in both Istanbul/Constantinople as well as elsewhere in Turkey and in Australia. Russell Crowe was OK in it but I really don't understand how he was able to find his sons bodies, I mean I realize he can find water with dowsing rods but he wasn't using any to find the bones of his sons and it never really explained that very well. Another minor thing is Olga Kurylanko is almost to beautiful, she is already a knockout but when she looks so flawless it takes some of the believability away from a film in my opinion. I don't mind looking at her as she is stunning but she's almost a distraction from the authenticity of the film. The biggest problem I have with this film is the character development, most notably the sons that went to war. I never felt any emotion or connection with their characters as they are not given much screen time but mostly just some flashback scenes and some minor clips of them at war. It was enough to let us viewers know what happened to them but not nearly enough time to make us care about them and what they go thru. Overall This is an OK film but I wasn't moved by it and it seemed very predictable. Although it tried to make u feel certain emotions or importance in many of it's scenes it didn't seem very organic, it felt forced. Like I said it's OK but I can't really say much more then that, it wasn't awful but it's nothing I'd recommend and I think it's rather forgettable as a film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Almost Perfect,"This movie managed to satisfy my thirst for a genuine war film. As a historian and a cinephile, I must say it even exceeded my expectations. Standing ovation for Mr Crowe!Water Diviner contained a gripping story, brilliant cues and amazing scenes as well as a fresh approach to the events of WWI, all of which will stay embroidered in my memory for the rest of my days. Acting was pretty solid. Especially the performance of the local comedy star Cem Yilmaz was impressive and some hilarious moments he offered stood as a fine contrast to the general melancholia of the scenes.Some of the user reviews here on IMDb accused the production as falsely depicting historical events. Most of these strange reviews contained the same copy/pasted lines that had nothing to do with facts. I've done my finishing thesis on the World Wars and I know enough to say there has never been a genocide of minorities in Turkey. These minorities wouldn't be ""minorities"" if (as claimed by a few users here) their numbers could be measured by millions. If you add the numbers up, the total ""death toll"" would be almost higher than the entire Ottoman population :) And the assertion that the Greek were sent to Western Anatolia just to protect the Christian population there... utter nonsense! The Greek troops were merely tongs of the British army who were too wise to handle the fire themselves. They were there to occupy those lands and they committed lots of atrocities, burning down Turkish villages even as they retreated from the battlefield. The movie depicts them as what they really are.All in all, a definite recommend to any war movie fan out there. This was one journey to remember!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Pure Beauty!,"Loosely based on the book of the same name, written by Andrew Anastasios and Dr Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios, 'The Water Diviner' which marks the Directorial Debut of Russell Crowe, is a beautiful film, that tells a tale that's saddening & yet moving. Crowe calls the shots with conviction & his performance in the central role, is beyond amazing!'The Water Diviner' Synopsis: An Australian man travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli to try and locate his three missing sons.'The Water Diviner' is a story of pure beauty & depth. I was moved & engrossed by the people I saw in this film. Especially the protagonist, played by Crowe. Its a character thats entirely tragic & yet engaging. I wanted him to find his missing sons & also get some redemption.'The Water Diviner' has one minus point though, and that's its pace. The slow-pacing in the first-hour acts a bit as a deterrent. But that's not much, since its a very superior tale otherwise.Andrew Knight's Adapted Screenplay is emotionally charged & takes a look back at the tragedy that happened in the battle of Gallipoli. Crowe's Direction is very well-done. He has handled the film with conviction & that's commendable by all measures. Cinematography is lavishly done. Editing is sharp, more-so towards the second-hour. Art & Costume Design are perfect. War-Scenes are graphically shot. David Hirschfelder's Score is good.Performance-Wise: Crowe commands the screen with a solid central performance. He enacts a complex part with amazing understanding. Its a winning performance by the master actor, yet again! Olga Kurylenko is wonderfully restrained. Yılmaz Erdoğan is alright.

A poor TV movie at best,Having read some of the recent reviews praising this film I thought I was onto a sure fire winner when walking into the movie theatre.Seeing as this was Crowe's directorial debut I was hoping that he was going to pull it off and provide a real cinematic belter.However I was sorely mistaken..The first 10 minutes didn't disappoint and I'm including the credits. But as Mr Crowe travels to Istanbul on his little adventure it drastically takes a turn for the worse. The acting from then on in from all parties is woeful and the supposed love story is completely pathetic and unbelievable.I'm not going to go on and on but someone seriously needs to tell Crowe that being in every scene of the film doesn't really help people to warm to him.But please people save your hard earned cash and waiting till it comes out on telly.

"A solid directing debut from Russell Crowe, and an effective antiwar statement","Often I'm skeptical when a prominent actor tries to transition into the director's chair, but luckily Russell Crowe does a decent job in his first motion picture behind the camera (as well as in front of).What I liked about 'The Water Diviner' was its mostly successful balancing of both the perspectives of the citizens of Australia and Turkey. As opposed to merely painting the Turks as the anonymous ""enemies-in-the- distance"" that appear frequently in many Gallipoli-centered war films, the Turks are portrayed predominantly in a positive light, with Crowe's character forming many close relationships with them. Many vital Turkish cities and landmarks such as the Gallipoli peninsula and Istanbul are utilised well in order to both highlight and give respect to Turkish culture and history.Russell Crowe plays basically the same role he does in every other film he's in, a stoic, blokish man's man who relentlessly searches for his sons who went missing in combat in this foreign land. The film is also helped by an impressive supporting cast, with Cem Yilmaz being a highlight as a compassionate Turkish sergeant. However, you can't help but be surprised at certain points why certain Australian and international actors were cast as Turkish characters, though these roles were still executed quite well.Like many war/postwar/anti-war films, 'The Water Diviner' can occasionally dip into some overly sentimental, melodramatic territory, however these are overshadowed by some truly hard-hitting, harrowing scenes. One in particular, during the last act of the film, really packs a punch (you'll know it when you see it).Now nearly at the 100-year anniversary of the failed Gallipoli campaign, it seems fitting that 'The Water Diviner' contains a much more retrospective, melancholy depiction of the conflict. There aren't really any winners in war. On either side fathers and sons disappear off the face of the earth, leaving gaping holes in the lives of those that remain. With careful, considerate storytelling and directing, 'The Water Diviner' is able to convey this message.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Film Review: The Water Diviner,"In June of 2015 one of my favourite HBO shows of all time will make its debut on the silver screen. While Entourage may not be the greatest television show ever created, it sure does succeed in allowing its main demographic to fantasize about fame and fortune. It is true that the Entourage film has very little to almost zero relevance to The Water Diviner, but its subject matter (a very eager Hollywood star, in this case, the fictional Vincent Chase making his directorial film debut) does. Now you may be asking, what is the point here?What many won't know is that The Water Diviner marks the directorial debut of famed New Zealand born, Australian loving actor Russell Crowe. Sharing in his immense adoration for the land down under with fellow famed Hollywood actors Hugh Jackman and Hugo Weaving, Crowe directs this film centred around the Gallipoli Campaign, also known as The Battle of Gallipoli, and Australian farmer/water diviner, Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe).Years after the initial battles, Joshua and his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie) have done the best they can grieving with the reality of losing all three sons to the war. Essentially, The Water Diviner becomes a great cinematic tale about hope, survival, and determination, soaked with an immense amount of inexperience by its very trying but lacking director.Hope is a big theme within the film, and going back to the analogy mentioned in the first paragraph, the same could be said for many upcoming actors turned directors. While the trend of acting-to-directing is nothing new (Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, and of course, Ben Affleck), it is something that many actors try, gaining knowledge and great aspiration from their confident directing leaders, but fail miserably. Just ask Ryan Gosling and his 2014 Cannes flop Lost River.While The Water Diviner may be considered anything but a flop, the film does seem quite familiar very quickly. Taking cues from very popular and hailed contemporary war dramas in the last few decades, Saving Private Ryan and Flags of Our Fathers most notably, Crowe's directorial debut is a beautifully shot, but poorly guided historical picture.High handed melodrama, non-conspicuous zooms during very pivotal narrative scenes and monologues, as well as the oh-so painful use of unnecessary slow-motion, The Water Diviner is ever so slightly taken away from a compelling story of patriarch and redemption. Against all odds Joshua makes his way to Gallipoli, a land labelled as a stretch of Earth saturated with ""blood and ghosts"", where he is greeted by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), a military official who is tasked with helping Lt./Col Cyril Hughes (Jai Courtney in his second straight historical war epic following Unbroken) adequately bury fellow countrymen. While most of the film is driven by blind and unexplainable intuition, Joshua finds two of his sons, Henry and Edward Connor (Ben O'Toole and James Fraser), who remain together. Not knowing the whereabouts of the remains of his eldest Arthur (Ryan Corr), who had been tasked with guarding his two youngest brothers, Joshua never loses faith in the chance of seeing his first-born.While much of the film narrative is driven by prospect, Major Hasan informs Joshua that he remembers his son in a chance encounter and gives him hope that he may still be alive, leading Joshua to Istanbul where divinely, he finds himself in the care of a recently widowed Ayshe's (Olga Kurylenko) hotel. It is there that Joshua slowly sheds his Commonwealth patriotism of Queen and Country beginning to open his eyes to the customs and lifestyle of the Turkish people, including that of Ayshe and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgides).While romance never plays a strong influence on the film between Joshua and Ayshe, some of the best scenes are undoubtedly between Crowe and Kurylenko as well as Crowe and Turkish acting gem Erdogan. Many won't be astonished by Crowe's direction but he can rest assured, after the atrocities that were Noah, Winter's Tale and Broken City, that his acting is in top form in The Water Diviner, proving scene and scene again that his talents as an actor are far from finished. Luckily, the casting and acting of the film is undoubtedly its strong point, including former Bond girl Kurylenko who is almost unrecognizable as Ayshe.Russell Crowe may not be the next Orson Welles, Rob Reiner, or Kenneth Branagh – men whose directorial debuts and first feature films Citizen Kane, This is Spinal Tap! and Henry V respectfully established their talents behind the lens as well as in front of the camera – but there is definitely hope for a very talented and ambitious man who is willing to shed light to some very obscure historical events. Crowe will surely be given a slew of elements in the fight to get his film seen and appreciated. While I won't be one to truly drown The Water Diviner, here's hoping that Crowe's first feature will have greater hope of keeping afloat than sinking quickly, despite its lack of any real cinematic divine intervention.",7.0,Anonymous,History
New Release from FEAR of GOD Films,"The new film from Russell Crowe's new production company ""FEAR of GOD Films"" is remarkable. Truly the BEST film Russell has ever made.In The Water Diviner the characters were real, with a depth of emotion and feeling not seen in many films today. The choice of actors was spot on and I could not find fault with any of their acting, from the young boy to the love interest. The parts of the Turkish sergeant and commander were played by men who gave their all and it showed.The roles played by the English and Australian officers was also commendable and their portrayed anxiety for the man wanting to visit Gallipoli, was done with a true sense of feeling and concern, even though this concern was misguided in this case.The locations for Gallipoli (near Pt. Lincoln)and other areas (Burra) were well chosen and apart from some scenes, were filmed at the South Australian Film Corporation on Greenhill Road, Adelaide, South Australia.The story is wonderful and who ever wrote the script is to be commended.If Russell and others in the cast are not recommended for the Academy and other Awards I will be most surprised. The film should be nominated for best film 2014 and best director. Many of the cast should be nominated for Awards in each of the relative roles.A Great film, a very commendable film, Russell's best and to date Greatest film. My belief is, that ""The Water Diviner"" is in the category of being one of the very best films made since WW2.A great film, made and directed by an Aussie too! The love interest between the farmer and the girl was tender and Russell's treatment of this was brilliant, whereby even a look between a man and a woman conveys all that is needed.4.5 stars out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,History

Following his wife's suicide, he travels to Turkey to begin the search for his missing boys, and finds lodgings with the beautiful Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her son. He also finds himself scouring the fields with Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), the army commander who lead the army Connor's sons were fighting against, who's now trying to build diplomatic relations with the opposing forces. As he draws nearer to the truth, Connor must brace himself for a devastating reality.In the year the world observed the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, Russell Crowe picked a timely moment to unveil his directing debut to the world. He'd spoken about it for many years, and there'd been hints it would be coming here and there, but finally this drama set against the backdrop of the war is finally here. Rather than set it on the battlefront, Crowe has chosen to highlight the raw human drama that unfolded behind the scenes and was comparatively ignored, that of all the soldiers in the various regiments, companies and divisions who were unaccounted for and in many cases, never found.It seems to incorporate many tones as it goes along, mixing together a lot of haunting atmosphere, light humour, raw human drama and historical narrative pretty much all at the same time. While all of this is very affecting, a lot of the time the pace is a little too slow and has a bit too much of a Sunday afternoon vibe to it, creating a bit of a dull feel. A shame, since the themes it's exploring couldn't be any less toned down, including heartbreak, forgiveness, redemption and hope. It beats with the heart of a lion, but flows with the blood of a sheep, a film with solid themes but the execution of a telly drama, but which still manages to stir and engage.If you only get one chance to make a first impression, Crowe has demonstrated a generally firm and adept approach to film-making, with a stirring story and tonnes of ambition, but one which maybe just needs to move with a little more fire and flare in it's heart. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History
Mr Crowe - just wow,"Every now and the Russell Crowe likes to remind us all about what a powerhouse of an actor he is. This film has left me feeling like I have been beaten with a cricket bat, but in a good way.In this stunning directorial debut Crowe tells a story of fatherly love and devotion. Add a dusting of the horror and futility of war and let the emotions simmer.The acting is of a very high standard throughout, the direction and writing is great, the cinema and production is perfect.9.9 out of 10.why the missing 0.1? It might improve on a second viewing.Many thanks Mr Crowe",9.0,Anonymous,History
'Because he is the only father who came looking.',"As written by writers Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios and directed by Russell Crowe, THE WATER DIVINER is one of the most profoundly moving stories about the devotion between fathers and sons that has been placed before us on the screen. The photography in both Australia and Turkey is astonishingly beautiful and the interplay between past actions and current circumstances that create this story is sensitively interwoven, emphasizing the passionate need for re-connection even after war has torn a family asunder.Based on real events, the story opens in Australia in 1915 where we find Connor (Russell Crowe) divining for water and successfully discovering a hard won well. He returns to his farmhouse and we meet his wife Natalia (Isabel Lucas) whose mind has been damaged by the loss of her three sons away at war – the Battle of Gallipoli. She pleads with Connor to find them, not admitting to herself that they are war casualties – a state of mind that eventually leads to her suicide. After burying his wife he promises her he will find their sons and he travels to Turkey to gain permission to get to Gallipoli, believing that his water divining powers will help him find their graves. He meets with obstruction form the English and Australian military (Jai Courtney) still mopping up after the horrendous defeat by the Turks and gains help from a compassionate Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmas Erdogan) and his assistant Sgt Jemal (Cem Yilmaz). Meanwhile while awaiting papers to gain permission to go to Gallipoli Connor stays in a 'hotel' in Istanbul where he meets hotel manager Ayshe (a brilliant Olga Kurylenko) and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgiades). The relationship is strained because Connor represents the 'enemy' (Australian) but there is a chemistry that sparks and a tenderness and mutual help results. Connor ultimately is allowed to go to Gallipoli ('Hope's a necessity where I come from'), finds the bones of two of his sons, but the third is missing – he was taken prisoner – and it is this remaining live son that binds the story of the love between the Connor, his deceased sons and his deceased wife together in an ending that will gnaw at the emotions long after the film is over.The cast is uniformly excellent with Russell Crowe in an especially brilliant and subtle performance. THIS is an Oscar worthy film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 15",10.0,Anonymous,History
Uneven and shoddily directed,"For a man who has worked with some of the most accomplished and respected directors in the industry, from Ridley Scott, Ron Howard, Peter Weir and Michael Mann just to name a few, you'd expect Australia's (although it should really be New Zealand's) very own Russell Crowe to have learnt a trick or two in the art of directing but sadly his debut The Water Diviner suffers from some uninspired and at times amateurish direction that halts any of its power it may have otherwise possessed.A huge hit here in Australia, with box office receipts of well over 10 million dollars, a huge feat here for a locally made film and with success at local industry awards, it's abundantly clear that the Water Diviner struck a chord with both audiences and critics alike. From this it's suffice to say that Crowe was obviously onto something in setting his story in the oft spoken about and patriotic battle of Gallipoli and the aftermath it would have on the Australian populace. In saying this though the film which is inspired by real events, fails to emotionally engage or resonate on anything more than a lower level, a judgement that can be based around Crowe's uninvolving directional style and a film style that suffers badly from countless and often unwarranted tonal shifts.It really feels like the Water Diviner had suffered an identity crisis in its development stages and no one was sure enough on how to fix it. We get a family drama, a love story, a few war set pieces, some politics and some cricket bat's being put to good use, but what we don't get is any of these becoming engaging in their own right. Just as one element of the film may be set to take hold of you and keep you glued to the screen, it disappears, only to be taken over by some awkward loving glances, a beat down with a Christian cross or a chase through a crowded Turkey set street. With so many things going on it's hard to feel much towards any of the characters and while Crowe is his usual gruff self, there's not a lot to write home about in regards to the acting states, although a moustached Jai Courtney, an underused Ryan Corr and Yilmaz Erdogan do have moments that suggest there was more to do with all their respective characters.The Water Diviner tries hard to be many things, a targeting at a mass market appeal that worked wonders for its financial success at local cinemaplexes and will no doubt work wonders for its shelf life in rental stores and in local's homes, fans that love nothing more than some patriotic tinged locally produced goodies. For fans of well-made cinema however, this is a hugely disappointing and only barely acceptable debut by Crowe, that suggests he has a long way to go before he reaches the heights of the directors his worked for.2 games of train cricket out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,History
Good Movie But Not A Best One,"WWI movies are still not enough, especially if we compare with WWII movies. So I like this kind of movies and I think they must do more. The movie is good and have a different view. But also its not a very good, some scenes are really simple. However I couldn't understand Greeks and some others angry. First I am a historian so I don't need a history lesson. I can say only in all history, everybody killed someone. Turks killed Greeks, Greeks killed Turks, Germans killed many, British also or French. And always some movies show others like monsters. I believe that Turks or Persians are really mostly unfortunate about that. There are many movies which mentioned badly about them. So please calm down. Nobody are monsters, we are all humans and all of us have some mistakes. So a historical discussion is really meaningless in that point. Also I want to remind if you look national geographic genom project you can see many Turks carry some Greek or Armenian blood and also many Greeks or Armenians carry Turkish blood. So please don't be ignorant. And last some reviews are really very ignorant because first you must learn Turks are not Araps,they have only same religion. But their culture, history and also language are totally different. It is a good say; Don't try to occupy a country which you don't know where it is or Don't try to write something which you don't know anything....",7.0,Anonymous,History
Divining for movie awards,"So Conner is your typical clichéd Australian farmer working land where it might not rain for two years and has the ability to do water divining (find underground water by using a couple of sticks held in his hand).He has lost his sons to the Gallipoli campaign in WWI and his wife, in her grief, kills herself. So now he heads to Turkey to find the remains of his 3 sons.On one hand this movie is brilliant. It shows the the war from the side of the Turks, and how they suffered during and after WWI. They also show the Turks are honourable people worthy of respect.This movie also explores why we need to remember and honour our war dead.But it also is a little silly where our hero seems to have mystical diving powers, not just for finding water but finding his children. This takes away any real motivation for the character and instead the Conner ""just knows"". This aspect cheapens the story and the movie.However still a good movie that is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wel Come Mr. Russell Crowe!!!,"'The Water Diviner' is a directional debut film for Oscar Winner 'Russell Crowe' and he has announced his arrival with a big bang to his fans. The movie is set in the backdrop of Battle of Gallipoli (1915) in Turkey. Mr. Conor (Russell Crowe) is a farmer who lives lives in Australia with his 3 sons and wife. His sons are taken away as forceful volunteers in Britain war against Ottoman Empire at Gallipoli where they are killed in action eventually. His wife could not take it and commits suicide leaving Conor in pain and distress. Conor takes a wow at her burial that he will find her sons and bury them alongside her grave. Conor travels to Turkey to find his 3 missing sons. While staying at a hotel in Istanbul, he meets Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), the hotel manager and tries to find a way to Gallipoli. Somehow he manages to reach Gallipoli despite resistance from British Visa office and military officials. There, he finds his two sons but the third is still missing. He has a strong belief that his 3rd son is alive but the military officials at Gallipoli forces him to return to Australia which is not acceptable for him. While at Gallipoli, Conor meets a Turkish officer Maj Hassan(Yilmaz Erdogan)who promises to help him. Ultimately, Conor, flees from Turkey by deceiving British officials and finds his son in Anatolia (which is under attack by Greeks). The movie is well- paced, well edited and doesn't drag. The lead actors were all perfectly cast and they delivered as per expectations. At the start of the 100th anniversary year of the Gallipoli landings, this is a story that was well worth telling. Russell Crowe has done a Great job at his debut film. Few dialogs are worth mentioning like Hope's a necessity where I come from and he is the only father who came looking after his sons.The war scenes conveyed some of the horror without being gratuitous in the violence or gore. A great movie from a great actor!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""You can find water but you can't find your own boys?""","""The Water Diviner"" (2014 release from Australia; 111 min.) brings the story of Joshua Conner (played by Russell Crowe) and his family. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""inspired by true events"". We are transported to December 20, 1915 to the Battle of Gallipoli, where the Turks are overpowering the ANZACs. We then switch to ""North Western Victoria"", where we see Conor looking for, and finding water (and building a well). At dinner time, Connor's wife is resentful. ""You can find water, but you can't find your own kids?"", she hisses. Shortly thereafter, she drowns in the lake near the house. After the burial, Connor decides to go to Turkey to look for his three sons, whom he urged to fight ""for flag and country"" and who are presumed dead. At this point we're just 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, it is remarkable that it has taken this long, but this movie marks the directing debut of Russell Crowe. Why he hasn't taken this up sooner, I don't know, but better late than never. Second, the movie makes an almost critical error by not giving a brief historical background note at the beginning of the movie. Do you know who the ANZACs are, and why Australian soldiers ended up fighting in Turkey 100 years ago? I sure didn't. I picked up bits and pieces along the way as the movie unfolded but still, I felt that was an oversight that could've been easily avoided. Third, the script does a good job in providing flashbacks of the Gallipoli battle which eventually reveal what happened to the Connor boys. At the same time, while the movie is ""inspired"" by true events, let's be honest here and just say it outright: this is a historical fictional drama, and quite entertaining, but fictional nevertheless. Last but not least, Crowe leads a cast of mostly unknowns (for me anyway). The little boy who leads Connor to finding a hotel in Istanbul is just delightful, and the little boy's mother is stunningly beautiful. Bottom line: this movie makes for an enjoyable and entertaining historical drama (it won Best Picture at the Australian version of the Oscars this year).The movie finally opened this weekend on two screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay, and it seemed that the audience was really enjoying the movie quite a bit. This isn't going to see the box office on fire here in the US, but it's a nicely made movie, showing a softer side of Russell Crowe as well as demonstrating that the man certainly knows hoe to direct a movie. If you are into historical dramas, you cannot go wrong with this. Definitely worth check out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Crowe doesn't have the mastery yet to perfect things,"'The Water Diviner' is Russell Crowe's directorial debut. It's an ambitious film to start your career with. There is a lot going on in this movie and even a veteran director might struggle with some of the complexities of it all. There are battle scenes, a love story, a family story and an underlying message all being intertwined throughout. For a first timer I thought Crowe did a good job, but for the standard we have come to expect in modern cinema it isn't quite up to scratch.A lot of the battle scenes just don't come across as convincing and thus lose a lot of their effect. When a master like Steven Spielberg directs a battle scene you buy into it, you feel like you're there, and the movie is much better off for it. The love story is probably the best directed element of the film. I wish it wasn't there, as it really does drag the movie down and make it quite dull for a period of time, but regardless it is well developed and executed. The main story of finding his sons (based on a true story) could have been done better. The reason for doing so, a promise to his wife, wasn't milked enough and really needed to be put forward powerfully so that the audience was always rooting for him in a big way. As it was, the motivation to support him in his mission waned a little at times.Altogether it's a watchable film, mostly due to Crowe's always fine acting. Anyone interested in war films will be certain to at least get something out of it. It's not Oscar worthy stuff but it is a decent effort for a first try by Crowe. I look forward to seeing if he embarks on directorial duties again and if so just how ambitious he is next time.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A touching movie with immense potential,"This war movie was released on 100 year commemoration of War of Gallipoli. Strange enough this is not a just a war movie, because it has such a strong human story that stretches beyond any particular war. An Australian father searching for traces of his three lost sons on the battle field of Gallipoli after 4 years past the war. Would not an actor jump on his feet hearing this theme of a movie! And there was incredibly talented Russell Crowe as an actor as well as director making the most out of the great story line. It just got better every minutes; setting against the backdrop of early twentieth century's Istanbul, as beautiful and standing tall as it is today with its markets, blue mosque and what not. Who could show a better and almost clairvoyant depiction of traditional Turkish muddy coffee? A good movie is never called good for one actor. Yilmaz Erdogan was equally brilliant in his subtle expression, so was Olga Kurylenko, what a transition from Oblivion star! All actors including young Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) are never weak links. The closing song ""Love was my alibi"" is so melodious. All in all I would recommend everyone to watch this beautiful masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Thoroughly Disappointing Gallipoli Tale,"The intention behind Russell Crowe's film, based on true events, is a noble one; to remind contemporary viewers of the horrors of the Gallipoli campaign, the hundredth anniversary of which takes place this year (2015), and to show how ANZAC and Turkish troops set aside their differences and embarked on a collective effort to disinter the hundreds of thousands of corpses buried on the battlefield and give them a decent burial and/or tomb.Sadly there is a world of difference between intention and execution. Filmed in Turkey and Australia, THE WATER DIVINER manages to include every possible stereotype about Turkey into its 111-minute running time, save, perhaps the hubba-bubba pipe (or nargile) and an aerial shot of the Bosphorus. There is the sound of the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer (which Connor (Russell Crowe)); the hordes of veiled women peopling the teeming streets; the violent uncle Omer (Steve Bastoni) wanting to take revenge on Conor in the belief his honor has been impugned; and the ritual scene of relative-beating, in which Omer assaults Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko). If Crowe had wanted to make a film advertising the country as repressive and arcane in its rituals, he couldn't have done a better job.Other stereotypes have along history going all the way back to BODYLINE (1984). In that never-to-be-forgotten miniseries about the English cricket tour to Australia in 1932-3, Hugo Weaving played English player Douglas Jardine with lip-curling relish; here was a villain to savor. The same applies to Jai Courtney's Lt. Col. Cyril Hughes in THE WATER DIVINER; sans any redeeming features, he regards both ANZAC and Turkish troops with contempt. His British accent wavers somewhat, but we are left in no doubt that Crowe blames British imperialists for the mess created both during and after the Gallipoli campaign had ended. While his interpretation is certainly valid, the use of stereotyping seems superfluous.Nor do the Turkish actors escape a certain amount of stereotyping. Yilmaz Erdogan does what he can with the role of Major Hasan, as he emphasizes the fact that the Turkish army was only trying to defend its territory against foreign colonizers. However Cem Yilmaz's Jemal veers towards caricature, his use of grimaces alternating with smiles proving once again that Yilmaz is a far better stand-up comedian than film actor.The film's shortcomings do not end there. Although ostensibly taking place in Anatolian Turkey, much of the action has obviously been filmed in Australia. The daylight scenes - especially those taking place in summer - lack the intense looks of a Turkish summer, while the landscape is far too fertile to stand in for the Anatolian plains. Crowe also includes scenes of breathtaking incongruity; at one point he is shown enjoying a candlelight dinner with Ayshe, something that would have been hardly likely to happen in late Ottoman times, especially with a married woman and a protective family dedicated to restricting her freedom of movement.THE WATER DIVINER looks and feels like a foreigner's view of Turkish history, one that lacks sensitivity to other cultures. Anyone looking for an effective representation of the Gallipoli campaign and its consequences in English would be better advised to watch Peter Weir's GALLIPOLI (1981), or more recently, ALL THE KING'S MEN (1999).",5.0,Anonymous,History

Heartfelt story of fatherhood,"The Water Diviner is a heartfelt story of a father searching for his sons who went missing during war. Joshua Connor (Russel Crowe) is an Australian farmer whom the title addresses being the one able to find water beneath any land surface. His three sons are speculated dead in the 1915's Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey but no bodies are located or facts are known. Connor decides to go to Turkey to find out fate of his sons as a promise to his wife who commits suicide losing all hope. After reaching Turkey he finds a nice lodge run by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) in Constatinople. They slowly start getting to close to each and the romantic side of the story is quite predictable. Apart from that we have a Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) who for reasons unknown tries to help Connor with his search.I felt the film was strong with the drama and emotions, also the depiction of intense war scenes made it more engaging. There were many back and forth shifts and flashbacks which may put you off but the screenplay doesn't lose its flow. Some of the flashbacks of Joshua with his sons were heartwarming. The camera work with the Turkish locale and music was simply beautiful! I just wished they didn't dwell that much into romance aspect or they could have made it more authentic. Anyways Olga Kurylenko looked nice. Narrative was straightforward and a few scenes here and there felt clichéd. Despite all that, Russel Crowe gives a master performance carrying the weight of the film on his shoulders all the way with his quest for his sons. The times when the script focused on that it was really good, the rest not so much. Overall, it was a good enough film based on war-drama and fatherhood.RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,History
A father with a hope to find his missing sons.,"A fictional narration with the backdrop of the World War I. Precisely the story begins after the end of the war, about a father who goes after look for his sons who were last seen on the battlefield of Gallipoli, Turkey. The rest is the mix of drama, war, romance, flashbacks, and whether his mission is accomplished or not is the climax that decide.Frankly, I was a little disappointed. The story was not based on the real, but looked like one. The point is it was a wonderful and inspiring theme, but direction was not convincing along with bad editing. If you look at who's that, it was a direction debut for Russell Crowe, who played the main character in the film as well. Some of the historical facts were wrong, especially showing the Greeks in the bad light was the negativity of the film. Visually the films do not give the impression of the pre 1920s where the story set in. Instead, it looks more of the late 40s or the early 50s.Since it was set after the war, most of the characters were in a guilt attitude. Can't say whole film was predictable, but the scenes were. The performances were the only things that tried to lift the movie, as well as the music and screenplay in some parts. This, book based movie should have been directed by any top director, not for the freshers to try-out their skills in direction field, because of the powerful stuffs like anti-war elements. One time watchable, but disappointment is ahead of you if you expect greatness from it. Anyway, it was Australia's top gross movie last year in Australia.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Sleeper awakens,"Never heard of this show, and that's sad. With all the junk out there it's too bad this one missed our theaters.Exceptionally well done and accurate in telling the tragic story of Gallipoli from both the ANZAC (Australia) and Turkish points of view. In that WWI was a totally absurd war with no reason (most wars do have reasons; WW2 was essential etc.) made the entire premise of a father from Australia leaving his farm to find his three sons whose bodies were never found after the campaign a profound premise.The film mixed in flashbacks to the campaign to win the heights overlooking the Bosphorous Straights between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Churchill was blamed for the naval debacle that occurred (and he bore some culpability but little) but the entire idea of invading Turkey, especially at Gallipoli was insanity that soldiers like the Cooper boys paid for.The acting is excellent with a host of different characters representing effectively the Australians, British, Turkish, and Greeks. The levels of conflict arising from a nation going from being the once proud Ottoman Empire, to a carved up mess with Islamic State overtones, to a Turkish nationalists movement that led to a secular state that Turkey is today, to the Greek/Turkish war continuation (that actually began long before the siege at Troy with Achilles) is all presented carefully in this film.Crowe is humorless in this film, but there's not much to smile about as the Gladiator faces his worst fears head on with dignity and determination.Well done, Russell Crowe. This is a hidden jewel of a movie. The R rating is a soft R at best and is only there for a few bits of war time violence that isn't much different that television violence. No profanity, no sex or nudity or drugs. Recommended for teenagers to understand the realities and tragedies of history and war.

Epic First Effort,"Water Diviner, Russ's directorial debut, is a demanding, complex story about an Australian man whose journey is fraught with the consequences of a hard life and the trials of letting his sons go to war. Diviner's production values are top notch. The cinematography excellent. The largely consistent script could so have used a couple more tightening drafts. Having said that, it's possible Russ changed things on set, on instinct and on the fly, as writer Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios's work on this story is obvious and usually impeccable.I've nothing against romantic elements creeping into a story, but Russ allows too many emotional colors and sentimental textures to bleed together in this story telling. Dramatic peaks suffer from that sentimentality, which shows Russ's inexperience as a director. Some of the dialogue, meant to be innocent or naive, also indulges sentimentality. It's interesting to see these chinks and flaws appear in Russ's judgment in his story telling. Those criticisms aren't to detract from his major achievement in producing an entertaining and watchable romantic war drama. To give Russell his full due, directing and acting in a film epic of this nature was no mean feat. Russ and his crew have done an excellent job. It's just that where Russ's judgement is flawed, so is the film. Had Director Russ allowed himself a mentoring assistant, someone with proved chops in the Directorial story telling department, I have no doubt I would be standing and applauding The Water Diviner. I salvage that kudos and bestow it upon the awesome performance of Yilmaz Erdogan. He gave this story the touch of gravitas and authenticity it needed to be satisfying.I look forward to supporting Russ's next effort. That he's known to us as Russ, it goes without saying how much he's loved like a brother in Australia and New Zealand for his achievements already.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An emotional journey to find the lost sons of a man who has lost everything,"This directorial debut from Russell Crowe is an emotional tale of a fathers journey to find his lost sons that is full of love and hope. This movie, for a first time director was mostly well directed and very beautifully shot. The cinematography really engages you in the film both during and away from the action, it adds to the quality and overall enjoyment of the film. Russell Crowe's performance was as always just amazing, he really put a lot of emotion into his character and that showed through his endless efforts to not give up on a promise he made to his wife. The longer this movie goes on the more you realise that this is not only about a search for his sons but a movie showing the determination of an individual who has lost everything and will not lose any more. Apart from Russell the other performances were also well done, mainly by both Olga Kurylenko and Jai Courtney but they never really stood out too much.One issue i had is that the first third of the film during Russell's introduction to Istanbul, spent too much time focusing on establishing the supporting characters, i wanted it to move on to the main plot rather than spending more time there. Some of his other visits to this location felt more meaningful and interesting, if only they had shortened his initial visit. Also there were some co- incidences that i didn't really buy into during his time in Gallipoli and a potential romance that was pretty predictable right from the beginning, small issues, nothing major. Russell Crowe's directorial debut, despite some minor flaws, was an emotional and at times intense film that hopefully gets recognised outside of Australia. - 7.6P.S - If you don't tear up towards the end of the film, well then you have no soul.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Crowe's First Film behind the camera, hope it's not the last...","No doubt that Russel is a great actor who made many remarkable roles and worked with great directors, in this movie it seems that Crowe learned some things from these directors, there are some positives in Crowe's first film but there are also little mistakes. First the script is good, has many sensational parts enforced with great acting abilities from Russel and his fellas. Soundtrack and music are good and represent the emotions and feeling of the characters, with a mix from eastern and Australian music. The song of the movie at ending title was so good and it was a completion of the musician effort at this movie. The greatest thing for me is cinematography, Andrew Lesnie (The cinematographer of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) showed us a great and marvelous pictures,the colors,the shades and angles of camera. What I didn't like was FLASHBACKS, It was many and the same at every time, Crowe showed it as a memory of the leading character but he wasn't there to have a memory of these events. So how he knew it. The worst thing was visual effects of some fire and explosions, it was poorly done and it looks like as in a cheap Turkish drama(The worst visual effects I've ever seen is in Turkish drama). It was a good start by Russel Crowe behind the camera but he has to avoid the mistakes - which were few- next time, and i really hope for a next time. My final rate is 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Two Historical Dramas Worth Your Time,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING for quality productions and thought provoking themes that carry into post-screening over-coffee conversation and well beyond, two new historical dramas topped by A-list stars are just what the doctor ordered.""Woman in Gold,"" starring Helen Mirren as a woman determined to reclaim a lost art work stolen by the Nazis, and ""The Water Diviner,"" directed by Russell Crowe and starring him as a father determined to find his three presumed-dead sons following the Battle of the Gallipoli, are those rare films that handle scope and intimacy with equal adeptness.In 'Gold,"" a British-American production directed by Simon Curtis from a script by Alexi Kaye Campbell, Mirren plays the late Maria Altmann, an aging Jewish refugee living in Los Angeles who enlists a young lawyer named Randy Schoenberg (played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds in a bit of Jimmy Stewart channeling) to fight the government of Austria to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic portrait of her aunt, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,"" which was stolen by the Nazis from her relatives just before World War II. Altmann took her fight all the way to the United State Supreme Court _ and Austria.To say much more would spoil the film, but suffice it to say that the writing, directing and acting are so skillfully rendered that the story is both moving and educational without being maudlin or dull.Mirren is completely believable as Altmann, and Reynolds opens eyes as young attorney Schoenberg. The supporting cast _ Katie Holmes (as Schoenberg's wife), Daniel Bruhl, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern (as a judge!!) and Jonathan Pryce _ show their respect for the piece and its subject matter through wonderfully understated performances.The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the Berlin International Film Festival.""The Water Diviner,"" or ""Last Hope,"" an historical fictional drama, is an Australian production directed by and starring Crowe with a screenplay written by Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight from a book of the same name by Andrew Anastasios and Dr. Meaghan Wilson- Anastasios.The film begins in 1919, just after World War I (1914-1918), as Joshua Connor (Crowe), an Australian farmer and water diviner, has discovered ground water on his land and is digging a well. His three sons have left to serve with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) at the Battle of Gallipoli five years before and are thought to have been killed in battle.When Joshua's devastated wife, Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie), commits suicide because of the loss, he vows to bring back their bodies and bury them next to hers.Joshua travels to Turkey and stays in an Istanbul hotel operated by Ayshe (a hauntingly beautiful reed of a woman, Olga Kurylenko), who has been widowed by the war, and grows close to her little son, Orhan (a charming Dylan Georgiades), whose unusual way of bringing Joshua to his mother's hotel is alone worth the price of admission. Ayshe at first is suspicious of Joshua, but after learning about his reasons for being in Turkey, that changes, much to the chagrin of her brother-in-law, who had coveted her as his own.Ayshe suggests that Joshua bribe a fisherman so he can go to Gallipoli by boat. He does, and upon arriving there, meets all sorts of resistance, especially from the ANZACs, who are taking part in a mass burial detail from which civilians are banned. There he meets Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan in a riveting turn), a Turkish officer who is helping on the mission. The major becomes a friend and ally of Joshua's and we're off to the races.""The Water Diviner"" at times boasts the kind of lush scope used by director David Lean in films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago,"" and like those films, manages to flesh out both character and story with unusual depth and intimacy.Both ""Woman in Gold"" and ""The Water Diviner"" give the audience a run for their money, providing a sense of emotional attachment while offering historical perspective and enlightenment.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating movie although the sound got on my nerves.,"""Are there any more records about my son? We are Ottomans, not Germans. ""It looks like ""Russell Crowe movie week"" here. After ""Fathers and daughters"" I had to check his directorial debut. And to be honest, I thought this postwar dramatic film was much better than the sugarcoated ""Fathers and daughters"". In both films the father figure plays an important role. In ""The Water Diviner"" however, he's a grieving father whose sons were killed in the Battle of Gallipoli, which took place in Turkey during the 1st World War. A bloody battle, on a piece of land as large as a handkerchief, between Turkish troops and a corps with Australian and New Zealand troops (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps or ANZAC). It's beyond dispute that wars provide disgusting scenes which once again demonstrate the absurdity of such tragedies. The agony of the three brothers on the battlefield was the most unpleasant and difficult part of the entire movie. It was so terrible to watch. I really had enough of it at a given time. The relevance was clear to me. It wasn't clear to me why it had to take so miserable long.Apart from a few hiccups, I thought it was a fairly successful film. Looking at the technical side of the movie, you could say it was excellent. Perhaps it seemed to be a dramatized travel documentary at times. But the palette of colored fabrics and the interior view of Turkish mosques assured some visually stunning images. The phenomenal scene in Australia, where Connor (Russell Crowe) protects his three sons against an impressive sandstorm, was a breathtaking moment. And this impressive imagery is used throughout this reasonable epic adventure story. It resembled a bit ""The Physician"". In this case it's someone from down-under who gazes at the traditions, the folklore and the beauty of Istanbul. Naturally this leads to intercultural conflicts with a few yelling Turks, who defend their values, and a fleeing Aussie.The historical side was also fascinating. I don't know that much about the 1st World War. And certainly not about what happened in the Arab part of the world. The Turkish community wasn't happy about welcoming Australian tourists afterwards. This was also presented realistic. At the same time the cooperation between the ANZAC and Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) also didn't proceed so smoothly and the intense hatred again resurfaced. And just let me mention the scene at the beginning with the local priest who has a huge problem with the burial of Connor's wife, because she committed suicide apparently. A strong moment. A proof that the short-slightness and insensitivity remained intact through the years.Altogether it's a wonderful debut from Crowe. And this combined with a not so bad leading role. The role Erdogan played was also noteworthy. A calm Turkish Major who forgets his grievances and offers his help to identify the tens of thousands of victims without hesitation. And additionally also aid Connor with his search for his lost sons. Dylan Georgiades plays the role of son Orhan enthusiastically. While the ultra-cool Olga Kurylenko gives shape to the widow Ayshe. An exotic beauty who's aloof at first, but as the film progresses her icy attitude slowly melts.And now it's time for the disappointing elements of this yet fascinating film. The ""station novel""-like love story that was incorporated, wasn't really necessary according to me. The fact that it's about two individuals from two different cultures and each bearing a loss due to the war, sounds plausible. But they should have left it at that. The paranormal talent Connor supposedly possessed, was grossly exaggerated. Sure, maybe he can find water in the bone-dry Australian desert by using a twig. I'm willing to believe that. But him standing in the middle of a battlefield in a sort of trance surrounded by the rotting remains of thousands of victims and miraculously finding the location where his sons are lying, was a bit ridiculous. And then the Indiana Jones imitation in the end, clashed a bit with the rest of the film. But the biggest annoyance was the sound. The dramatic music and sound effects were terribly noisy. By contrast, the conversations were at whisper level. I had a sore thumb afterwards because I had to use continuously the volume button. But ultimately it was still a magnificent movie.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good war movie,"Crowe did a good job telling the story from the only point of view that matters to Gallipoli - the experience of ANZACS and Turks during and after Gallipoli. ANZACS and Turks were both unwilling participants in a brutal war started by imperialist and nationalistic goals. They paid dearly and in return got nothing, except each other's well deserved respect.England, France, Italy, Greece, Russia, Armenians, Arabs, Slavs, and even the US (covertly) were allied against the Turks for the sole purpose of carving the Ottoman Empire among themselves. It was a war purely for imperialist and nationalist profiteering, with complete and utter disregard for humanity, justice, or the lives of Turks, or even their own people for that matter. But for Turks, it was much, much worse.Is it so unfathomable that the Turks suffered more than anyone in WW1? But unsurprisingly, and callously, a lot of Turk haters are here using movie reviews to spread their propaganda. These are the people who ultimately lost to the Turks - Greeks and Armenians. They cannot move on like ANZACS and forgive the Turks - as Turks have forgiven them. They are still fighting their war. They are giving a movie low reviews based solely on their agenda, nothing more. It is sad.It is as if nobody else in the world can have their own version of events that they were personally party to, or that Russell Crowe risked his career by telling his version that he based on his own research and the experience of his own nation. How dare he not consult the Armenians or Greeks! One thing for sure, this movie would never be made in Hollywood. If you look at some Armenian or Greek reviews, it's as if their version of events is some indisputable holy gospel, and Russell Crowe was bribed to tell lies by evil Turks - and that he put his career and reputation on the line just to serve a political purpose or greed. As if. If you see the movie, you will see his intentions are noble, not based on politics or greed.Australians and Turks fought for nothing in that battle. They gave their lives for greed and treachery of others (Armenians and Greeks), and got nothing in return except pain and suffering. 100 years later, Crowe tells us, it was not for naught, but for a beautiful friendship forged on the battlefield, by blood, of a common pain, of consecration of new nations of their own, and of proving to the world what both were and are made of. Courage to fight, and to forgive.Thank you Mr. Crowe for having the courage to stand up to bullies and liars (Greeks and Armenians) even if it was not your intention. Now, if Hollywood would start being more objective, we could have less hatred and more understanding in the world.It is a great movie. And I give this movie a 10 because of the honor and courage it took in telling the story that nobody else dares to tell, because of fear from reprisals from the Armenian and Greek lobbies. Thanks again Mr. Crowe, you truly are a gladiator!""Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives... You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us where they lie side by side now here in this country of ours... you, the mothers, who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace.

Simple Pretty Good Story,"An Australian Farmer, and Water Diviner, Joshua Connor (Crowe), sets out for Turkey to find and return the bodies of his 3-sons who died at Gallipoli so they can be buried in concentrated ground.A Water Diviner can locate water, various ores and even graves. In the beginning we see Connor find water using 2-metal wands (clothes hangers will suffice) and we expect to see more magic along these lines. He gets to Gallipoli and does discover the graves of two of his sons, but not the third son. Hence the magic stops.In his mind's eye Connor sees, the battle scenes which claimed his sons. These scenes are quite graphic and we see something we never see in movies. We see soldiers wounded and cannot move, but we hear their groans because their pain is so great. Just listening to these groans is upsetting. This showed us a side of War that we don't normally see or even consider. Until now.There is a love interest for Connor when he sets his base of operations in a Turkish bed and breakfast hotel and here we see Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) who runs the business. Ayshe considers this Australian as the enemy and wants nothing to do with him. Of course, movie magic takes over and she warms to him. This relationship doesn't go anywhere and why it's included in the movie is not clear. A candle lighted dinner later on between these two was a bit much for something that didn't go anywhere. See?Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) becomes Connor's guide and friend as he leads Connor to a location where Connor's third son may be alive. Along the way we see a battle with Greeks attacking the train Turkish soldiers - including Connor - are on. Keep in mind this is 1919 and the last year of the War to End all Wars. So the War is not yet over.Overall this is pretty good mostly because of the acting performances by the entire cast and the cinematography which is very good throughout. There are elements of this being an epic, but doesn't quite make it so. We needed more magic and it didn't happen, and maybe more CGI as we saw with a humongous sandstorm in the beginning and lastly the music didn't signal epic-like proportions.

Masterful bit of Film Making,"I suppose with Russell Crowe being Australian this must have been a labour of love and a privilege for him to tell the story of his fellow Australians and their sacrifice made all the more pertinent by the fact that it was the incompetence of Winston Churchill who caused this disaster at Gallipoli. Few Australians however realise that 'the British, French and Indian causalities were far greater than those of the Anzacs, and that the British bore the brunt of the fighting - and the losses.'The only thing and its a big un is they try and portray the Turks as somehow relatively blameless ""just defending their country"" which was certainly exaggerated in the film. Releasing this on the 24th of April (2014), the commemoration day for the Armenian Genocide (Lets not forget 1.5 million yes million people (CHRISTIANS) were murdered crucified raped and tortured by the Turks purely over religion in less time than the Nazis killed 6 million Jews - Any similarity between then and now (ISIS) is purely coincidental - Yeah right!) was madness - what were they thinking?Putting this aside it was a pure cinematic pleasure however; masterful photography, scenery and his best performance to date even if it goes easy on the Turks and their place in infamy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A war movie that is not about war(?).,"As a migrant to Australia of many years I still cannot fathom the Australian patriotism that surfaces when national citing of Gallipoli is mentioned; as many people know it was a defeat packaged in that over- credited brain of the first lord of the admiralty: Winston Churchill. We all know that his use of Australian troops, among others, in an ill- founded attack at Gallipoli which strategically may have been reasonable but tactilely virtually impossible given where the Allied landing occurred.With this monumentally futile battle as the background a father returns to the actual battlefield after the war to find the bodies of his three sons who never returned to Australia and their parents. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a film about war but has a minimum of scenes of the warfare elements. It is a film about the search, definitely, but it is also about what he finds in that country so far away with people that are far away from his own parochial patch of farmland on the desert's edge in NSW.I thought the film was about discovery; the discovery of his missing sons and likewise the discovery, not so much about himself but about a larger world with vastly different people who have their own unique approach to life on this rock. It is a movie of joining and of the realization that we are far closer than the war leaders would like us to understand.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Better Than Average WW1 Tale - The Water Diviner,"This film is not as good as some WW1 classics such as 1918, Gallipoli, or Paths of Glory, but it certainly places fourth on that short list. This is a very nice effort by Russell Crowe, with a lot of help from a talented supporting cast and a very interesting script. The one thing about this film I found interesting was the treatment of Turkey and the Turks in WW 1. No other Hollywood film has shown them in such a positive light. Lawrence of Arabia merely showed them in a stereotypical way (they were the BAD guys) and other films have depicted the Turks as just background for WW1 topical films. This is the first film that delves into WW from the Turkish standpoint. I did not buy the romantic aspect of the film, but that was a minor glitch. The primary story is overwhelming enough to overcome that small bump in the road.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Maybe Mr Crowe is just trying too hard for a big blockbuster, but as they say from small acorns and I fully expect that with his first film under the belt he will become much more adventurous. It isn't a bad start, just not great. I found myself more drawn to the Colin Firth character in The Railway Man.

Something Excellent To Crow (pun intended) About,"Extract from 'The story behind The Water Diviner'.
While conducting research on events at Gallipoli, archaeologist, writer and University of Melbourne Arts alumnus, Andrew Anastasios, discovered a line in a letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Hughes, a worker in the Imperial War Graves unit, who was recovering the dead after the war. The line in the letter, a footnote in a much more detailed account, simply said, ""One old chap managed to get here from Australia, looking for his son's grave.""
""Lt Col Hughes was trying to identify the bodies, and here was this father who just turned up from Australia, out of nowhere,"" recalls Andrew. ""It was a huge commitment and a serious undertaking to visit a country of which you have no knowledge.
""By that stage, the Ottoman Empire was being dismantled completely by the Allies, and so it was in disarray and the idea of just turning up in a country that is slowly being dismembered was really quite fascinating. I guess that line just jumped out at me.""
That is the basis for the film and everything in the movie was made up and embellished beyond the book; so there are no historical pieces to be nit picked about, as some have tried to do. There is a disgraceful background to this war and its pure animal carnage of massacre that occurred because of it but all that needs to be said of this as a film is that its a wonderful directorial debut by Mr Crowe (Russell). Yes there are lots of mistakes to it and a few cultural insults but, Mr Crowe is most definitely not known for.....well that's another tale :).It unwraps at a nice smooth pace that does not degenerate and things such as lighting and scenery are perfectly captured.

The film's strength lies in its evocative cinematography, capturing the haunting beauty of both the Australian Outback and the war-ravaged landscapes of Gallipoli. While the editing navigates seamlessly between past and present, a minor weakness surfaces in certain pacing moments. The musical score, a melodic companion to the emotional journey, enhances the film's heartfelt resonance. The Water Diviner, with its profound themes of reconciliation and the enduring human spirit, stands tall as a poignant tale that ripples through the heart, leaving an indelible mark on the shores of cinematic storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I want more Russell Crowe,"Russell Crowe bares his soul in this debut directing the feature The Water Diviner. Elegant, compassionate, multi-faceted, elevating, intimate, vigilant . . . these are some of the words that come to mind when reflecting on this work.I enjoyed the music very much; Russell wrote and produced the ending credits song. He tells a good story about how the song manifested at the 11th hour via Skype and several European countries.The acting was excellent, full of emotion that Russell captures with beautiful close-up shots. At the SAG Film Society Q&A Russell talked about how he took his actors through ""boot camp""; a rehearsal process that gave the actors the necessary time to imbue their performances with magic. I applaud him for his leadership, and respect for the art. The results are evident.It's not an easy feat to weave a balanced widely appealing multi-international story that highlights the complexities of the human spirit. Crowe made it look like he's been directing for decades.Crowe states he did not want to star in his film initially. The producers weren't going for that. Obvi. Thank God, he was perfection.His smile as he spoke about capturing the eyes in the close up frames of budding super star Jai Courtney who played Lt. Col. Cyril Hughes was a clear indicator that Crowe is on the right path.Jai's presence sang a captivating solo from the big screen and melted my heart!Okay, so I really loved this film - I am searching for a negative critique so I don't sound like a cheer leader.

a few flaws but otherwise a great emotionally engaging story,"This movie screened on free to air TV in Sydney last night- only a few months after it was released at the cinema, which must be a record. One of the backers was channel 7 so I guess that explains that. Anyway Its a great film despite a few flaws, mostly technical. I noticed a few camera flashes (is that what that's called?) early in the film- and the scene where Russell strikes water he has cotton wool in his left ear (not sure if that was intentional IE to protect the actor from infection or something the character would have done) the cotton wool isn't in his ear in the next scene) Anyway- very minor flaws. Like a lot of Australians- my grandfather was at Gallipoli so anything on this subject will always get a strong emotional response from me. The acting was excellent- Olga K once again showing what a great actor she is. The Turkish cast, including the boy were all excellent. And its good to see it shown in a mainstream film how things were for the Turkish people- after all they lost over 70,000 in that battle- it is an event of obvious great importance to the Turkish people. Yes- there have been better films about Gallipoli but this takes it to a very personal level about a father grieving for his sons- I assume nothing is known about the rest of the real story that the film is based on - we will never know what happened to the father who went there to find his sons body, so apart from that element, I assume the rest of the story is a fiction- and an excellent one it is too.

Why using colored screen?,"The movie is an art, or it should be... One-dimensional, one-sided, one-directional film like this one has too much color, too much noise. The story about Great War, guided by the fairytale carpet and the storm of emotions, can not have another burden. Simply, it is too heavy. Many other art directors left their work in black&white mode, in piece with the victims, because in the end they are all victims, victims of an unimaginable horror called war. This one can also be blue&white, like our brain perceives the water... Like you should not ""invade a country if you don't know where it is"", you should not make a movie about the people, nations, its cultures, languages and history connections, if you do not know them. The victims are everywhere, why measuring the ground under their feet, why choosing the side, why choosing the language, why measuring them at all? The life is one that matters. All war movies should be remainders of it. You can confront the ideas, the principles, but not the nations (war already done it). This film licks the wound to someone, and for the others makes it deeper. That war, unfortunately is not over yet. The chance of ending it, is in the heart and mind of the people who outlived, who survived. The hope and the quest of one man in this film defies the war and its meaninglessness. But, I will repeat it: every movie needs to be art, not a tool in someone's hands.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Strikes a universal chord,"""Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes"" - Wilfred Owen, Anthem for Doomed YouthIn 1915, Australian and New Zealand (Anzac) soldiers formed part of the expedition that set out to capture the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey in order to open the Dardanelles to the allies with the ultimate objective of capturing Constantinople (Istanbul), the capital of the Ottoman Empire, an ally of Germany. It was a campaign in which over 50,000 allied troops were killed including 8,000 Australians. Directed by Russell Crowe from a screenplay by Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios, The Water Diviner, an Australian-Turkish co-production, was released in conjunction with the 100-year anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli which is celebrated in Australia as an event of national pride even though it led to a military defeat.The Water Diviner focuses on Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe, ""Noah""), an Australian farmer who uses his skills as a dowser or water diviner to attempt to find his three sons who were reported killed at Gallipoli. Without any historical or background information to guide us, the film thrusts us directly in the battlefield where Turkish troops wait in the trenches, ready to advance to positions that have been abandoned by Anzac soldiers. It then shifts to a time before the war when Joshua, his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie, ""Beneath Hill 60"") and three sons, Art (Ryan Corr, ""Wolf Creek 2""), Edward (James Fraser, ""Sleeping Beauty""), and Henry (Ben O'Toole) are enjoying life at Connor's farm in Victoria. It is before the boys, encouraged by their father, leave to join the Australian army out of a sense of patriotic duty.Fast forward four years to 1919 where we watch as Joshua successfully finds a water well on his arid land using his skill as a dowser, a centuries old practice that uses a divining rod or other device to point towards an area where there is water or other objects. It is a skill that requires psychic ability as well as a strong knowledge of topography. Sadly, we soon learn that Connor and his wife are mourning the loss of their three boys, missing and presumed dead in the war. In a poignant scene, Joshua, on his wife's urging, agrees to read the book Arabian Nights to the boys, but all we see is Joshua speaking to three empty beds.After a further tragedy strikes the family, a heartbroken Connor leaves Australia for Turkey where he hopes to use his intuitive powers to locate his sons' bodies at Gallipoli and bring them home for a consecrated burial. When he arrives in Istanbul, he is met by a precocious ten-year-old boy, Orhan, wonderfully performed by young Melbourne actor, Dylan Georgiades. The boy dutifully steals his luggage and leads Joshua to a hotel where he is reluctantly given lodgings by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko, ""To the Wonder""), a widowed Turkish innkeeper who still views Australians as the enemy.When Ayshe sees that her son relates to Joshua better than he does his overbearing uncle Omer (Steve Bastoni, ""Drift""), she warms up to him and good chemistry begins to develop. Though told by the occupying British officers that he is not allowed to visit the battlefield, Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan, ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"") and Sergeant Cemal (Cem Yilmaz, ""Coming Soon""), leaders of the Turkish army helping the ANZAC ""Grave Unit"" find missing soldiers, military officers, smooth the way for Joshua to go to the restricted zone. It is there that he makes a surprising and life-changing discovery.Bolstered by the vivid cinematography of Andrew Lesnie (Oscar winner for his work in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" and a frequent collaborator with Peter Jackson), The Water Diviner is an honest and heartfelt effort that shows in human terms the futility of war and the devastating effects it has on families. It is marked by outstanding performances by Yilmaz Erdogan, Olga Kurylenko, and especially by Russell Crowe, who, in an understated way, carries the burden of every father who has lost children in war.Though the film develops complex characters such as Major Hasan, it also contains some unfortunate stereotypes such as the Turks as noble and heroic, the British as pompous and arrogant, and the Greeks as merciless, marauding bandits. In spite of its tendency towards oversimplification, however, the heart of the film is the simple and personal story of a father's love for his sons. It is a story that is not afraid to show a connection between former enemies, a connection that strikes a universal chord in those who long for peace.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The boys had followed in the path of many Australian young men of that era and had gone off to fight on the shores of Gallipoli in World War I. To the best of his knowledge, his three sons were dead, Connor had promised his wife is to bury them in the consecrated soil of Australia. Conner goes to Turkey to search for his boys and comes in contact with Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko), who manages the hotel that he will stay in throughout his search. Ayshe and her son, Orhan (Dylan Georgiades) help Conner in understanding the nuances and beauty of this exceptionally foreign culture. Many challenges confront him as he works through the bureaucracy of the British military, the Turkish culture and the emotions surrounding the loss of his sons. Throughout his experience, he begins to see that his loss is measured against all of the tragedies of war, those that occurred to other Australians and especially to the Turkish people. Through a series of events surrounding his search, he comes in contact with the leader of the Turkish forces, Major Hasan or better known as the Assassin (Yilmaz Erdogan). There relationship is adversarial at first, but they soon become friends on this journey of finding the souls buried in the ground of the battleground. In the end, they help each other in finding what they seek in the wasteland of Gallipoli and in their own hearts.Being Russell Crowe's first directorial effort, there was an obvious wisdom of staying close to his homeland and telling a story that is close to the heart of Australians. It is a film that depicts the tragedies of war, but at the heart of the story is a man's love for his family and his desire to find them. This is a universal tale that transcends cultural heritage. Anyone who sees this film can connect with the characters, regardless of the awareness of the historical components involved. The story is based on a novel that that relates to actual events following the war. Crowe does an admirable job of directing the storyline and delving into the heart of the human condition. As an actor, he manages to get draw us into the story and get great performances out of his cast. These are the best works for many the film, including Olga Kurylenko, Ryan Corr (Not Suitable for Children) and Jai Courtney (Divergent, Jack Reacher), but Crowe's performance was the one to take into consideration. The storyline contains a quest and in it he seems to find himself. He utilises the beautiful canvas of the Australian and Turkish landscapes and manages to bring forth a wonderful artistic work of a father's love and forgiveness. Crowe travels through the story and throughout his search for his sons and he comes to realise that war has victims on many fronts. He should be commended for his maiden directorial venture, but needs to be recognised for finding the Russell Crowe that most came to love throughout his career in films like Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.The Water Diviner is a wartime film and there are gruesome battle scenes, but they are necessary for the sake of the story. These should not deter people from going to see this film. The over use of the Gallipoli tale can become wearisome at times, but it is merely the backdrop for a wonderful film. There are obvious challenges and stretches in believability throughout the film, but the overarching narrative of this man's love for his family will grab the hearts of all and make up for any weaknesses in the story. The deeper considerations of a man wrestling with loss and his anger with God helps to bring forth the authenticity of the cinematic experience. He does not come to terms with this battle in the film, but his unrelenting drive to find his sons has many Biblical underpinnings. One of the key themes of the Bible is the relentless pursuit that God the Father has for mankind. In studying this them in more detail helps to understand the hearts of mankind and a father's love for their family, regardless of the difficulty of the experiences of life. On its own, this is a beautiful story of a father searching for his sons, but the value of the film is found in the multiple layers of the story which brings forth a rich cinematic experience.Leaving the cinema... Call me sentimental, but I loved this film. It was not a perfect film, but Crowe managed to find himself in the making of this film. The man that grabbed our attention in Gladiator has come back and found himself in this endearing Australian tale. It may only grab the attention of Australians, but he manages to get the best out of all of cast involved and direct a fine film of a father's love and hope.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film?

Amazing work with a relatively low budget,I think Russell Crowe did a good job and found a catchy story that impresses the audience. The story is focused on two geographical locations which are Gallipoli and Aegean regions which were invaded by the foreign armies. Armenian genocide took place in some other regions of the then empire. Actually there were countless Armenian and Greek soldiers fighting in Gallipoli against the Allies.There are many movies telling the story of the genocide. The peoples of the middle east and Balkans are obsessed with their official history rhetoric. But they should at least understand that whether or not the losing side the Turks lost many people including millions of civilians. Death should not be deemed unfair when only the members of a specific ethnicity dies. The rulers are responsible of the losses of every fighting side. The pain is common and its time to repair the broken links.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Disgraceful,"Based on historical events. Translation, complete fabrication. People ignorant of history will believe this narrative as historical fact. These films that retell historical events, should be advertised as historical fiction, not ""based"" on historical events.No mention of Armenian genocide, (frankly astonishing)portrayal of Greeks as an invading force of barbarians.(Gallipoli = GALLI good POLI City)No mention of Turkish atrocities, in fact paints the turks as victims no less.This film is a poor attempt at rewriting history. Those that would swallow this version of history and accept it as factual are the the historically ignorant. A shameful enterprise , not much else to say. I mean you'd think they'd at least get the weather right and the correct regiments that fought. Nothing.",1.0,Anonymous,History
It was super,"Thanks Russell Crowee, Yilmaz & Cem and Olga.You definitely have to watch this story.I hardly recommended. Exciting and effective script, successful production and good acting. In World War I, ""The Gallipoli Campaign"", was an awful and notable failed offensive by the Allies, and took place on the Gallipoli peninsula for eight months from 25 April 1915. Gallipoli derives its name from the Greek word ""Καλλίπολις"" (Kallipolis), meaning ""Beautiful City"", and where the Anzac Legend began. ""Anzac Day"" every 25th of April, commemorates the date of that military landing at Gallipoli, and remains the most significant day for Australian and New Zealand commemoration of our military casualties and our veterans from all wars.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Offensive,"The Water Diviner is about a man who travels to eastern Thrace and Anatolia after the Battle of Gallipoli to try and find his three missing sons. The premise of an Australian wandering around western Anatolia in 1920-21 is itself incredulous. The story deals (in part) with the Anzac prisoners-of-war of the Ottoman Empire in World War One. The Water Diviner paints indigenous Anatolia Hellenes as barbaric invaders, at one point being labeled ""Satan's army"" by one character. Surviving Anzac prisoners recorded how Hellenes assisted their survival – and in some cases, their escape. The danger of this and other similar films that claim to be ""inspired by actual events"" is that because Crowe is a famous actor, his words are taken as being authoritative. His film may be treated as actual history. The Water Diviner is a film that will undoubtedly offend the descendants of numerous victims and should therefore be condemned. Russell Crowe's film is a distortion of history.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A divine classic,"An excellent World War 1 feature that details the quest of one man who lost his three sons in the ANZAC campaign of Gallipolli. Having the skill to find water in the bleak and bone dry Australian outback our protagonist Connor (Russell Crowe) goes to the Turkish peninsula where he believes he will find his lost sons.A very moving and emotional story that will capture the hearts of many. The couple sitting beside me were shed to tears as the narrative resolves. True some back stories are a little predictable and unrealistic but at least they get resolved to a logical standpoint. While watching I was trying to find any hint of bias but not once could I find any tendency towards the ANZACs in what is very unlikely in any flick especially in War films.Its been hard to put my love for this film in words and maybe I could do it only if I were making a video review but don't be dissuaded by a couple cheesy references or a few predictable scenes this film is truly a masterpiece and I loved it from the very first to the last second.Rating: A+ Comment: Be careful not to cry, be very careful not to cry on the person in front of you",9.0,Anonymous,History
we still suffer from World War I's effects,"Russell Crowe's directorial debut casts him as a man trying to find out what became of his son, who fought in the 1915 Battle of Gallipoli. You may have seen Peter Weir's 1981 movie about that battle and how the British Empire used the Australians as cannon fodder. Crowe's movie does sympathize with Turkey, showing how the Turks also suffered from the war, although it's drawn criticism for ignoring the Armenian Genocide (which the Ottomans perpetrated during the battle). Millions of lives on all sides senselessly lost.Here we are 100 years later and we still see the effects of World War I playing out. A notable result was that the Nazis rose to power due the crippling reparations imposed on an already demoralized Germany. Furthermore, the seeds for the Vietnam War got sown when the rabidly racist Woodrow Wilson refused to listen to a young Ho Chi Minh at the Versailles Negotiations. The current bloodshed in the Middle East resulted from the British and French carving up of the former Ottoman Empire. To crown everything, the Armenians acquired only a tiny piece of land while the Palestinians, Kurds and Yazidis didn't even get their own countries.Anyway, it's a really good movie. There are some intense scenes, as there should be. I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies I've ever seen,"Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Brilliant story, along with excellent direction and acting put it up with some of the greatest Hollywood classics. The film gives an accurate and engaging portrayal of post World War 1 turkey by placing emphasis on traditional Turkish clothes, music and lifestyle all of which is shown prominently in the film. It also has brilliant character development, thanks to the talented actors and screenplay writers who worked together to deliver rich emotional scenes. All these elements collectively, allow the reader to strongly empathize with the characters and their lives, resulting in a truly unforgettable and involving film watching experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Objective and outstanding!,"I think that The Water Diviner was great. I am a teenager who certainly did not want to spend her Saturday evening watching a movie about war, but at the end I really liked it.I loved the fact that it was mostly unbiased since not a lot of movies these years have that about them. The people of the Middle Eastern countries are always bad people and Muslim people are always terrorists is what is generally portrayed in movies today. But that was not the case in The Water Diviner. The Water Diviner displayed the idea that people of different countries, different places can unite. That a person shouldn't be defined by the country they're from.I think this was both an excellent and a very educational movie that had just the right amount of sentiment and action. I congratulate Russel Crowe and all the actors of The Water Diviner and hope you watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Well done Russell Crowe,"4 April 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Water Diviner. Directed by, and starring Russell Crowe, this is the story of an Australian farmer who makes a graveside promise to his wife that he will travel to Turkey and find their missing sons. Joining up together, all three boys fought side by side at the Battle of Gallipoli. History tells us after major battles like this, many fallen men on both sides are lost to the earth, nobody knows whose sons they may be and graves remain unnamed or even unmarked. Slow to start, this is not so much a tale of war, but the aftermath. It is a tale of of a man's desperation to find the truth, but his story is a basis for all the the stories to come out of the horrors of war. Russell Crowe did a good job with this, both in his acting and his directing. The film did not shy away from the distressing scenes brought about by the destruction of battle, but what we saw was essential to the story and set everything in place to direct our attention the the search made by a Father for his sons. Beautifully filmed with some very unusual camera angles from the outset, I felt immediately drawn into the scenes, whether the grand vistas of the Australian Outback or the crowded, smoky souks of Constantinople. A sobering tale, but a story that must be told.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Love My Alibi,"Wonderful movie, beautiful soundtrack. If anyone thinks war is glorious better think twice. No sanitized drone shots in trench warfare, just gruesome hand to hand combat. Nice to see the two sides of the conflict rather than a black/white scenario with a demonized enemy. The filming was gorgeous, especially the scenes in Istanbul and at Gallipoli. In many ways it reminded me of Breaker Morant and the rigidity of imperial organizations vs. the bravery and vulnerability of the individuals on which they are based. The movie also introduced us to the various historical conflicts and trends that were playing out at the time. The battle scenes were gripping, you really felt that you were there.

"History's ""restoration""","This film is a hideous Turkish (Kemalian) propaganda. Greek soldiers, pictured like a bunch of thieves, dressed like Cretans in ww2, appear to be invaders! All refugees are Turkish people instead! The slaughter of Armenians and Greeks of Pontos by the Turks, is well known to the universe! History is been demolished. In what way all that historical confusion has anything to do with young Australians's sacrifice in Kallipoli? Film's quality, on the other hand, is way bellow average. There is no consistency in the script, scenery has been set as in contemporary Turkish mini series, with aesthetics like Mexican TV series. Characters' development lack essence and complexity. Schematic plot, holds the viewers interest loose. Some interesting battle scenes and that's all. So same that Erdogan, a class A Turkish actor, known by Ceylan's films, is in the set. Russel Crow, should do himself a favor and stay out of directing (and cheap policy) from now on. See 1982's, Peter Wier's film with Mel Gibson, instead.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Remarkable story, remarkably told","David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has always stuck in my mind (and heart) as being a very 'atmospheric' film. An artistically appealing ambiance, tonally transcendental. I had not expected in my lifetime to see another film that had quite the same effect upon me. I was wrong and most pleasantly surprised.'The Water Diviner' is a truly incredible story and most beautifully, atmospherically, lyrically told under the deft direction of Russell Crowe. There is, for the most part, an understatement of drama which entices the viewer to look deeper and find more hidden meanings in the nuanced script and performances. Script which is both intelligent and exceptionally moving without a drop of superfluous sentimentality to detract from the thrust of the story. It is a very, very 'human' story. Never difficult to relate to the various characters at some level, to the extent that I could almost feel my mind and heart were being read. This is really a film of 'audience participation' on so many levels. The acting performances are, without question,superb. Crowe solicited from the actors subtle and almost understated performances that added mystery and momentum to the telling. Olga Kurylenko, Yilmaz Erdogan and Dylan Georgliades are the more pronounced of these.And, of course, Crowe is superb. Yet all the key players have their own beautiful rhythm of realism to add to the telling.Within the story hide many very human truths and realities. Beware of making any judgement about any character you see portrayed, for the film has a wonderful gift of clarifying, simply and directly, why a character behaves the way they do. It is a marvelous film for any student of psychology!I give nothing away, except to say - watch the eyes of the actors and actresses.Their immersion in their respective rolls is clear to see in their eyes.Bravo, Mr. Crowe. A superb film. Truly a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Movie from my Favorite Actor and now Director!,"Overall I was very pleased. A little background about my top 5 Hollywood actors: Robin Williams has been my favorite actor or all time.

Half-truth = half-lie,"The Greek soldiers were shown as cruel inhumane barbarians and presents the Turks as innocent victims: According to the 21 century norms.This movie fails to mention the 500+ years of cruelty, torture, genocide, rape, robbery and humiliation that was the rule for the old Ottoman Empire. No word about the 1,500,000 Armenians, 400,000 Bulgarians, Who-Knows-How-Many Kurds, killed in 1915 alone. The 1915 Genocides were performed under Kemal Ataturk and the new ""civilized"" Turks. The half-human bashibozouks of the Ottoman Empire were much worse.Released on the day of Armenian Genocide it only adds insult to the injury to the memory of the victims of 500+ years of slavery: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Arabs, Slavs, Persians, Kurds etc.This is a pure political brainwash for the West EU, in attempt white-wash history. One wonders how much BAKSHISH Russel Crow was paid to produce such disgusting love story.In modern ""civilized"" Turkey it is forbidden to criticize the government. This Movie is an attempt to distort the truth about the Ottoman Sultanate before the World. Sorry: we shall never forget the past.

"Great first work of a director, original plot","I had low expectations of this movie: it's a director's first work, yet he has to shoot and direct on foreign country with some unknown actors, the story is delicate at some multinational level... recipe for almost a disaster. But I was wrong.This is not yet another war movie. The story is original, about little known face of WW1 covering two sides, one of which gained nothing and the other lost almost everything in the end. Kurylenko and Bastoni are surprisingly good at Turkish roles (this is the first time I've heard discernible Turkish from foreigners in a movie), spot-on Turkish mimics and gestures. Crowe's and the Turkish soldiers' transition from foe to friends was natural, convincing. Carefully sprinkled humor easing out the delicacy of the subject. Not a historical documentary, which is also mentioned in the movie: ""No records. we're Ottoman, not German"", the scene showing piles of documents being burnt (1920s' Middle East was apparently quite chaotic and gloomy).Obviously there was a pressure to ""keep it under 2 hours"", and given the fact this is an Australian movie (hence 10 min long father-meets-son scene), some other parts progressed very rapidly, making it look like bad editing. I'll be looking forward to an extended cut, with at least 15-20 min more, if there's any. Overall I'm impressed, very good work deserving a solid 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
A poetic vision,"I remember the impact Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"" had on the audience in the suburban cinema where I first saw it in 1981. That battle is so much a part of the Australian national conscience that the affect of the scenes at Gallipoli was electric. Something we had only read about or heard about was brought to life before our eyes.Now Russell Crowe has made a film that is a companion to that brilliant film except this one is about the impact Gallipoli had on the families the soldiers left behind - on both sides.Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) journeys to Turkey to search for the bodies of his three sons presumed killed during the attack on Lone Pine. Although meeting resistance from the British and Australian authorities, he is helped by Turks who were in the opposing trenches during the war.The big surprise is that ""The Water Diviner"" reveals Russell Crowe as a filmmaker with a poetic vision. He has learnt his craft well during his journey through film. Directing a movie as well as acting in it is a big call, but the effort doesn't show, and he has an instinct for big scenes as well as intimate ones. Although ""The Water Diviner"" heads a bit too suddenly into action-adventure territory about two-thirds of the way through, the film is beautifully made and has something to say about loss and the universality of suffering in war.Crowe intersperses his story with scenes of the Connor boys during the fighting at Gallipoli - rather than historically accurate, they are more impressions of the fighting. However, the film starts with something we haven't seen before when the Turks attack to discover empty trenches after the British and Anzacs have evacuated the peninsular. Another unusual aspect of the film is the depiction of the situation in Turkey after the war with the British occupation force and the war with the Greeks.I would never complain about Olga Kurylenko being in a movie, but her role and that of her son seems a little grafted onto the story, thankfully her relationship with Joshua is handled with restraint and even subtlety at the end.""The Water Diviner"" has the same lyrical quality, sharply observed realism, and feeling for time and place that made Peter Weir's ""Gallipoli"" so unique - it's a classy piece of filmmaking that touches a nerve.",8.0,Anonymous,History

When it hit me that I had seen this already, I had pleasant enough thoughts of it, but really only remembered a few things about it.

It's well-acted and there are a couple cute/funny things that happen, but it's mostly drawn out and not much interesting going on.",5.0,Anonymous,History
well written well played,"Crowe, making his debut as a director, clearly learned much at the elbow of Ridley Scott, on ""Gladiator."" There, similarly, Maximus was impelled, and made threatening, by the purity of his motive—to avenge the murder of his wife and child. There are touches of Spielberg, too, as Connor learns that one of his sons may have survived; as a result, the latter stages of the new film turn into ""Saving Private Connor,"" as the father, like the hero of a parable, traverses the land in search of his lost sheep. He is aided by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), who commanded Turkish forces at Lone Pine, where the Connor boys were killed, and who himself has many dead to lament; the timbre of the movie owes much to Erdogan, an actor of gravity and charm, whom audiences here will have seen in ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"" (2011). He and Crowe make a strong, unexcitable team, each as wry as the other, and Hasan doesn't even look surprised when Connor saves his life, in mid-fight, with judicious whacks of a cricket bat.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Revisiting Gallipoli,"There's a lot to like about this movie. It has grand themes: Love, Loss, War and Peace. The locations are vivid, the pace is good, the performances un-showy and believable. The farmer's quest for his lost sons is interrupted with short but powerful flashbacks to the gruesome horrors of the battle. The quest has a predictable outcome and introduces a clumsy suspense element into the human story. You also kind of know how how the charming if slightly awkward love-story will end, although, in fact, the climax of this particular story is perfectly handled.This is a touching, almost noble picture, well put together by Mr Crowe in his directorial debut. But somehow there's a vital element missing: it doesn't feel tragic enough. The epic themes have been diluted to make THE WATER DIVINER a crowd-pleasing pot-boiler.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very good movie despite the historical errors,"I just finished watching this first Russell Crowe directed film and i loved the style of the movie! Returning themes, the cinematography and a good score all supported this overall great movie. I read a lot of the reviews on this page and was shocked by the reactions of historical incorrectness. Yes, I agree, this movie isn't historically correct, but why make such a point of it? Movies like Inglorious Basterds and Braveheart are just as incorrect, but unlike this one, received a lot better by the critics. At the start of the movie it is said that it is based on real life events. It doesn't state that it is a documentary or a historical movie. It is the story of a man desperate to find his missing sons and I think Russell's done an outstanding job. Can't wait to see more of his work!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not without it's flaws, but very enjoyable movie","Greetings from Lithuania.""The Water Diviner"" (2014) is a guilty pleasure. Uneven, yet very enjoyable movie almost till the end. First half of this movie was superb, surprisingly highly involving, very skilfully made and very intriguingly written. At the end it kinda lost it's road with ending somehow easily and bit on the ""adventurous mode"". That said, ""The Water Diviner"" is very good directorial debut by a great Russell Crowe. The man also stars in a lead role and goes on a journey at the end of WW1 to find his three missing sons in a Galipoli war, known as one of the bloodiest battles in a 20 century. There isn't much of war battles in this movie, although there are some, and they are done well here and serves more to story as well as shows the gritty war side.Overall, ""The Water Diviner"" is a good movie. It's has very involving, intriguing, sad and very well told story, although this story loses a bit at the end. The thing i didn't like was Olga Kurylenko - she's is very pretty but i think she is overrated, i don't have anything against her but it's hard to take it seriously to see model Olga Kurylenko always with a perfect makeup in Turkey during WW1, it's just odd casting. Isabel Lucas had a very small but surprisingly good role. Russell Crowe was OK / good but nothing special.

An impressive film weakened by supernatural elements,"""The Water Diviner"" is impressive. Defining the film is more of a challenge than describing it. It's part bromance, part road trip and part epic historical drama with a dramatically hollow throughline that, in the finest Hollywood tradition, degenerates into a Western/chase film with the Everyman protagonist transforming into a two-fisted gun-toting action hero.The cinematography is stunning. The locations, sets and costumes are fantastic. The acting is superb. Even minor roles are detailed and convincing.The plot is a bit of a mess. The larger, background world-view plot is a Byzantine tale of political and military conflicts, bureaucratic intransigence and cultural conflicts following an epic battle that helped define the national identities of both Turkey and Australia. That part is brilliant, fascinating, and seemingly historically accurate and authentic.The smaller chick-flick personal plot is an incoherent jumble patched together with a series of improbable occurrences and coincidences, both favorable and unfavorable, and a bit of mysticism. Russell Crowe plays a hardscrabble outback Australian farmer who survives by virtue of uncanny success at dowsing for subterranean water.Dowsing or divining is a discredited pseudoscience and modern audiences are likely to consider Crowe's character a bit of a crackpot who's clearly been working under the blazing sun far too long. While most of the movie seems highly authentic, its treatment of dowsing tests the limits of the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. I'm no geologist, but I would expect water tables to be relatively large things measured in acres or hectares, not something like buried pirate treasure where X marks the spot and if dig anywhere else you're doomed to failure. There are doubtlessly places where the water is closer to the surface, but those places are more like the dome of a sports arena than the apex of the Washington Monument. If you miss the high point, you may need to dig down a couple of more meters, but you'll still hit water.Not only does the movie take dowsing very seriously, but this talent morphs into a supernatural ability to visualize past events and distant scenes. Another character also displays powers of prognostication. But the movie isn't about these supernatural abilities or developing them or convincing others that the visions are real. They simply sap the dramatic potential of the plot. In fairness, Crowe's Connor admits that he's dug a lot of empty holes searching for water, but the talent never fails him during the movie.Connor is up against insurmountable odds. Three armed forces, two government bureaucracies, a resistance group and a jealous suitor are determined to prevent him from reaching a dangerous place where finding what he wants is nearly impossible. Connor reaches the place basically by sneaking in the back way. Once he gets there, his adversaries decide they may as well help him. The dangers never materialize. He uses a bit of magic to find what he wants, but then abandons his original goal. There is a sort of moral about hard work, determination and perseverance, but it is undermined by the supernatural abilities and an improbable coincidence that causes another character to assist at unexpected times.The water images are nice, but the divination angle detracts from the drama in a manner that isn't at all credible.The film is definitely worth watching for the background story, strong performances and cinematography. The human story may be relevant to people with supernatural abilities, but less so for the rest of us.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Russell Crowe made a really good movie.,"I liked it a lot.I like it when Russell Crowe is on top of his game. He went through a few years were he was an out of shape, bloated, movie star, phoning it in for a paycheck but in his directorial debut he was looking fit and putting his acting chops to work as a father whose boys were killed in war and he goes to Turkey to retrieve the bodies.Crowe did a fine job as both the director and the star.

Great Actor but fake movie,"Russell Crowe is a great actor, nobody can tell otherwise. However, my personal opinion is that he should not have agreed to perform in this film. This movie is nothing other than historical revisionism sponsored by Turkey. The turks (Osman Empire) had massacred millions of its own citizens, mainly Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians at the end of 19th and the beginning of 20th century...genocide. Making victims from turks is completely inaccurate in this film. Whoever watches this film, please, please, please, consider it just like a scenario, just a fake but ""interesting-like"" story and not a true flow of history.

Beautiful movie,"It's a very very good movie. It has a beautiful message for all the people hurt by the wars and difficulties of life. It's a movie about losing your hope in everything and then finding it again and fighting for it. All the actors played their characters really well and beautifully, especially Crowe and Olga. What surprised me was that i was hoping for a different story, and ended up with a softly and emotional movie really well made. The locations are also other awesome good point in this movie. The music is another great thing in the movie that goes along with the story and the scenes.I myself highly recommend this movie for all the audiences. I gave it a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very effective juxtaposition of emotions in a visually captivating piece of very good story-telling,"Perhaps it is not a huge achievement to make a good film out of spectacular locations, one of the most notorious battles in history (and the First World War in general), and the histories of Australia and post-WWI Turkey, but - hey - half the battle in the film industry is finding the kernel of a new good story for a movie and actually going on to make something out of it. Notwithstanding the issues of flawed detail that experts rightly take note of, this is a gritty film that looks and feels right, offers an appropriate range of emotions and settings (both domestic and a million miles from domestic), and acknowledges the truth that Turkey in 1919 was an extremely ""fascinating"" place to be. The opportunity to contrast the existence of a small-time farmer from the Outback with the life and culture of a huge city straddling two continents that had half a million inhabitants by AD600 is not lost. There is also a refreshing honesty as regards the balancing of enmity and reconciliation in the wake of a battle that cost the lives of seven times as many defending Turks as attacking Australians and New Zealanders. If there is a flaw here, it is the renewed attempt to portray the Brits (with one noble and notable exception) as starchy, out of touch sticklers quite distinct from the matey and down-to-earth Aussies. This is the kind of thing we have seen far, far too often before, and it is well past its sell-by date. With this proviso, this (British) reviewer was impressed and moved by the beauty, authenticity and simple power of this well-done and mostly well-acted piece of work. Yilmaz Erdogan as the senior Turkish officer and would-be pioneer of Turkish nationalism is the undoubted star of the piece, but Crowe, Kurylenko, Courtney and Yilmaz all give us our money's worth, as does the entirely convincing boy-actor Dylan Georgiades.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Awful movie - Historically wrong,"Awful movie - Historically wrong! The movie is totally historically incorrect. Specially when I saw the Greeks at the end pictured like half drunk Pirates of the Caribbean... The Turks denying almost a full century the genocide of Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians, they will love the movie as historically correct. Some actors acted like wooden puppets, and the movie did not give any clue why the little boy and his uncle could speak English in 1919. The second language of the Ottoman Empire was French in those days.Based on historical events. Translation, complete fabrication. People ignorant of history will believe this narrative as historical fact. These films that retell historical events, should be advertised as historical fiction, not ""based"" on historical events.No mention of Armenian genocide, (frankly astonishing)portrayal of Greeks as an invading force of barbarians.(Gallipoli = GALLI good POLI City)No mention of Turkish atrocities, in fact paints the turks as victims no less.This film is a poor attempt at rewriting history.

The movie is about a father's dedication and sacrifice to search for his children in a foreign & hostile country amidst the chaos of WWII.,"This movie is a must see for the people who loves to search for historical events through the eyes of others.

All I knew prior to this film was that the Dardanelles campaign in WW1 cost many Anzac lives and was regarded as a disaster. For Russell Crowe's family it was the loss of 3 sons, and all that the father could do was go to where they died to find them.The story builds to a gripping climax and the ending was completely unexpected.

That was an honest demonstration of the following point of view of the historic events that are being recounted in the movie.

A very commendable directorial debut,"Since Russell Crowe came to the attention of cinema-goers worldwide in ""L. A. Confidential"" (1997), he has starred in some 25 films and given a series of terrific performances - most notably in ""Gladiator"" - but this is the first film that he has directed. He also takes the lead role as Australian rancher Joshua Connor, who loses three sons in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, so this is clearly a very personal movie for Crowe as well as for Australians generally in the centenary year after the conflict (director Peter Weir covered the battle more directly in his 1981 work ""Gallipoli"").What makes Crowe's film interesting is that he treats sympathetically the viewpoint of the defending Ottoman Turks underlining their losses as well as those of the ANZAC troops (65,000 Turks dead and 46,000 Allies dead including 7,600 Australians), depicting the rise of Turkish nationalism and resistance against Greek invaders, and providing serious roles for Turkish actors. The battle scenes are well done and the cinematography is excellent.What weakens the work rather is a degree of sentimentality, partly around the powers of divining but more especially around the relationship between the Ozzie farmer and a local woman played by former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko. Also the one British character depicted has an appalling accent and is unfairly stereotypical. But overall this is a very commendable directorial debut by Crowe and augers well for his future career.",,Anonymous,History
Russ definitely shows he has what it takes as a director,"The Water Diviner is a historical drama about the Gallipoli campaign directed by and starring Russell Crowe. I really enjoyed it. It was very respectful to both the Turkish and ANZAC soldiers who fought in World War I.Russell Crowe plays Josh Connor, an Australian father of three boys who were sent off to fight at Gallipoli on the 25th of April 1915. A few months afterwards, the three brothers were reported as missing in action. One year after the war had ended, Josh travels to Turkey to locate the bodies of his sons and bring them back home to Australia for a proper burial to fulfil a promise he made to their mother.The film was very well shot, the sweeping cinematography really showcased the vast, sprawling Australian desert and the cramped, dank conditions of the trenches at the Gallipoli battlefield. Russell Crowe's character was very likable too, a larrikin Aussie with a deep heart who just wants closure on what happened to his sons. As far as directorial debuts go, Russ definitely shows he has what it takes.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
All the 1 stars leave out important detail,"1: A lot of the one star reviews point the Greeks as barbarians, and the were, but the Turks were the same. The Turks are shown as barbarians at the beginning scene.2-p1: Most reviews say the film is boring, the war scenes are fake, ECT. The movies is not pif paf shooting the whole time, there is dialogue, and a few action scenes throughout the film, more near the end.2-p2 War is like that, people don't get shot once and miraculously die with not pain, they bleed out. Unless a bomb hits right near a person, they will not be blown into pieces like most films portray, is they are more that 4 feet away, they will get cuts, some deep, but they will most likely just land, maybe break something, maybe land on a spike and bleed out. In one scene one of the three brothers is blown off his feet and gets stuck, is brothers run to him, and get mowed down by a machine gun, one brothers face is shot of and dies right there, the other brothers guts are hanging out as he bleeds out. Later, near the end of the film, they come back, and show the brother with his guts hanging out, asking his older brother to kill him, because of the pain, and sadly does kill him.3: Quite a lot of the 1-4 star reviews say this is a false story, made up. This is false, they were looking at ww1 diaries and letters, and in one of them they found a passage saying, ""One old chap managed to get here from Australia looking for his sons graves."" Thus, the water diviner was born. Yes, there are made up parts of the film, but they tried to make it as historically accurate as they could, with real people, and who knows, this could be fairly close to the real story of "" One old chap"" from Australia.3: This is a deep movie, it shows the reality of war, and what a father will do to find his children.

Anti-War Movie from an Australian Perspective,"In 1981 the film ""Gallipoli"" was released, and even then some reviewers complained of bias, but that film and this one are clearly anti-war films based on the tragic waste of lives that was the World War I battle of Gallipoli. Blessedly, this film concentrates not on battle but on the quest of one man to find his three sons after the war. His ""water diviner"" intuition tells him that one of them is still alive. A small portion of the film was made inside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, other scenes were shot in the city, but the majority was shot in Australia. The cinematography is impressive, Crowe's performance is believable, and the supporting cast is outstanding. To dismiss this film as historically distorted or biased is to miss the point. It is not history at all; it is a movie. To conclude that the film is worthless because it humanizes Turks is to justify the endless march to war that has been the history of the human existence and to ignore the fact that for warmongers today's enemies are tomorrow's allies.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The script is as ineptly written as the farcical faces Olga Kurylenko makes in her daft attempt at acting. It is incomprehensible to see so many positive reviews of this paint-by-the-numbers production. The complete issue of not addressing the true horrors of the happenings in the Turkish portion of the First World War will be missed by most who watch this production.

Not quiet a 10 but Rassell Crowe makes a good effort here.,"From the very moment I started watching this movie, I could see parts of Crowes former characters bleeding through his performance. A little bit gladiator (The Gladiator), a bit of the gun slinger (3:10 To Yuma), and even a bit of the wine maker (A Good Year). But by the end of the film you see him as the character he plays in this film. His portrayal of an Australian dad in search of his sons does come shining through by the end.As the films director, Crowe shows the influences of Ridley Scott's mentoring. And that is a good thing because Russell has played the lead character in several of Scotts movies, and they were all good films. So, I would have to give Crowe a big thumbs up on his direction. I do get the feeling a lot of this movie wound up on the floor of the editing room.As far as the story goes, it is well written but does get slow a few times and seems to wonder off track a few times.

Russell Crowe's love letter to the Turks,"THE WATER DIVINER is a family drama set in the years following Australia's disastrous foray into WW1, the Gallipoli campaign. Russell Crowe plays a grieving father whose three sons all vanished, presumed dead, in the battle. Spurred by an old battle diary he decides to travel to Turkey to find out the fate of his offspring for himself.This is a film that seems to have been devised as an ill-conceived history lesson for Australian viewers. Certainly as a movie it's not very interesting, lacking life and vision. There are a handful of flashback battle sequences in the film which play out all the clichés, and the present day material involving Crowe's character isn't very good. His romance with Olga Kurylenko (utterly out of her depth in her attempt to play a Turk), clumsily shoehorned into the story, is quite laughable.Elsewhere this veers between maudlin introspection and old-fashioned jingoism. What's most surprising is the blatant way this film whitewashes history, with each country being stereotyped to basic levels. The British are humourless, dour, and unfriendly; the Greeks are evil; the Aussies are gentle and heroic; the Turks are misunderstood. It's basic stuff indeed and portrays certain events in surprising ways given the complexity of the real-life historical situation. The climax is as predictable as they come, and although Crowe employs decent cinematography in his directorial debut, he just doesn't have the power to bring a lacklustre script to life.",4.0,Anonymous,History

The Father who went Looking,"Greetings again from the darkness. The lure of the director's chair is sometimes too much for A-list actors to avoid. We have watched Mel Gibson, Angelina Jolie and Kevin Costner have success behind the camera, and now we get Russell Crowe with a story tied to his roots in Australia. The film is scheduled to open in conjunction with the 100th Anniversary of ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), a day of national pride and remembrance.Mr. Crowe also stars as Connor, an Australian farmer with a gift for finding water sources in the outback – hence the title. Connor and his grieving wife lost all three of their sons in the Battle of Gallipoli, when Britain and Allies invaded Turkey, resulting in the death of more than 100,000. Four years after the battle, Connor is forced to try and fulfill the promise he made his wife  travel to Turkey, find the bodies of their sons, and bring them home for proper burial.Director Crowe, working with Oscar-winning cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), delivers a film that looks exceptional  both in its widescreen vastness and beauty, as well as its more intimate moments (though the heavy dose of amber glow is a bit too much early on). Flashbacks play a key role and the battle scenes are brutal and realistic, as is a monstrous sandstorm that engulfs the young sons in a moment designed to convince us that Connor was a protective father, and carries the guilt of allowing them to fight the war.Connor's trip into Turkey allows for the clash of cultures, as he is truly an unwelcome guest and a proverbial fish out of water. If not for the enterprising young boy that guides him through some tough spots, Mr. Connor's trip may have been short-lived. Instead he struggles through clashes with the British, the Greeks and especially Turkish Major Hasan (an excellent Yilmaz Erdogan).While the cultural and personality clashes are entertaining, the stereotypes and simplifications are somewhat tougher to accept. A romantic interlude with the hotel owner (Olga Kurylenko) is maybe the most out-of-place segment of a dramatic movie we have seen in awhile. Crowe and Kurylenko are both fine actors, but this makes little sense and distracts from Connor's mission. We can only assume the Producers demanded a little romance to offset the downbeat war segments and cash in on Crowe.Crowe shows promise as a director, and if the film has any box office success, we can hope he will have a bit more input into what stays and what goes in his next project.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Beautiful film that explores wisps of hope found through countless tragedies,"I try to watch as many movies as I can about war, so I added The Water Diviner to my watchlist as soon as it hit Netflix. A movie set after the action admittedly sounded like it risked being boring; however, this was anything but.Russell Crowe plays a stoic, even docile father whose soft-spoken manner doesn't get in the way of his ambition to risk inconvenience, travel, and even injury and death to find the bodies of his sons lost in the Battle of Gallipoli. He knows their date of death and that they died together--nothing else. He travels to Turkey, meeting various characters who either help or hinder his efforts. Jai Courtney (an actor I've been seeing a lot lately who excels in historical roles) is interesting and demanding of attention here in the short time he's on screen. Olga Kurylenko gives a noteworthy performance as Ayshe, and Yilmaz Erdogan's character of Major Hasan was both layered and respectful.The Water Diviner avoids over-dramatizing for the sake of Hollywood drama (save for the last shot of the film, though its inclusion was understandable after the gut-wrenching affair the rest of the film puts its audience through). One must give credit to the film for showing the nuance and various layers to all sides of the war and its participants. Major Hasan (at one point in the movie blamed for the deaths of the brothers) is a complex and interesting character that, in any other movie, could be portrayed as the simple ""enemy"". Instead, The Water Diviner strives to remain unbiased in terms of war and politics and remains focused on the human condition.Action scenes are not scarce in the film, either. The movie actually opens up with one, though more are sprinkled throughout the film as both flashbacks of the Battle of Gallipoli and as new struggles Crowe has to get through as a foreigner in Turkey during a time of unrest. It's not as action-packed as some war movies given its subject matter, but regardless, The Water Diviner never bored me. It did make me tear up during one phenomenal scene showing the aftermath of a charge (men bleeding out, missing pieces of themselves, crying and groaning), and that's usually hard to do. I applaud this film for tearing through my heart like a meat grinder; the brutal realities of war are explored in full here, as is the devastating aftermath on the people the dead leave behind.Overall, I loved The Water Diviner. Full of tragedy and the exploration of the human condition in two cultures on either side of a bloody divide, this was one hell of a movie. I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in history or war and who can stomach its brutal realities.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Learn Nothing of that Conflict,"The film, in part, tells that part of WWI, around 1915, involving U.K. forces storming the beach at Anzac Cove; part of the Gallipoli Campaign to fight Ottoman forces. U.K. forces were militarily superior with about equal numbers with the Turks, but they might have been a bit apathetic as they end up losing. Story centers on the Australian contribution as represented by the three sons of an Aussie farmer. Today, still a significant Australian remembrance.Negatives: 1. Although a small attempt was made to show that there is always another side in a war, what we get of the Turks is just movie stuff. The real history of this conflict with hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded is poorly treated. 2. A good part of the film is filled with the usual romantic encounter and discord and distrust. The female part in the movie is unrealistically attractive for the role, thus not too believable. Tossed in is the customary plot hook of her engaging young son to reel in the Aussie who, of course, had lost his wife. 3. More obstacles are placed in our hero's search for his lost sons with unusually cold bureaucratic barriers being placed in his way - to be overcome, of course. Again, not believable. 4. Dialogue was inane. Directing was disjointed in that the film used excessive numbers of flashbacks to explain what could have been given at the beginning and resulted in better continuity to the story. Acting was too predictable and a bit stereotyped. Ending also became too predictable.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Movie with some substance,"Generally, I find modern day cinema is a barren landscape of predictable plots, senseless violence, sex and an endless parade of cardboard super heroes. For me, The Water Diviner was an unexpected gem. It may not be a masterpiece, but there is enough here to keep the viewer engaged and moving with the characters. The backdrop of Gallipoli post WWI is presented very believably and the scenery is beautiful. I enjoyed the journey of the main characters and the performance put in by the Turkish woman across from Crowe was unexpectedly spirited. There were many 'delicate' scenes between Crowe and this woman and her son, plus Crowe crossing cultural barriers. I really enjoyed the clumsy honesty of Crowe's performance as he continued to step on toes moving through situations with an aura of Aussie-ness in a culture that was foreign to him. A particularly pleasing aspect of the story was his journey with the Turkish army officers throughout the movie.On the whole, left the film feeling moved and challenged and entertained.

Pretty bad and historically disrespectful,"The water diviner with his sixth sense and his superior martial skills make this movie pretty bad. Historical inaccuracies and distortions make it plainly disturbing.
The time this movie takes place is very special for the Ottoman Empire. Before WWI the empire was probably the most multicultural country of that time. Gallipoli is the greek name of the city, at least this is shown in the movie, Turks use a different name. After the war, Turkish nationalism and religious fanaticism rose significantly. Hate and crimes towards Greek, Armenian and Assyrian citizens started during the war and reached the point of genocide. All we see in this movie is how the Turkish suffered from the Greek invasion which started in 1919. 6-7 years after the Turks had set in motion their ethnic cleansing. Yes, of course this bred too much hate from Greeks towards Turks. Greeks are shown as a pile of dirty and purely evil criminals attacking ""all innocent"" Turks, no comment, no context.
A couple years later Turks achieved their ethnic cleansing and the Ottoman Empire became Turkey. Turkey still doesn't recognise these genocides, although many countries do, such as Germany and Netherlands.
Movie ending: ""This film is dedicated to all those who remain lost and nameless and who live on in the hearts and memories of their families"" is just too disrespectful considering these.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Russel goes down or getting old or just getting bored.The only joy from the 90 minutes pain is Olga. She saved some points from my opinion.

And with one leap he was free...,"I went to this film with a completely open mind and with no preconceptions or hang-ups about Russell Crowe. All I knew was that it covered the aftermath of the Gallipoli campaign in WW1. The first section of the film is set in Australia and to my mind is the most effective, dealing as it does with the trauma of a family that has lost 3 sons in the war. Anger, blame and guilt are effectively portrayed and the cinematography is stunningly beautiful. It is only when Crowe sets off to Turkey to try and locate the site of his son's deaths that the film begins to go off track and credulity is stretched beyond breaking point. Enter a sweet boy whose mother is also the most beautiful woman in Turkey and you already begin to realise we are being set up for a romantic ending. Add in stereotypical British cad officer with haughty attitude, rough and ready Aussies, good/bad Turkish locals who sing and dance at the drop of a fez and the palate is full and ready to be splashed all over the filmic canvas. The ensuing hunt and chase is reminiscent of Sapper and John Buchan at their Boy's Own worst and as unbelievable. There was a film here that had possibilities but it eventually got lost in the need to make it an action movie. The denouement shows our hero doing the ""and with one leap he was free"" action - literally.

The attempt by the Allies to seize the Gallipoli peninsula from the Ottoman turks and gain control over the strategically important Dardanelles failed in a welter of hubris, blood and suffering. A terrible, solemn, tragedy, indeed. The battle of Gallipoli did actually happen as did the alliance of Turkey with Germany in WWW1. The movie also touched on some unhistorical skirmishes with Greek militia presented like pirates of the Caribbean, but it did not, conveniently, touch on the Armenian genocide in progress by the turks during and after WWW1, and certainly in the days during and after Gallipoli.

"Story starts OK, but then quickly disintegrates. Historic dishonesty kills it.","This movie starts with some beautiful wide shots, then quickly turns sentimental. When the father arrives in Turkey to look for his sons after the battle of Gallipoli, the story seems to hold up, but quickly starts disintegrating into non-relevant elements. Towards the end it's getting weak and very hard to watch. Think soap-opera cheesy. 
I was also very irritated by the attempts at whitewashing Ottoman/Turkish history. First this happens when visiting the Blue Mosque, where the father is so surprised to acknowledge that such a beautiful thing does not exist in his culture. Well, maybe not in Australia, but sitting next to it is the Hagia Sophia, until modern times the building with the largest dome, which was a Christian Church until it was captured by the same Ottomans during their conquest of the Byzantine (Roman) Empire. The Hagia Sophia is thus an expression of the same culture that led to the culture of Australia. Second, during the second half, Greeks are painted as truly evil villains against the noble Turks, whereas during the period of 1914-1922 is known by historians as the Greek genocide: the systematic genocide of the Christian Ottoman Greek population from Turkey, by the Ottoman Empire's government. Third, the movie is also completely silent about the Armenian genocide from 1915-1923 where the same (Islamic) government exterminated 1.5 million (Christian) Armenians, something acknowledged by international scholars, but denied by Turkish government to this day. That same genocide has been the inspiration for Hitler's genocide against among others the Jews during World War 2. He said of it:""Our strength consists in our speed and in our brutality. Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter -- with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. It's a matter of indifference to me what a weak western European civilization will say about me.I have issued the command -- and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad -- that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness -- for the present only in the East -- with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?""Hitler was well aware that denial of the Armenian genocide was a strong signal that his tyranny would not be opposed by the civilized world. It is telling that Russell Crowe sought Turkish approval, and the Turkish minister of culture told him ""I believe in the script."". That's the same minister who's responsible for Article 301 in the penal code, which has been used to prosecute Turkish citizens who have brought the Armenian genocide to the attention of the people.

"Awful directing, peaceful approach, some pluses.","Some talented actors excel in directing, but Russell Crowe isn't one of them. 'The Water Diviner' feels like a film made by a promising film school student who has managed to secure some budget for their debut feature.

Turkish characters in the film attempt to speak Turkish, but their effort falls short.Despite high expectations due to the involvement of Turkish stars Yilmaz Erdogan and Cem Yilmaz and the film's significant release date, I was deeply disappointed. The film wastes a powerful true story with a problematic script and an untalented director.

Simply put... boring.,"Gone are the days where I could watch the news and hear about how Russell Crowe pummeled a random person or threw a phone at the face of a hotel concierge. What we have now is a much more subdued Crowe, so subdued in fact that I was starting to wonder what happened to him. Being once a leading man, he seems to be taking on smaller roles as side characters. That's all changed with The Water Diviner as he both directs and stars in this war film. Loosely based on the book by the same name, Crowe plays Joshua Conner, a simple Australian farmer/ Water Diviner (A water diviner being someone who can locate water under ground with a divining rod.) who is in the process of digging a well on his land. Four years previously, his sons have joined the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps at the battle of Gallipoli and our now presumed dead. Unable to deal with the grief, Joshua's wife commits suicide. Having nothing left, Josh travels to Turkey to bring back his sons bodies and bury them with their mother. Once in Turkey he finds out that Gallipoli is off limits to all civilians as the army is involved in a mass burial of the fallen, but Joshua meets a Turkish officer who takes pity on him and helps with the search. Throughout the film Joshua meets a cast of colorful characters and gets into a few battles all while trying to find his dead sons. Hearing all this you would assume that this sounds like a rousing crowd pleaser, the kind of movie you can take your grandparents to without the fear of a sex scene of too much swearing (Old people, am I right?!) For me, The Water Diviner was a huge letdown. Sure, it's probably a movie that old people will like, not too violent, romance instead of sex, strong family values, but for the younger crowd, I found the movie to be boring and cheesy as all hell. From the music to the acting, this film reeked of cheese, and not the good type of cheese like pepper jack, no, this reeked of Limburger. There's also the fact that the movie is called The Water Diviner, other than the beginning where he is digging the well, his ability to find water doesn't really factor into the rest of the movie. Now, I've talked a lot of smack on the film, but that's not saying the movie is completely terrible. It's beautifully shot and they made great use of Turkey and it's people, the war scenes are nicely done too, but that's where the praise ends. The Blu-ray of The Water Diviner is a little on the bare bones side when it comes to the special features, A ""making of"" and a documentary on the battle of Gallipoli are all that on the disk. The picture and sound is top notch as always being that this is a Blu-ray. At the end of the day, The Water Diviner is a forgettable movie that I'd be hard pressed that anybody would watch more than once, let alone own.

Joshua fit the battle,"Russell Crowe's directorial debut shows that he has skill behind as well as in front of the camera but ultimately, even bearing the legend ""inspired by true events"", in the end this well-meaning film ran away from itself as the unexpected, coincidental and just plain ridiculous piled up the longer it went on.The first scenes of Crowe himself show him divining water in the Australian outback which somehow qualifies him to later pick out the long buried remains of two of his three soldier sons at the infamous Gallipoli battlefield. Miraculously, although shot too in battle shoulder to shoulder with his brothers, the third son survives, although not before witnessing his siblings' excruciating deaths and also not without an overwhelming sense of guilt not just because his brothers have put themselves in harm's way by trying to rescue him in the first place but because of the drastic step he has to take to take to ease the pain of one of them.Crowe also loses his wife firstly to insanity no doubt brought on by the grief over her loss and then to suicide when she finally can't go on. With nothing left to live for, Crowe embarks on his unlikely mission to bring his sons's remains back home to bury alongside their mother, stubbornly defying officialdom as personified by the officer class he encounters in the Australian, British and even the Turkish armies. He also hooks up with a young, pretty, Turkish war widow-hotelier, at her hotel, where he stays, she herself being coerced into an undesired arranged marriage with her late husband's brother. Her young son tricks Crowe into staying at their hotel and it's not too long before he strikes up a friendship with the mischievous youngster.I liked must of the early scenes, in particular the moving one where Crowe's wandered wife implores him to read from the Arabian Nights to the obviously empty beds of their children. However the narrative starts to lose credibility when he defends the young widow's honour, hooks up with a couple of Turkish vets on the run from their territorial rivals the Greeks and accomplishes a series of death-defying escapes as he homes in on his surviving son.Beautifully shot and well acted as it is, like I said the only things more clichéd than the action sequences at the end were some excerpts from the dialogue too. Crowe knows where to put the camera to tell his story and is well supported by a convincing cast too. However in the final round-up, I just couldn't buy into the would-be happy endings which while they may be the long-suffering Crowe's just reward, in the end seemed too sentimental as well as unbelievable to, forgive the pun, hold water.All it needed to make this film work better was a more grounded narrative as it winged its way to an upbeat conclusion. Crowe's attempt at an outback epic in the end though well intended and made fell short at the writing stage.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Emotional but way too long! 5/10,"Review: I must admit, this film did feel like it wasn't going to end but the concept was OK and there are some interesting characters, like the couple of Turkish soldiers who helped Crowe to find his sons. I was expecting Crowe's amazing water skills to come into play but they really didn't have that much to do with the film. Its basically about a man who sets out to find his sons who are missing in action. After his wife takes her own life because she can't deal with the fact that her sons are missing, he makes a promise to bring them home, so he sets out on a epic adventure to try and find them, dead or alive. With the help of two Turkish soldiers, he soon finds two of his three sons bodies but he receives information from the soldiers that one of his sons might still be alive. This is were the journey begins and his life soon becomes in danger from various people who make his journey hard to accomplish. Its a extremely epic movie which has a emotional undertone and a great storyline. The main problem that I found with the film is that it was way too long. I liked the scenes with the Turkish soldiers, who tried there utmost to help Crowe but there is a lot of unnecessary material which made the film drag in parts. I was expecting more of an emotional ending, after such an epic journey but it seemed to end quite abruptly. The cinematography was impressive and the cute kid was a nice touch to the cast but Crowe could have brought some more emotion to the main character, especially as he and directed the film. Anyway, is an average movie which did have me gripped in parts and the emotional content was well put together. Watchable!Round-Up: Although this movie didn't make a profit at the box office, Russell Crowe, 51, should be proud of his first directional debut. After winning an Oscar for Gladiator and being nominated for his roles in the Insider and A Beautiful Mind, he has had a career which has definitely had its ups and downs. From starring in epic movies like Les Miserables, with the awful singing, Robin Hood, we're he was confused about his accent, The Man With The Iron Fists, don't ask, American Gangster, great film and the Insider which was a brilliant performance, he really isn't the most consistent actor but he does know how to pull in an audience. To date, his movies have grossed $1.6 Billion which averages out to be over $54million a film. Pretty impressive! Anyway, the movie might have made some more money if he had some other stars alongside him. That's not to say that the rest of the cast didn't put in a good performance but it could have done with some experienced actors who would have brought some emotion into a film with such a intense concept. With that aside, I did stay interested throughout the movie and there was enough elements to keep me awake.Budget: $22.5million Worldwide Gross: $15.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/war movies about a man's epic journey to find his sons who are missing in action during World War I. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Forced Prestige,"The Water Diviner is Russell Crowe's directorial debut for a full-length feature. He takes a father's search for his sons into an adventurous scale. This is meant to be a quest of a man who has nothing left to lose, but suddenly finds empathy towards the people who he should blame. It sounds like a possibly complex drama, but the film chooses the typical direction of what normally results as a glossy cinema. While the star's inspiration from the films he's been does show in his directorial style, the soul rather follows the artificial and melodramatic roots which hardly makes it compelling.The overall film hardly has any sense of subtlety, while it's obviously building some sentimentality, the first half is quite solid at making things seem bleaker, as emotions genuinely breathes through the scenery. When Connor starts interacting with the locals, it's sort of engaging at first, but these relationships only shines to the conventional extent. It's nice that the story has to play shades of gray with both cultures which are supposed to be against with each other, but these characters aren't given enough interesting, or more specific, fresh characterization. The kid is the typical kid best friend of the hero in many adventure movies and the lead female character is basically the unfortunate one who is getting an unwanted favor, but also hinting a romance to the protagonist. Without the fact that this is a true story or any of the dramatic schmaltz, this film might as well be some generic adventure movie, just with a little less action.And that theory just keeps getting true. There is one point where the main character plays Cricket with some fellow soldiers on a train, and when they are suddenly attacked by some enemies, Connor happens to defend them with a Cricket bat. It seems more like a comedic moment you would find in a classic adventure film, but these kinds of strange moments that keeps showing up in this film just never felt like it even belonged here. Russell Crowe as a director seems to bring an ""epic"" treatment into this story, but with these choices being put together, it just gone otherworldly compared to its earnest and grounded first half. Moments of levity aren't bad, but it would have been more appropriate if it was more authentic and less contrived than what we saw. The direction is more impressive when the grandness is spoken on the visuals, like the flashback scene where Connor runs towards his children to protect them from a formidable dust storm. The acting is fine, with Crowe does his own thing while manages to invest some charm, but really, all of them eventually embraces the tone in the latter parts.The Water Diviner is watchable enough, though it just shifts from an engaging bleakness to strange silliness. It somehow comes close to some Hallmark Hall of Fame or something. While the production and acting are at least impressive, it just can't completely gloss over to what the movie eventually become. There is a potential that this is going to involve a compelling theme about war or sacrifice, but what took over is the generic choices towards its characters and sentiments. It just isn't smart enough if it attempts to go through that level, therefore the journey ends up being rather disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Overly Melodramatic, Unrealistic but a good drama for the wife","Maybe I am cynical but I could see this movie was made to cash in on the 100 year anniversary of ANZACS fighting in Gallipoli. Focusing in on the fathers plight to find his boys - sort of like Saving Private Ryan but after the war has happened.Somehow when he arrives in 1920's Turkey he happens upon a boy who can speak English as well as his mother who is pretty and speaks English - so it was no surprise that love would develop between the two characters.He also happens upon a ""friendly"" Turkish general who happens to know where his boys fought. Pretty lucky string of events even for a movie.I found it weird that the main character uses his Water Diviner skills to find the bodies of his boys and this is not really explained??? what is he now able to channel the supernatural???don't take me to be totally heartless there were touching scenes of the movie such as the bond of the brothers in GallipoliI just found that this movie was over melodramatic and the events that happen seem very unrealistic that would fall in place as they did.",5.0,Anonymous,History
