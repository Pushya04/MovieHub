Viva Pirates!,"Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.If you like the first movie, you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.Jack Sparrow: ""Why is the rum *always* gone?"" (he stands up and staggers) ""Oh... That's why.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great fun, perfect visuals","This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates.All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Shamelessly entertaining,"Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I enjoyed this movie,I don't know why so many people say that this oneis not good enough like the first movie. This has some better made actions than the first and very good job by thedirector who makes many great scenes whichmake more ..... the movie.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Best Of The 'Pirates' Trilogy, And Demo-Quality For Blu-Ray","After seeing all three of the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.This was the best ""Pirates"" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.The newest main character is the multi-tentacled ""Davy Jones,"" and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before ""Davy"" was ready for action. (Actually, the same good be said for Johnny Depp's ""Capt. Jack Farrow, who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker.) Anyway, between the battles of both land and sea, something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie, making it a fun ride all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overlong, but this is a lively and hugely enjoyable sequel!","This film is a little too long, and doesn't quite have the charm of the predecessor. But it is solid entertainment, with a good plot, and consistently good acting, as well as the whole production looking stunning. Johnny Depp is as lovable as always as Jack, and Kiera Knightly is as lovely as ever. Orlando Bloom, while less charismatic than he was in the first movie, is still charming. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport also delight, as does Stellan Skargaard as Bootstrap Bill. But an unrecognisable Bill Nighy almost steals the show as the rather creepy Davy Jones. The special effects and the stunts were very impressive especially with the very scary krakon, so was the outstanding music score and although the script lacks the sparkle of the predecessor, this is a resoundingly entertaining film nonetheless. Oh, and be prepared for a surprise at the end. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Captivating,"As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist.Overall, I believed the second Pirates of Carribbean was a rather good film, and very successful in standards of sequels. I can't wait for the third.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Cilly jokes collides with a poor divided story. It  didn't keep me focused, it was impossible.","What a misfortune, I loved the adventurously journey in the first film. This movie was less entertaining. As I go on and tackle it, I certainly will declare why now.The story in the first one was really a story you could follow, this time every step forward, is hard to follow. The story-line is cut into small story-lines which gets very confusing to keep focus on after a while, then the movie becomes silly with too cheap jokes, you laugh so quiet that you don't even think of if you're having fun or not.I will watch the third one, why will I? Because they have succeeded in franchise a beloved silly adventure without any certain ending, and the effects and the environment is actually quite fantastic to rest your eyes on. Well it's a bag of chips really, you get tired of it the more you eat it, and after all you realise it wasn't giving you anything really. But as I said, the visuals and the environment is great, they will be the black pearls in my eyes, until its all over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful film,"I just came out of the movie 30 minutes ago (as it was released a day before America over here).The movie is visually stunning - the CGI is top rate and you won't spend the whole film groaning about how fake things appear on the screen.Acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp once again proves why he's the only man alive who can play the role of Cap. Jack Sparrow. There's a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.My only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain 'heart' that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn't contend with.That aside, you will hardly notice it. There's a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. One of the best films I've seen all year thus far - can't wait for the 3rd one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can't help but feel disappointed,"I loved the first POTC and am a big fan of Johnny Depp's movies, and indeed the man himself is pretty much flawless again in this sequel. My gripe really centres around the unnecessarily complicated plot and the overall length of the film. Unlike the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings trilogy there is nothing in the screenplay to really justify the bum-numbing 150 minutes spent watching this film, particularly as the plot takes so long to get going. The major set pieces involving the island cannibals and the key to Davy Jones' locker are good but seriously in need of editing, and although the CGI effects are impressive, there really is only so many times you can marvel at the 'beastie' before its time to stifle the yawns. Anyone who saw King Kong and experienced midway restlessness will probably recognise similar symptoms here too. That said, the performances by the lead actors are excellent and although the script doesn't seem to provide the same number of laughs found in the first film, this is generally not a poor sequel. Expectation gained from the first film is likely to be an issue when assessing the merits of the sequel and most fans of JD will not be too disappointed, I just hope this 'trilogy' does a 'Back to the Future' and ends with a pacey flourish, rather than a further need for pressure-relieving cushions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Avast,Damn those Bloody Pirates,it's too hard to resist them Mate,they are so bloody fun!","Man,these Summer Blockbusters keep getting better and better.One after another,each better than the previous ones.I'm sorry Superman,but those bloody pirates are just so damn good that ,you've got to fall in love with them.Pirates of Caribbean is the film that shows what Summer Blockbuster is all about.They don't make movies like these you know.It was endlessly entertaining,more entertaining and fun than anything all year.Not even the Man of Steel could pull this off.With all the cast returning and more,this is a joy ride that you have to pay twice to fully experience it and feel it.I was astounded and rocked.This film was awesome.The film begins with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner being arrested just before they were about to get married.They are accused of letting Jack Sparow escape.So in return Will must find Sparrow to help himself.While Elizabeth tries to escape, follows Will.Settling down with his ship and crew, Jack Sparrow is pretty much hidding something himself.But things of course can't be well for a damned Pirate,when a squid like pirate Davvy Jones reminds Jack that he has an old debt to pay.So,of course ,the dishonestly honest Jack must seek help from Elizabeth and Will Turner and there we go again.Another wild ride that will simply leaves you completely satisfied.One hour to this film and I found myself completely clueless.All that was taking place on screen made no sense.With all its silliness and half baked jokes really left me terribly unsatisfied and disappointed.It filled me with doubt that the rest of the film is pretty much gonna be like this.But then by the start of the second hour,the film picks up like a person can spot a pirates lie.Then it enters back to territory that made the first film so endlessly enjoyable.The smartness and clever side of the script emerged and thrills,surprises and incredible effects with huge excitement totally made me change my mind.And an ending that will leave you dying to see the third part.All that pretty much assured me that ,this sequel is exactly what I had expected.There's everything here for everyone.The thing that Superman Slightly lacked.Colorful ,fun Characters,smart dialogues,great epic-sized action.And of course,some really ,really awe-inspiring CGI effects.There are twists and surprising turns,especially towards the end ,where the fun gets even better ,scene after scene.Something great is always popping up.Though less superior than its already splendid first installment,we all loved the first one.And it concludes with a cliffhanger to leave you thirsty for the third.It's the kind of cliffhanger that Reloaded gave us,but its final installment didn't live up to expectations.But I can say this much that ,this films finale,or final installment will rock the world.The Production designs,the sets were unbelievable!They were breath taking.They were so elaborate and detailed that they meet the standards of LORD OF THE RINGS films.It gives the film an other-worldly look.As if the characters were in some kind of a fantasy world.Thank someone,that we have a versatile actor like Johnny Depp.The only actor who I would thank.Having his presence throughout the film was like having a magician constantly pulling out tricks that are all satisfying.Depp,is the first and best reason to watch this film,just like the first one.Knightley is a surprise here.The first one didn't develop her character much,but here she elevates and pushes the boundaries.She really has a lot to do here.Bloom was just like he was in the first one.But his character discovers something that will leave the audience surprised.That is his father.What a surprise it was to finally see the legendary Bootstrap Bill,and Sarsgard was perfection.And then there is the always fabulous Billy Nighy.Where the first one had Geoffrey Rush,here we have Nighy to give you a great baddie.Who never had disappointed me with his performance.So goes for the rest of the cast with a few new additions,such as Naomi Harris.Kudos,to Director Gore Verbinski,and Producer Bruckheimer and Ted Elliot& Terry Rosio for their smart,witty writing.They all give you the very definition of ""sequels better than the original"".They give you a grand spectacle.They really give you everything you deserve to get from a summer Blockbuster.It's a film that we deserve after numerous Blockbusters that didn't fully satisfied us.This film boosts a better score than the first one too.This one is purely fantasy.The Squid looking Pirates are hardly believable,I mean did they ever existed in really world?Whereas the first one had a more believable Bad Pirates.In this film,the Pirates are more Fantasy-like.And somehow detaches itself from reality.It doesn't occur to you that this might've happened.I mean Pirates that look like squids can hardly be bought.It features a lot more weird creatures,that are actually pirates and more.Giant sea monsters and creatures that are very well created with CGI.And that's one of the few big flaws this film has.It doesn't make itself realistic,nor does it take itself too seriously.When there's something dramatic and serious is suppose to happen.And yes,it's a lot more darker than the first one. Way dark.Don't bring those kids of yours,or they'll hate pirates and their misadventures.Yet,this is a splendid entertainer.It's funny,exciting,fast-paced even with 2 hours plus length.It's simply great.This film features more than you could ask for.Those 2 and a half hours in the dark will keep you thrilled throughout.This year's greatest entertainment is here and will knock you flat.I've seen many Blockbusters, from V for Vendetta,to MI3,Da Vinci to X3 to Superman returns.But none could achieve the satisfaction as this Pirates sequel did.So,it's not all that risky to trust the bloody Pirates after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More than equals its predecessor.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great Summer fun, but one word:  editor","Overall, an enjoyable movie. If you liked the first, you'll like this one fine, too. However two and a half hours tests the limits of this viewer's attention span. Maybe too many stars needed too much camera time...maybe so much was spent on budget, had to show it all...who knows? Like I said, loved the first movie, and would recommend this one, too. But don't say I didn't warn you on the time thing. If you wear a watch, you will look at it more than once.That would have been my entire review, but apparently there is a minimum lines of text, so I will continue. Johnny Depp is fantastic as usual. The special effects were amazing, and the villains quite creepy. I won't spoil the ending, but I will tell you--I smell sequel.

You definitely need to see the first movie before this one, otherwise you'll miss some crucial elements about the various characters and plot.

This What The Summer Needs,"This was a great film... had all you could ask for in a summer flick.Comic moments, action, drama, a few twists too... and the best part of any film... leaving you wanting just a little more in a good way.A lot of the cast is back in some way or other, the Davy Jones story is well thought out and is a worthy follow up to the ""Curse of the Black Pearl"".The summer needs more big blockbusters that'll make you want to come back for more... this is on of the films that can do that, much like the Spider-Man films among a few others that have a big budget and prove that prove they are money well spent.Take a few hours of of you day go see the film with the family and then come tell me i'm right, i never get tried of people telling me that.Enjoy the show.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jack Sparrow saved Pirates of the Caribbean,"I went to see this movie last Thursday (it has just been released here in Belgium) with rather high expectations and I must say I was quite disappointed. There are definitely some strong scenes in it and I'm a big fan of the nonchalant, humorous way that Johnny Depp played the role of Jack Sparrow, but the story was just too much. If the makers had just simplified the movie a bit, maybe even cut it down to +/- 100 minutes, the movie would be more pleasant. And by the way, I wasn't really convinced about that whole sea-creature thing. To summarize, unless you're a huge Johnny Depp fan (like I am), this movie isn't more than a way of filling up your free time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very disappointing,"I could not wait to see this movie as Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are two of my favorite actors and I really enjoyed the first movie. HOWEVER, the movie was disappointing. The costumes, scenery and special effects were awesome and the acting was good, but the story was very boring. I felt no emotion while watching this movie, it was just there. I think maybe they were emphasizing too much on the costumes, etc. I didn't laugh, feel sad, anger, happiness, fear, or edge-of-my seat feelings, it was just blah. The story line didn't have enough to it. I think Johnny Depp is great, but his flamboyant walking and behavior got a little annoying. While it was funny in the first movie, it was too much in the second. I was very disappointed I'm sorry to say.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well worth the price of admission,"I worried that after all of the hype and a record setting weekend at the box office that this film could not possibly live up to expectations. IT DID !! It is an excellent film with a great storyline! I only rated it a 7 because I have a very tough scale. I typically do not get caught up in costumes or make up in movies but this film should win the Oscars in these categories hands down. They are great! Davey Jones and his crew wore on and on a little too much for me, but other than that no complaints. Johnny Depp is hilarious and you can not get enough of his antics in this film.

Great summer fun!  Everything I hoped for!,"I will make my comments without spoilers so that people who haven't yet seen the movie can read it.One of the worst things that can happen in a sequel to a successful movie is that audiences will feel like they're seeing the same movie again with slight variations on the theme. Dead Man's Chest gives us all the characters we loved in the first movie, but puts them in a refreshingly original movie. The action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. And there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this movie than in most comedies. I felt entertained from the beginning right through to the special scene after the closing credits. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I and my entire family will be going to see it again today.For parents with young children: This movie is more violent than the first movie. There is a lot of killing, though none of it is shown close up or in a grisly manner. Davey Jones and his gang are very gross. In the screening I attended, there were a lot of ""Ewwww!""s from the audience. If you have sensitive young ones, you should probably leave them at home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Better than the first, and that's saying something","I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.I was pleasantly proved wrong.This is the most fun I've had in the cinema in the longest time. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained.Although it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it's predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.If you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think ""What the hell?"" and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.There are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.In summation: SEE IT!

An OK film....obviously rushed,"I love the Pirate movies....don't get me wrong. They are a lot of fun. However, I thought the second film was rushed and over-used many of the special effects. I do not want to give anything away but you will see what I mean while viewing the film. The cast was pitch perfect. Depp just keeps getting better and better.The length of the film was a major issue. I thought it was a bit too long and the word of mouth on the length will not work for the better for this film. I think I had high expectations for this film because the first one blew me away. Not because it was a good movie but because it was unlike anything I have ever seen. I was hoping to be blown away by this one but I just felt some parts were too dull and when the scenes were exciting they did not last long. A 6 is pushing it. I thought it could have been so much better if the production was not rushed. I can see it had to make a deadline but something this huge should be filmed carefully and to perfection. I think Disney really wanted to make this movie a ""filler"" to fill in the gap between (hopefully) the two stronger movies.The one thing I can say I loved about the film was the end, it was very satisfying and leaves me wanting more of the Pirate world.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow!,"I loved the first movie, so I had to see the second one. The beginning was a bit slow, but there sure was a lot of action. The sword fighting scenes were exciting and in some cases rather funny as well. The special f/x were outstanding. All of the characters were believable, even the computerized ones. The voodoo lady was hard to understand. I caught every other words she said. I'm sure I'll get all of the humor when I buys this DVD and play her section with the CC on! I didn't quite understand the reason behind the part of the movie with the tribal people other than it gave the movie more action scenes. That whole section could be removed and the movie would still flow well. I loved Commodore Norrington in the first movie. I was disappointed with what they did to him in the second movie. I hope he returns in all his glory for the 3rd Pirates movie.I saw a few young children in the theater and was horrified to think that those young eyes saw some very scary and gruesome images.

What a BLAST!,"No one expects this movie to be Shakespere. But it is still an excellent, fun, summer blockbuster movie. The special effects are fabulous, and seamless. The characters are well done, and well acted. Believable? No, not really, but did you actually expect it to be? Was the first one? Did that make it less enjoyable? No, not in the least. The much touted ""non- ending"" wasn't any different than Empire Strikes Back, or Two Towers. I'm quite exited that there will be a third movie in the series - and pretty much can't wait to see it.While I won't say this is as good as Empire, it's still a very good follow-up to a really fun movie.

"Pirates, Squid/Fishfaces, Kraken And A Dead Man's Chest","The first time I saw 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', I disliked it so much that I didn't bother finishing. However, something motivated me to give it another chance and surprisingly I enjoyed it. It is quite well executed. The action sequences and stunts are brilliantly choreographed. My favourite one was the three-way sword fight that continued through a spinning wheel. I liked that the director used minimal CGI for these scenes. The cinematography is stunning and the exotic landscape is breathtaking.The actors do a fairly good job of reprising their role. It's great to see Johnny Depp again as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is quite alright but his chemistry with Keira Knightley appears to be weaker than in the first movie. Knightley does an okay job too. Jack Davenport is a surprise to watch in a different gettup. Bill Nighy is great as the squid-faced villain and Naomie Harris is convincing as the witch with the Jamaican accent. The rest of the cast are adequate.The dialogues are funny and witty and the comedy works but at times, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' felt more like a repetition than a continuation of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The CGI, particularly on Davy Jones and his crew looked poor when compared to that used in Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' (the kind which would have excellently worked for this movie). The ending is unintentionally funny and seems very rushed. Not to mention, it's continuous (a cliffhanger ending) so the third one better be good.For me, what stood out more about this movie than the first one were the amazing outdoorsy locations and the action scenes. It's quite a good sequel and very entertaining. Hopefully, the third one properly rounds up the trilogy and not end up like the disastrous 'X-Men'.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The consummate summer movie,"Movie light for summer viewing? This movie was great fun as expected, over-qualified actors, great color filming, great costumes, great sets, nothing serious at all. But, maybe they saw Lord of the Rings too many times: I think those were water orcs and way too many of them. Once you've seen a couple of stupid sea-men you don't need to keep seeing them over and over. The physical adventures of the characters, the sword-fights, etc would have been exciting enough without the stupid creatures added on. And the blatant set-up for a sequel is a box-office cheat. It's a shame they didn't make a better movie while they had all of the pieces assembled. But, any movie with Depp, I'll be there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
pirates 2 not as 'sugar coated'!!!,"When watching pirates 2 for the first time, you start to wonder what was going through director Gore Verbinski's mind. Pirates 2 shows a very different side to piracy than that of 'the curse of the black pearl'.Disloyalty, greed and lying are the basic themes of piracy, but this has shown more in the second film than the first. Mr Verbinski has definitely shown a new side to piracy, making it not as 'sugar coated' as the first movie.But overall, at the end you are still hanging of the end of your set as expected. Well done to all those involved. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest was tops!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great fun.,"Yet another sequel! Capn' Jack returns for another adventure, and this time the scale is ginormous! If you thought Pirates 1 was action packed, and spectacular, this film goes far beyond with massive sets, brilliant effects, and a massive 2 and a half hour running time, that will have you leaving the theatre feeling like you've spent a year in the harshest prison, wearing a ballerina's outfit, with a bull's-eye painted on your rear. Now the scale is huge, and there's all the lavish extravagance that Bruckheimer loves to give his punters, but the story lacks some cohesion, and it's all a bit too much, without much in the way of character depth. That could be an unfair nitpicking for a film entitled Pirates of the Caribbean sure, but the film is little more than a rollicking and fun night out at the cinema. It's not going to adorn top 100 lists of film buffs around the world that's for sure.However this is the second in a series of films that should be predominantly about fun, spectacle, and pure entertainment. In this regard Pirates 2 more than delivers, while maybe lacking the ingenuity and surprise factor of the first movie which, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, took the public by storm. Depp once again is superb, despite giving one of his least interesting performances, as of course this is the first time ever, he's reprised a role, and Depp of course is renowned for doing startlingly different roles from one film to the next. It actually seems incredibly strange to see Depp treading old ground, still his creation of Jack Sparrow is superb. Orlando Bloom again is in the film for little more than to play the straight man to Depp, and to look good for the ladies. It's not a great role for Bloom, who as yet hasn't proved just whether he's going to be a top actor or not, or merely a pretty boy. To some extent the same is true of Keira Knightly, who come mud, sweat, grime, or rain, or dragged up as a boy, looks phenomenal. However while this role offers little for Keira she has already proved she's going to be a great actress (one Oscar nod to her name already!). On one regard though Bloom and Knightley at least have more to do in this film, and Depp is allowed to step back every now and again. This isn't merely the Depp show, which is arguably to the films detriment. The rest of the cast are good, but it's Bill Nighy who steals the show managing to convey an amazingly expressive performance from behind his squiddy CGI mask.All in all Pirates 2 delivers all you could want in a fantasy adventure. The story gets muddle in amongst all the swordfights and giant sea creatures, but still for pure fun at the movies, you can't go far with this. I most certainly look forward to Pirates 3. ***1/2",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rollicking good fun...some wonderful escapes...but a bit overlong...,"Darker than the first film, and even more episodic, is PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN with Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. He holds the spotlight most of the time even though he is up against some of the most fantastic looking creatures a make-up man ever devised. Hideous as they are, it's hard to look away when they come on the screen. The cinematography is stunning, but the fast clip of scenes is overdone and gets wearying after awhile.ORLANDO BLOOM and KEIRA KNIGHTLEY do nicely as hero and heroine, the sort of pair that harks back to the days of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Miss Knightley has a beautiful face but not quite the warmth of personality this sort of heroine should have. Orlando Bloom looks good with a sword but needs more work with his acting abilities.The busy, overly orchestrated score by Hans Zimmer pounds away at the music in what must be the most overwritten score of the year. Dialog manages to be clear enough except for Naomi Harris who mumbles some inexplicable heavily accented words as the exotic Tia Dalma that should have required sub-titles for all their blurriness.Most fun are the chase scenes wherein Bloom and others are locked inside some sort of a rolling wheel-barrel--but all of the special effects are handsomely staged for maximum effect. And surely, an army of stuntmen must have been kept busy on the sound stages for all of the action scenes.Depp's character is given some questionable things to do. His moral compass is not quite what it ought to be, even if he is the anti-hero of this swashbuckling epic. And much of the action scenes could have been trimmed to bring the story in at a length less than two-and-a-half hours. Perhaps with some of the action trimmed, there would have been time for more emphasis on exposition, especially for those who never saw the first film.Aside from these minor reservations, it's highly enjoyable entertainment for those wanting to escape the summer heat and looking for more than two hours of pirate fantasy with stunning special effects and photography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Noisy and quite fun but not as good as I had hoped for thanks to a darker approach that doesn't have the material to really sustain it,"On their wedding day, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan find themselves arrested for helping Jack Sparrow to break out of jail. Facing the death penalty themselves, Will accepts a deal from the East Indian Trading Company to win their freedom by getting an enchanted compass from Sparrow. As Will sets off to track down his acquaintance, Sparrow has his own problems. The deal he made with Davy Jones all those years ago is due and Jones himself is coming to settle the debt. Meanwhile Elizabeth's father arranges for her escape and she sets out to find Jack and Will.Having enjoyed the first film and applauded the Oscar nomination for Depp, I was looking forward to more of the same and went to see this film on the fist weekend. I was slightly on edge because of having of having to share a cinema with a group of chavs determined not to let anyone forget they were at the back, but settled into it. The opening of the film is rather heavy as it sets up the plot and it does rather lack the fun that the first film had  which is sadly how much of it turns out to be. It doesn't really help that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense at times and that the film is too long but generally the main problem is that at times it forgets that first and foremost it is supposed to be entertaining. Others have wittily ripped of The Guardian newspaper by describing this as The Empire Strikes Jack, which is fine because it does have a good try at being dark and interesting, but it is at the expense of the fun.It does have moments throughout the film that are funny and entertaining but it puts too much emphasis on the plot (which isn't that great) and the darker tone. The latter is a problem then because the first film never took itself that seriously so it is a bit jarring as an audience member to be expected to suddenly buy into this film as the second part in a dark, sea-faring trilogy. The direction is still good and visually the film is very impressive; the sets, costumes and make-up are very convincing and the special effects look like every penny was spent (but they also merge well into the film and don't stand out for their own sake). Depp is as good as he was in the first film but here is sidelined by the many other characters and threads. It is a real shame and a big reason why it feels less fun than before  he has less to do and less to work with. Bloom is rather wooden and history may well remember him (assuming it does) as someone who lucked their way into two massive trilogies of the time before fading away. This may be a bit cruel but his performance isn't anything special and he is totally in Depp's shadow. Knightley is a bit better because she is feisty and fun. Nighy is a great addition  not only for his character but also for his performance, which is fun and slightly menacing; god only knows what the film would have been like without him because he does steal many of the scenes. Support from Skarsgård, Crook, McNally, Pryce, Davenport and others is mostly good but really the film could have done with a few characters and threads being scaled back to make for a brisker and pacier film. Harris was a surprise find and I was impressed she still managed to be sexual while under very ugly makeup.Overall then this is an OK summer film but those that loved the irreverent sense of fun of the original will probably feel a bit let down. It is still a solid film and the dark edge makes for a more rounded film  albeit not one that I actually wanted but still a good one. Visually it is amazing and I was never really bored at any point but I would have liked it have been a bit more fun than it was and also for the darker stuff to have had a bit more substance.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as good as the first, but okay.","This movie didn't quite live up to the hype left from the first movie. The make up, set, costumes, and effects did live up to expectations. I was a little disappointed by Depp and Knightley's performances, the acting lacked the passion and intensity that existed in the first movie. The new characters did add to the movie and provide unique twists. The action scenes were almost as good as the first. The scenery was actually better than the first movie. The make up job of the eyes (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it) was really cool. It is worth seeing, and I will see the third was as well, I'll just try to maintain a more realistic expectation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
No heart . . .,"""Dead Man's Chest"" is an overly-ambitious jumble of characters, settings, and effects that fail to deliver a story worth the journey... The characters we thought we knew from the first film, are lost in hard-to-follow plot lines. Like Jack's compass, they don't know what they really want. To add to confusion, there are several passages of dialogue that were impossible for the audience to understand. Captain Jack is still the man to watch, there is wonderful acting delivered by Johnny Depp. He, along with Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, are the saving grace of the film. But even Captain Jack seems distracted enough to throw his compass out of whack. Poor editing puts characters in one place after another with no clear explanation why. An example, for what purpose did Jack and his crew sail to Cannibal Island? I'm still perplexed as to how the characters wound up in the final scene. It is unfortunate that the special effects overpower character development in ""Dead Man's Chest"". While Davy Jone's octopus face is amazing to behold, the Kraken's tentacles are overdone. If more attention had been paid to the story line, these effects might have enhanced this film. As it is, it is a movie without a heart in more ways than one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
10 Dead Man's Chest's out of 10,"I have been to see this movie twice, and it has only been out in Australia for two days. I am an enormous Johnny Depp fan and so of course I had to see the very first session of this movie. The main question I wanted answered was, ""Would this movie live up to the legend that was The Curse of the Black Pearl?""I am pleased to tell you that not only does this movie live up to the BP, it exceeds it. DMC is amazing!! The acting is exquisite, the special effects are astonishing, the music is inspiring, the jokes are endless, the storyline is flawless and the ending leaves you satisfied though still wanting more and wishing that we were just a little bit closer to May, 2007.The characters in this film are just as amazing and intricate as the first. There are the main characters, each with their goals, priorities and little quirks to go along with it.The costumes and sets are amazing. Each character has an individual quality and looks authentic for their person. The islands of the Caribbean act as a playground for each scene, complimenting the storyline and actors.I heard a bad review of this movie before it's premiere date and I thought I may be in for a disappointment. How wrong I was.Go and see this movie as soon as you can. It will push fans of the first film to further heights and will make fans of those who haven't seen the first (though I cannot imagine why they haven't). Gore Verbinski has yet again gone above and beyond and Jerry Bruckheimer has delivered another great film. I only wish that one day I too can direct as well as this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A few less jokes would have given the film a stronger characters & plot,"I was entertained. I laughed throughout and enjoyed the action. It's not a bad film. But the plot was thin and the character development was lacking. If the jokes and action were trimmed a bit here and there, greater weight in the plot and character development could have easily been achieved. Unfortunately the film is yet another example of executives saying, ""Well they bought the premise the first time so now let's just give them more action and laughs."" Who doesn't like action and laughs? But if that's all you have the story gets old after a while and the characters never grow. Why is Terminator 2 a better film then the first? Because the plot was dynamic and the characters throughly changed within the story. Sure there was great action scenes, but the reason people keep watching the movie is because the character relations are so strong. Why was Terminator 3 not as good as 2? Because it was pumped up with action and jokes and lacked in character development. The first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a great film, because the plot was solid and the character's were genuinely understood. And I'm not saying the plot of the sequel isn't interesting, it's simply under developed. I wanted more back story on Davy Jones and his ship, and stronger relations between Will & his father, Jack & Elizabeth. One might say ""That will come in the third installment."" And I say it better, because if all it is, is just more jokes and action then I won't see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Comparable to Empire Strikes Back,"I saw this movie at a test screening this week. I really enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, I own it, love it, and have watched it many times. Our of all the movies I have seen this summer (Superman, Cars, Da Vinci Code, X3, & Click), I have found Pirates to keep me the most entertained. I would say it is comparable to Empire Strikes Back. Depp has Sparrow nailed to a perfect part. While Bloom is not as good, the part he plays in the film is very important. Everyone does a very good job at their part, especially Mr. Gibbs (who seems to be the pirate narrator for those of us who do not know about things such as the Kracken).I would say that if you go to see one movie at all this summer, you should see Pirates:Dead Man's Chest. The CGI is incredible. Davy Jones is the best bad guy since Vader. Depp is a perfect Han Solo match and Knightly has the sass of Leia. I think that anyone who does not feel impressed with this film did not understand what they were going to see; a sequel to a fun, summer, popcorn movie with scary effects, interesting twists, and many surprises. Time your bathroom breaks, or don't have them at all. The first part of the film is the only place I would ever go back to the restroom.

What a movie should be!,"Arriving hours early was worth it to be first in line to see this film - As good as, if not better than the first film, special effects abound, sinister new characters are uncovered, spectacular stunts and fights on several occasions, all with an unexpected cliffhanger ending only adding to the suspense of waiting a year the third in the series! This will not disappoint!I have dubbed this the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of our era (even if some friends of mine consider that to be either an overstatement of the film or an understatement of Star Wars), but never the less this was a fantastic film which I'll be seeing more than I saw the first film, which, if I told you how many times I saw it, you'd all tell me to go get a life.I have deliberately not explained the story unto you all and instead am writing of its wonder, in the hope that you will all go and see it!!! p.s. no, I am not Jerry Bruckheimer or Gore Verbinski endorsing this film",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fantastic!,"I thought this movie was excellent! It revived the wonderful characters of Captain Jack, Elizabeth, and Will, but brought more into the mix! Before you condemn this movie (I have already read the many comments posted about it below), you must see the first POTC to truly appreciate this one. Next, you must keep in mind that it is intended to go hand in hand with POTC 3. Finally, you should truly like the movie. If you simply thought the first one was OK or technically OK but the plot stunk or whatever, you will likely not appreciate this movie because you have no real attachment to it. There are many supposed classic movies that ""everyone should see"" that I detest because I personally cannot get into them. I am not putting this movie on the same level as those, but the same principal follows it. This movie contains a lot of action and drama and I think it will be nicely rounded out by POTC 3...that is part of the reason some of you whiners complain that it has no plot.

Fun but a little disappointed!,"Great set pieces, great actors and a plot that made sense (I think), visually good to watch and generally has all the components of a great movie.However, I'm just out of the cinema and I feel a little hard done by. I don't have the - Oh My God, I have to see that again - feeling that some films give me.In general I enjoyed it but I just feel that everything was taken to the point where it was working and then pushed to see if it could get any better. In doing this it actually made It slightly worse. Cpt Jack for example - In the first movie you really wanted him to win. Every time he was on screen I felt myself moving towards the edge of my seat, wanting to see what he would do next. This time he juggles with the old good Vs bad, light Vs dark storyline and makes decisions that I feel he as a character would never make. I felt let down by him. Also his little quips that made him so lovable in the original began to get on my nerves ever so slightly.As I said the Actors did a great job, Bloom and Keira as usual are very watchable. However they gave me no reason to think they even liked each other let alone are ready to wed! ...All in all the movie is watchable and I will go and see the next one just to see what happens.

And, once again, Captain Jack Sparrow has one of the best introductions in movie history. The special effects were very good and everything looked realistic. The sword work was excellent, the fights both suspenseful and entertaining. And, there's a wonderful surprise at the end. If you want a movie that will make you think, this isn't really it.

They didn't need a sequel,"When I saw the teaser trailer last summer, I thought, ""But the first one didn't leave room for a sequel. They didn't need one."" But being a big fan of the movie, I was still excited to see all the characters in another movie with hopefully the same intertwining plot lines and great actors. I was wrong. Sure, the actors are great, and they're all the original ones. But they might as well have not been. This sequel doesn't even compare to the first. Imagine seeing a commercial for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The TV Series!"" and mix up all the episodes and Dead Man's chest is what you've got.

Edges,"Smart movies always have a seed. If you want to read them, it always pays to start from that seed.Disney has been very smart about those seeds in the past, and they may be entering a new age of power in this regard, now that at least one of their research ideas has born fruit.The seed in this case comes from the business reality that Disney has a special way to leverage movie franchises through their themeparks. The question is: what cinematic effects can you put into a movie that will stick in the popular imagination AND be exploitable in a completely different domain, the one of physically built rides, what they call ""attractions."" There are colorful characters of course. But what else? Worlds, but how to define worlds. What works? Viewers might not be aware of the rather exotic science that comes into play, in addition to following trusted artists with intuition.""Treasure Planet"" was an experiment in how to place a camera so that the environment was the star, more precisely the built environment, the ship and planet. And in that case, the edges. The world is made of edges  in our eye and mind. It wasn't a particularly effective movie, either as entertainment or architectural experiment.But there were lessons learned from it. Most of what we know in film and architecture goes back to Orson Welles, in particular his ""Othello."" The first one in this franchise was very serious about this, a heavy investment. Sure, they wanted to sell theater tickets. But more than that they wanted to built monetizable intellectual property, duly injected into the culture.With that as preface, look at how the camera relates to the built spaces here. Its extraordinary, extreme. Every shot starts with the inclusion of an edge, which is then registered with an object: a ship usually, but any space. The reason is because they will later be selling entry into that space.See how every composition is thus influenced. You can see it immediately from the opening: rain on lips of teacups... what a device! Then scanning  not panning  to tell you that what you will get is place defined first. The situation is always placed.Later, the big effect is a huge wheel. You can just see the brainstorm: we need something that is spatial, that moves, that moves differently than anything else in life or the movie. We have to be inside it and outside. We have to as characters be manipulated by it, its dynamics not influenced by humans.Then see how that is set up earlier by the similar device, men in suspended globes (of bones!).Its a remarkable advance in the cinematic lexicon.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest,"This is by far one of the best sequels out there. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I know that some reviewers have said that it's too long at 2 hrs and 30 min. I say how can you never have too much action. All the characters are explored a little deeper as well as some questions being answered. The Location in the Grenadines was spectacular as were the special effects! Although different from the Pearl the effects were just as exceptional! You do need to pay attention to the dialog very close in some parts because it is difficult to make out. There were as many twist , turns and surprises as there were course changes in the ships directions. Speaking of the ships, the Flying Dutchman looked pretty menacing. The Pearl was as sleek as ever and appeared to have changed just slightly from the first movie. Wehter you root for the Pirates or root for the ""other guys"" you will have a great adventure.

Slightly Disappointing,I thought that the movie was a fairly big let down after watching such an amazing prequel. Johny Depp was good but not as spectacular as he was in the first film. The special effects were very good and the cliff hanger of an ending was excellent. But overall I thought the plot was rather boring in fact. I also found the movie to be quite a bit longer than it needed to be it could have been maybe and hour and half and been really good but the movie slowed to a crawl at some parts. There were a few humor moments that were very good. And I still recommend seeing it if you liked the second because by the sounds of things the 3rd one will be excellent. However since this is just above average for me I give it a 6 out of 10.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great Movie,"Since I'm a wicked fan of Johnny Depp I pretty much adored this movie. I cried when he died though loll. I heard he's in the next one. I wonder when that one comes out. Well I loved this one so i bet the 3rd one is even better.I was so surprised with all of my favorite characters coming back. Will's dad was amazing, great chemistry between them. Yeeh also I liked the jokes in it. The part when Jack and Elizabeth saw each other the first thing Jack said was ""Hide the rum"". Hahaha, I was laughing so hard. Probably the best movie I have seen this year and I'm already counting down the days for the 3rd one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
everything about this movie is bad. everything.,"Terrible, terrible movie. I'm not quite sure why so many people gave it a 10, were they entranced by the name of the movie ... or passed out after the first 5 minutes... or is it simply that they were preoccupied thinking up the fan-fiction they were going to write upon their return home? I mean honestly, this movie was just poorly done. They dropped the ball hard here. First of all, it needs some serious editing, it was far too long, and needlessly so. The fight sequences were repetitive and I hardly saw any swashbuckling! Next, can we get a little more imagination in the writing please? How many times are they going to repeat the same rum joke?!?!I was considering giving the movie a 2 or maybe even a 3 due to the great visual effects, but topped with the terrible story, awful writing, poor score, and pretty much ruining the first one for me, I just couldn't bring myself to do it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as expected,"I thought the movie was alright but not as good as I expected. I loved the first one and this didn't quite live up to its high standards, as with most sequels. I found that it dragged on too much and the ending was also a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to leave people in suspense and looking forward to the third one but i think they could have done it differently. The ending left me feeling disappointed and incomplete.However, apart from these small things I thought it was still pretty good. It had the same good humor that fans one the first one loved and of course everyone's favorite character, Captain Jack sparrow remained his hilariously charming self. I'm not a great fan of Will though as I find him too heroic and trusting. No one is perfect. I also thought the bringing back of some of the previous characters from the first movie was a bit unnecessary as they sometimes seem out of place and to be grasping a bit to have it similar to the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Without a doubt one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies EVER!,"Hollywood and numerous other places in which they make big fat expensive action/adventure thriller type films... are usually very lazy. They usually put in a hell of a lot of money, they may throw in some very good-looking actors, probably some expensive things like muscle cars (The Fast and The Furious), some really good looking girls, explosions, bad one-liners, POP CULTURE REFERENCES AND MAYBE EVEN SOME POINTLESS CAMEO APPEARANCES, bad dialog and a really uninteresting or boring plot... if not no plot at all. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is not one of those films... IT'S A MASTERPIECE!!! I was a huge fan or the original and own it on DVD. I have watched it many times over. The performance of Johnny Depp earned him an Acadmedy Award nomination and knowing this man I can honestly say right now that he without a doubt the greatest American actor of all time! I mean... sometimes you can hardly tell that its Johnny Depp because he gets to into this character of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are good in their roles but of course they are overshadowed by Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. Davy Jones is a complex, dark and very original kind of movie villain and one of the best I have seen in a long time. The plot is very original, the action sequences done extremely well and the loads of money put into such a production hasn't gone to waste... every cent has been put into good use. This is ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"" or the modern age... and I am without a doubt not the very first person to say such a thing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as the first,"I was a bit disappointed in POTC; Dead Man's Chest. The plot didn't seem to be very well thought out. As usual, Johnny Depp rescued the film with his entertaining portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow, and his crew does an excellent job. Orlando Bloom didn't seem to really get into his part, which seemed diminished, as if the writer(s) really didn't know what to do with him. The ending made us eager for the next installment, and we hope that they have a better plot line and script. The special effects were excellent; the replacement villain and his crew are far more frightening than Barbosa and company. I wouldn't recommend that children under 10 be brought to this movie, as it is very intense in parts, and the creatures are extremely gross. I have a feeling that this will be the last time that Depp reprises a character (after the next POTC, that is) as this film really lost steam.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Okay but way too long,"I wish the moguls at Hollywood could learn that less is often more. Too many blockbuster films of recent years have been ruined by self-indulgent directors going on and on and on until stories become overweight and boring. Think Peter Jackson and King Kong, or, for that matter, any Peter Jackson film.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is another one of these. The elements of a rollicking yarn are there but too many scenes overstay their welcome. The film could have been cut by at least half an hour and it wouldn't have lost a thing. In fact it would have gained.I suppose we can expect the same in Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End. Personally I hope they try to bring it in in under two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot of flash...but no heart.,"Wellll...aside from trying to help me catch up on my sleep three or four times, the second installment to the Pirate's franchise didn't have much to offer. Johnny Depp was there, of course, and just as amusing as in the first, but without much heart. There were a few great scenes full of situation comedy that about had me in stitches...but they were few and far between. What did they fall between? A loose, empty-aired plot that wasn't near as interesting as the first...and just seemed like an excuse to have the characters, especially the CGI spectacles, on the screen. The movie did manage to make me laugh though, Johnny Depp was still great, and I'm sure some awards for make-up/costume design will be in order. So, overall, I'd rate it at about a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it!,"Absolutely loved it! This sequel is much funnier, wittier and looser than Curse of the Black Pearl! Jack is far wilder and zanier in this one. Will is even more heroic and still a great straight man and side kick to enhance Jack's quirky pirate behavior. Liz had a little more action this time (double swords at one point). Great that all the gang was back for this one: the hilarious comedic duo of Pintel and Rigetti, Gibbs and the rest of the usual suspect pirate crew! Of course the introduction of new characters, the mythical Davy Jones and Will's father Bootstrap Bill enhanced character development in this one. The non-stop action made for a great ride!

"Not ""Dead"" in the water, the most fun I've had at the movies all year long, savvy?","***1/2 Johnny Deep, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook. Directed by Gore VerbinskiThe sequel to 2003's summer smash hit ""Pirates: Curse of the Black Pearl"" comes the new and near more entertaining summer blockbuster for 2006. I've gotten to see a lot of so-called ""extravaganzas"" like ""Poseidon"", ""Da Vinci Code"" and ""Superman Returns"" and I am pleased to say ""Dead Man's Chest"" does not disappoint in it's efforts. Instead each scene is well crafted by original director Verbinski (Showcasing some talent this time around in his directing) to make it by far the most entertaining movie I've seen all year.Cunning Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp, savvy?) is being hunted down by the legendary ""locker"" owner Davy Jones (Nighy, respectfully) to repay his debt. While a Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) get prepared for there wedding until forced to find Jack and retrieve a valuable compass. Also joining the crew are the two ex- immortal Pirates from the Black Pearl (Arenberg and Crook). And Crook gets the laughs with his eye popping in and out at times""Pirates"" although with a run time of 2 hours and a handful of minutes does not bore with a tiresome story line. Instead 90 percent of the run time is filled with action both on land and water. Kudos to the special effects team who did a great job with Davy's water logged ship and adding those little sea shells you find on the rocks. A dazzling display of directing and an all out beautiful film with great CGI. Certainly on the years MUST LIST, I for one savvy",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Awful,"Well, it made a record $132 Million opening weekend and that means only one thing: a lot of really disappointed people. I enjoyed the first movie, but I wasn't what you would call a fan. My wife dragged me along to this one and I relented mostly because of the poor reviews for Superman, which I would have rather seen.Pirates II wasn't funny and it was totally self-indulgent. The editor is a genius, basically because he figured out how to get paid without actually doing any work. Almost every scene without fail had five to ten seconds of crap on each end of the action. The run time was way too long (which could have been remedied with cuts in appropriate places). For an action movie, it doesn't say much that I got bored on two separate occasions, finding myself searching for the remote.The first movie was redeemed by a fantastic script and solid wit. The sequel had neither. I saw an interview with Johnny Depp in which he claimed to be willing to do ""eight of these movies if the scripts remain as good as the second one."" LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. I love Depp, but he will forever be a sell-out in my book if he continues to insist that this is a well made movie. I'm totally OK with actors making crap for the money so long as they acknowledge that they did it for the money.The only thing that could have possibly redeemed this movie would have been extended gratuitous shots of Keira Knightly just standing around or doing basically anything. For a movie that didn't know when to edit a scene, there were surprisingly few of these shots. It also didn't help that at some point near the end of the film, she gained an ugly, obviously fake tan out of nowhere.All in all this movie was bad, but it wasn't so poorly made as to become entertaining in its badity. This is the worse kind of film to watch. That being said, I'm definitely looking forward to the third one; at this rate it will be exceedingly awful and possibly awful enough to be entertainingly bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic!,"This film really lived up to the hype surrounding it! I saw the first one and I forgot about the plot completely. Fortunately, this one was very memorable that I am sure I won't forget it. The plot was intense and tightly woven, and there was a nice balance of action and comedy in the film. The viewers laughed out loud so many times on those mischievous moments. The scene with fruits was so hilarious! Johnny Depp's acting was incredible. The facial expression on his face kept on changing, and he obviously thought deeply on what face to pull in each second of the movie. The make up is amazing. Those people on the haunted ship looked so terrible and yet so real! Having a starfish on the face or having corals on the shoulder showed that the costume designers and make up artists really put a huge amount of effort in making those characters real.The ending was great as well, the finale lasted well over 30 minutes, and it kept me wanting to know more. The fights were well choreographed and also looked comical enough to be entertaining.This film was fantastic. I can only recommend it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Going the way of The Matrix, except better...","Though a wholly entertaining flick, Dead Man's Chest was not The Curse of the Black Pearl.It seems as though Pirates 2 is going as most sequels go: SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, instead of a gripping plot. But don't get me wrong, Dead Man's Chest has a good plot dealing with revenge, Captain Jack's self-serving nature, and Turner's save-Elizabeth and save-everyone else complex.The main thing I noticed that bugged me was Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was it was just a bit different than in the first installment.As a whole, it's a movie to see, but see it on the big screen.

A High-Seas Adventure of the Highest Calibur!,"""Dead Man's Chest"" is an outstanding and exciting movie that blows the competition out of the water. You will be glued to the screen from beginning to end, not wanting to miss a single minute of the action. The plot is original and entertaining and really takes ""Pirates"" to the next level. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly are brilliant once again as Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. There are also several familiar faces that will entertain and surprise fans. Will Turner fans will definitely not be disappointed with ""Dead Man's Chest."" This second outing allows Will to show his magnificent and exceptional leadership abilities and once again his undaunted bravery and love for Elizabeth. The music to accompany the action is fantastic. Hans Zimmer does a magnificent job capturing the power of the movie. The soundtrack is driven and epic in nature to support the grandness of the movie. Fans of ""Pirates"" will be humming the music in their heads for days. Now that ""Dead Man's Chest"" has finally sailed into theaters -- taking the box office by storm -- the countdown is on for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" (tentative title?) due out in May 2007.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"When Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was released in the summer of 2003, it was a breath of fresh air in the world of blockbusters, managing to be light-hearted and fun, whilst adding a touch of horror and buckets of humour. Unfortunately, Dead Man's Chest has taken the route of many sequels; disguise the fact that it is not fresh anymore by making it look prettier. And that is probably the best way to sum Dead Man's Chest. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not as good as the first.Most of the cast have returned, and this is actually one of the films' problems. At the end of the first film the cast had all separated, and so the sequel needs to find ways to bring them all back together again, and this results in a plodding first half hour which mounts up as episodic and badly thought through plot devices. Even Commodore Norrington returns, and his entrance and role in the film, whilst is interesting in its own way, is (at least for the moment) needless. Also needless are the return of Ragetti and Pintel as the (unnecessary, given the fact that Jack Sparrow is the source of all the humour) comic relief, who really aren't that comic at all.The point about Norrington brings up the next big fault. As it is the first part of the two sequel story, Dead Man's Chest is not a film that can stand up on its own; it is only half a story. This may mean that come May 2007, all the various plot points will make sense, but at the moment they are all too far-stretched to makes a whole lot of sense. There are also really too many different plot strands to last its two and a half hour running time (which is itself about half an hour too long).There are good points about the film, of course. The effects are nothing short of staggering (although some of the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman are not quite as good as the rest), especially Bill Nighy's Davy Jones who has a multi-tentacled beard. Nighy himself is good in the role, but Davy Jones never seems as menacing or, quite frankly, as good as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. Also good is Stellan Skarsgård as Bootstrap Bill, Will Turner's father. Will is a little darker but Orlando Bloom lacks the gravitas to pull off such a character turn. Knightley's Elizabeth Swann is also different, showing a more pirate side to her actions, at least making her a little more exciting even if Knightley herself doesn't entirely convince.The star is once again Depp's Jack Sparrow; even though, like the whole film itself, his act is not as fresh, he is given enough to work with so that most of the humour he creates lands well. His entrance is another classic moment, and his ability to run away as well as he can swagger is often hilarious  he even manages to build on his role from the first film.There is plenty of action, and although it can be thrilling, it feels a little too over-the-top to truly impress at times. However, much of it is well handled, and injects a little more fun into proceedings, just when the audience begins to think that the film has begun to take itself too seriously to be fully enjoyable. It is now down to film number three to see whether the franchise is strong enough to stay afloat; the last ten minutes of Dead Man's Chest has three plot twists that at least will make us come back for the answers next summer. Overall, whilst it is enjoyable enough, it is certainly not a patch on the first, and the third entry in the series has a lot of work to do to restore audience faith in it.Rated: 7/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Beyond Expectations,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest seemed like a bad idea even up to a day before release ruining a great movie like Pirates of the Caribbean never the less I thought it would be good...but if it should have been made I argued.After seeing it I realize how wrong I was...the movie though worlds different from the first links problem more closely to the upcoming At World's End. Though this does some have jokes rooting from the original and the greed, pirates, swords, explosions, action, comedy, betrayal, lies, and heart pulsing action is all there and amplified. Elizabeth, Will, and Jack show great character development and the story takes off leaving fans begging for Summer 2007.Deffiantly 2006's High Point alongside X-Men 3...Dosn't disappoint like Superman Returns.This movie will leave your heart pulsing out of your chest, mouth opened, and eyes peeled....Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is definitely worth the admission...definitely worth the DVD..............................definitely worth the sequel.....best part of it all you don't have to bid farewell to your favorite characters until next and final movie...Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End...Summer 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Two thumbs up!,"This sequel is almost as brilliantly composed as the first film. I highly recommend it to those who were fans of the first one. A great family film. With quite the surprising twist. It will leave you asking for more, and is full of the action and laughter in order to make a great movie. For those who have not seen the first one, you do not need to in order to understand this movie. Yes, its great to see the first one because you already know a bit about the characters but thats about it. This movie's story line is its very own (there again is why you wont be totally clueless when the movie is over). So my advice for you is, if you have not yet seen this movie...what are you waiting on?! Take the whole family, I promise you, you won't be disappointed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Superior Sequel,"Usually you have to settle for mega eye candy at the expense of the story, or vice-versa. This sequel delivered a well-balanced blend of both, and for that I'm very grateful.In the spirit of second acts, this installment is darker, both in terms of ambiance and character twists. The rum-soaked lurching, sexual innuendos and sight gags are still there (the second act still knows how to have fun), but there persists an undercurrent of real treachery, both promised and delivered.The first film posed a basic challenge to what the term ""pirate"" really meant - pedestrian notions of ""good"" vs. ""evil"", as contrasted against Jack Sparrow's uber-utilitarian ""what a man can do; what a man can't do"" maxim, etc. And it was all a big laugh.Dead Man's Chest, while still grinning, is decidedly grimmer. Inbetween the laughs, this sequel effectively pushes the lines of loyalty and sentiment, while adding more nuances to the already fantastic Pirate lore.That, and Davy Jones and his pet Kraken are two decidedly nasty pieces of work.Don't trouble yourself with the ""critics"", the usual fashion victims of pop culture. See it for yourself and enjoy the ride.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
not worth the hype,"this movie is good over all but the problem is that you go to movies like pirates of the Caribbean expecting a certain standard and wen the movie doesn't deliver it becomes disappointing. my guess is pirates wont stay on top of the box office come next weak. the movie takes along time to get down to business. almost the entire first hour of the movie has nothing to do with the story line (the story line is Jack sparrow finding the heart of Davy jones so that he can rule the sea) thats our story line forget any other thing like Jack's debt to Davy coz this is just a twist that helps the climax of the movie (introducing a third character that wants the heart) or will searching for jack to rescue Elizabeth as its just an excuse to get both will and Elizabeth to join jack on his magical trip! what Elizabeth does to jack at the end of the movie is motiveless. so to some it up the storyline is a bit troubled. my favorite sequence in the movie is when jack, will and that other captain are all fighting on this huge wheel its just out of this world. and a tribute to Mr. depp for his excellent performance. i mean i cant understand how some one can act as a pirate then go on to do three very different roles (finding neverland, Charlie and the chocolate factory and corpse bride) then goes to do the same pirate keeping exactly the same looks , voice tone its unbelievable. i think in the future we'll compare Johnny Depp's career to Robert De niro.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Offensively bad. Just plain offensively bad,"This one goes in the 'what were they thinking' pile.This was so disappointing that it prompted me to write my first ever review of any movie I've ever seen. Yes, that bad.Too long, tortuous story, cliché ridden, not very well acted, very badly cut, with some of the most awful digital work I've ever seen. Orlando Bloom is as bad and annoying here as he was in Troy (No small feat), the rest of the cast isn't really believing it themselves. The rhythm and tone are off most of the time. I knew it right away, something felt off in the first five minutes. My wife and I looked at each other and said in sync: 'Oh no!' It got worse from there. It's hard to say if it's the writing or the direction, but nothing quite runs well. It feels like a car running on three cylinders most of the time. It runs, but it's unpleasant to witness.I don't get it. The first one was so enchanting and fun. What happened?On the plus side, Depp still manages to come out on top repeating his performance from #1. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking at times and the special effects for Davy Jones' character are absolutely remarkable.Ask yourself: how many scenes of a giant calamari slowly crushing sailboats can you stand before you start thinking of something else?I had the same feeling coming out of there as I had when I came out of Waterworld: How does one ruin such a great premise?Grrrr.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Nice, but disappointing","My understanding is that three movies were planned for the Pirates run, but this latest installment makes me think they only had enough script for two. So instead of just doing two movies, someone, other then the original writers, stretched out the first part of the script at the last minute. I don't know if this is true, but that is certainly what the movie felt like.The first half-hour or forty-five minutes is rife with jokes from the last movie, or jokes playing on the jokes from the last movie, and they are sadly uninspired. This movie also features more, and more drawn out, fight scenes, that seem to do little more then eat up time. After a bunch of ill-thought out CGI sense, this part is over. Thank god.Then the movie picks up! Lots of good stuff that you can see for yourself if you want.The last halfhour the movie starts to die again with more loooonnnnngggg fight scenes and bad dialogue. But there are some good bits in this as well, especially a three way sword fight that is good for the first five minutes, but unfortunately goes for fifteen. What Jack does at the end is fitting, for the most part (even here I smell the stink of the producers touch), but the featured ending is not surprise.In short, with some editing you would have the first half hour of a good sequel to the first movie, maybe someone will try that in the directors cut.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely The Best Movie Of All Summer 2006 Films,"How could I not think this movie was going to be bad (by the trailer)? A guy with tentacles on his head... kind of corny. But, once I went in the theater and saw this movie- from start to finish I was pleased. I was entranced by the plot and the characters were amazing, from their well-written dialogue to their complexity that sometimes altered the story completely, but in a good way. The action sequences were clever, yet funny, and I just loved every part of the film. It was a little slow in the beginning because it was building up the story, but it quickly caught up its pace and blew me away for the rest of the movie. In conclusion, I found the film very endearing among all the other horrible summer movies this year, and inspiring for more terrific action/adventure movies to be made. Just when I thought Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl could never be beaten by its sequel, the film makers had to prove me wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the First,"I had been excited to see this movie for months. I was a huge fan of the first one, having seen it at least 5 times in the theaters. This movie just adds to the fun. Captain Jack is just as mischievous and charming in this movie. I felt that there were more humorous moments in this movie, but some may disagree. If you haven't seen the first movie, some of the humorous moments will pass you by. There's a line about rum that's absolutely hilarious.As a mother of a 5 year old girl, I had no intentions of taking her to this movie. She has seen the first movie and loved it, but I was concerned about the images I saw in the previews. After seeing the movie, I was right not bring her. Davy Jones' crew is a bit on the creepy side and I wouldn't recommend this movie for children under the age of 9, and that's assuming they have strong constitutions. Other than the graphic violence and pirate images, the other daunting thing for smaller children would be the length of the movie. 2 1/2 hours a bit much to expect from a 7 year oldThe surprise at the end was enjoyed and it makes you want to see the next movie even more. If you liked the first one, than I seriously doubt you'll not like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It was nice to see that all the old characters were still in the movie like Mr. Gibbs, Cotton and Marty. Those are just a few of the crewmen. Pintel and Ragetti did a great job too and I was happy to see that they had more movie time this time around.

"If you like the first, you'll like this... if you didn't like the first, you still won't like this","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is certainly geared towards those who are happy to see the same thing over and over again. Anyone going into these films expecting to see something truly new and unique is going to be sorely disappointed. I had heard the hype over the first film and was not overly impressed with it. It was fun, true enough. But, it wasn't an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination.So, too, is the second film not a great film in any regards. It has its fun parts mind you, but it is nothing new, nothing unique, and falls prey to rehashing the same action sequences over and over again. I don't know how many times we need to see Orlando Bloom parlaying an action sequence either on top or inside of some round, rolling obstacle... but when you have the main character in a ball made of bones, on a net full of gunpowder and on top of a water wheel all in the same film, you know the writers are running out of ideas fast.What truly annoyed me about this film was the fast and cheap setup at the end for the sequel yet to come. There was no sense that this film resolves anything or even ends a narrative path. Instead, it leaves the story hanging just as any of the previous action scenes did. In truth, for how little this film resolves anything, it could have ended anywhere and achieved the same result in terms of the story coming to a conclusion.At least with other films that mandate a sequel, there is some sense of closure in the story lines. Even the second Lord of the Rings film had several plot resolutions, though the ultimate story had yet to finish. This film concludes nothing, and in that it feels like I wasted two and half hours, which is far longer than this type of film can sustain any semblance of relevance. By one and half hours I was already bored, but by the time the film ended with what was not even an ending, I was sick to death of the same things over and over again.All in all, the second film is full of the same silly humor, rehashed action scenes and forced character development as the first. So, if that is your thing, all the power to you. But, if you are looking for something new or to stir the mind and imagination, this is not it. I like silly humor (I even loved Snakes on a Plane) but this film simply isn't interesting enough to reward the attention it deserves.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but not ""avast"" lot of Character Development","OK, first of all allow me to excuse myself for the terrible pun in the title. I just felt like it.Now on to ""POTC 2"".

But if people like it, then who am I to say otherwise.How could Gore Verbinsi treat us to so much in the first instalment ""Curse Of The Black Pearl"" and then give us so little in plot and character development in Dead Mans Chest. I'll say no more of that, i feel i've already said enough The saving grace of this movie is the Special Visual Effects. WOW!!! they get a 10/10 rating all on their own. ILM has done a fantastic job. You wouldn't believe that Davy Jones and his crew of Sea Phantom's were all Digital. Simply Superb.So a massive round of applause and cheers to John Knoll and all the crew at Industrial Light and Magic, But jeers overall to this not so great sequel to a bonafied classic.

*Yawn* Pirates Sails Through Sleepy Waters,"There's really not much to say about this movie strictly because of the fact that there's not much going on in this movie. The audience gets a simple plot that lasts definitely over a couple of hours, bogged down heavily with rather lengthy action sequences. People sword fight. People sail on ships. If that entertains you, then you'll like this movie.If you want something to sink your teeth in, something with a little ""depth"" (pardon my pun with this being a pirate movie and all), take your business elsewhere. This is just a cheap, petty thrill to help roll in the bucks that will subdue the moviegoers with less complex needs.Unfortunately, if you're an avid moviegoer, this movie may bore you. I know it did for me. The jokes really weren't that funny, nor was the action a spectacle. Although, I must admit, the makeup and atmosphere was probably the best element this movie has going for it. I give kudos to whoever took care of that.Other than that, this is a sleeper. I didn't care too much for the ending either, but I won't mention more about it. You'll see what I mean if you see for yourselves, which, with the way this movie is really cruising at the box office, I'm sure you probably will.Johnny Depp still has an interesting character though. So if there's any redeeming factor about this poorly scrambled together shindig, it's the makeup, atmosphere, and Mr. Depp. The rest was just assembled out of bits and pieces left in the Hollywood dumpster. It's a pity that there wasn't enough to give personalities to Will and Elizabeth.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp saves a listing ship,"Once again, Johnny Depp needs to call on his powers as one of the great actors of his time to save this gigantically overblown sequel to part one of the Pirates franchise. The stunts are great. The jeopardy scenes are inventive. The costumes are spectacular. But where's the plot? An hour into the feature and we've seen a host of quality action and choreography to go with Keira Knightley's heaving bosom, Orlando's pouting and Depp's masterful Cockney lecher's leer, but it feels like five short action features one after the other with nothing holding them together. One review of this movie I saw noted it was five minutes longer than Goodfellas, and pointed the question as to what might be gained as a viewer from this as a result as opposed to taking in the Scorsese masterpiece. Cut it down to 115 minutes and you've got a quality pop blockbuster the audience can go home from brushing off the popcorn crumbs with all and sundry telling their friends how they can't wait for the last one, and plenty of good script ideas left over to use in the final instalment. Mind you, it always pays to stay till the end. I've never seen an actor steal a two and a half hour movie with his only line in a fifteen second scene, but well, it's all in a day's work for Geoffrey Rush.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Captain Jack's Back What More Is There To Say?????,"Absolutely brilliant. Really there is nothing else to say. It really does live up to the hype. The acting's fantastic, the dialog's fantastic,the plot's fantastic, the effects fantastic, the locations fantastic,the whole movie just fantastic. All your favorite character's are back better than ever with new ones to spice things up and stir things up including some tantalizing clues about Jack before the Black Pearl. The sequel has done the first movie proud. If there is one movie to see all year it has to be this and I cannot wait for the third even though it will be sad that it is the last one.

Difficult sequel to a tee,"Criticising Pirates of the Caribbean is a bit like criticising Christmas. It is one of those sacred institutions whereby daring to even utter a word against it leaves one branded a miser and a scrooge with no sense of fun, but the downside is sometimes it is quite apt. Now the original Pirates movie was terrific, an energetic romp through the high seas that has become one of the classic blockbusters of the decade, but the sequel sadly isn't quite as good. Like trying to recreate the childhood magic of the holiday season as an adult, it just isn't as rewarding. Not that Dead Man's Chest isn't a good film, far from it. In fact it's another highly entertaining ride with enough one liners, set pieces, ""yarr matey"" shenanigans and sea monsters to keep the multiplexes packed for months, but unfortunately it doesn't have the zest of it's predecessor. The main reason for this appears to be a case of over-ambition on the producers part as they have crafted an epic film with multiple plot strands and have sadly succumbed to the same over-stretching that blighted the Matrix sequels.The storyline here involves Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) attempts to pay off a blood debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), commander of a fearsome crew of sea monsters and Captain of the fabled Flying Dutchman. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) meanwhile is hired by the East India trading company to retrieve a key that Sparrow is searching for in return for pardons for his crimes in the first film. Inevitably, Turner's fiancée Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) becomes involved as well and all three characters set off on their own individual plot lines as they race towards a reunion in the latter half of the film. This may sound exciting on paper, but sadly what it translates to is increasing the running time to a bladder-challenging length and over-complicating the premise. Worse, each character is afforded an equal amount of attention and as they all become separated, Johnny Depp is given less screen time. Bad move. Jack Sparrow was the best thing about the first film and once again, every second he is on screen is a joy to behold. Unfortunately, Turner and Swann are considerably less interesting characters and whenever the storyline returns to them, you find yourself tapping your fingers and waiting for the mascara-clad pirate rogue to reappear. The pacing suffers because of this and there's a continual sense that much of the fat could have been trimmed to make this as sleek a vessel as the first: an escape from an island populated by cannibals at the start for instance is riotously enjoyable but in all truthfulness, isn't that essential to the rest of the film.That said, Dead Man's Chest is still a rewarding experience despite it's faults. Alongside Depp's vibrant charisma there are some terrific performances including the return of the ever bickering Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) who provide a lot of laughs, plus the foreboding sight of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). His is a villain that easily matches that of Captain Barbosa from Curse of the Black Pearl, a sea-dwelling abomination with horrific arachnid legs and a beard composed of a slimy wriggling mass of tentacles. But the real breakout is from Jack Davenport, who returns to play the now-ruined Commodore Norrington. Where once was a man of honour is a drunken, brawling, back-stabbing villain and one of the biggest surprises is that he quite effectively steals every scene he's in.Furthermore, the studio hasn't held back on some big budget set pieces. A three way sword fight inside a spinning waterwheel is perhaps the standout as director Gore Verbinski makes the players throw in a really rough and tumble ride that looks so dangerous it's amazing nobody was hurt. Added to this are plenty of rucks with the Kraken, a vast sea monster sent by Davy Jones to drag Sparrow to the bottom of the ocean and numerous clashes with all kind of villains.Additionally, they should be praised for making Dead Man's Chest a significantly darker proposition. There's an ever lingering sense of foreboding hanging over it and the moody lighting, grim score, themes of damnation and the sight of men having their eyeballs pecked out by crows leave no doubts that the waters are far more turbulent this time around. And let's not even get into the sub-textual references of Jack Sparrow falling into an open grave...In a nutshell then, Dead Man's Chest is a film all set to divide audiences. The over-indulgence in the running time and the sometimes convoluted storyline do it no favours but these grievances aside, it still makes for a glorious evening's entertainment with plenty of giddy thrills to remind us all why we love Jack so much. Just bare in mind that it is the first part of a two part story and come the jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending, you'll be counting the days till Pirates 3 sets sail.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ahoy Mates!,"OMG! what can I say!? Fantastic, Superb, Thrilling. POTC Dead Man's Chest was all of those things and more. I must say that if you are looking for the 2nd most thrilling ride of your life (after POTC Curse of the Black Pearl that is) then sign up for the sequel of a lifetime. The crew is back in full force and Captain Jack Sparrow is funnier than he was last time around. Orland Bloom and Keira Knightly were wonderful Pirates, and the addition of Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as Bootstrap Bill was right on the money. Ragetti and Pintel were back in full force as was the wooden eye (lol). The action sequences were over the top but not to be outdone. I got dizzy at my second showing (I sat near the front!) during the wheel sequence. Norrington is very comical and rightly has a bigger part in this one (although not as you might expect). Tom Hollander as the new Lord of Port Royal was surprising at first but welcomed. He is a fantastic actor. I Must say that Tia is a character who I think will be a major player in POTC 3. The movie got a standing ovation in both showings I saw on Friday and during the last two minutes of the movie you couldn't even hear the dialog because everyone was hooting and hollering from a surprise character appearance (and no not Keith Richards). I won't spoil it and say who but man was I cheering louder than most.

1000 unfocused plots in one movie,"This is definitely the worst movie I have seen this summer. First of all the acting was average at best, and the movie held no excitement for the audience at all.The entire movie is a 2 and a half hour long trailer for the third one. The plot is filled with confusion, hysteria, and completely baroque one liners. As soon as 30 minutes of the film passes the script introduces a new and More confusing plot than the previous one, and also fails to finish the storyline it has just abandoned. Not even the writers and director knew what this movie was about. I had more of an understanding of the movie from the trailer than I did in the actual film.If you like completely mindless movies with no central plot or theme this is the one for you.

Filler,"Captain Jack has returned and unfortunately there is not much to see. Pirates 2 is 40 minutes of story and nearly two hours of filler.

It's an appetizer that is served cold, when it should have been pipping hot! There is only a few key scenes that advance the pirates story in any way, the rest is just a bunch of screen time shenanigans that aren't worthy of this tale. A film needs to be able to stand alone without its sequels, ala Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom, The Empire Strikes Back, and Police Academy 5.

On the way to becoming one of the greatest trilogies!,"Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favorite movies - it introduced me (and few other people in the world) to a certain Captain Jack Sparrow. What a beloved character he has become and Depp is perfect in this role. All is well that ends well, and movie no. 1 was a unique masterpiece.Here, however, one immediately starts to think of the original Star Wars trilogy or even Back to the Future, Matrix ... etc. Not because of any reference (although one can easily do so), but because this film is a true example of a great trilogy in the making. I am at awe, truly. Everything in this film is perfectly done, but the only negative side is that I have to wait until next summer for the final chapter to appear. If I would break it down a little, I would do it like this:Costumes: perfectly done. I haven't seen that many pirate movies but I have a feeling how a pirate should dress, and here the costumes are flawless.Music: Always an important factor for me. And I loved Badelt's score in the first one, but Zimmer takes it further and with familiar references to Badelt once in a while. Awesome!Script: Without giving to much, I think the scriptwriters have done an amazing job, I loved the dialog, I loved the scenes and interactions and I loved the ending - that's all I can say!Visual effects: Flawless, yet again. The Kraken is without a doubt one of the best cgi characters I've seen. And of course Davy Jones's face! and other sea-creatures and the cursed crew of the Flying Dutchman.Acting: Depp is hilariously great and awesome, Bloom and Knightley improve a lot, Bill Nighy is fun and of course the smaller parts are all cleverly cast and wonderfully executed.Action: One of the best I've seen! The turning-wheel sword fight (don't worry - this has been seen in trailers so I'm not giving anything away) ... pure magic and skillfully done. And other action is great!Direction: Verbinski is a master at work here, no doubt about it.With this in mind, I think it's gonna be hard to top this one. The final chapter is gonna be awesome, but until I get to see it (with the rest of the world) these two films are gonna entertain me very much.To sum it up in few words: The Greatest Entertainment you can find this year!

Definitely not what it was made up to be.,"As many other people did this past weekend, I went to the long-awaited Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I was quite excited for the movie to begin.The beginning of the movie was awesome however it started to drag on near the middle and I was definitely ready for it to be over with. Don't get me wrong, the performances by Johnny Depp (Capt. Jack Sparrow), Orlando Bloom ( Will Turner) & Keira Knightley ( Elizabeth Swann) were very well done, however, it was the plot itself that was non-existent. When the end of the movie finally came, it was disappointing as there was so much that was left not explained.It was the reappearance of one character from the previous movie that topped off a growing dislike for the movie.To me, the movie felt like it was originally supposed to be 6 hours and just cut off and the 2 1/2 hour mark and then only given half the story. The acting, the visual effect *which are awesome, though a little bit over done in parts* are probably the best part of this plot less movie. It's a good movie to see, but don't go with high hopes as there's a pretty good chance that they'll be brought down. Despite this, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the next movie and hoping that it makes up for this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Critics be d@mned,"I have no idea what bias drove many critics to pan this film, but don't pay them any attention.

The only negative comment I can muster is towards a particular line in the film, which I felt a bit cheesy (SLIGHT SPOILER ahead): ""Why is the rum always gone?"". Other than that, references to the previous film were amusing and all the actors delivered stellar performances. I'm so glad that Johnny loves this character as much as his audience, and is willing to do more films. Disney really has a winner in the Pirates series, and they did nothing but seal the deal for our purchasing the DVD and eagerly anticipating the next sequel.

pirates 2 was amazing,Pirates 2 has been a long awaited movie for many. The first pirates was just a taste of whats to come.

Terrible,"The plot seemed to be written by choosing random scenes out of a hat in an effort to produce a boring, illogical and incoherent story with lackluster and completely unrealistic action scenes. Johnny Depp's character was the funny, aloof drunk that he was in the first one, but his character did not seem to evolve at all. The same old, ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" type thing. Orlando Bloom has too big of a roll, he needs to stick to the type of thing he had in Lord of the Rings. Kiera Knightley is beautiful as ever and does a decent job (it's not her fault that the scene were she dressed like a man was total garbage).

It is sad where the movie industry is going,"I was looking forward to the movie because good movies are really far in between these days. Johnny Depp is playing,that should be good I thought, really only remembering Depp and his wackiness from the first part.People are becoming increasingly confused in these times, wanting more and more intensity from things, wanting everything instantly to occupy them, things to distract them from their thoughts.This movie is just too typical of that to be even funny. We have action sequences stretched out beyond anything enjoyable, there is absolutely no depth to anything in the movie, you could be a mushroom and still understand everything happening on the screen. It was like watching formula 1 these days. Bland, no likable characters, no passion , no nothing. Just something happening. Great CGI and technical perfection. No good dialogs, no real background of anything or anyone, no intelligent humor, It just has no essence.

I am a fan of action and felt that this film didn't do justice to the subject. There should have been a lot more hand to hand combat. However it was still a good film and I will have to see the next film when it comes out next year I believe it is.

my thoughts,"I went to see Dead Man's Chest last night. It was a packed theater. A few people were even dressed for the occasion, swords and all. As soon as the film began, I was hooked. From the moment CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow made his entrance (I cheered) to the shocker at the very end, I loved every minute. Most everyone else did as well. If this was a stand-alone movie, I might have been disappointed because of the ""here comes the sequel"" cliffhanger. But as part II of a trilogy, it works wonderfully. It was darker, funnier, and the various sea battles, swordfights, and escapes were creative and exciting. I appreciated how the director balanced the serious dialogue with slapstick comedy so well. Davy Jones' crew were gross and unpleasant to look at, but that was the point. They're trapped in a watery hell, they're not exactly going to have faces like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (people who complained about the ugly pirates probably went to the film just to ""ooh"" at the two actors listed above). The plot was a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll be alright. I had no problem with the violence and I believe it was done tastefully, not gory or graphic. It's a PG-13 movie based on an idea of Uncle Walt's, not some soccer mom's home video of the ride in Disneyland. I say kudos to the Disney company for having taken such a chance three years ago with The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's about time they realized that most of their original customers have grown up and want things a little more mature from the main Mouse. By the way, Johnny Depp is an incredible actor. Jack Sparrow just might be my favorite franchise movie character since Indiana Jones (incidentally, Spielberg would be proud of this film I think. It feels a lot like Raiders of the Lost Ark at sea). The CGI was top-notch. I really believed there was a giant squid crushing those ships, and as mentioned before, the crew of the Flying Dutchman were delightfully creepy. I don't know if I can wait for the final installment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's NOT as GOOD as First part,"This movie is good, however, it has not been thought out very well. Once the movie makers of a successful film decide to make a sequel, they should keep in mind how many sequels they will be making.Dead Man's Chest was made keeping in mind that in yr 2007 they will release Pirates III. Thats Okay, as long as you know what do you want to show in part 2 and 3. Here, i think the makers had plan for a big part 2 film, started making it and then realized this movie will become 4 hour long. So they decide to chop it into 2 parts ... Now they wanted to build a plot for the 3rd part however without giving away the whole thing, so they kept dragging this one ....First 35-40 mins are good, sensible, entertaining and refreshing, next 1.5 hours is drag ... simply stretching the concept by using gross costumes, acts and scenes.No fun, no one liners, no thrill, I could have taken a nap for 30 mins and wouldn't have missed a thing.As a movie goer, I don't like that. If you have something interesting than show it. Don't worry about the size of the movie. Finish it in one go ... don't be greedy to make more money with part III.Depp fans will watch this ... I simply loved the first part and thought Depp was marvelous ... this part he is ordinary.I will wait for the 3rd one .... $10 more for Mr. Depp",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"All Swash, No Buckle","As the climatic conclusion of this Pirates sequel approaches, there is an especially thrilling three-sword brawl between three of the main characters. They all fight for the same treasure, which many have killed for, given its value, but the duelers don't seem intent on killing each other. In fact, none of the attacks seem aimed towards killing, but rather towards grandstanding and making an ostentatious show of one's ability to balance on an ever-spinning waterwheel.Thus is the spirit behind this inferior sequel that seems more intent on keeping us in awe at the stunts and/or special effects than giving us a cohesive story we can follow. The thrills are in surplus, true, but we still leave the theater with lots of unanswered questions, which I daresay will have to wait until Pirates 3.But maybe I got my hopes up too high. Not an hour prior to my screening I had finished the first Pirates in hopes of refreshing the details of the story. Instead, I sat through Dead Man's Chest with disappointment where there otherwise would have been a more overwhelming excitement. It may have been the comparison to a superior film, but with all bias aside Dead Man's Chest crosses into the upper echelon far fewer times than its predecessor.Not to say that it never does, though. In a complex and sometimes confusing webs of plots and character motivations, some brilliant and suspenseful moments break the surface, especially a jolt moment that would probably startle me again and a tense game of do-or-die Yahtzee. Such scenes are fueled by the improved performances from Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, and of course Johnny Depp's ebullient Jack Sparrow. All are seeking a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones, which, for some reason, enables the possessor to control the seas and thus the wealth that traverses it. Will wants it to save Elizabeth from a greedy lord's bum rap, Elizabeth wants it to save will from eternal servitude on the decks of Davey Jones' ship the Flying Dutchman, and Jack wants it to avoid paying his soul to Jones as a debt owed to him. Enter some cannibals, a giant octopus, and some characters of questionable origin and purpose, and you've got something decent enough to sit through, even for 2+ hours.The final third of the trilogy may make everything clear, just as the last half of the first movie explained the storyline to a satisfactory degree, but this time the anticipation is not exactly killing me. Maybe next time it will not be so set up for a letdown, but one thing is for sure: Jack's got a lot more fighting to do. Savvy?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Marvellous.,"I found Dead Man's Chest a thrill ride on so many levels - similarly to the first film. its a movie that does not necessarily have to 'make logical sense', it follows piratey stereotypes and seafarers mythology, and its a fun thrilling adventure in which we are meant to lose ourselves with its energy and imagination.characters have become more dimensional this time, as the first film has already introduced them. of course Jack has the laughs, and memorable moments, and he is so much fun to watch. Yet it is not his movie - as he does in the first, he injects trouble everywhere he goes, of which the story is built upon. New characters, particularly Bill Nighy's Davey Jones, do not feel like 'filler', or character clones, but like everything else in this film, widens the POTC universe, as though we were journeying through the mythological canon of an ancient seafaring cultures. They all have a screen presence which excites. Acting, although not exactly award-standard, is at the right tone and consistency to make this a fun family adventure, rather than an emotional drama.The CGI is consistently brilliant. Davey Jones is the 'gollum' of 2006. Sea monsters and flying tentacles are the real deal, and applause must go to the crew animating their butts off to bring us this convincing, wondrous world.As i've said, its a thrill ride. sure, its long, and that may get people tired of it. But as it goes on, enjoy the ride with its twists and turns, and you'll be eager for the next. Word of advice though: pay attention to every word said by the characters, as so much happens in this film, and it is easy to at times be a little confused as to what has happened. Keep your ears peeled as well as your eyes. ;-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This one is a REAL film,"that is the best way i can describe this one. in the first the characters were hollow, in Dead Man's Chest you actually feel for the characters and they are alive. in PEARL, all that kept that bloated crock, to steal a great summary from peter travers, was DEPP almost mocking, insane, and brilliant performance as JACK.in this film, the story is stronger. it is darker, and the acting from all is better, seeming to realize that their is REAL conflict going on, as much as can be in this type of film.The extra serious and darker tone adds what i thought was the biggest loss from the first one, and that was how silly and corny it was at one time and then how overly serious certain parts were trying to be and were almost laughable.in DEAD MAN's CHEST, the corny stuff works with the story and doesn't seem so placed, and the serious tone is not forced, it IS the tone, and backed up by dark characters, betrayal, and conflicts.IT is a GREAT, popcorn film, with a truly unforeseen cliffhanger and punch to the gut....",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the worst films I've ever seen,"A day before I went to see it myself, a friend of mine warned me not to go. I went anyway, because I figured the first Pirates of the Caribbean was actually an enjoyable film. I wish I had listened to his advice.By the time we hit the 2 hour mark, I was thinking to myself: ""This could have been over a half hour ago and I could be banging my head against the wall and having more fun."" The plot was ridiculous, even by Hollywood standards. For example: ""Let's see, Will Turner will strike a deal with a diminutive bad guy in order to save his future wife, who ends up escaping anyway."" There was no real character development, or even any sort of resolution.The last hour or so of the film featured a giant octopus eating a ship for the third time, a long drawn out and boring sword fight rolled into a chase scene, neither of which were entertaining and an ending that offered no resolution to the film and actually felt like a slap in the face.After the film was finished, my friends and I sat in our seats in disbelief as we felt robbed of not only our $6.50 but our dignity after being tricked into watching a 150-minute long trailer for the next installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. We didn't even sit there long, but we were the last people to leave the theater. It seemed to me that no one there really enjoyed the film enough to sit around through the credits and talk about how much they enjoyed the film. This observation was confirmed on our way out by the overwhelming number of downtrodden faces and lack of smiles among the crowd in the theater lobby.If I could give this film a 0/10 I would.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

So, of course, I've been dying to see this thing for a long time, as many of us have. I left the theatre with a very mixed reaction, but I'd say I was more disappointed than anything else. Rather than go on about how I don't like it, I'll give my honest reasons of exactly WHY I was disappointed.The plot was interesting. I'll give it that. I was interested in the whole Davy Jones, Dead Man's Chest storyline. I enjoyed it, and I would liked to have seen a little more detail on the past of Davy Jones, and mainly a better explanation on his heart and how it ""controlled the sea"". When I sit down for a movie that is two and a half hours long, I don't want to have questions. I understand that there are supposed to be loose ends in order to build suspense for the third installment, but the plot just seemed to be a little incomplete.The acting was solid. Johnny Depp didn't seem to be quite as good as he was in the first film, but I don't think that is his fault necessarily. The writing was good, but not quite as clever and witty as the first. I would have liked to seen even more humor. The audience seemed to really feed off of that, and it created a great atmosphere. I think that's what gave the first installment an edge- it wasn't just a good action movie. It mixed comedy with drama, action with romance. It had something for everyone, and yet it remained a family film. That's why everyone loved it. That's why it was nearly impossible for this film to be as good as it's prequel. That doesn't mean that this isn't a good movie. As far as good entertainment goes, it's about as good as it will get. Extremely entertaining. But it lacks that ""edge"" that the first film had, and it lacks that edge due to the plot and the writing that failed in comparison to the first film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Brilliant - an already great franchise to a very high level,"Saw it on CinemaExpo yesterday and it has been a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. Incredible CGI and great acting performances, with an exception of LotR's Legolas (In My Humble Opinion). But I am already used to his ""performance"" so it didn't bother me (he makes Neo look good actually). Compared to Black Pearl, the story has even more twists and sub-plots, while the pace of Dead M C is also higher than BP (and I also loved that one). Another great aspect is the return of recognizable characters of the first part with a very pleasant appearance of one of my favorite characters of BP in the last scene (again: IMHO). Depp's performance is great, but other actors also get plenty of screen time to show their class-acting.Definitely my favorite Summer Buster (and I have also seen Superman Returns... but still need to see Miami Vice, which I look forward to).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's mostly fun, but in the end, it'll leave you disappointed.","POTC2-DMC features a lot of nice CGI work, some good one-liners, a lot of action - but it suffers from an incoherent plot and from the fact that it really is just a big teaser for part three. I recommended to my friends and co-workers to skip this one and wait for next year's installment.Yes, Jack Sparrow is back in all his Captain-Jack-Sparrowishness, Davy Jones is well-done and well-played by Bill Nighy - but what is the point of the movie? The quest for the chest is drawn out much too long, too many characters are unnecessarily repeated from the first movie and there are simply too many loose ends left dangling.Dead Man's Chest would've probably been better if it had been trimmed down to two hours. Let's hope that there are improvements in next year's installment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Preserves the mood and even excels at some points.,"This time I did expect a lot from a sequel and for the first time in my recent memory I am totally satisfied and adequately entertained. Come on, ""Dead Man's Chest"" starts off with the same mood and pace the first film left us with. But this film is far more complex in order to deliver something new.First of all, it is just insanely hilarious. Really I didn't expect so much bout of comedy. Yes, a few of the funny scenes are rather forced but the rest are just brilliant... and this comedy mood stayed throughout the film even when suspense and action were full on. Second, the new characters... be it the crew of Jack Sparrow or Davy Jones and his men... are extremely well-designed and well-written. For the actors, Depp's acting this time looked rather forced sometimes as he was trying hard to achieve his Oscar-nominated standard of the character. But face it, in the first film Jack was something unique, here we already know his character and his antics, manner of speech etc. So I think ultimately Depp did a nice job. Keira Knightley has got a more wide and complex role this time but she does little besides delivering her beautiful bullet-like English accent. She falters often with careful emotional sequences. Bloom also hasn't much improved from his previous portrayal of Will Turner.Bill Nighy portrays the infamous Davy Jones with much style. And the make-up and visual effects regarding him and his crew are really worth every praise. The overall special visual and sound effects are top-notch, as expected. Verbinski took special care building the sets and location, as evident by the excellent outdoor scenery and entirely believable and captivating indoor atmospheres like the bars, the dungeons and the tribal area in the river at night.The film has enough amount of action, perhaps too much at some places with the underwater monster. It ends in a rather interesting manner, making you crave for the part 3 to come out. I really enjoyed the ending and its various implications or predictions. To summarize, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best part is the ending,"Admittedly Dead Man's Chest had a lot to live up to. And, as with most highly anticipated sequels it didn't live up to the hype. Overall, it was a fun movie, although I found the story weak and hard to follow until almost the very end of the film. The action sequences were great but sparse for a 2-1/2 hour movie. In my opinion, the special effects used on Davey Jones' crew was over done and unbelievable. The actors' performances were excellent as usual. Johnny Depp was fun and witty although it seemed that his drunken banter was much more limited than in the previous Pirates. Kiera Knightly was incredible and a joy to watch as always, and Orlando Bloom met all expectations as the hero. I have to say I was overall I was disappointed. The best part of the movie is the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A classic cliff hanger!,"I recently commented on the worst summer blockbuster, Superman Returns. Now I'm giving my two cents on the best.Out does the first, which was, visually and performance wise, amazing. Cast is really on point. Plot is a great bridge film between the first and the last but more than holds up on its own.

Good Sequel,"I think this follows on from the first movie well however I don't think it tops it as a movie in general. While there is good elements to it I feel it is slightly too long and I think it could have been cut down slightly.However the movie does follow on with the characters well, keeps the same comedic elements Gibbs proving to be very funny again. Orlando keeps his combat flair which is excellent in this movie.I would especially comment on the use of cgi in the movie. The creation of the character of Davey Jones and his crew on the Flying Dutchman is fantastic. The creepy, realistic looking octopus head with its tentacles and the crewmen's barnacle infested looks really give you the heebie jeebies! This is one of the best elements to the movie along with a fantastic score much like the first!Overall, good solid movie that follows on well from the first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie is a disgrace and I will NOT pay to see the next one!,"There is NO PROPER ENDING TO THE MOVIE! It just STOPS. What kind of idiots release a movie that is INCOMPLETE!!! I will spend hours looking into this and I will determine who had the most control over the concept of NOT FINISHING THE MOVIE and I swear I will NEVER pay to see another movie that that person works on again.When I pay for a movie, I expect to see a beginning, a middle and an ending. I expect EVERY thing in that movie to be tied together and completely resolved before the credits role. This movie did NOTHING but create more questions and scenarios to make you wait and wonder until the next one is released.I for one am completely disgusted by this.In Matrix we were ALL WARNED about the cliffhanger - and the next movie was released within months... I saw no published articles warning about this... and I am completely surprised to be the first person to complain about it online here... Is no one else bothered by this? Speak your mind!I have seen people talk up the soundtrack - - WHAT soundtrack? There are no 'lei motifs' for the characters, (meaning a specific type of music that appears when a character appears... like the famous JAWS music when the shark appears... or the Darth Vader/ imperial march music... etc) there is simply a few scores that repeat themselves with a slight variation as the movie drags on... Certainly not something I would pay for at the local music store.I did not see the spoiler at the end... After 2 hours of the movie I started wondering how they were going to tie in all the loose ends... then the movie just ended... I was so angry I stood up and nearly cursed the screen!! It was all I could do to smile at my nephew and ask him how he liked it as we left the theater at as fast a pace as I could set!This movie gets a 1 out of 10 because no matter how good the special effects are, the ending (or lack of one) ruined it for me. I will never watch it again.Pirates, Disney, Gore Verbinski,Ted Elliott,Terry Rossio and whoever else may have had a hand in NOT COMPLETING this movie - you should be ashamed of yourself for your lack of vision! -One extremely unhappy person.Brian",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp Camp as a Lady's Hairdresser,"Yes I do not mind admitting that I saw this film. It was very good to be fair, maybe not as good as all of the hype but worth a trip to the cinema nevertheless. I would also consider buying the DVD if it is fairly priced.I would not recommend it to anyone who does not know the first film. I think you would have to want to see this film to enjoy it, i.e. someone shown it who does not know what to expect would find it odd.

Summer of '06 has turned out very good for cinephiles,"I had a great time with X3, Da Vinci Code, A Scanner Darkly, and Click so far this summer but just when I thought there would be a drought in the middle of summer, along comes Pirates which makes a splash into cinemas and bring forth a tidal wave of...Okay, enough with the puns. This movie was great, plain and simple. Even better than the original, in my opinion. And I didn't even like the original that much, I just saw it for Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly (yow!). But this time, there's a lot more to see than good ol' Johnny and Keira.Yup, a lot more.First off, the story pacing is a lot slower and steady. Something I loved very much. We explore the changes in character with Elizabeth, Will, and Jack even more (with two new recruits as the comic reliefs), with bits of comedy and incredible action here and there. While I thought the Skeleton Barbossa from the original was okay, the new one (the squid-like Davy Jones) actually felt pretty intimidating and incredibly 'wow' to look at. The same goes for the rest of the crew, the makeup effects are incredibly top notch.The movie takes its time in telling the story, letting you soak into the characters and beautiful scenery. Gore and his team have a good eye, through realistic landscapes, makeup, and even with CGI (which is rare nowdays for people who heavily abuse CG).The music seems a little better too, Hans Zimmer seems to carry the soundtrack on with more of an epic beat this time (and doesn't let it drag like it did in the original). The Pirates' theme sounds a lot more ""adventerous"" this time, the new beat really helps enhance the movie even further than I could've imagined.The action was one of the things that surprised me the most. They somehow managed to top themselves every time a major action scene comes up. The over the top sword fights, the ship battles, the bar fight...every single one of them was great and better than the last.Not a whole lot more to say that's not spoilerific other than...you have to see this movie! NOW!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doubles Down on Spectacle,"Sometimes it's really hard to see past a film's flaws. For whatever reason though, I really get a kick out of these Pirates adventures. Whether it be because I had fond memories of them when I was much younger, or because there just wasn't quite a spectacle like them in the mid-2000's, either way I still find Dead Man's Chest to be an admirable part of the franchise.I'm not sure there will ever be a Pirates film as good as the first one. There's nothing quite like that first adventure with Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. And Dead Man's Chest wastes no time trying to top the spectacle and scope of that film. However, when the story and characters are second fiddle to the set pieces and grand action sequences, that's where you have the problem. In many ways, this film only exists to set up the third film. Most of the story beats are drawn out in what could be only one film's worth of story, but we don't get the payoff for any of it until the 3rd adventure. That's not necessarily always a bad thing, but I would have preferred each film to stand on its own a little bit more.Although we don't get Geoffrey Rush's maniacal Captain Barbossa, we are treated with equally invested performances from Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard as Boostrap Bill. Jones', the main antagonist, is essentially a supernatural pirate with the ability to also control a large sea creature called, the Kraken. If you thought the original film takes advantage of the over-the-top side to the series, the second one doubles down. Luckily, Nighy is an absolute joy to watch on screen, thanks in large part due to the groundbreaking special effects of Jones & various other characters and creatures.Much like the first film, Dead Man's Chest is a bit overlong and has too many moving parts. It worked with the first film because the script, directing, and performances were all brilliant. I think some of the magic wore off here because you definitely feel the length. But there's no denying the entertainment value if you enjoyed the first outing. The ridiculousness continues to an island of indigenous people wanting Jack Sparrow and subsequently a dog to be their ruler, a wheel barrow sword fight that goes on for like 15 minutes, and one great cliffhanger. I know they're silly, but I always manage to have a blast re-watching them.+Doubles down on ridiculous action+Mind-blowing special effects+Cliffhanger-Lengthy & too goofy at times7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Did you love part one? Well, you'll like this one.","You have probably all seen the first film and loved it, like all normal people did, but if you read this, there's a 50% chance you're wondering ""but what's the deal with Pirates 2?"". Well, in short, part 1 was brilliant, part 2 is pretty great.It doesn't happen very often that I love a film from the first time I see it, but Pirates of the Caribbean was one of them. I fell in love with it from the start. But, part two (and three) were announced, and the people among us that love films know that sequels can really ruin it. I'm a very difficult guy to please with films (and pretty much anything else), so I think there should be some credibility when I say they did an OK job.If The Curse of the Black Pearl deserved a 9, I rate this one 7,5. Still a very good score, if you ask me. But why is there 1.5 points difference, well several reasons. Dead Man's Chest is a bit less mature, or a bit more Hollywood than The Curse of the Black Pearl.The use of fantasy has increased. Part one had unrealistic elements, but part two stretches to fantasy (of which the CGI has definitely improved since part one, may I add). Speaking of stretching, the story is all stretched out. While I have no real problems with the duration because I enjoy it so much, it could've easily been cut 20 minutes shorter. Especially considering the story doesn't end in this one. But there is still some good writing at times, and even though it's not as captivating as part one, you'll still enjoy it. They tried to make it seem like the story was meant to continue, and they succeeded in making it seem like that.The jokes are more obvious and if you compare it to part one, they could bother you. Because a lot of small jokes are surrealistic things. Things that would never happen in real life. I won't give any examples, because I don't want to spoil. But Jack as well, you might sometimes get the feeling they're overdoing him. I did have that feeling once or twice. But it's still Jack Sparrow, and you'll still love him. They haven't fked him up, don't worry. And there's another character, Davy Jones. If you are familiar with Bill Nighy's strange ways, you'll know that he fits in this film and is a lovable character as well.One last thing I'd like to mention is the ending of the film. You will probably not like it, I warn you. But let's hope for part three to make it all up.So, people who hate this one just have to get over it. It's still an enjoyable entertaining film, just see it for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Very Disappointing,"I saw the first Pirates movie, and liked it very much. In fact, I own it. This one was terrible! The movie just drags and drags.

The comic relief is decent, and the lead acting is good, but overall, the film left me very disappointed. The CGI is very well done for the most part, but the plot is just too boring and predictable to be considered interesting. This film didn't feel quite as exciting as the first film. While I understand that it is a Disney production, this film felt a bit more simple and childish than the first.

Underrated classic.,"Most people who are fans of the Pirates of the Caribbean films like this film, but I've always thought of it as the best installment in the franchise. In terms of story, mythology, villains and protagonists; this film is better. The film isn't afraid to go dark and at a few spots it almost feels like a horror movie, but it also understands when not to take itself 100% serious.A common complaint that I hear about the film is that it has too much going on and that it doesn't succeed with every element of the story, I disagree. It's telling a bigger story that the original, and for that to work they split the story up into multiple sub-plots that all come together in the end for a well set-up final fight with a lot of tension and suspense. The third one does the same thing, but it doesn't work as well there.I've loved this film ever since I first saw it and it's one of those few movies that no matter how many times I watch it, I can never grow tired of it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"""Something I was definitely not expecting""","I am a Pirates fanatic...I can repeat the whole first movie. When the second installments trailers came out I made sure that I watched them like crazy...memorizing the lines. I have been counting down the days to the movie for the past two years and was very angry when I wasn't able to go to the premiere in Disney Land. I had a HUGE party honoring the second movie on the sixth and saw the midnight show. I was definitely not disappointed. However I wasn't too surprised either...I had read the book, watched trailers, read whatever I could that was supposedly ""the script""...although I was defiantly not expecting the ending. The cliffhanger will definitely keep me wondering. The humor and the intensity of this film is enough to keep watchers at the end of their seats. I've seen this movie every day since midnight on Thursday and plan on seeing it everyday until it is out of theaters. If you loved the first movie then you will think that 'Dead Man's Chest' is much better! Johnny, Orlando, and Keira do a great job in portraying their roles and always have and will I am sure. Verbinski is a pure genius and so are the writers of the film. Their job I'm sure is very stressful but in the end they pulled off a movie that is WAY to good for words.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"Talk about a change in tone. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest takes everything good about the first film and amps it up. Not only are the stakes higher, so are the challenges that our heroes face. Be it from the enemy outside, or the internal struggle between right and wrong.What becomes apparent from the very start is a sense of direction. The first film, while a tremendous success, felt in many ways like a test. No one knew if people would like a comedic action film about pirates. Curse of the Black Pearl was much smaller in scale, and importantly, had it not been successful, it would've always worked as a standalone. Despite its enormous success, I do applaud Disney and Verbinski (director) for the audacity of creating a sequel that needs a companion movie. While Dead Man's Chest could, weirdly enough, be its own thing, it ultimately leaves the story wide open. Although it was a big risk, it's clear that it paid off. However, had this film not been as wonderful as it was, I doubt how successful this plan would've been. So, what then makes Dead Man's Chest so good?
As already briefly mentioned, it's the change in tone. This second instalment is much darker, much bigger, and much, much more ambitious.A testament to the much darker tone is an example from the very first minutes. A dark and grimy prison, where some of the prisoners who have been left in cages outside have their eyes pecked out by crows. And no, it's not just implied, it's actually shown. It was that scene, despite its insignificance, that set the tone for what was to come. And boy was there a lot to come. As mentioned, Dead Man's Chest took everything that worked in Curse of the Black Pearl and turned it up a notch. The action sequences are much improved, both in the way they look and how they feel. They encompass a whole new sense of grandeur in their scale. That is of course helped by the new and improved villains captained by the infamous Davy Jones. He and his whole crew are simply spectacular. The combination of practical effects and surprisingly good CGI make for an exciting and ghastly feeling bunch. While they aren't immortal, like the villainous crew in the previous film, they feel significantly more frightening. Add to that the Kraken that Davy Jones wields, and you have yourself an opponent that even the mighty Jack Sparrow might not be able to best. Indeed, it's partly thanks to the new and improved sense of dread, and partly to the stakes that are also much higher, that this film succeeds even better at its goal than it's predecessor. That is, providing a tense and entertaining bit of cinema, that makes you want to return for the sequel.However, despite all that, there are still hints of the problem that The Curse of the Black Pearl faced. What I'm talking about are some of the scenes that feel a tad too long. Although there aren't nearly as many of them in this one, there are quite a few sequences that feel a little redundant and stretched out, and it begs the question, should they have even been there in the first place. Regardless, these problems are far and apart, the biggest problem that Dead Man's Chest has is that it isn't a proper film on its own. The story in it doesn't get any closure, it leaves an endless number of questions unanswered, and ultimately, it requires for its sequel to be seen. While that is not a problem, of course, especially now that they are all on Disney+, I do have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of films that make you watch another film, so that they work. While some other films, most notably Lord of the Rings and the last two parts of Harry Potter, do the same thing, at least they had a source material to go by and justify the decision. In the case of Pirates of the Caribbean, though, there is really no excuse for it, apart from hoping that people will feel the need to return for the next part and create revenue. But alas, I can't stay too mad. This film, like the one before it, is great fun. In fact, as far as the film itself goes, I think I slightly preferred Dead Man's Chest. I just wish that it had wrapped up at least some of the loose ends.With all that being said, I happily look forward to watching the last part of this original trilogy. There is something special to be cherished in these films. It could just be the nostalgia speaking, but I honestly feel that movies like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and others in the series aren't made anymore. They have a wonderful sense of carefreeness and an endless yearning for fun and adventure. Not only do they provide a great time, but they also make me wish that I could be there alongside Jack, Will, Elizabeth and the rest of the crew.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

if only all sequels were so entertaining,"if all sequels were as fun as this one, then we wouldn't mind having more around.

THe story was well told and even though you were a little confused in the beginning, it ended up to develop beautifully. Johnny Depp was magnificent and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen when he played. Orlando Bloom did a very good job as Will Turner and he gave the character more depth and mystery, than he did on the first film. Keira Knightly played her part very good, even though the difference between Elizabeth in the first film and Elizabeth in the second one is evident from the beginning. The other characters completed the puzzle, each giving a little something so as to make the movie wonderful. Stellan Scarsgard forced you to look at him, every time he appeared on screen as Will's father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner and Bill Nighy was the most sinister Davy Jones, that made you wonder if his appearance was truly digital, or if he was somehow real. The next best thing were the special effects that were even better than the ones in the first film. But the cliffhanger in the ending was the cherry on the cake.

"""I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.""","The follow-up chapter to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl might appear inferior in content & a step-down in quality of narration but it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that presents significant upgrades in many aspects, takes the spectacle of the first film to a higher level and despite a few hiccups remains a highly entertaining & amusing ride for the most part.The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Dead Man's Chest continues the journey of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as he's reminded of the debt he owes to Davy Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, and then races against time to steal Jones' heart in order to strike a bargain with him. But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, most impressive part of it being the sea monster Kraken as well as the convincing portrait of Davy Jones.Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, who happens to be a strange mix of aquatic flora & fauna.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing to the story. More epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is definitely a fun experience that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent 2nd in a trilogy!!,"This movie was excellent!!In my opinion it's better than the first movie,though only by a little.The animation was superb,especially the sea creatures,Davy Jones and the Kracken.The story was nothing short of amazing g with a terrific ending.The acting was once again terrific.Even though there was less interaction between the main characters.Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy delivered excellent performances.DMC was also funnier than COBP with superb lines from Johnny Depp.And the sword fighting sequence was probably the greatest sword fight in movie history.My only hope is that POTC:At World's End will be even greater and offer more surprises.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates does it again!,"Five words...BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR..I can't lie to u,Deads man chest is proablly one of the top movies I could literally say that had me glued to the edge of my seat.Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the best movie characters created of all time.I never had that much fun watching a movie.With a couple slow parts here and there,which u don't mind,Pirates 2 has Jammmed packed action,laughs,and fun.The twists also keep your head ruin.I didn't even want to leave the theater.The saga itself is great,and i cant wait to see where they take it.Some peolpe might not want to see the saga go on cause they would feel it might ruin the first.But watching the second it bascilly reasures the fans that Pirates is to great of a movie to only make 2 or 3.Pirates 2 steps outside of the box of what regular movies we see now.Its the type of movie that you enjoy with the family and just have fun.This is how movies should be created.So like i said Pirates does it again....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"In my opinion, a rare sequel that equals the original","I struggle to comprehend why this film is so much less loved than the original. I find myself enjoying it even more than ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" at moments.I've said this before, but the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are insanely fun and exciting adventure films, but they are also surprisingly subversive and thought-provoking. You can enjoy them equally with your brain turned off, or your brain dialed up to 11.This film takes everything that is wonderful about the first film, while further deepening and exploring the themes. I feel that Lord Beckett, as a villain, is genuinely such a sly commentary on the human urge to control and dominate nature and the world as a whole. He's smug, powerful, and a wonderfully hateable villain. His presence in this movie, I feel, furthers the ideas presented by the ""Pirates"" movies: that authority is not always right, and that being a good and noble person sometimes exists outside of the mainstream.Yet this movie further complicates these themes by giving each of the characters (including the once-idealistic Will and Elizabeth) complicated motives and conflicting agendas. It really makes me think about how the world, and society, breaks down individuals to commit such acts of ""piracy"" when at the core they're just trying to protect the ones they love.You can say I'm reading too much into it-I say otherwise. As I said, the beauty of the original ""Pirates"" trilogy is that you can enjoy it both mindlessly and mindfully.Beyond the thematic exploration, I think ""Dead Man's Chest"" is still just as fun and ridiculous as its predecessor-if not moreso. Everything from the action sequences on the islands to the fight at the ruined windmill is just so much fun, so badass. Aesthetically as well, I think this movie is so pleasing. Davy Jones and his crew are such creepy, skin-crawling characters, and surprisingly, their special effects still hold up to this day. Moreover, this film is perhaps one of Disney's darkest films ever (which, granted, isn't saying much); I find myself surprised each time I rewatch it at just how violent it is; I kind of doubt Disney would have the guts to be so brutally violent with their films in recent years.Overall, I find myself enjoying this movie just as much as the original, I probably have seen it more times as well. It's just so damn fun, hilarious, emotional, and thoughtful. Another near-perfect film in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Do you fear sequels?,"It takes a while for 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)' to come together but, once it does, it's an enjoyable adventure that maintains the spirit of its superior predecessor. Depp continues his tightrope walk of a performance but he isn't quite as sure-footed as before. His character is even more selfish, basing his relationships entirely on a series of double-crosses and triple-crosses so that he can come out on top. He does have an arc that sees him, essentially, admit that he really does care for his pirating buddies, but by the time it's complete it's almost too little too late. This makes him less empathetic and, combined with his ever-so-slightly annoying mannerisms (which are accentuated through the actual screenplay this time), creates a less compelling character than you'd expect. The villain this time is Nighy's Davy Jones - an impressive, entirely digital character - who hunts our hero for the hundred years of service he owes and somehow manages to add an extra vowel to every other word. He's a good baddie, suitably callous and commanding, but he can't compete with the previous entry's Barbossa. The plot is sprawling and sporadic, featuring less swashbuckling than its predecessor and relying on the fact that it is, in essence, 'part one'. Indeed, the narrative doesn't actually complete itself in a satisfying way; it just sort of ends, with the denouement being dedicated entirely to cheap sequel bait. Still, the story is entertaining and the set-pieces are well-conceived. The stand-out is clearly an extended sabre duel between three of the focal characters, which starts on a beach and ends on a rampaging, ever-spinning wheel. The thing does a brilliant job of keeping track of its characters, with everyone's position and motive being clear at all times. This is as important in the action as it is in the set-up, which sees most of the core cast separated. By the time everyone comes together, the movie is in full swing and it's a fair bit of fun. It doesn't match the quality of the first film in the series, but it's a decent continuation and a good time in its own right. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Exciting!,"Dead Man's Chest is a great sequel movie,but I didn't enjoyed as the first.

Pirates 2/3 Sucked,"OK first of all apparently there are going to be three movies, but they forgot to mention that to anyone. I sure didn't know that going into the movie theater. I was expecting them to wrap up all the plot lines, but no they couldn't do that.You spend 2.5 hours in the watching the thing to find discover that not only did they wrap up any of the plot lines they started in this movie, they create more bogus plot lines that we have to assume will be wrapped up in the 3rd movie. Its leaves you unsatisfactory feeling of why did I just spend $20 to go see this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.The entire movie was just filler material so they could make Pirates 3, which I am _not_ going to go see in the theater after this debacle.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Effects are incredible here!,"Going back to Dead man's Chest it did not hold up as well as I thought. It´s still a good time and highly entertaining but it has some glaring issues that it needs to overcome before you can just sit back and enjoy. There is a lot of moving parts and it´s actually the lesser sums of those parts that works. The big cog in the machine is a rusty barley turning one, but all the small ones around work fine and even great and that makes it still entertaining to look at. A story that wants a bit too much surrounded by fun action and comedy, it works.Captain Jack Sparrow is on a quest to find a key, a key held by the legendary Davy Jones. Meanwhile Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are trying to apace the law by obtaining Jacks compass.Where this movie falls apart a bit is the many things it wants to do. This is clearly a set up part one movie and it needs to introduce the many players in the game and what they have at stake. That is a lot to do and if you have watched the third movie you know that went okay on some levels and not so great on others. There is a lot of plot treads that feels dragged out and the first half of this movie is just an incoherent mess. After we escape the island, we are treated to a more coherent story that is just a fun adventure movie. This makes the movie defiantly watchable and actually enjoyable.The effects here are incredible! Davy Jones looks so transformed and till this day looks great. The many movements and elements on him still looks so good in different lightings and clearly a lot of detail went into that Mold. This together with the rest of his crew that also looks incredible makes the effects a stand out here. I must say though, a lot more greenscreen was apparent to me here. There are so many backgrounds and moving scenes where it´s clear we are in a studio and that sucks when so much more care was put into the rest of the special effects.The practical aspects are good too. The ships and sets looks great, the costumes, this is still and incredible practical movie that looks so great all the way through. It is still though a bit obvious at times we are in a controlled pool or ocean of water. There are just a bit too many ""perfect"" looking shots for it to be real ship circumstances.The performances here are incredible. We have so many stand out performances that sells this movie and it´s world. Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow, giving a incredible fun performance. He is the heart of this franchise and seeing him back here is so great. His comedy, facial acting and physical acting sells every scene he is in and he quickly outshines whoever is on screen. My only complaint is that he seems like a side character in this story that should be half about him. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones delivers an incredible villain performance. Such a distinct character that at the same time is so complex. Emotional, evil and cocky all of these delivered with such an unique flare by Nighy. Stellan Skarsgård makes such a good and emotional performance here to as a side character, that will play into the bigger narrative later. I must say though, Will Turner can´t sell the comedy of this movie. This is a ridicules movies with ridicules people doing ridicules things, he is playing it a bit too dramatic for a movie like this. Everyone else can sell the corny tone, but he falls flat here.The scope of the story is great and I like the idea of the adventure. All the building blocks for a great adventure are here just not executed to its fully. It´s very good and has some great stakes for the characters and we see that to its fully here.There are some different accepts of the movie that works and some did not. The comedy is great here and it lands pretty much every time. Depp insures that the humour stays great for the duration of the movie. The romance here fells so weak and I did not understand the triangle that had to be made. It feels highly unnecessary and maybe even a studio note somehow. The action is fun here, done well but needed a bit more emphasis on it in terms of cinematography to really make it land.Dead man's chest is a fun movie all the way through. Even its weaker start and accepts are tuned up by its greater aspects and that makes it just an enjoyable adventure. The comedy, action and fun characters makes you want to stay along for a ride that has some bumps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dead Man 's Chest is a typical sequel,"Dead Man 's Chest is a typical sequel. It turned out to be much weaker than the original. In it of course action scenes are brought to a new level, CGI for 2006 is generally magnificent, even in 2020 looks worthy.

Pay full price and be prepared for 2+ hours of movie magic.,"Although the start of the movie may be a bit slow for some I think it helps to tie it together. My wife and I and our daughter (35 and due with our 3rd Grandchild any day) really really liked the movie. It is not just a rehash of the first. The Davey Jones character is very inventive and portrayed wonderfully by Bill Nighy. This is the kind of movie I go to the theater to see. Definitely big screen, big sound. I like to get lost for a few hours and this movie certainly does the trick. It is a bit much for young kids though so I would definitely heed the PG-13 rating. I ended up seeing the first POTC 4 times in the theater taking family and friends who where reluctant at first to see it. I am sure I will be going at least that many times again with this installment. If you are looking for a movie that makes you ponder the nature of the universe and why we are here this is not the movie for you. If you want to be whisked away in fantasy mayhem then climb aboard for the ride. Kudos to the entire cast and crew.

"If you enjoyed the first, you will most likely enjoy this.","If you enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" then you will enjoy the sequel just as much. This had everything that made the first one enjoyable. There is amazing sword fight/action sequences, creepy bad people created with incredible special effects, romance, humor, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow.Captain Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davy Jones. The deal was for Jack to be captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years, then give up his sole and become a crew member of the Flying Dutchman. Those thirteen years are up, and Davy Jones is after Jack Sparrow. Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann are also on the lookout as well. After being arrested by the British government for aiding in the escape of Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are blackmailed into helping track down Jack. Lord Cutler Beckett forces them to find Sparrow and obtain a magical compass from him in exchange for pardons.There were many similarities to ""Empire Strikes Back."" This is darker compared to the first film, just as ""Empire Strikes Back"" was to ""A New Hope."" Captain Jack Sparrow has that classic Han Solo type feel, Will Turner is a lot like Luke, and even Elizabeth Swann has a similar feel to Leia. Even Ragetti, tall and skinny, and Pintel, short and round, are back and have some comedic roles, just like R2D2 and C3P0. There is a cliffhanger, which will catch most people by surprise, much like ""Empire Strikes Back"" did.Once again, there is a great villain. Davy Jones was a better villain then Captain Barbossa. What made him better was that Davy Jones a more multi-dimension character then Barbossa. Barbossa was just pure evil. At least once did you think that Davy Jones had a passionate side, but then the next scene he would do something totally brutal and evil. Davy Jones is sure to become a classic villain.The special and visual effects, once again, are top notch. From the look of Davy Jones to his henchman, it was spectacular. Davy Jones was created the same way that Gollum/Smeagol was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Some of the special effects used to make his tentacles are possibly the best use of CGI ever shown on screen. Davy Jones and his crew all looked like creatures from the sea. Davy Jones' main defense, which he summons to destroy ships, was the Kracken, a giant tentacled beast with a toothy throat similar to the fictional creature called a Sarlacc from ""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi."" Just like in the first movie, you should expect some major sword fights, and those fights are improved.A ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie cannot be reviewed without mentioning Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Once again, the rum loving pirate steals the show and shows that his character is the coolest character since Hans Solo in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. His introduction was humorous, but not as memorable as the first one. Hopefully, Johnny Depp is once again nominated for best actor. It will be exciting to see him and Keith Richards, who was Johnny's inspiration for Jack Sparrow, on the screen together. In case you did not know, there will be a third movie and Keith Richards will be playing Jack Sparrow's father.Some of the side characters we all knew and loved are back, such as Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce), Pintel (played by Lee Arenberg), Ragetti (played by Mackenzie Crook), Mr. Gibbs (played by Kevin McNally), and Marty (played by Martin Klebba). Those people got the same amount of screen time. Norington (played by Jack Davenport) has received a bigger, more in depth role. Orlando Bloom (who plays Will Turner) has shown a little improvement and has improved quite a bit since he donned bows and arrows in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Keira Knightley (who plays Elisabeth Swann) has also added a little bit more to her character.The new additions are also well done. ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (played by Stellan Skarguard), Will Turner's father, is finally introduced and he had very nice chemistry with Will. Another interesting character was a woman named Tia Dalma (played by Naomie Harris). She was very strange and was possibly even weirder (maybe just more mysterious and unknown) then Jack. Maybe they will explain more about her back-story in the next chapter. Of course, we know about Davy Jones (played by Bill Nighy).If you are looking for the perfect summer popcorn movie, you are in the right place. This was just as enjoyable as the first movie. This is must see on the big screen and hopefully you do not forget to leave until after the credits. Bring your family, bring your friends, and do not forget to start singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirates life for me."" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is very recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Comparative Look at the Pirates Series - Part 2: Dead Man's Chest,"The second entry in the series returns to the world of pirates in a bold new way.It is still an Adventure film in many ways, but I think this and the next in the series is far more in the realm of Fantasy. Dead Man's Chest brings back the characters that we were introduced to in the first film, and many new ones to add more depth to the 'Pirates' world.At the beginning of the film we return to the island where William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann have recently started their life together. Very early on, their relationship is threatened by a new and much more human villain. Under the employ of the East India Trading Company, a man by the name of Cutler Beckett uses his financial and political clout to arrest both William and Elizabeth for their acts of piracy in the first film. He uses this to manipulate William to hunt down Jack Sparrow and bring him to justice. Jack hasn't changed much since the first film. When we are introduced to him, he is literally escaping what looks like hell, and he does so with such ease that he makes it look like fun. In addition we are introduced to another new villain, Davy Jones (fantastically played by Bill Nighy) who is consumed by an immortal quest to sail the seas and collect the souls of the dead to spend 100 years aboard his ship in service. Personally, I think he is my favourite personality throughout the series, if not just for the facial expressions he (and the FX team) managed to portray through the digital design of the character.This movie and its sequel serve a much larger portion of plot to the viewer. Dead Man's Chest serves as the middle story for the original trilogy of films. There is a definite negative undertone throughout as each character goes through their own trials and alliances are tested. It becomes quite obvious that each person will play their part and betrayal is the main theme of this movie. Despite the fondness William may have for Jack, they are pitted against each other. Elizabeth finds herself in a position of power for the first time and must use it to manipulate Jack to her own ends. And of course the villains of the film pulling the strings to achieve their own ends.This entry is probably the darkest in tone, and certainly has an undertone of death to it. The fight scenes are certainly aggressively violent for a Disney movie, but I think it was essential for this adventure. It is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the series, and so; ends with a cliff-hanger as expected. It maintains that level of excitement throughout and plays an important role in the series, although perhaps not as lighthearted and fun as the original.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great fun, not without its flaws","Middle installments of trilogies often tend to suffer, especially when the original was not necessarily made with a sequel in mind. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Put ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on the opposite side of the sequel coin to ""Matrix Reloaded"" - there most decidedly IS a precedent for second films emerging from the shadows of their predecessors.Thus my hopes when I went in to see ""Dead Man's Chest"" were reasonably high. The fact that all of the original cast had returned, along with quality additions like Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy, only buoyed my optimism. And surely Johnny Depp wouldn't have let himself be pulled into any old crap, contractual obligation or no.Like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this is a considerably darker affair than the all out fun of the original. The themes dealt with here are more somber - betrayals and double crossings are commonplace even among the good guys, and issues of mortality dealt with by Davey Jones and his crew make them far more frightening than the villains of the original - indeed, Barbossa and his men look almost cartoonish by comparison. There are some real scares here, and this is definitely not a film that I'd recommend to parents with young children, bladder busting running time aside.Not to say its all gloom and doom. Definitely not. The visual effects are virtually flawless, and the action set pieces - particularly a three way sword fight between Jack, Will and Norrington while Elizabeth throws a temper tantrum (not to mention rocks) on the sidelines is fantastic. The script is great, not only containing a good measure of great one liners (of which Captain Jack predictably gets the lion's share) but also real deepening of relationships between the characters. Jack and Elizabeth in particular. Ragetti and Pintel are great fun, trading on their great rapport like they did in the original, and Norrington finally gets to be something other than a ""prat in a wig"" (as the lovably self deprecating Jack Davenport described himself in a magazine interview).Inevitably, it lacks the freshness and the ""wow"" factor of the original. But there's nothing the filmmakers could have done to avoid that. Because, lets face it, nobody expected the original to be as successful as it was. A Disney flick based on a theme park ride starring Edward Scissorhands, Legolas and the skinny chick from ""Bend it Like Beckham""? Who knew? Pleasingly, though, there's no sense of anybody resting on their laurels - in particular I had dreaded Jack's antics skirting into caricature territory but Depp is, of course, far too ""savvy"" an actor to fall into that trap.The ending, like that of ""Back to the Future Part II"", is predictably a cliffhanger ensuring that everybody and their dog (or monkey) will drag themselves back to see part three, but oddly the feeling of being manipulated is somehow all part of the fun. And if part three is even anywhere near the quality of part two....we're in for an awesome ride...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Overblown but Still A Lot of Fun,"It starts off knowingly acknowledging the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean and Jack Sparrow have become pop culture phenomenons in the years since the release of the first movie. It's a bit jarring, and watching it now after the fervor surrounding the series has died down certainly makes the winking more distracting than amusing. That quickly goes away though, and we're whisked away into a story that is all over the map, a tone that less elegantly dances between slapstick humor and grand adventure than the first movie, and a Jack Sparrow that no longer feels fresh.Still, there's no denying that many of the set-pieces here are pretty astounding, especially for how they're handled simultaneously. I love the Kraken attacks, even if they go to that well maybe one too many times. The organ playing while the ship cracks in half is a great, epic moment. Then there's Davy Jones, a CGI creation that still looks great a decade later and Bill Nighy's performance which manages to feel human.I think this one was my favorite when I used to watch these when I was younger. It's definitely the movie I where I developed a crush on Keira Knightley.

Not A Patch On The First Movie,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to his first sequel (not counting his 19 seconds in Freddy's Dead) Pirates Of The Carribean: Dead Man's Chest.Because the first movie made so much money, it was inevitable we would get a sequel. It was also linevitable the sequel would be of inferior quality. The filmmakers decided to make two further instalments back-to-back. Since Empire Strikes Back, every film maker with an eye on a trilogy feels that the second movie must be darker than the first movie.Dead Man's Chest is full of plot holes, inexplicable character actions and is not half as much fun as its predecessor. Pacing is a huge problem, the movie slogs through about hour of set-up before launching into its main story. For what is pretty much just a simple quest movie: find the key and chest, and use one to open the other, for the next 90 minutes.I find it hard to figure how a movie with the central character of Captain Jack Sparrow could ever be anything but fun. Depp is in top form again, making Captain Jack the most dashing scoundrel since Han Solo (there is more than one similarity with Solo and his character arc).Kiera Knightley is a bit more than the obligatory love interest she was in the first movie. This one takes Elizabeth's romantic life in an unexpected direction, as sparks fly between her and Jack (Even if she does not want to admit it) Knightley and Depp have decent chemistry. Knightley and Orlando Bloom do not. They are a much more interesting coupleOrlando Bloom's Will is not much more than he was in the first movie, the dashing hero. Bloom is more than ok, but he is often overshadowed by Depp and Knightley. Davy Jones represents a creepy villain (great CGI), Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport both return, as do the comedic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as pirate versions of C3PO and R2D2. Yes, I know, another Star Wars nod.The slow, uneven beginning is not really compensated for by the climax, which drags on about twenty minutes too long, with one scene after another, just leaving you feeling blah as it drags to the end credits. It's a common problem in movies these days, as the movie makers are more interested in putting scenes in movies, to put things in place for the next instalment rather than concentrating on one solid instalment. There were no further movies planned (though I'm sure Disney had hopes of a franchise) when the first movie was made, and it's to the movie's benefit.Despite being nowhere near as fun or fresh as the first movie POTC: Dead Mans Chest grossed $423 million at the domestic box office to become the highest-grossing movie of 2006. Making it Depp's highest grossing and best performing movie.For a time, this movie also held the box-office record for the highest opening weekend with $135,634,554 dollars earned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'm as surprised as everybody else: I loved it,"I was really concerned when I went to see this movie last night (midnight showing) that I wasn't going to like it at all. All the critics had panned it and other people's reviews I had read did not give compelling reasons for liking it.However, it turned out that this movie is waaaaay better than the critics claim. It's only drawback is that it is long and a few scenes could have been worked out. Despite this, I loved the action sequences and I didn't at all find the plot to be razor thin by any means. What I think this movie is suffering from is critic's bologna. These are the same people who claimed Spider-Man 2 was the greatest superhero movie ever made. It's great but not the best (in fact I got kinda bored through it). The point being that since they hold that sequel to such a high standard they have since panned all other attempts by other franchises.The plot to POTC:DMC is actually quite similar to the first in scope and execution but it is no way a repeat. Gore Verbinski does a great job again at the helm of direction and the music by Hans Zimmer goes very well with the action sequences. And the ending is a nice set up to the third movie due out next year. I was not ""overstimulated"" as one critic has put it and I never found any of the returning main characters to be annoying or less than what they were before. I think actually that Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is much more real character now than she was in the first. I honestly believed this time that she was more than just a pretty governor's daughter.My advice: definitely go see it. The critics have no idea what they're talking about. I think I might even like this one more than the first, which is saying a lot since I loved the first one a great deal.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A sequel is always going to be harder to follow (unless its Lord of the Rings),"Pirates does well do add an interesting story line in Dead Man's Chest, but it was always going to struggle to be better than the Curse of the Black Pearl. This story got a bit more outrageous and over the top. With Jack becoming the King/Chieftain of a whole village on a remote island, to some exaggerated action scenes with the pirates swinging in a giant ball and climbing up the cliff or the giant wheel battle. Although it does stick out in my mind as entertaining and memorable. But just a bit over the top. The characters all return in good strength, and the movie is enjoyable, not enough to get me fizzed and watch every movie in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
so cool,"This film is the best in this series for me. I watch this series sometimes when I have nothing to do. Johnny Depp is the hero. His performance is good and unique. He often acts the role of person which is crazy or looks addle-brained. I like his acting which despise somebody. But in serious scene he is always cool. The story is simple and we can understand it easily. And this film has many funny scene. The enemy is scared with the figure of monsters for children, but I think there are more scenes that are more interesting than the serious scene. I do not get tired even if long. Everybody enjoy watching it. The figure of monsters is made by the CG effect. It is very fantastic. It will be one of the factors that this movie is splendid. If you like action movie, you should watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Inept,"This film is a disaster.

"Alright, but feels held back by a few inconsistencies","I checked out the midnight screening of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with mixed anticipation. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first film, and seriously consider it as one of the most recently released films that actually felt like it was made just to be fun. It was an obvious risky gamble as a film, and it paid off for Disney. As could be expected, two sequels were greenlit, and filmed back-to-back. And as one of the key highly anticipated films of the summer, it has some mighty shoes to fill. And understandably, there are mixed results.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) are about to get married. Unfortunately, the newly appointed Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has other plans. They are placed under arrest for aiding and abetting felon Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), and are told that their penalty will be death. Meanwhile, Jack, after a great intro, is informed that he has to pay an owed debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), and is now a marked man.Revealing anything else would just give away some of the intriguing subplots, and the useless boring ones. Some elements felt a bit half-baked, but of course, will sound and feel a lot more developed come At World's End next summer. The script seems fairly well formulated, but it feels like they went heavy on story here, and cut back on the comedy and action that made the first film so much fun. There is plenty of it to go around of course, but it just feels totally lessened down in comparison to the first film. Another element missing here is a lack of character development. A few crazy developments do happen, but the characters really do not change at all throughout the film. Again, something that may be fixed in the next film, but nonetheless feels awkward here. One thing they did not bother changing from the first film was the intensely long running time. In fact, it's even longer. The editing feels a lot sharper as opposed to the original film, but there is still quite a bit of dialogue and useless add-ons that could have been excised.Although not at the forefront of attention this time around, Depp still has the right amount of flavour to pull off Jack Sparrow. His performance in the original film was flawless, and he just continues his fabulous Oscar-nominated role here. As said though, he does take more of a supporting role here as opposed to Bloom and Knightely. Bloom does great again as Will Turner, and while nowhere near as stunningly superb as Depp, he puts in another fine performance for what is arguably his short career's best character. Knightely is alright here, but she looks and feels a bit distracted for the most part. She does not have the genuine independence or the spunk that her character had in the original film. Her character instead feels a lot more static and uneven in comparison to the other two.Jack Davenport pulls in a great continued supporting turn as the conniving Norrington, as does Kevin McNally as first mate Gibbs. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, although they could have done with a little bit less screen time, do great as the comedic pirate duo of Pintel and Ragetti. They were shining parts in the original film, and despite feeling overused, do very well here too. And although they only skimmed the surface of their characters, Nighy's Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgård's 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (who was only mentioned briefly in the original film) are great additions to the cast. The only thing they would have benefited from, was more screen time. I can only hope they get extended and more developed in part three. Other characters like Hollander's Lord Cutler Beckett and Naomie Harris' Tia Dalma are almost totally unreviewable, as they get even less screen time, and are given nothing but plot advancement/surprise revealing to do.The music, while featuring a few recycled/redone tunes, is just as great the second time as it was the first. The depth and feel of it only complements the film. The costumes, set designs and makeup also continue to be well done. Their authenticity adds greatly to the film.And even with their unevenness, the special effects dazzle. Davey Jones and his crew look absolutely phenomenal. Watch them in battle scenes and they look just as awestriking, if not more so, than the skeleton pirates in the original film. A particular standout for me was watching Davey Jones play the piano with all of his tentacles. It looks so realistic, and is done so well that it looks absolutely flawless on screen. However, the Kraken (a giant octopus that can be summoned at will) just does not look anywhere near as good. His tentacles, as they come around on the various ships, look fairly well done, but look weak when they attack any member of the cast. And when they do show anything more than just his tentacles, the effects look totally off, and feel inadequate in comparison to the great effects used for Jones and Co.In the end, the film really is a mixed bag. It does have many inconsistencies and a lack of completion, but it is watchable. The original film is obviously better, but at least this does not feel totally rushed and ill-managed. I can only hope that they fix up the loose ends in the screenplay, clean up the effects and get a better editor for the next round though. Otherwise, this really is going to be a one-trick pony of a franchise.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates plunder  old plot elements in this Dead Man's Chest,"Let's see: long lost father in league with the dark side, an evil emperor (of the high seas instead of the galaxy), a maverick soldier of fortune captain who cares only about himself, sword fights (instead of light sabers), a love triangle developing, a second installment that is just one long set-up for a concluding third installment, a character apparently dies but is strategically positioned for resurrection, etc...This sounds like a been-there-done-that situation.I guess part 3 will introduce some fish that resemble mini-me-Wookies that help fight Davy Jones. The guy and the girl will find out they're brother and sister? Will they start saying ""May the Caribbean Sea be with you, says I, maitee"" and then make 3 prequels? Fill in your own Star----oops, I mean, Pirates plot twists here.Overall, it's an OK movie, but with some flaws. Johnny Depp was brilliantly dashing yet devious in the original as Capt. Jack Sparrow, and has made this character part of our cultural lexicon. However, the awkward scripting this time on how Sparrow evolves is a challenge even for Depp's talents. Unnecessary action is thrown in, apparently to pad the running time, so that you don't notice this whole thing is just a commercial for part 3. The entire chase scene with the island natives means nothing in the story line. The free-for-all-mayhem where several characters just start fighting over stuff at the end has too much slapstick; the 3-way sword fight and the odd way it is shown are almost too much to endure.On the other hand, if you prefer a film that has loads of action, you'll love the pace of this movie. The ship-to-ship engagements are not bad at all, and the Kraken's ""Moby Dick"" style appearances are highlights of the flick. The Flying Dutchman creatures are also very creative, but their design is almost comic relief, rather than scary, in nature.A half-hearted thumbs-up on this one. The movie's strong points outweigh the weaknesses. However, this movie is shallow compared to its predecessor, and I hope the installment that it spends a lot of time pointing to is better than this, as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
utter madness,Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's wedding is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company who arrests them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow. Norrington is also wanted but he has resigned and disappeared. Beckett offers Will pardons if he retrieves Sparrow's compass. Meanwhile Sparrow is haunted by impending doom from Davy Jones and his compass seems to be malfunctioning.This is utter madness. Anybody who claims clarity about the plot upon watching it the first time is simply lying. The story is a convoluted collision of non-sense. The jumping from one set of characters to the next leaves the movie disjointed. What's left is Johnny Depp doing a repeat performance. He continues to be one of the craziest character ever. It's not original anymore but he's still great like when he escapes from the natives. Davy Jones and his crew are things of marval.

Jack's back... Yo ho!!!!!,"Ah, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a wonderful film. It successfully resurrected the swashbuckler genre, became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2003 and received five Oscar nominations, including, for the first time, Best Actor for Johnny Depp (apparently, the Academy didn't notice three previous gems such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco), who turned from indie poster-boy to Hollywood superstar. Oh yes, POTC was a great movie. And now the pirates have returned, bigger, but not always better, than ever!This time, everybody's in trouble. Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) wedding day is ruined by the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a very unpleasant man who's been sent to arrest them for helping the notorious pirate Jack Sparrow, I'm sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow, escape from hanging. The couple's only chance to get a full pardon is to steal Jack's compass, which will lead Becket to the Dead Man's Chest, an object that gives its owner the power to control the sea. Jack (Johnny Depp), on the other hand, has gotten himself in an even worse situation. You see, in order to become captain of the Black Pearl, he made a deal with the demonic Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Now, thirteen years later, the Scottish pirate wants Jack to pay his debt, meaning our hero is supposed to serve on ghost-vessel The Flying Dutchman for 100 years. Unless Jack can get out of this mess, of course. Hence the need to retrieve the aforementioned chest...Now, let's be honest. Pirates didn't need a sequel, since everything ended so perfectly and everyone got what he/she wanted. But who cares, when the continuation is, for the most part, a fun ride? Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio have returned to familiar territory and expanded the mythology, creating a fascinating world which fuses elements of Indiana Jones and Star Wars (DMC has plenty of references to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, not to mention a threesome sword-fight that will make The Phantom Menace eat its heart out). And while they introduce new locations (a stunning cannibal island) and new threats (the half squid, half crab Jones, his ""fishy"" crew and his pet sea monster, the Kraken), they don't forget our old friends on the way. Supporting characters such as Commodore Norrington and the comic duo Pintel & Ragetti are given more space, while the protagonists carry the story without disappointing us. Will is still an honorable man, driven by love towards his fiancée and forced to deal with his father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill (a very human Stellan Skarsgård), who turns out to be not only alive, but also a member of Davy Jones' crew. Elizabeth still seeks adventure as well as a peaceful life with her man. The pirates are still a bunch of stinking rascals, and Jack... well, he's Jack! Constantly unreliable but charismatic, he steals the entire movie with no effort at all (although he has less screen-time than expected). From the moment he first shows up, you know you're in for something absolutely unforgettable. His performance is zany and brilliant enough to make the very long running time (two and a half hours) and occasional far-fetched twists seem less irritating than they should be.If you loved the first movie, you just can't miss Dead Man's Chest. It may not be as fresh and well-crafted as its predecessor, but it is a good piece of entertainment and should raise expectations regarding the upcoming number 3.6,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Is this sci-fi??!,"What a let down. This thing is absolutely ridiculous! It's more about the actor's face shots and line counting than an actual plot. I was really trying to pay attention because I loved the first one- but even I found it difficult. There were a few ""funny"" references to the first one but they were more cheesy rather than funny. This time it seems like all of the characters are a bit more hammed up and the entire plot is incredible annoying. It should be under the sci-fi movie category and we all know Disney does not do sci-fi! And why does Davy Jones look like an octopus?

"Alright, but not worth paying to see","This was as far a movies these days go an alright flick. However it has received much hype as being an equal to the first film if not better than the original. Nothing could be simultaneously further from the truth or more correct. That is to say that this was definitely not as good as the first film, (which proves I'm not just some cynical critic because I thought the first film was fantastic, my date agreed and was also disappointed with the sequel). However I can see how people compare its quality to the first. They do this because the sequel recycled all the originality and funny scenes from its predecessor. This was basically the same movie with a different name and a monster added to it. Therefore to me the film was a failure.The cast did deliver, Captain Jack did a marvelous job of looking drunk or off-balance or most likely like a man used to being aboard a rocking ship. His constant stumbling awkwardness was a welcome comic relief. Furthermore the monstrosities that were in this film were imaginative and very well done. Lets also not forget the action, which was not lacking.Yet in the end the effects, action, and comedy were still not able to overcome the fact that this film was riding on the coatails of the first movies popularity. If you watch the film after having freshly watched the first movie you will undoubtedly notice how recycled it was. But if your just looking to turn off your mind and be entertained by something then this is a good film for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A drawn out mess laced with charm and effects,"The much anticipated sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean is finally here, and it's clear that the cast hasn't changed their gameplan. Johnny Depp is still swaggering about, stealing the show with his swashbuckling charm, while Bloom and Knightley keep making their way into Jack Sparrow's plans to repay the debt he owes to Davy Jones.The film runs over two hours, and some things probably could have been cut out, especially for an audience that is used to films under the 120 minute mark. But Pirates has many of twists and surprises for the audience, many of which are reminiscent of the first film. Those who are familiar with the first will notice many references in the first to crack a smile or make a point. Which isn't bad, but it's a little overdone.I was very impressed with the CG in this film, Davy Jones and his crew were always a joy to watch, and the mystical sea creature, the Cracken, was extremely well done. Environments and props were crafted to perfection, and the film draws you in very well in this department. I don't think they could have had a more convincing atmosphere for Dead Man's Chest. But it doesn't make up for the film as whole, which has some issues.Overall the movie looks like a perfect specimen from a far glance, but it has a serious gimp. There are a ton of plot holes, inconsistencies and it's incredibly absurd considering how many characters make returns and how much Dead Man's Chest has to lean on its predecessor to keep itself from stumbling over itself. Some of the magic from the first film is there, but the only thing that has improved are the CG pirates and the sometimes almost mystical environments. The third installment will have a lot of explaining to do thanks to Dead Man's Chest, and I don't know how they are going to keep it under three hours without it making any sense and still have it be as wildly entertaining as the first.Overall it's an enjoyable experience, with laughs here and there, but in the end you're going to be saying out loud, ""what?"" Let's just hope that the final installment can patch up the holes and make this trilogy a solid, consistent winner, and make Dead Man's Chest a little more understandable. Perhaps then it will lose its gimp. But for now, I'll have to say the highlight of the film was Davy Jones blasting away at his organ. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Bill Nighy,"The performance by Mr. Nighy was magnificent. Being buried under all that make-up (CGI?) would have stifled a lesser actor.

Like Jeff Goldblum before him in The Fly remake, it will be another excellent performance in the purest word of actor that will escape the attention of the Academy Award Lords in their nomination process. With all the seafood aberrations that populated the film, he alone anchored the chaos aboard the Flying Dutchman. Well done Mr. Nighy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As worthy a successor as i could have hoped for,"I have to admit i love the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-movie. I'm not that much of an adventure-fan usually, but there is just something about playfulness in movies that attracts me. When filmmakers allow themselves to play and have fun with the media as well as the subject. The first movie was genuine fun, and so of course the expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? I think it did.Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to fall in love with. Insanely weird and existing somewhere between good and bad, wrong and right, he's just the perfect. Orlando Bloom who should have the Academy award for stiffness (if such is ever presented) is also perfect as the, guess?, stiff William Turner. The first movie had captain Barbossa (the always wonderful Geoffrey Rush) and this movie has Davy Jones (the equally wonderful Bill Nighy) who is a worthy successor. So the stage is set character-wise for a repetition of the success. Don't forget story though. Of course treasure is the goal and enemies must be avoided and vanquished. In this movie though there is more at stake than just simple gold, something that doesn't destroy the fun luckily. There is sword-fighting, acrobatics, insane stunts and crazy sailing to make everyone happy. Much as in the first movie.So we have the characters, we have the story, we have the action and the comedy. Is this a better movie than the first? Not in my opinion. The first movie had the advantage of being first, as well as a story that perhaps made more sense. But this is as worthy a successor as i could have hoped for. Intensely funny, exciting and without losing the comedy and tongue-in-cheek that made the first movie such a delight. Maybe just one small point, i somehow wish the third movie would have been released closer to this one considering how close it follows story-wise. But that is just a small complaint, something that will make the arrival of the third movie all the more exciting.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good Action but light on story,"I would not disagree with many of the other reviews submitted. The action is non-stop, the special effects are flawless, the acting is decent and you truly are immersed into the pirate world. However, I left this film disappointed. There is no attempt to create a single film here, this is one very long film chopped in two, with an abrupt ending that resolves nothing that has been previously set up. Most films that are written with sequels in mind still make an effort to tell a story within the overarching plot (e.g. Star Wars), this makes no such attempt. A lot of the story that is set borders on the pointless side (Why did Captain Jack need to find a picture of a key to know that he was looking for a key?) and there are certainly parts which do not cater for those who have not seen the first film (the 'cliff-hanger' will leave the uninitiated clueless). I enjoyed this film and will go to see the second but I wish more effort had been given to the script rather than the money grabbing approach of forcing people to watch the third film to resolve the second.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Sail away, mates!","We all know that in sequels, they take everything one step further, and you'd better believe that ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" does that!

Whether it's battles with Davy Jones and his crew, or an unpleasant encounter with the Kraken, this movie has something for everyone.

"Remember the old saying ""Less is more""?","The second part in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" franchise has the same advantages and flaws as the first one. The storyline is just a unnecessarily complicated and the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be suitable for kids or not. By now we've gotten used to Johnny Depp's weird performance, although I'm still not entirely convinced by it.Still, the movie is full of great ideas for action sequences (even more so than part one!) and mostly the chemistry between the actors works fine. Here's the thing: THIS MOVIE IS WAY TOO LONG! It's like a neverending roller-coaster ride. Things fly through the air, people are thrown around like volley balls, ships explode, a monster Kraken unleashes hell. After two hours the headache starts and it's just too much. It's an annoying trend in Hollywood that probably started with the Matrix and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Also, why is it not enough to make just one sequel these days? Why do they have two come in pairs? I'm so fed up with a movie ending right in the middle of the story, so you have to wait another year until you've already forgotten about everything that happened in the previous part.Well, it seems to be a clever concept commercially but I'm not so sure if this procedure won't backfire sooner or later. After all the trick is to stop when the audience still wanted to see more, not when everybody's so exhausted they just can't take any more. After all this is really the one thing that keeps ""Pirates Of The Carribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" from being more than a slightly above average summer blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An excellent, if overly dark, adventure film.  Expect no more and you WILL enjoy it.","I enjoyed it. Let's set our expectations sufficiently low here: if you're expecting a piece of cinema that will satisfy you on a critical level, excelling in all the ordinary boxes of plot, character development et cetera, you'll probably be disappointed. The plot is silly and meandering and character development is clichéd (the father thing) and forced.That's not what this film is about. It's a family adventure film, a swashbuckler. Personally, my criteria for this genre, which I enjoy very much, would be inventive and exciting fight scenes, a little light-hearted comedy and characters that are likable and fun without necessarily having to be compelling or three-dimensional (though it'd help, of course), and spectacular effects, visual feasts and music that capture the imagination.This film has these in spades. The fights are fantastic and so original it doesn't matter if they're a bit ridiculous. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is in my view as cool as ever while remaining the classic pirate - his last scene in the film (I won't ruin it) stays in the mind for hours after you leave. It's so powerful and awe-inspiring. Once again the environments and scenes, from Tortuga to the islands visited to the ships, are enchanting. The music, though unchanged, remains the brilliantly exciting and dramatic adventure score it always was (I played it in my head during a rugby game while on tour, it's that heart-pounding. I definitely played better. This film will improve your rugby - further incentive.) The issue of violence and darkness is one valid area of concern. There are some nasty bits in this film and some pretty freaky monsters - wait until you see Davey Jones' crew, for one. I'd be careful about bringing your youngest. More than that, however, is the notion that the very imaginative ideas, but very dark ones, that they had in this film might have been better suited in a film that wasn't aimed at families. This would have been better as an adventure thriller with a higher rating. All the ideas are there but they're a bit out of place in a film with Road Runner-esquire cartoon comedy sequences (seriously).These remain minor issues. This film is not a critically satisfying piece of cinema. But we're not all critics. Expect a funny, passionate and fiercely exciting adventure film and you will be richly rewarded. Promise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Do not believe the hype!,"I did enjoy the first movie but I was unsure about ""Dead Man's Chest"". Sure, the trailed looked pretty exciting and the storyline caught my attention but I just had a bad feeling about this movie. So I went to IMDb and read some of the positive reviews so I decided to go. Well I just got back from watching this movie. I should of went with my ""hunch"". I do not understand how anyone could rate this movie above a 4 or maybe a 5 for some die hard fans let alone a 9 or 10. I even saw a review where someone compared this movie to Star Wars? What are you smoking?!?I am glad that the original cast(Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, etc...) came back but this ranks up there as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This had not beginning, middle and end. There was maybe a couple good moments in this movie but it had no plot, the humor was recycled, and the scripting was terrible.The only good thing about this movie is the people in their marketing and publicity department. With movie tickets soaring, I would wait for the DVD. Terrible disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Little Lacking,"I was anticipating this movie very much, since I am such a fan of the first in its entirety.The movie started out well with the rain pouring down and the camera zooming in on poor, desolate Elizabeth (Knightley.) But as the movie progressed, things got weirder and little confusing, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, the acting was great (yet again by the Depp, Bloom, Knightley, Davenport and many of the others). The visuals were absolutely stunning. The dialogue fully embodied each character.The tipping point, however, was the story direction and the plot. So many times during the movie, I thought, ""What is going on?"" The movie is meant to prepare you for an upcoming sequel, but it does not seem to that all too well. The plot was simply lacking something extra...Well, I still can't wait for the next movie, considering the end of this one. But this one was... just not up to par as the first, let's say.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Expect little and you will receive,"Those who expected little from this second installment of Pirates will be. Completely justified.Dead Man's Chest suffers from sequel-syndrome, with an extraordinarily convoluted plot, and jokes that seem to scream (in an increasingly hysterical voice) ""Remember the first one? Remember how funny it was?!?!""Not to say that the movie in itself was all bad. Certainly it meets the requirements of a fun summer blockbuster, but after the overwhelming success of Black Pearl, this seems depressingly inadequate. With three years between the first and second movie, all the good jokes were already feeling hackneyed enough without being dusted off and reused. One could only moan ""not another rum joke Please not another rum joke.""Most viewers, of course, will go simply to see Johnny Depp  but it seems Gore Verbinski decided this was not enough reason to shift focus from the overly-dramatic Will Turner onto Jack Sparrow. Jack appears to have (shockingly) gotten even less screen time than in the first film  and what he does get is, for the most part, poorly written. In the scenes where he was given new material to work with  new jokes and character development  Johnny Depp is absolutely extraordinary, but these scenes were too few and far between to save the film.In true sequel-style, the ending will, indeed, leave you cheering and waiting expectantly for the last installment, but this fabulous last 30 min. doesn't really justify 2 hours of drudgery. There is much potential here, but to capitalize on it the film would have had to try harder to stand on its own - not relying so heavily on Curse of the Black Pearl  a true sequel instead of a half-hearted clone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I loved it:,"I probably would've loved it even more if it were 20-30 minutes shorter in the middle but as it is - great fun. Jack is back and he is magnificent -drunk most of the time, his morals as unstable as his walk, lying, seducing, running, hanging by his leg on the rope, and always irresistible. Depp's Capt. Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I am sure that the make up artists will be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserve them all). I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all. The film is a rare case of equal opportunity entertainment and enjoyment - for the young children, their parents, cynical teenagers, sophisticated intellectuals, rednecks - for everybody and their uncle Max.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Pretty good, but it has its flaws.","Okay, let's start with the story. Jack Sparrow (sorry, *Captain*) has been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years (unlucky thirteen, as it were). Originally, he had made a deal with the sea himself, Davy Jones, to raise the ship from the depths of his locker (we don't find out the details of that, yet, but I'm sure they'll be answered in the third movie). The deal was that Jack would be captain for thirteen years only, and then be doomed to servitude on the Flying Dutchman (Davy Jones' ship). Now, his time is up, and Jack gets the ever-familiar 'black spot' on his hand, marking him as pray for the Kraken (Davy Jones' assassination minion of the depths of the sea) if he should defy his deal.Now for everybody else: Will and Elizabeth are about to get married in the very beginning, but a certain Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company has put out arrest warrants for them both (for helping Jack escape the hangman's noose, for which their crime shares the exact same punishment), and one for Jack (for his crimes mentioned in the first movie), and even one for the *former* Commodore James Norrington (his conditions are a bit more fuzzy)! The deal Lord Beckett makes with Will is that, if he gets a certain 'compass' from Captain Jack, then Will and Elizabeth will both be pardoned (Norrington has been nowhere to be found for the past few weeks). Too bad Lord Beckett has a hidden agenda...Now, that's the beginning, and I'm going to stop there, because I don't want to post any spoilers. So, with this in mind, forgive me for being a bit evasive as I give my analysis: Captain Jack changes quite a bit in this movie. He's much less decisive about what he needs to do with his strategies (and a bit sloppy with them), and his heart seems to always be torn in two (you'll see what I'm talking about during the course of the movie). Overall I see this as a negative impact for the movie, but it may turn positive in the third, showing that he is indeed 'growing'.Will is actually an improvement, in my honest opinion. He was the classically adorable, lovesick puppy in Curse of the Black Pearl, but much more of an adult in Dead Man's Chest. He seems to have lived more in this movie, and experienced a whole lot (like all of the events of the first movie). Though some may say Orlando Bloom's acting is wooden, I *completely* disagree! I think he portrayed a very 'real' (no other word to describe it) person as Will Turner, without you feeling like you're even watching an actor, but the actual person Will Turner, ups and downs both.Elizabeth, pardon my English, is a major S-L-U-T in this movie. She mentions toward the beginning how Lord Beckett ""robbed her of her wedding night"" (the least ladylike thing she could possibly say in front of company). She flirts with nearly every guy she meets in this movie (Jack most certainly included, if you can believe it!), and throws herself at a couple of them (literally). Total downhill spiral from the first movie, making Elizabeth a rich and promiscuous snob (never a good combination for a movie heroine).Norrington is a MAJOR plus! He pitches the white wig that made him look like an ice cream cone in the first movie, and becomes... well, *piratey*, if you can believe it! His personality has many different sides here, with conflicting desires (including a possible remaining love for Elizabeth?) and motivations. And also--and this is not something to criticize the movie with, but my own heterosexual female opinion--Norrington was incredibly HOT!The new bad guy, Davy Jones, is another negative. His story is explained (such as how he became an immortal sea-like creature), but his motivations and desires are rather fuzzy. Barbossa from the first movie was a much better villain: you knew that what he was doing was evil, and that Jack needed to defeat him for the movie to be happy, but you understood *why* Barbossa did what he did in Curse of the Black Pearl--to feel like a human being again! (And, be honest, you sympathized with him a bit.) Davy Jones, on the other hand, is much colder than Barbossa (and not in a good way), much crueler, and offers you no outlet for sympathy, making the storyline more one-sided. That's not to say Bill Nighy was bad for the role (he portrayed him very well, actually), but the character himself was a downside.All in all, with the above story and character analysis, I give this movie 6/10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Sequel,"Just before their wedding, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) for helping the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), but Cutler proposes a deal to Will: their freedom per Jack's compass. Meanwhile, Jack is afraid of the sea, because he owes his soul to the evil Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchmen. When Will meets Jack, the pirate proposes to exchange his compass by a key owned by Davy Jones. Will goes to the Flying Dutchman without knowing how dangerous and diabolic Davy Jones and his crew are.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is another good supernatural adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, with action, humor, romance, mystery and great special effects. The story is inferior to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but is also very entertaining. Unfortunately it is does not end, actually it is interrupted in a suspenseful moment in order to have another sequel again with Captain Barbossa.

Boooooooooooooring,"I went yesterday to see this movie. I had seen the first one and thought that it was not your typical blockbuster so I gave this sequel a chance. My mistake. Johny Depp seems to be high (on rum?) and I only enjoyed the scene where the sailors are swinging their bone trap to get to the cliff. Apart from that, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. The ""seafood"" ghost pirates are absurd and most of the scenes were copied and pasted from other adventure movies (hello Indy). The story was poor and the main character, Jack Sparrow, doesn't say anything to me. At least, a fantasy movie should thrill you and there's nothing thrilling in this movie. Well, I promise I will not go to the 3rd part. I consider I have already paid my dues to the entertainment industry so no more blockbusters this year.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's Fun, But Does Anyone Know When to Stop","Sometimes I think they sell movies by the pound. This is a pretty delightful tale. The sea creatures, the special effects, Johnny Depp's prancing, tilting Jack Sparrow, interesting rules of the sea, Davey Jones. But it is an eternity. Just like the first one, I thought it would never end. What could be much more suspenseful and captivating is dragged on for two and a half hours. A snip here and there would have done wonders for this film. One thing that always bothers me is the complexity of the hero's task; we are submerged in a whirlpool of details. At times I think the characters themselves are confused by what's going on. How could they know?Still, it's nice to see someone put forth the effort to tell a really nifty adventure yarn. The sea puts forth obstacles that we don't have on terra firma. It has its own legends and its own being, and it's really quite wet. I like the hammer head guy and the octopus-like Jones. Obviously, the makeup people put in a lot of overtime. It also sets up episode three. See it, but it's quite an investment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointed,"Well, I am probably going to be made to walk the plank for saying this, but I saw this movie on the first day of its US release and after waiting anxiously over a year for it to come out, I was disappointed. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I can only compare it to the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean' which I felt developed and used the characters much better than the sequel. I was utterly disappointed at how the plot unfolds, and the changes in the personalities of some of the leading characters. And I was really let down at the ending, for reasons some of you will understand when you see this movie.Maybe I was just expecting too much. Maybe it was ""fresher"" the first time out. Maybe there was an obvious point to this movie, which will be better known in 'Pirates 3' (At World's End) due out next year. I don't know, but overall I just sat there at the end of the movie going ""What the heck??"" I might just go back and see it again in a few days, maybe it will be better the second time around; but I am not getting my hopes up. 'Pirates 2' falls short of the original, not in the CGI (Davy Jones' crew equals the ""dead"" crew of Captain Barbossa in the first movie) but unlike the Indiana Jones trilogy, the sequel did not meet or exceed the original. I am very disappointed to admit that, but it is how I feel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This one is full of action, no need for that much character development.

"Honestly, A Disappointment","As much as I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow, the action, and the visual effects, the plot and story behind the second installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" makes the movie confusing and detracts from what we're watching unfold on screen. While the light tone and gentle gabs at the genre remain from the first movie, as well as the slightly intoxicated character of Jack Sparrow who is as hilarious as ever, character development is lacking. Elizabeth Swann is simply an annoying heroine who loses the edgy graciousness she had in the first movie, while Orlando Bloom just doesn't convey the youthful excitement from the previous film. Plus, the scene where Will is reunited with his father is just silly. Add in a two dimensional evil villain who just cares about money and you have at least three blah performances who revolve around Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. The movie is entertaining, but far too much is going on for us to enjoy Johnny Depp and the special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just barely misses the mark.,"The eight-star score is generous. Dead Man's Chest is definitely not a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed a little. It's always tough to create sequels to successful blockbusters and have them live up to original's name. The first ""Pirates"" film had a rare charm that most other Hollywood pictures would envy. Fantastic characters, a great story, amazing special effects, and an all-around ""fun"" feel. It's not hard to understand why it became so popular.On paper, nothing really seems wrong with Dead Man's Chest. It has the same elements that made the first film a hit. Yet at the same time, something felt missing.Two of the ""main three"" characters (Sparrow, Turner, and Swann) seemed to have experienced a personality makeover. Initially, all three characters are likable and you found yourself rooting for them through both good and bad intentions. That's not the case in DMC. Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann both show their dark side and become devious, cowardly, and double-crossing individuals. Their actions are so despicable that even a movie audience will have a hard time justifying them. Will Turner, however, is still the same honorable and loyal gentleman that is the fish-out-of-water among cutthroat pirates. This leaves Turner as the only remaining likable character out of the ""main three."" On the other hand, there is one character change that I was pleasantly surprised with. Commodore Norrington. In the first film, he was a snobbish stiff that dedicated himself to capturing criminal scum and bringing them to justice (or execution). In DMC, an unfortunate twist of fate causes his character to do a 180* and become the very same scum he once fought to destroy. This spin is very amusing and one of the highlights of the film.A great amount of the storyline felt like filler, as if they were just there to set up the next action scene. This formula works for B-movies and martial arts films, but for a big budget film like DMC, it feels awkward.The humor is hit-and-miss. It's impossible not to smile Johnny Depp's performance, even at his most outrageous moments. However, it often feels that the writers tried too hard to squeeze in humor at inappropriate places just so they can meet their humor quota. This sort of bad timing is another element that sets DMC below COTBP in terms of quality.Davy Jones and ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner are two terrific additions to the ""Pirates"" cast. They both add to a very dark atmosphere that the overall story focuses on. While the dark tone is a welcome change for the series, it also makes the story a bit depressing. You can't help but pity Bill Turner, trapped in a world that he can never escape.Though far-fetched at times, the action/sword-fight scenes are a ton of fun to watch and help make DMC an all-around solid film.The ending is not 100% satisfying, but that was done intentionally to build up anticipation for the third (and perhaps final) film. I hope that the third film improves on what I didn't like about the story and ties up all the loose ends so it can leave audiences feeling thrilled and satisfied. If they do, The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has the potential to be remembered as classics worthy to sit by the legendary Back to the Future and Indiana Jones series as great timeless adventures for everyone to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A disappointment...,"Well, this is my first movie review, I'm going to try and get straight to the point, and try to avoid being wordy.

Orlando Bloom was barely there, Knightly waswell hot There were some great scenes in this movie, I laughed quite a few times, but I was never on the edge of my seat, I was quite bored.

Almost Great,"PIrates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Directed by Gore Verbinski Written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Jonathan PryceSo, Captain Jack is back to grace the screen after the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, made a surprisingly world beating blockbuster run three years back. Already dominating the box office, Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest is a almost a lock to end up in the top three of the all time box office charts, with some already imagining it might even sink Titanic.Well, to start off with, let me say that Pirates 2 is not a titanic flop in any way. If you've been afraid the last few months that this movie will end up being cast aside like The Matrix Reloaded, then rest easy, the film is good.The film has improved in more ways than one. As enjoyable as The Curse of the Black Pearl was, there were many instances where due to no fault of the crew, the film visually fell short because of it's lack of size (in money and in space). The skeleton people looked as best they could, and the waters as dreadful as humanly possible (with a tinge of realization that it's a set, not a real... boat). Dead Man's Chest does away with all visual doubt. The Black Pearl in it's full glory carries a menace of its own, equalled only by The Flying Dutchman, ship of the villain Davy Jones, made out of oysters and seashells.The tentacle man Davy JonesSo the story goes that Davy Jones wants Jack Sparrow to pay up his debt, which is (to no surprise) his soul. So the double crossing, triple crossing, quadruple crossing plot unfolds with Sparrow, Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann, Ex-commodore Norrington, and other familiar foes. The plot twists in the film surprises well, and the film in it's own right carries substantial weight and food for thought for us viewers to chew on till the finale. It's no secret that Pirates 2 ends on a cliffhanger note, which I believe many will not enjoy. But that's life :PHowever, the interesting storyline also is perhaps the greatest weakness of the film. The many prominent plot points are used as ""excuses"" to set up unnecessary chase, swordchopping, swashbuckling, and squimy twitching, scenes.Jack Sparrow exceeds expectations, if only marginally, and caused my belly to swell, thanks to all the laughter. The sideline story of the aboriginies is easily the highlight of the film because of the level of creativity, which mind you, required minimal computer graphics. The human element, that's what they would call it. Speaking of computer graphics, as great as all the sets and costumes were, and the by and large innovating animation of the seashell baddies, the giant octopus, known as the Kraken, supposedly the biggest visual highlight of the film... turned out to be quite a bore. Won't say more, other than, well, it's a giant squid la.Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom gave par performances, riding on the film's other great qualities. Davy Jones amused and delighted me with his twitches and his nostalgia, but fails to inject fear into my blood. Most of the supporting cast were supporting enough, with none rising above the tide to steer the Black Pearl into greatness.I love you. You love me. Scriptwriters don't let us marry. Darn them.And oh yes, Hans Zimmer didn't fare much better than his apprentice from the first film, cos the music was one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. I've always admired/defended Zimmer scores to be purposeful, highly functional, and when necessary, glorious, even if dull notes needed playing, but Pirates was only existent at best, and a nuisance most of the time.All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is deserving of it's record breaking blockbuster status, and as startling as the film is visually, it fails to deliver a consistent pace and balance of adrenaline and thought. Hats of to Johnny Depp, Jack Sparrow, who has single handedly carried this film on his back, but the prominence of his contributing is leading me to wonder if his presence will burn out with the next film.Then again, Chow Yun Fatt is in the next one.Savvy?And I've been saving this line for the last: Johnny Depp should win an Oscar for his role as Jack Sparrow. Should've won it the last time, and should win it this time.Rating: B",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"entertaining in its own right, but can't hold a candle to the original","Dead Man's chest was, at best, an entertaining wild goose chase. Following the rules of a sequel, it is bigger, brasher, and derivative of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, Curse of the Black Pearl. The jokes felt (and often were) recycled. Each reference deserved nothing more than a fond chuckle. To psych myself up for the new film, I watched Curse of the Black Pearl again last night, and found that my appreciate for it actually grew with each watching. I do not see this happening with the latest Pirate escapade.But enough comparisons. As i said, on its own Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a satisfying summer blockbuster, with pretty faces, somewhat clever writing, and its fair share of shocks and scares. Based again on the Disney theme park ride (which I hear they're finishing revamping to capitalize on fan's love of the film's story), this one feels more like a ride. That is to say, the plot points are used simply to thrown the characters through various roller-coaster like adventures without any real consequence. No one is ever safe, but then again you never feel that anyone won't make it into the next scene. Maybe its just because I know there will be another sequel, but any genuine concern for the character's well-being or actual investment in the story is missing.So yes, an enjoyable film, but missing the heart of the original. but you probably knew that already.

Truly astonishing,"First of all, Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl was simply amazing. The CGI was top notch and you won't complain about how horrible and fake looking it was. The acting was amazing, probably because of the super casting Johnney Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geofrey Rush, were most likely the best actors at the time and still are.Pirates of the Caribbean Mans Chest is no different. The CGI was amazing, especially Davy Jones who looked like a real keeper of the sea. His tentacles were astonishing, his face was creepy and disgusting in a good way and his body was great. Also how can anyone forget the Kraken which looked amazingly real and scary. Davy Jones crew was quite the cast that I won't be forgetting for a while, and the fight scenes were much better than the 1st.The acting was just as good if not better than the 1st. Bill Nighy did a great job of playing Davy Jones and Johnney Depp proved to us again that he is the only man on earth who can play Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom did a fantastic job of playing Will Turner just like in Curse of the Black Pearl and Keira Knightley also did splendidly.Overall: This is the best movie of 2006 so far. The CGI was amazing and very believable. The acting was great, especially Jack Sparrow, the movie itself is so astonishing that you won't be looking at your watch at all. Some might think this is a bad movie because it is too long, but time doesn't mean anything ( look at Titanic, Return of the King, King Kong, Godfather ). People might think this is a bad review, but you can believe whatever you want, just like Pirates. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Good, but not great...","I was really looking forward to this one. The first POTC was one of the most enjoyable movies released in 2003, and Johnny Depp just owns the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Naturally, I was looking forward to a lot of the same things that were very entertaining the first time around today....with the added bonus of furthering the story and providing a little more insight into the world of the Pirates of the Caribbean.What do I think now that I've seen it? Its somewhat unremarkable, underwhelming, and didn't really meet my expectations.Although this movie is visually stunning, I couldn't help but wonder if it really needed all the bells and whistles that they threw at it. Davy Jones and his crew were somewhat distracting, and I think would have been just as effective as a supernatural crew of pirates without all the CGI.The story was scattered, but OK. We all know that there is a third film coming soon, so it didn't really feel like a complete film (Not to mention that knowing who is signed on for the next one kinda ruins some of the tense parts of this film). I think that this was really due to most of the characters having their own agenda in the storyline. (You kinda have to pay attention to this)Some of the best parts of the first film are still here: Captain Jack Sparrow (Which Johnny Depp still owns), some humour and cool sword fights.

The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie is one of my favorites, so I have been eagerly anticipating what Disney and Bruckheimer would cook up with this franchise. When news came in that the movie may be so-so I was worried, however went into the packed theater with an open mind. While thoroughly entertaining, witty and enjoyable, the movie is very long, filled with filler fluff, and probably could have been cut down and combined with the third movie and made into one better film.The plot is hard to describe in a few sentences, but basically Captain Jack Sparrow is back, and his life is in debt to the legendary Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchmen who are supernatural creatures who do underwater dirty work and are out for blood. Facing possible eternal damnation, Jack must save himself by calling on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who have an obligation to come to Jack's aid. Unfortunately, their involvement causes them to miss their wedding day, and sends them into the high seas for danger and adventure.In Dead Man's Chest we see a lot more character development of Will and especially Elizabeth as they go about their story lines and get tangled in the plot. The enrichment of their characters was a pleasant surprise for me because I wasn't expecting it. Everyone loves Jack Sparrow, but it was nice to see that the movie focused on them and wasn't only the 'Johnny Depp' show (although he pretty much steals the movie anyway, as predicted).So what of the film? Extremely appealing, a loud, fun, summer 'popcorn' flick if you will, however inferior to the original in many ways. Overall very dark, with creepy characters and a LOT of plot to explain, the movie delves into the supernatural quickly and while very interesting, sometimes is too unbelievable. The good news is that it's quite funny and doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there is so much plot that I felt like I should have had a notebook to keep track of all the important elements. The overall artistic look and feel is mysterious and menacing, but could be considered scary for children or people like me :) Overall the CG was so-so and did not compare in any way to the original with had a much better villain and more interesting bad guys in general.The main complaint I have with this film is that there are TONS of action sequences that are there for no reason other than to show more action and perhaps take up time. For example, the scenes involving Jack Sparrow and the natives could have completely been cut out, because they did virtually nothing for the plot. I sincerely think that this film could have wrapped itself up within one movie if unnecessary scenes had been cut; leaving only the parts that served the plot. Now there is going to be a third movie, probably with more action scenes, rather than one solid movie with a great script.To wrap up, in order to enjoy the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the viewer must understand that the point is to have fun; therefore you must sit back, relax, and roll with it. If you are expecting an Oscar film, this ain't the place for you. If you've got that, then you will be all set for this movie. I honestly wish that Dead Man's Chest would have wrapped up much like the first one, however predictably now I can't wait to see the third one to see how the adventures conclude.:::www.animationchick.com:::",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A wonderful experience till the very end,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, hands down. Depp plays his character magnificantly. He once again makes Jack Sparrow come to life before our eyes.Knightly, who has made me tremble in some of her other performance, had amazing chemistry with both Bloom and Depp, and played the part of the ragged sailor much better then could ever be expected.Twists and turns till the very end, this movie will leave you wanting to see it again, and pray the next chapter finds its way to us sooner.A second epic with the right to be placed next to The Empire Strikes Back.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The three part saga thing is starting to annoy me,"It started a long time ago (in a galaxy not so far far away) when films started to mix with TV series and transform into sagas. Even the name annoys the hell out of me. If it's on TV, it's a mini series, if it's on the big screen it's a saga!Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Pirates of the Caribbean. The second part is less funny and intriguing, has a lot of special effects, and the characters transform dramatically in order to make the link to the third part. Of course, just reediting the first part wouldn't have been good either. I guess what really bothered me is that this film cannot be taken separately from the first and (apparently) from the third. It's just the middle of something bigger and you can't truly enjoy it for itself. They went the Matrix way: the first film nice and interesting, then a two part second part which they name 2 and 3, just for kicks and which you can't really separate from each other.But it was also a good film. Johhny Depp does wonders once again, even if he lost that charming wavy way of standing. The evil spooks are not even more spooky and the human and mollusk look payed off. It look great. Keira Knightley... I really made efforts to like her. She even seemed sexy when she first rose to stardom, but for whatever reason I just can't stand the woman now. Orlando Bloom is co-starring. I can't put it any other way, he is there just for filling up space. He could have had a better and more complex role. I loved Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, captain of the mollusk pirates.I just have to say something about Naomie Harris. She is HOT! The cute Jamaican accent thing and the fine, yet complex movements of lips make her look terribly sexy. She plays a minor role, yet she does it in style.Bottom line: it's a nice continuation. Could have been better and it's more than a sequel. But since it is a fun movie to begin with, you will probably have fun either way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as good as the original, but still entertaining","I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest last night. I've had the DVD at home for about a week from Netflix and I finally got around to watching it.I enjoyed the first movie (as most people did) and was surprised by how entertaining it was given its source material (as most people were). So, while I wouldn't say I had high hopes for the sequel (didn't think it was necessary), I was looking forward to some more Captain Jack Sparrow and top-of-the-line special effects (I felt the original movie's effects were the most impressive to date).Wow, a lot of parentheses in that last paragraph.Overall, the movie was entertaining, although not as good as the original. The story was hard to follow, the first 45 minutes were completely unnecessary and did nothing to move the plot forward and overall it was probably about ½ an hour too long. Actually just remove those first 45 minutes and it would have flowed much better and been a better flick.But we must remember that these Pirates films are about having fun, and when the film gets going, it is just that: fun.The cinematography, sets, costumes, audio, effects and acting are all top notch. Everything looks fantastic. Johnny Depp again reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow to perfection. Maybe some of the magic is gone, since it is not as new or fresh, but you can't blame Johnny for that.I'm not going to bother with plot details, but I will say this. The folks at ILM have done it again. They've topped their previous effort and again delivered a special effects tour de force! The main antagonist, the pirate Davy Jones, a half man/half octopus creature is simply the most impressive visual effect ever put on film. Ever. He was created completely out of CG, overlaid over the actor playing him, and it is so convincing it looked like the actor was wearing a prosthetic mask. Only you know it couldn't be a prosthetic because if it was, it was the most convincing, organic looking prosthetic in history. The texture of his skin, his tentacles, the way the lighting would reflect off of him (in either night, rain or sunshine) was absolutely perfect. I can watch the scenes in which Davy Jones are in over and over and not get tired. They did a simply amazing job.If you haven't seen the film, rent it just for Johnny Depp and Davy Jones. They are both worth the extra long run time, the so-so beginning, and at times convoluted story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
overall good movie with some faults.,"Good but not as Good. Something felt wrong. This one wasn't sugarcoated which is a plus. One of the bad factors is how complex the storyline is. It was almost confusing. Action was high, Comedy was crazy high too the point I thought they were trying a bit hard. The first one's ending was better. This One is Like TADA! GO SEE TREQUEL ( is that even a word?). If you really don't want to see this movie don't it isn't worth the 10 bucks for admission unless you're into it. The casting was amazing. So was the scenery. It literally takes your breath away. I do think it's a little too complicated and scary for little kids so if you were planning on taking your kids or your siblings I wouldn't. I definitely liked the first one better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun entertaining special effects fest,"Gotta be honest, the first Pirates of the Caribbean flick didn't really do it for me. Before you start firing your cannons at me or plan on starting a mutiny, allow me to explain myself. The first Pirates of the Caribbean, was well directed and made and all that, but as far as story goes, I found it a big bore for some reason. Of course this has nothing to do with Johnny Depps masterful, memorable and Oscar nominated performance as Jack Sparrow which I loved right from the get go. So, I was one of those guys who thought that the only saving grace that the first movie had was Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Now after the enormous success of the first one here comes the bigger sequel. In other words, if Dead Mans Chest follows the rules of being the sequel to a successful film right, we should get more of everything. More effects, more action, more comedy! More Jack Sparrow! I'm glad to say the film successfully achieved all of these and then some! This time around Jack Sparrow is running away from a supernatural evil pirate called Davey Jones. You see, Jack owes Davey Jones his soul, but of course Jack being the sleaze bag trickster that he is doesn't want to pay up what he owes. Instead he chooses to run away and find a way to destroy Davey Jones and his crew of half human half fish pirates. This enrages Davey who conducts a search for Jack across the seven seas, leading us to a cannibal infested island, giant octopuses and strange half man half fish creatures.Little did I suspect that this was going to be the best movie of the summer. I mean literally, it took me by surprise. The big anticipation this summer for me was Superman which for various reasons I wont get into here was great and at the same time disappointing. But here comes Pirates of the Caribbean blowing me away. As this film progressed I realized what a huge production it was, everything is bigger and better here. From the monsters (giant octopuses ROCK!) to the sets (loved that cannibal island!) to the villains (Gotta give props to Davey Jones, what a cool villain!) and the comedy. Yup this film had it all and it turned out to be a really entertaining film of epic proportions.The best thing about this movie of course is having Johnny Depp return to one of his best roles. Like I said before, the thing everyone loved the most about the first flick was Depps Jack Sparrow and on this sequel we get plenty of him. Jack is funnier, trickier and in a strange way more lovable then the first since the guy finally learns that sometimes we have to do the right thing. All the supporting characters were great, I loved some of the jokes coming from some of the lesser important pirates. Orlando Bloom was in the movie, but honestly he has very little to do in this one, since most of the film focuses a whole lot more on the chemistry developing between Keira Knightly and Jack Sparrow and the action and effects.Speaking of effects, another great bonus on this film is that the effects are truly spectacular. Getting wowed by effects is getting increasingly difficult for me, but Ill be damned if this one really had me saying wow every five seconds. The gigantic octopus known as the Kraken freaking rocked! Some of the extended effects sequences with the octopus were extremely exciting and incredible to watch. It brought back memories of scenes from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and seeing Kirk Douglas battling rubber tentacles. On this film Gore Verbinsky has orchestrated a truly memorable monster sequence. One for the books! And speaking of memorable monsters, I loved Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. Its only fair that since Jack Sparrow is such a memorable anti hero we should also get an equally formidable villain. And such is the case with Davey Jones. Aside from the fact that Mr. Jones has a striking look to him (all about the tentacled beard!) the character itself moves and talks in a very interesting and different manner. Loved the way the bad guys looked in this film! So visually speaking get ready for some cool stuff.Of course the guys behind making this film are very smart. They know how much audiences love Jack Sparrow and they know we want to see more of him which is probably why the movie ends with a cliffhanger ending. They literally leave you gasping for more even though the movie last well more then two hours! So be ready for a Lord of the Rings type of ending where you go WHAT? No way it just ended there! So to me, this was the true spectacle of the summer. Incredible effects, great action, great characters and just plain fun. After all ain't that what summer movies are supposed to be about? Fun big budget special effect spectacles! And this one delivers in spades. So trust me on this one maties, we got ourselves a winner! Rating: 5 out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun set pieces in a movie that loves to swim in circles,"Pirates II is a fun summer movie. It has its share of laughs, romance and convincing CGI. It's a charming piece, a charming Pirate movie.Sadly, the lines above are about the only good points about this unnecessary sequel. It seems the rush to bring it to theaters resulted in a 150 min ""preview-from-hell"" that, although amusing at times, gets repetitive and incomprehensible very early in the game.It's very clear that there's no real storyline. All we get is another dumb McGuffin device (whoa, a BOX) and a collection of set pieces that barely relate to each other. There's no sense of purpose, no notion of continuity or consequence. Like a David Lynch pic - in a bad way.Gore Verbinski is a very talented guy. If Pirates is even watchable, that is a testament to his skill as a director. It looks and sounds amazing; Verbinki always picks the best shots. We can see he was trying very hard to turn this mess into a great movie. Kudos for him.Surprisingly enough, this time Depp was way off in his Keith Richards impersonation. Of course it's funny but soon enough we get bored of Orlando Bloom (aka ""the hero"") and eventually expect more from Jack Sparrow. We never get it. He seems uncomfortable having to repeat the same old tricks in the sequel. As for the rest of the cast, they do the best they can but there's no escaping a poorly written script.In the end, Pirates II is just another example of a franchise gone bad, much like The Matrix Reloaded before it. Today we know that the only reason Reloaded made so much money was that it had the momentum of the first one, not that the Wachowski brothers had found some new and improved way of hypnotizing an audience. I bet the third one will not do as well.So, for those brave enough, go see it and enjoy the special effects in a big screen with good Dolby or DTS sound. It's worth 10 dollars - and you might even have some laughs added as a bonus. However, expect nothing else or disappointment will ensue.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's all about the money,"I really cannot comprehend how this movie could possibly have a 7.9 on IMDb. I would go as far to say that this movie was WORSE than The Village (which I also hated). The story picks up a bit after the last movie left off, which is probably the only good thing about the movie. After the intro, he just goes horribly wrong. The plot feels like it's pulled and twisted just so that they can stretch this movie to an uncomfortable 2.5 hours and leave the story open at the end so they can make 4 or 5 more of these atrocities. The number of plot holes created from this warped directing style just adds to the confusion of why I actually bought a ticket in the first place. Maybe, it was because I liked the first movie and expected the 2nd to not be absolute junk. I can honestly state that I will never watch another Gore Verbinski movie, seeing that having his name stamped on a movie must mark it as manure.You've bested me this time Gore Verbinski and taken me gold, it will not happen again!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW: he is the basis of the story and he is the one who makes this a great movie. Johnny Depp is incredible. the movie would be nothing without him; Captn.

Why is the rum always gone?,"If you think someone should watch the movie, you don't tell them the whole thing for goodness sakes people! That's why I've decided to post a comment. Anyway, here goes...We've got the same cast, same thrilling music, same director, same writers, and same Caribbean baby!! What more can you ask for? Unless... Heath Ledger, Elijah Wood, and Jeremy Sumpter were to pop up as new characters-O.K. now I'm letting my imagination run off. But really, Ted & Terry did another amazing job with the writing; I don't know how they do it - much respect. Someone posted the comment that they were trying too hard or forcing things. In my opinion, they observed the way Johnny played his character *Captain* Jack Sparrow and played off of that nicely.Someone also said that DMC was darker. I found it to be more humorous. Capt. Jack was hilarious and Will and Elizabeth also added a bit of comedy here and there.The fight scenes were sensational. I couldn't believe that they actually got to do some of their stunts with the giant wheel. When Norrington, Jack, and Will are all fighting each other while Elizabeth helplessly throws rocks at them there was a roar of laughter in the theatre.On the contrary to what another poster has said I don't believe ""it doesn't take itself seriously."" Johnny Depp wouldn't participate in a film if it wasn't taken seriously. They also said ""unlike the first one the second one wasn't realistic."" Did you forget about the whole cursed pirates never dying and turning into skeletons in the moonlight thing? But it's all fun, and don't spoil that!!Although I thought this movie was fast-paced, exciting, funny, and had a lot of shocking surprises, I'm going to have to disagree again by saying I don't think it was better than the Black Pearl. That person may be saying that because they've just seen Dead Man's Cheast. Perhaps they should watch BP and compare the two. I will say that they are about equal to me.Johnny Depp may be pulling an Adam Sandler by having his fellow co-stars in several movies with him. Some guards in BP and Mackenzie Crook(Ragetti) play in Finding Neverland. Also there is Lor Cutler Beckett from DMC and the third film, At World's End, who's in The Libertine and Pride and Prejudice with Kiera. Comador Norrington is also in The Libertine and the links go on and on. I love when actors do that; it's so fun to see them working together again.We are introduced to some fun new characters, Tia (whom I think though she is hard to look at because of her ugliness might have been one of Captn. Jack's old flings. She really isn't ugly in real life by the way), Davy Jones, Boots-straps Bill and others. Also you will be delighted to see some familiar faces you may not have expected to see. You'll have to go see it to find out who that is!! Captn. Jack is the same, however other characters have changed a bit and I think we'll have to wait until the final film to see what that's about. Will Turner's character has also expanded, but still not completely developed yet I think.Again, perhaps we must wait until the third film.Capt. Jack's entrance was just as good as his entrance in BP - brilliant and might I be so bold to say he is the BEST pirate you've ever heard of. The ending is a shocker. I can't wait to see what will happen next, and Keith Richards (Johnny's inspiration for the character) will make a cameo appearance as Capt. Jack's father!! How cool is that? He was actually supposed to be in this one, but was busy.To the people who keep complaining about the ending leaving them hanging - I'm sure you'll recall that The Lord of Rings didn't have an ending to every movie either, but that is the point!! It's a trilogy. We should be glad they filmed the second and third film at the same time or else it would be coming out even later. And for those people who are saying DMC was a disappointment, I can guarantee they'll be in the theatre watching the third film when it comes out.The ONLY thing I didn't like in the movie (being an animal lover) was the scene when Captn. Jack was being chased by the cannibals and didn't rescue the dog with the key (from the first film) but ran right past him. I thought good ole Captn. Jack will surely swipe him up or turn round for him (after all they do have history together), but sadly he didn't. Then they show the cannibals chasing the poor thing and I as well as some other people in the theatre shook our heads. Awww noooo. *But I'm told I should have stayed until the end of the credits because it has something to do with the dog.* Maybe it's like the first film where after all the credits are finished the monkey takes the medallion. Something to think about; so stay and watch the credits!!This movie will do wonderful because it's a movie the entire family can enjoy - for real!! Truly, age doesn't matter, give this movie a shot and you wont regret it. It's also a good movie for couples because it's not a chick-flick, but the girls will love it just as much as the guys (I know I did). And if you're looking for an adventure this summer, look no further. So just sit back and allow yourself to get lost in it!!Now, you have your heading mates, so cast off and go see it you scalywags. Let's say it all together - Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. The rum is gone? Oh bugger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
*An Epic Voyage Into the Depths of Adventure*,"!! Possible Spoiler !!Set sail on a tumultuous sea of action, humor, and supernatural intrigue, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" delivers an exhilarating continuation of Captain Jack Sparrow's outrageous exploits. This sequel not only expands the beloved universe of the first film but also dives deeper into the lore of the mysterious Davy Jones and the haunting allure of the Flying Dutchman.From the onset, the film's production value is staggering. The cinematography transports viewers to exotic locales teeming with lush jungles, perilous islands, and treacherous waters. Each frame is meticulously crafted, blending stunning visuals with jaw-dropping special effects that elevate our suspension of disbelief. The design of Davy Jones and his crew, with their grotesque features and aquatic essence, encapsulates the film's theme of the eternal struggle between man and monster.Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow remains a cornerstone of the franchise; his eccentricity and charm are on full display, making him one of the most iconic characters in film history. The interplay between Sparrow and his former accomplices, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), injects emotional weight into the narrative, as the stakes grow ever higher with the looming threat of Davy Jones.One of the film's standout aspects is its ability to balance humor and darkness seamlessly. The comedic timing, particularly in Jack's bewildering escapades and quips, is impeccably executed, providing levity amid the encroaching doom. Yet, the film doesn't shy away from exploring darker themes: the price of ambition, the burden of loyalty, and the inevitable consequences of one's choices echo throughout the storyline.The climax of ""Dead Man's Chest"" is nothing short of spectacular, featuring the unforgettable battle between Sparrow's crew and the enigmatic crew of Davy Jones. The fight choreography is breathtaking, blending swordplay with fantastical elements, showcasing the impressive craftsmanship that went into every action sequence. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, propels the narrative forward, enhancing moments of tension and triumph, solidifying its place as a cinematic masterpiece.Ultimately, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is more than just a sequel; it's a bold and imaginative journey into a world where adventure is at every turn. With its unforgettable characters, rich storytelling, and stunning visuals, it captures the essence of what it means to be a pirate and leaves audiences yearning for more. As the winds of the Caribbean howl and the tides of fortune turn, this film stands tall among its peers, ready to be cherished for generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"too much emphasis on the ""undead"" concept","I was surprised that I actually became bored in several scenes with this movie and can say with certainty that I enjoyed Pirates 1 much more. Still, it was very entertaining with plenty of action and laughs. My boredom was with the over-abundance of ""undead"" scenes. Those were my least favorite parts of Pirates 1 and there was just way too much of it in Pirates 2. Those feel too much like scenes from a zombie movie and even though the graphics are superb, they are still lame. If you can take that in stride then its a very worth-while movie to see.Some parents may be uncomfortable with the high levels of gross, gore, and violence in the movie from the very start. Yes, you expect that stuff to be in a movie solely about pirates, but just be aware of it as it could cause nightmares for young children.Overall I enjoyed the movie, but couldn't help feeling it could have been so much better with less emphasis on the zombies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ho ho ho, and a bottle of rum","Captain Jack is back. And how. Where the first Pirates of the Caribbean film was, IMO, bland and too full of Jacks strange ticks and a lot of little things that just didn't work this one is alive with a multitude of good effects, odd happenings, great characters, funny bits and a lot more good bits that add up together really well.It picks up where the first one ended, at least I think it does - I can't remember the first one very well anymore, as I really didn't like it all that much. But after seeing the trailers for this one I thought that this one had a lot of potential to be better than the first one. So I just had to go out and watch this one.So. What is it about? Well. Davy Jones wants Jack to pay of his debt. So Jones goes hunting for Jack. And Jack goes avoiding him and tries, in his own evil way, to avoid him and find a way to get out of his arms forever. And all that, in that setting of beauty, fun and pirate laughter.Good stuff. Several factors better than the first one.

Sea thriller - with so many other narratives in the background,"I went to see this film wondering whether this was going to be yet another cheap Hollywood rip-off movie, fortunately, this was not the case. Johnny Depp, in my opinion, will soon be considered the greatest actor to have ever lived and in his greatest role as the camp Captain Jack Sparrow he didn't let us down. The narrative was brilliant, the graphics were fantastic and I would advise that everyone sees it  the film seems to appeal to all ages. The only disappointment was the inclusion of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom whose soporific acting continued, something which seems to coincide with the whole tradition of being Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. I heard it said that Keira Knightley demanded that she was in a fight scene; I'm surprised the director gave way to her - it seemed rather out of character.Apart from the minor hic-up of two very poor actors, the film was brilliant and the cold Bill Nighy, starring as Davey Jones, was a sensation in his own right. It has many story lines overlapping and I'm sure everyone can at least relate or enjoy one of them. So far this year, for me, this is the must-see movie! n.b. There are quite a lot of references to the original film so for maximum pleasure refer to the previous episodic before watching this one. However, this film is still very good if you haven't seen the first one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, worthy of a super-sized popcorns. But I almost want to rename it POTC: The curse of a sequel","********Spoilers Warning******* Is it worth the wait? Yes for me, and if nothing else, just for seeing Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It was a raucous, fun ride as I expected. The CGI is incredible. It's action packed. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann mature a little bit this time around. And good ol' Jack, one of the most loved pirates in movie history, is as sleazy and funny as ever and always scheming up something. However, this time he's also slightly out of his elements, and not quite sure what he wants. Maybe in the 3rd movie, we will get to know why. Devy Jones might be just the most impressive villain coming out of the movies in the last few years. The ending, with Jack returning to his fearless self and walking into the mouth of Kraken and the return of Barbossa, is absolutely jaw dropping.That said, I walked out of the theater feeling entertained but slightly disappointed. There are too many actions and not enough Jack Sparrow, too many plots and not enough building up of the characters. The film makers are so eager to make sure that this is going to the biggest and the most spectacular ride in Summer and that there will be plenty left for the 3rd installment, they forgot the success of the first POTC is mostly due to unusual and vastly intriguing character(s). Take away Jack Sparrow and there's not much left to watch (OK, there's still Barbossa). Here not only that we have only bits and pieces of Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth suddenly becomes attracted to Jack, Bootstrap Bill came back from nowhere, and seemly dozens of new characters show up with very little background and introduction. They all seem to be lost in the non-stop actions and a very complicated plot.Hopefully everything will fall into place in the final movie. I will definitely see the movie the 1st open weekend. And Disney better not ruins it for me the magic and the enjoyment that came with the 1st one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
(Spoiler Alert) This film is like having a fat man who ate at IHOP run a marathon and then drop a diarrhea dump on your chest and proceed to use your face as toilet paper,"I should preface this review by saying that I was indifferent as to how I might feel about this film going into it. I thought the first film was fairly good. It was entertaining, but nothing that made me yearn for a second one. That being said, I hadn't read a review of this film (and still haven't) and had only heard that it had received mixed reviews. I had tempered expectations going into the theater, but I was certainly open to a good time.A good time was not had. This film was quite simply awful. I have not seen anything in a long time that made me marvel at the fact that it was actually the finished product of a gigantic summer film churned out by a Hollywood Studio. I saw X-Men 3. While that was dreadful, this was eons past X3 in terms of excrement put to celluloid.The plot was akin to a second-grader's class project. There was zero character development and not a single moment in which you thought you were seeing an original thought projected onto the screen. While it is a sequel, at some point the things that happen to the characters should matter, and if something bad happens to a character, the events that have molded him or her to that point should affect the audience somehow. Instead, the tools responsible for this screenplay have events happen without emotionally investing the audience in any way, shape, or form as to the fate of the characters on-screen, simply hoping that writing an event will somehow tug at the heart-strings of the audience without ever having to earn it.I don't know that it is entirely the filmmakers' fault, because it seems that Verbinski & Co. were tied to some P.O.S. script that was churned out in a matter of days to get the cameras rolling, so Disney could bend the movie-goer over and sodomize them while getting paid for it. In the place of an actual story, they were probably told to blow up the film with mind-numbing action sequences and lame special effects.To add insult to injury, the film clocks in at a mere two-and-a-half hours, which for a film with a plot wouldn't bother me in the least, but when you can write out the entire plot of this film in a matter of moments, seeing that paper-thin storyline stretched into 150 minutes is unbearable.I could even make an exception to all of the aforementioned gripes and say that there was something in the film worthwhile if there was one performance from the cast that was mildly amusing. Alas, there is not. The actors all seem to have mailed it in, including Depp, who had a single chuckle-worthy moment as a follow-up to an Oscar-nominated turn in the previous Pirates outing.***********SPOILER ALERT*************** When it comes down to it, all you'll get from this film is an obscenely long prologue to Pirates of the Caribbean 3: The Search for Spock--I mean Jack, because the entire plot of this atrocious piece of refuse is enough to fill a mere introduction to a real story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yo Ho No.,"I just know my daughter is going to kill me if she ever reads this. Normally a young woman of impeccably British cynicism and with barely an iota of emotion, she goes completely to pieces at the sight of Johnny Depp. And Orlando Bloom. Put them both in one movie and she's positively girly. So of course she thinks Pirates of the Caribbean 2; Dead Man's Chest is quite the most wonderful thing since, well, Pirates of the Caribbean 1. And I don't. I'm only giving it 5 stars so she doesn't leave home.Yes Johnny Depp is very nice to look at, (what the hell is he using on his skin? It's just beautiful..) and he is faultless and entertaining again in this his second outing as Captain Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly is lissome and lovely and feisty, and Orlando Bloom is, umm, Orlando Bloom. Sweet, inoffensive, very straight and loyal as Will Turner, and struggling hard not to be completely overwhelmed by Depp. The effects are awesome of course, Bill Nighy is excellent, Naomie Harris is good value, Tom Hollander does ""prissy"" so well etc etc.This is an ""Oh look there's"" movie, as in ""Oh look, there's thingy, wasn't he in......er you know, that TV thing, and oh look there's what's his name.."" You get the idea? But this movie is half an hour too long, way, way too complicated and not as good as the first one, which I thoroughly enjoyed, mostly for its complete honesty. Yes, it was cheesy, but it was high class cheese. Hand-made farm organic Stilton. This is Kraft cheese-food slices. And it's bordering on the cynical, in its efforts to milk every last drop of interest out of the audience. And I'm afraid it lost my interest way before the end. Trilogies rarely work for me, although I'm sure the bankers love them. The only trilogy I've ever seen where part 3 was as good as part 1 is The Lord of the Rings. Somehow I doubt that Pirates 3 will be up to the standard of The Return of the King. Tell me, have they fired every film and story editor in Hollywood? Truly there were at least four places in the last third of the movie where I reached for my handbag thinking ""Well that must be it,"" but no, it dragged on into another scene. And another. And another.More is NOT better. Sometimes less is better. This film could have lost at least 20 minutes, maybe thirty, and it would have been a far better movie for it. We would still have loved Johnny Depp, we would still have gasped at all the clever CGI stuff, we would still have put our hands in our wallets and gone to see part 3. In fact, I'm less inclined to see part 3 after sitting through 150 minutes of this one with my legs crossed. It's ironic that cinema owners love these super sized blockbusters because they fill the cash registers with money from pop corn stuffing and soda slurping kids, then the movie-going experience is ruined because every few minutes after the first hour and a half, someone gets up and clambers all over you to get to the bathroom. They should sell incontinence pants in the foyer, not sodas.I'm not the first person to note that the current tendency for movies to go on and on and on and.... is just way too much. King Kong, Superman Returns, X Men 3. All way too long (although the latter was worth sitting through just to see Hugh Jackman finally take his shirt off.) Enough already!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I like my Sparrow well-done but you can keep the cheese,"Happy to say I thought the movie was OK. Sad to say, I am rating on the lower end of a 7.So much repetition and too much time taken up with repetition. This is one of the few times I will say a movie was too long. But it is because of so much ""same ol', same ol'"". And I am not saying it the same ol' stuff from other movies but the same ol' stuff from the first movie.Jack Sparrow is still entertaining and so is his soul, Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom does everything right. He well deserves his own swashbuckling lead part. Keira's character is a nice ornament that I wouldn't throw out with the rum. But for the other characters, none held any intrigue for me. Don't get me wrong, they fit in but they had nothing spectacular going for them.I think the very best part of the movie was one long action scene that played out some of the best choreographed action I have ever seen. This includes the best 3-party face off since ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". AND this one far exceeds that face off.You should see the movie if you liked the first, but be ready for a very rocky boat ride. Too much dialogue, too little good action, too much ""filler"" action, too many old faces, not enough of anything new and way too long. This movie could have been done in 90 minutes or so - and probably should have. Enjoy it, but don't expect anything except for a lot of makeup. Oh and that reminds me, there is one very interesting make-up scene but not enjoyable as it reminded of a last ditch effort to mix it up just for the sake of mixing it up(sorry, but no spoilers here).I hope the end of the trilogy comes from the heart and not the pocket book as this one obviously did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"Wow. Pirates 2 is almost better then the first! The CSI was amazing... the plot keeps you awake throughout, although you get left hanging at the end. Johnny never ceases to amaze me... his acting is top notch. Orlando and Kiera were great, too. Their characters have expanded a lot since the first movie. I want to go see this again! The very end is definitely a shocker -- I'm so excited for the 3rd installment!! This was definitely my favorite movie of the summer-- you should go see it as soon as you can, if you haven't already. I don't think anybody I know dislikes this movie. Some say it gets boring, but I disagree. It keeps you on your toes!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not exactly a Caribbean Cruise,"This was a fun, rollicking, watery, barnacle encrusted tale of adventure in the Pirate infested West Indies, complete with love, honor, betrayal, revenge, sword-fights and a rain-soaked wedding dress that keeps turning up. The dread pirate Depp, aka Captain Jack Sparrow was in as good a form as ever, and did not disappoint. Appearances of characters we knew from the first film gave the story a familiarity and continuity I hadn't anticipated, and yet the film stands well on its own with lots of characters that have ""history"" with Jack Sparrow - that guy sure gets around! Knightly and Bloom both turned in stronger performances this time around, which was a pleasant surprise. This film is darker than the first, but there are still plenty of comic moments to provide relief, and sufficient complexities to the characters to give depth where you might expect a caricature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Keyword: FUN and ENTERTAINING!,"My best friend had told me that this movie was very entertaining, and his word was proved well after I finished from watching it.It was all about another adventure of the crazy-but-lovable trio, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and this time they were facing someone (or something) far more dangerous than Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It was none other than Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who wanted Jack's soul as payment for his debt.I must say this movie totally blew me off with laughter and excitement. It was so silly in a fun way and made 2.5-hours worth watching until I didn't realize it ended. Depp's acting was superb and I don't think other actors could replace him. It does looks like Depp and Sparrow is one person all this time. Another actor that surprised me was Bill Nighy who played as Davy Jones. Behind his tentacles you can still saw his crazy acting and that was amazing.Although the movie was good and entertaining, it took awhile for me at the beginning of the movie to make the connection between the first one (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  2003) with this one. I have to admit that I forgot some details from the 1st Pirates and yet I need to focus on details in the 2nd Pirates. It was minor though and your memory could easily got refreshed as the movie flows. As for the story, the 1st Pirates had richer story than the sequel, but the sequel had more fun and entertaining scenes, or I would rather say silly and entertaining, which it will make you excited. Anyways, this movie will surely surprised you, especially at the end.In summary, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was one of the great summer movies that worth watching. You may watch the 1st one before the sequel to enjoy this movie better, but that's not a must. Oh, I just want to give you a hint (not a spoiler). If you want, please stay on your seat until the end credit title finished. You will see a scene there, which was made for another laugh only, similar to what they have in Cars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Amusing, but weak","Dead man's chest chooses a very risky road many sequels go for - take what worked in the original and move it up a notch. More is better, and yet more is even more better. Unfortunately, the action-packed plot-heavy movies don't leave enough room for the characters.While I enjoyed the light adventurous atmosphere of ""The curse"", ""Dead man's chest"" with all it's frantic tempo felt like a big mess. Plot moves at relentless speed never pausing to take a breath, one action scene follows another but surprisingly instead of taking me into its grip and not letting go it resulted in boredom. Sure I laughed at some jokes and enjoyed the action here and there but mostly I felt like I'm watching a rushed imitation of something cool. The whole experience was like eating a re-heated gourmet meal - all the right ingredients are there yet it doesn't taste quite the same, and you want to enjoy it but find yourself in constant desire to spit out the chewy cold bits. OK, getting a bit carried away with food metaphors there, but you catch my drift.Perhaps the thing I really didn't like is how ""Pirates 2"" more often misses then it hits the mark. Take the fruit ke-bob bit for example. Funny? Yes, but when Wile E. Coyote does it, for Johnny Depp it is quite embarrassing. Or how about the fact that the monster can sink a ship in a millisecond when only the extras are on board, yet conveniently takes a much more leisurely pace when our heroes happen to sail on it. Twice, for that matter. Or what the hell was with all that hatcheting and murdering? All the sword fights are basically bloodless yet prisoners freely get their throats cut and butchered up with axes? Am I the only one seeing something wrong with that picture? Or the small fact that the movie is not in any way self standing, but basically provides a convenient set-up for Pirates 3. Want to see how it turns out? Pay up, chum! They didn't even try to put up any kind of closure, you only have a weak twist (heavily advertised before the premiere so hardly a twist at all), a mid-scene cut and yay here go the credits. Cheap, cheap gimmick.Anyway, I cannot say I didn't have fun with this flick, but remembering how overjoyed I was with the first one the sequel just left me with a ""eh"" feeling. Not bad, but hardly deserving it's current reputation.6/10 - Disney, be thankful you got Depp, without him this would hardly be a 3-.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2 and a half hours I'll never have back,"Worst movie I've seen in 10 years. Where to begin? This is dark. It is violent. Johnny Depp is no longer acting the role of Capt. Jack, he's mugging it. The plot is confusing and often nothing more than a convoluted way to work in yet another fight scene.If you're looking for the humor found in the first one, you're going to be sorely disappointed.And could we decide what accent Davy Jones is supposed to have, and stick with it?Right up there with Back to the Future II.My recommendation: Avoid it in droves.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It still gets the girls and the audience.,"""They were a rough lot indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly parts of life, and condemned to toss together . . . them that had sailed with the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of . . . ."" R.L StevensonSwishbuckling Johnny Depp as pirate captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reprises a role that in its maiden voyage looked like a great vehicle for Depp to show his many mugging and voice talents. Now he is a caricature of himself endlessly repeating the ticks that once tocked.The pirates are looking for too many treasures, gold and human, so the film ends up being a stew of concepts looking for a rest. Thank goodness for easy-to-look-at Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, a damsel hopelessly caught between her need to save virtuous fiancé Will Turner and her passion for the reprobate Sparrow. The special effects are the same old quick cuts and malleable cosmetics, crafting a crafty Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with moving worms on his face and a kraken with tentacles worthy of Jules Verne but far more believable. Depp is the Errol Flynn of our time but with much deeper talent and narrower taste in women (Vanessa Paradis as a wife is enough for any man in a lifetime).I have little else to say. The original Pirates of the Caribbean was an original and Depp a most creative Sparrow. The second time around it's more of the same, not a stretch or a necessity for an actor of Depp's considerable talent. As for Orlando Bloom, a sizable paycheck for no challenge is a bit like a pirate finding a chest of goldhe doesn't deserve it, but it still gets the girls and the audience.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates 2 Sails into Shallow Waters,"I personally was extremely disappointed in this movie. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan as well as a huge PotC fan, but its sequel fell extremely short of meeting my expectations. Here are the pros, and unfortunately, more cons:Pro: Johnny Depp returns as Jack Sparrow Con: He's not as original and his character seems a little dragged out. At times he can be difficult to understand as wellPro: Amazing Special Effects- Davy Jones' crew & the Kraken Con: Feels a lot like the first one, cursed ship, crew and captainPro: Keira Knightley Con: She's dressed up as a boy for nearly the entire movieSadly, more cons overshadow the pros in this sequelOther cons:-it's a true sequel, nothing new, and grew weaker then the first-Orlando Bloom can not act, he reminds me of a Keanu Reeves with a swaggering English accent (minus the fact he's saving a girl, not the world)-it fully relies on the fact that there will be a 3rd movie, unlike the first PotC (which was it's own movie overall), Pirates 2 abruptly ends without a real conclusion, just a lead on to number 3-the plot is poorly played out and drags on for nearly three hours-Johnny Depp has a lot less screen time than Pirates 1Overall, I was extremely disappointed in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and really hoped it would be at least as good as the first one. But leave it to Hollywood to keep the whole tradition of 'sequels never surpassing the originals' to its utmost meaning.Visuals: 9/10Music: 8/10Story: 6/10Acting: 7/10Flow: 5/10Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Thrill Ride,"I was one of the die hard fans that attended the midnight showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest , early on Friday morning and had absolutely no problems staying awake. It's a total shot of adrenaline.They've provided stellar special effects, acting, and all around entertainment equally for men and women and have done a wonderful job building for the next one to be released in 2007 (thank goodness we knew that before seeing the movie, because I carefully paid attention to all the clues there might be hidden in this one which were building for the next one). Yes, they have done everything in this movie with something for everyone. They even sophisticatedly poked fun at the first Pirates Black Pearle in a few places.A couple of days later, I watched a History Channel presentation of ""True Caribbean Pirates"" which profiled some of the better known historical Caribbean/African/Etc. pirates of the era and have an even higher regard for the research and writing that Ted and Terry have done for Dead Man's Chest.Both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's characters have matured quite a bit in this movie and they command their own piece of it. Their characters face all kinds of ""real"" obstacles and are still dancing around each other in a wonderfully optimistic way.What can I say about Jack Sparrow, uhhh I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow; he is a brilliant mixture of daring, brave, chicken, sexy, careful, ohhh I could go on and on. But he's definitely a pirate.You will enjoy this movie, there's no way you can't. Now, I'm counting down to Memorial Day weekend 2007 when #3 is released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Watching Space...,"I really feel like I just watched 2 hours of Space. Like what they had to say was really just about 30 minutes worth of plot movement and the rest was to show case their academy nominated talent and amazing vfx. This was more the promo video at a scifi convention and less the movie part 1 was made of.The actors really flopped as well. Jack Sparrow was wonderful, but Johnny seldom fails in his delivery. Sometimes he picks bad scripts, but regardless his delivery is always on. He was the only human actor that did this with this plot less tale. Orlando and Keira really missed the mark. Sometimes you can tell when an actor is already swinging for the fences and strikes out completely.With these two actors that is exactly what happened. There was no levels in their performance and no memorable moment.The second savior of the film (The first being Jack Sparrow) was Davy Jones. WELL DONE!!! I am so glad I live in an age where claytronics don't exist and characters like Davey Jones does. I couldn't stop staring and couldn't get enough. Jerry Bruckheimer should be kissing who ever did the VFX's rear, because without that this movie would have flopped.At the very least he should give his writers a smack on the wrists as they didn't fill the void of a second movie with amazing content, instead they left it empty with the occasional change of scenery.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Satisfying Sequel,"The sequel to the 2003 mega-hit 'Pirates of the Caribbean' begins shortly where the first film left off. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightley) marriage is cancelled when the two, along with Norrington (Jack Davenport) are arrested and set to hang because of their involvement in Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) escape. The arrests seem to be a scheming plan of new character Cutler Beckett (Tom Hallander) who offers Will and Elizabeth a pardon if Will sets out to find Jack and return with his compass. Jack, meanwhile sailing the high seas, has received some disturbing news from beyond the sea-grave; he has to pay his debt to Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy) who turned Jack into captain of the black pearl 13 years ago in exchange for his soul. Will Turner gets caught up in Jack's predicament, as does Elizabeth who is hot on the duo's trail, having escaped from prison.This sequel has received mixed reviews; and it seems there is no middle ground when it comes to audience opinion of 'Dean Man's Chest'  you either love it, or you hate it. I loved it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than the first film, but it was a satisfying sequel that left me anxious for the third and final installment. The CGI effects are phenomenal, Johnny Depp is (as always) an absolute delight to watch and the film really does very nicely set-up the storyline for the third sequel 'At World's End' (2007).'Dead Man's Chest' is notably darker than the 'Curse of the Black Pearl'  there's more horror, gross-out moments and violence  it isn't over the top, the darkness actually adds a mature angle to the film, and makes it stand out from the original. Where 'Curse of the Black Pearl' was decidedly family-friendly, 'Dead Man's Chest' is aiming for an older demographic.There weren't as many laughs in this film as there were in the original, and there are less quotable lines  understandably the best laugh out loud moments come from Johnny Depp, who is able to once again reveal the depths of his talent and show what an able comedian he is. Depp has particularly impressive command over physical comedy (as was evident in 'Curse of the Black Peal', but is absolutely fantastic in 'Dead Man's Chest'). Though they both really rose to fame because of 'Curse of the Black Pearl', Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom (especially Bloom) are no match for Johnny Depp who is the real power-house of the franchise. The writers clearly understand what an iconic character Jack Sparrow has become, with his own cult following and fandom; thus certain story lines are added to satisfy the throngs of Sparrow fans (like the tension between Jack and Elizabeth) and Johnny is given ample opportunity to give the audience everything they loved about Jack in the original, ten times over in the sequel. Which is great  Johnny Depp is responsible for making these films what they are.All in all a very satisfying sequel  not as great as the original, but plenty of Jack Sparrow screen time, a darker angle and fantastic lead-up to the final installment make this a very enjoyable film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"There's no shortage of pirates, that's for sure","Let me start by saying that I really loved the first ""Pirates"", and watched it 3 times. I was looking forward to this sequel. It proved to be an adequate sequel in that it connected the first movie to a (yet unreleased) third, but that is about all. Don't get me wrong: I liked many things about this movie: the special effects were great, the diversity of the pirates was enhanced (I particularly liked the hammerhead guy), and the line between good and evil was blurred, which is a good thing in a pirate movie.The main shortcoming of this movie is that it has only two talented actors: Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy (Davey Jones). The rest give a bland, forgettable performance that does not even rise to the level of a caricature. Bloom and Knightley seem to have the chemistry of Bill and Hillary Clinton: during the fighting scene she doesn't seem to care her fiancé is in danger and doesn't come to his aid. It's each one for himself in this movie, be they engaged to be married, good friends or longtime shipmates. There is no camaraderie, there is no love, and there is no loyalty.The fighting scenes are good at times, silly at others (the watermill wheel sequence is a good example), and the plot line is very thin indeed. I got to hand it to the director, though: no one has ever had more pirates featured in a pirate movie: with the exception of a few British soldiers and some cannibals, every one in this movie is a pirate. Even those who didn't start out as pirates become so before the end credits role. Oddly enough none of them are ever seen robbing merchant ships or innocent civilians, but occupy all of their time pursuing hidden treasure chests and Jamaican-accented witches who know how to find them.But overall, I can't say I felt like asking for my money back. It was good entertainment for $9, and I will give the third installment a try. Who knows? They might introduce non-pirate characters and have Jack Sparrow and the Kraken live happily ever after (there must be SOME chemistry, Verbinski!).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Twisted fun!,"What a fun, demented movie! After the original pirates, I wasn't sure if a sequel could stay as clever and offbeat, but Dean Man's Chest delivers on nearly every front! Yes, it's great to see Johnny Depp's bizarre creation, Jack Sparrow, again, and this time to peer into his mind. The original film never really took a close look at the character, who returns this time with motivation, complexity, and (perhaps) genuine conflicting emotions. This installment also takes care of Orlando Bloom, whose character is given much more of a chance to be both leading man and action hero. Only Keira Knightley is given the short shrift, giving a great performance but only having a few scenes that really give her a chance to do anything with her character.The special effects are as spectacular as it gets in this jaded age of CGI, and the fight sequences are intense and energetic. But what I loved the most about this movie was how wonderfully weird and demented it is. I won't give anything away, but just from the trailer you can already see Jack's eye makeup, a duel on a rolling mill wheel, and a villain with an octopus for a head, all much fresher and more demented than anything you usually find in Hollywood outside of the realm of Tim Burton. I had no idea Disney did things like that! This movie definitely lacks the strong, uncontrived storyline of its predecessor, clumsily maneuvering a number of contrivances to get the story rolling. The resulting plot is more a travelogue than anything, but fun nevertheless. It also picks up speed toward the end, and, for a film that sets itself up for the next installment, still works pretty well as standalone fare.Anyway, this movie, like the first, is first and foremost an exercise in camp and offbeat swashbucklery, which it delivers beautifully. Be warned that there are frequent references to the original film, many of them clever, others quite predictable. Still, as an extension of the original world and characters of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie excels takes the cake, and in terms of blockbuster entertainment, there's nothing fresher or better under the sun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"This is one of the worst sequels that I've ever seen in my entire life. Usually after seeing a bad movie, I shake it off and don't worry about it, but this one made me leave the theater actually upset. I felt ripped off. It was the corniest movie I may have ever seen in my life. I would suggest anybody to go see Shaquille O'Neil's next movie if he ever comes out with one over that movie. So, the movie in summation; Two thumbs down, $8.50 wasted, two hours wasted, and bombed expectations! It seemed as though they didn't make an attempt to create any irony during the whole film. The plot was a rip off of treasure island, and a lot of the mini-side plots were incongruous to the film's entirety.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There are some fantastic special effects (Davy Jones for instance) and a lot of really fun scenes, but I came out of the cinema thinking ""huh?""The script is really disjointed, and there seem to be large sections added in just for the sake of creating action sequences (if you see it you'll know what sections I mean). The storyline is too complex and you are expected to understand who characters are and their motivations without these being explained very well.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest:The Doc's Review,"Pirates 2 is a good film that is easily enjoyable no matter what age group the audience consists of.A lot of humour and some gorgeous cinematography with some breath taking visuals.The voodoo woman was a very neat character she was spooky yet enticing and a really intriguing new character.Davy Jones was a pretty cool new character as well not and not only was the cgi masterful the fight scenes were just as fantastic.I enjoyed the fact that everyone had a darker,more selfish side and personally that seems more believable of pirates than the ""noone gets left behind"" attitude in The Curse Of The Black Pearl.Everyone is as greedy as each other and soon enough they accomplish what they set out to get but then fight over who gets it.My only criticism for Pirates 2 is that the action is far too spaced apart and it at times flows at a slower pace than expected.Unfortunately no battle occurred in this film however there is a great little three way sword fight,and some cool monster fighting scenes in there as well.Pirates 2 is overall great fun and contains an ending that is as good as that of The Sixth Sense or Saw.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"On the whole, disappointed","Pirates  OK, first the disclaimer. The first Pirates replaced Superman the Movie as my favorite movie of all time. I loved the script, the banter, the clever lines, the cinematography, everything. It was a perfect movie. So this Pirates had a huge uphill battle and it failed pretty convincingly.So what made Jack Sparrow such an interesting character in the first movie? After all he was a ""bad guy"", a pirate; yet we rooted for him. Will Turner summed it up when he proclaims Jack as a ""good man"" (what Jack called Will's father, Bootstrap). In the first movie Jack risks everything to save Elizabeth. He rescues Will. So he is worthy of redemption at the end, and that's why we root for him. In the new movie Jack is much more the scoundrel and less the hero. That is a HUGE error. How can we root for a villain? The first movie was so beautifully choreographed. Dark scene (literally  night), then bright scene and back and forth. New movie  mostly Dark Scenes. First movie had many great lines. Second time Jack shows up in front of Barbosa and Barbosa exclaims ""impossible"". Jack corrects him with ""improbable"". Just an example of a terrific line. Very few of these in the new movie. Will and Elizabeth were very good in the new movie.Music was great, special effects were excellent although some were hard to see in the darkness.I give this movie a 6 but then add a point because is is a MUST SEE movie. Afterall, it is the highest (by far) single day grossing movie of all time.So the movie gets a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If You Want MORE, You've GOT IT!!!","It's pretty much a rule written in stone about sequels: if you want to be as successful with a follow-up as you were with the original, you MUST raise your game. If you had glamour the first time around, it has to be MORE glamorous. The suspense must be MORE suspenseful, the gore gorier, the flash flashier...well, you get the picture.With the track record of such gems as INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR TREK 2: THE WRATH OF KHAN, I was hoping that the creative crew behind the first PIRATES would bear all of these in mind, and join them in their glorious achievements, instead of coming up with something as downright awful as, say, SPEED 2. I needn't have worried.The magic is definitely back, and DEAD MAN'S CHEST is probably the best sequel you will see all year. If MORE is what you've been craving, you'll have a full belly before this one is even half-over!No time is wasted jumping right into where BLACK PEARL left off. A morose Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) thinks she's been left at the altar by fiancée Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), but such is not the case. Soon she, Will and even her father, Gov. Weatherbee Swann (Jonathan Pryce) will all be arrested for aiding and abetting one Capt. Jack Sparrow in Part One. But there's more treachery afoot here than even a pirate could dream up. Certain ""agents"" representing the East India Trading Company want possession of Jack's mystic compass. The compass is the key to finding yet another key...the one that opens up that object of fabled myth, Davy Jones' locker. And anyone who can grab what's inside the locker can ultimately control the Seven Seas.And that's just going into what THEY want. Jack Sparrow wants the key to the locker to escape a fate far worse than death...an eternity of servitude as one of Jones' crustacean-encrusted crew, on board the hellish ghost ship The Flying Dutchman, to fulfill a debt that Jack never repaid. (BIG surprise.) So yes, MORE story is only the tip of the iceberg here. Bloom and Knightley as the prettiest characters in the cast have much more to do, but they also go through more changes. A lot of their naiveté has gone since their last misadventures with Sparrow, and a lot more will disappear before the movie's end. It's rather refreshing to see that even the ""good guys"" here can have some conflicted moral dilemmas to work through.And yes, dear Jack. What was shocking before has now become normal, even almost endearing, as this swashbuckling stew of Keith Richards, Pepe le Pew and maybe even a little Prince thrown in for extra flavor, slashes and sashays his way from one predicament to the next with a boozy, blustery bonhomie.Not to be outdone is Bill Nighy as the fearsome Captain Jones, who projects both melancholy and menace through some of the ookiest CGI layers since Andy Serkis got behind Gollum. You won't see a more frightening or fascinating villain this summer. And new addition Naomie Harris (28 DAYS LATER) as the eerie swamp witch Tia Dalma, sinks her teeth into the pivotal role like it was a seven-course gourmet meal. She HAS to come back for Part Three!I so want to go over how great each returning cast member and character was, but I'll let you plumb the depths of those surprises and pleasures yourself. Gore Verbinski, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and Jerry Bruckheimer will be happy to know that their sequel definitely goes into the Hall of Fame with the other heavy hitters, (and that's before you even take into account the dizzying box-office returns.) It does run a little long at over two hours, but for pure entertainment, you won't want to miss this one. And if what you're already getting wasn't enough, wait until you get a gander at the gasp-inducing ending. Not since EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or the first KILL BILL has there been a climax that has you climbing the walls and yelling ""NOOOO! What happens NEXT???"" See ya in about two years, when they answer THAT question...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Too long!,"I saw this move pretty late at night and I don't know if I was in the wrong frame of mind to watch this movie but I thought that they were trying to do too much in one movie. Too many plot lines, too many characters, however interesting they may be, too many story lines. My main problem with this movie is the length. 150 minutes is a long time for any movie, but especially one of this nature. This has huge entertainment value, in other words people come to see this movie for fun. It loses much of that due to some slow parts during the movie. Possible I need to watch the first movie again to get into the spirit. However the effects of Davy Jones and his crew are impressive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Swashbuckling at its Best,"Before I give you the review I must give you the preamble. I was going to a 10:00 showing Friday Night, got there an hour early and the line was about three yards from the door. Before we got seated, it was out the door. And a group of six white-haired ladies cut in front of us in the line. It would have been funny if it weren't so incredibly rude.The movie itself was quite amazing, the makeup was frightening the special effects were awesome but we didn't expect any less. Even though the advertisements proclaim that Captain Jack is back, everyone else gets a lot more character development in this film, especially Will, Elizabeth, and Norrington-who looks much better without a white wig. Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg, and Kevin McNally all return to their roles, which have been greatly expanded.New characters appear including the shockingly horrible Davy Jones, and Bootstrap Bill Turner. And the Kracken, which I won't ruin by telling you about it.There's much more slapstick, which I highly enjoyed, to this one and everyone gets to participate. I warn you now, the ending is a HUGE cliffhanger.Overall, it was a wonderful film and highly enjoyable, and while it is two and a half hours long, it doesn't feel that way, because you never get bored.

Enormously trumped up and overrated!!!!!!,"PotC2 is one of those movies that has a lot of great assets to it, but then has so many damn plot holes and unfinished business that you want to punch Keira Knightley for being such a hot snob...? The main characters were lousy: Johnny Depp was just average, Keira Knightley's character was loathsome, especially towards the end of the film, Orlando Bloom was the most likable, and most heroic...The movie's sole redeeming features were the unbelievable FX. Davy Jones' crew and himself were over the top and badass, but the film's main monster was kind of a letdown. The film was also too damn long, with some scenes growing monotonous even with crazy crap going on. Man, I was disappointed with this flick; all I wanted to do was be entertained, and I ended up hating Keira Knightley, and Jack Sparrow for that matter. Maybe the next one will give a little rehash on Sparrow's life, and possibly redeem the lackluster screen time he had in this FX laden, FX carrying, letdown. Did I mention the Fx were great?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I didn't like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"Johnny Depp is enjoyable, as usual. However, the story line is drawn out and filled with emotional drama, as if we were watching a soap opera. The story line did not come to a close, the movie ended right in the middle of a stunning moment. I left the movie theater feeling disappointed. I will not be looking forward to #3 coming out to the theater, I will wait for release on DVD.This movie had the same kind of humor and action as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" however, it becomes entangled in a lot of emotional grief that never comes to an end. If they had all come to a conclusion at the end, or at some point in the movie, then I believe it would have been an excellent movie to watch.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Verbinski loses the fun plot. Still a good ride, but not a great one.","One gets the impression from ""Dead Man's Chest"" that Gore Verbinski either lost the fun parts of the script from the last half of this movie, or that he reviewed the script from the forthcoming third movie and realized there was too much left in the fx budget and not enough juice left in the script. So wide was the disparity between fx and writing that he seemed to need to spread one thickly and one far too thinly.The movie rambles along nicely enough for the first hour and 20 minutes, very much in the vein of the first, tightly directed, plot well built, some decent jokes and neat ""in"" jokes to keep fans intrigued. What follows though is comparatively very dark.Without entering into the arena of spoilerdom; the plot line goes off on an elongated wander apparently intended to ignite interest in the third installment, but actually in serious danger of extinguishing interest. We see some very tired devices attempting to twist the plot, but in truth far more suited to a bad episode of ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"". Sexual intrigue which isn't intriguing, wholly unbelievable character reversal and re-reversals, the re-introduction of an unnecessary character and a lame attempt to draw on the audience's emotions by the elimination of another.Verbinski also seems unduly obsessed by the use of paranormal characters to add wow. He fails almost completely. What actually occurs is that we become almost ""effects weary"" by the continued use of jaded devices which are not original the first time they appear in this movie, never mind that they are rolled out time and time again. It feels like one is being beaten over the head with them. The first movie benefited greatly from the occasional displays of the ""curse"". No such subtlety exists here.Taken in isolation, this movie could be pronounced an entertaining spectacle, but perhaps Disney has created a rod for their back by attempting to recreate the magic and the excellence of the first twice more.This story cannot stand by itself, much as the second Matrix was a meaningless ramble without the third. That series remains a flawed tale, we can only hope that Pirates finds it's touch on the third outing. After such an excellent start it would be a dreadful waste of excellent talent for if the third were nearly as unsatisfying as this disappointing follow-up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best comedy/action movie of the year,"Brilliant movie... one of, if not the best sequel I have ever seen, even more one liners that the first movie. Johnny Depp is again brilliant as the drunken pirate, as his interviews state, he has borrowed a lot when developing his character from his friend Keith Richards (Rolling Stones) and it shows. This movie opens up the unanswered questions from the first, ie, how did he become the drunken pirate, where/how did he get the Black Pearl etc etc. It gives a great deal of anticipation for the third movie in the series. Not to be missed...great in a home theatre..........awesome in a good wide-screen movie theatre with decent surround sound, ( even the seats vibrate from the thunder of cannons)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A little less then a full bottle of rum.,"With the first ""Pirates"" movie, I went into not expecting much. The second time around, my hopes where much higher for this movie, yet unfortunately they were unfulfilled. Most of the humor of the movie was just run-offs from the last movie, beating the ""rum"" running gag to death. They seemed to spend all their time with special effects instead of investing it into making an easy to follow plot. The swash-buckling feel the first ""Pirates"" left you with seemed to be absent from this movie. Instead, you were just wondering how much longer was left in the movie.There were bright points to this movie, such as Jack Davenport as Norrington. Johnny Depp will not disappoint his legion of teeny-bopper fans that fell in love with him in the first ""Pirates"" though, it may make some more die hard Johnny fans disappointed to see him play the same character once again.Some are calling this the new age's ""Empire Strikes Back,"" but I think a closer association would be to ""Phantom Menace."" For me, I'll just leave my midnight showings to ""Harry Potter"" from now on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Dead Man's Chest"" starts out great but somewhere near the end it loses steam and becomes ultimately disappointing.","In the sequel to the 2003 hit, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny ""The Man"" Depp) is being haunted by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a ghost pirate who wants Jack's soul unless Jack can get him 100 souls in exchange for his own. To make matters worse both Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must join Jack's voyage in order to steal Jack's compass for Commodore Norrington in exchange for their lives. A decent however disappointing sequel ensuesRight off the bat, I am going to state that I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp. He is my favorite actor and I think he is great at every role he plays. I also really enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film which was a great and unique summer blockbuster that I personally own on DVD. With that being said, I have been looking forward to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" for many months now and when I finally saw it on opening day, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.Its hard to say what went wrong with ""Dead Man's Chest"" because I have talked to several people about the film before writing this review including my girlfriend and some of my friends at work and no one hated the film, but just felt disappointed by it. From what I gathered people found this movie disappointing for two reasons which I will address as my review continues below.Personally, I found the first 2/3 of the film to be every bit as good as the original film however when the film begins to show Davy Jones as a major threat, is where I feel the film goes down hill. The problem with the film at this point is that it begins to go special effects happy and shows this huge battle involving an octopus and every person who I asked about the film said this scene never seemed to end. The scene in my opinion reminded me a lot of the 3rd Matrix film, ""Matrix Revolutions"" which as we all know wasn't as good as we hoped. The scene I am referring to is the battle of Zion in ""Matrix Revolutions"" because that scene never seemed to end and neither did the scene in ""Dead Man's Chest"" where Jack Sparrow and the gang were battling the octopus. This is the first main problem and if this scene was cut down to say 10 minutes it would have worked quite well however it was overlong and became repetitive and boring.The second problem is the ending which basically without giving anything away leaves the audience unsatisfied and makes the entire second film seem like a marketing scheme in order to see the 3rd film. Personally even though the ending upset me to no end and left me wanting more, I know for a fact I will be in the theater when the 3rd one opens next year because I am curious to find out what happens. But this may not work for anyone because when everyone saw the 2nd Matrix film and was disappointed, the 3rd one was very poorly attended at the theater. I hope this doesn't happen with Pirates like it did with the Matrix but who knows. All the director Gore Verbinski had to do was create an ending that didn't seem like a tie-in ending and he could have literally made millions happy.Other then those two things I really can't say there was anything else wrong with the film. I still loved Captain Jack Sparrow and as I previously stated I thought that most of the film was great up until the last 40 minutes or so which just seemed so drawn out and repetitive. Seeing the fact that I really loved the first film and I am a big fan of Johnny Depp I was expecting a great sequel and although the sequel wasn't horrible or unwatchable by any means, it just didn't live up to the greatness of the first film. The first film is probably a solid 8 out of 10 maybe a 9 if you want to give it credit for being a solid summer blockbuster however ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very weak 7 because the film just seems to never end and when it does end it just leaves the audience feeling cheated.I will recommend this film because I think it was a decent sequel however be forewarned that it does not live up to the hype nor the first film. I am crossing my fingers for the 3rd one and hoping that the final installment will be outstanding and blow the other two films out of the water (no pun intended). Go see ""Dead Man's Chest"" for Capitan Jack because he is still without a doubt the best part of the film and is part of all the best scenes in this decent however disappointing sequel.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

worse than lost in space,"This has to be the worse sequel ever made. The entire film is jerky. It does not have the same flow as the first.

And then there are the scenes that were totally unnecessary and do nothing for the story at all.The effects are sub par when compared to the first one as is the dialog.Do not waste your time and money here people. Lost in Space was a better movie. The Mod Squad was a better movie.

Great Cliffhanger,"Originally I was going to see The Da Vinci Code this weekend but instead wound up seeing Pirates of the Caribbean DMC. I must say I was in for an an unexpected treat. I did like the first one but didn't really expect much as far as a continuing plot goes. The second movie comes out with both guns a blazing. There is plenty of great stunt work and even better plenty of plot with just the right balance of CGI. The actor who plays Davy Jones who was also in Underworld and Love Actually is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors. He carries a certain amount of charm and subtlety which one can see even through all the tentacles of the squid effects. Depp returns with all the great mannerisms that made Captain Jack Sparrow a household name. True he didn't exactly come out of left field as he did with the first movie, but one just has to love this character if not merely for the fact you never know what he will do next. Good supporting roles by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly although I would like to have seen Knightly's character be a bit more brash. Oh well perhaps in the third installment. I say bring on the scalawags. I can't wait to see how it ends.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good, but it's no Black Pearl...","I must say I'm quite torn in regards to my feelings on this movie, and I'll explain why. The movie has equally good and bad points, and although the good outweighs the bad, the film as a whole feels quite odd. On the one hand the movie had a lot to live up to, the first movie was great. Great characters, great action set pieces, great villains, and great humor. So dead mans chest, like all blockbuster sequels had to try and out-do everything about the first film and in the end, that is it's greatest weakness. It feels like a popcorn movie in parts, but too often it is way too serious. It's entertaining when the action hits, but again, for a popcorn movie, it's too frigging long.Most of the cast from the first film returns and they are just as good this time around (except when they double dip on jokes which usually gets more of a sigh than a laugh). Jack Sparrow is funny as always, but it's getting harder for the character to carry the film, since there isn't much more to him than there was in the first. Normally I wouldn't mind with a popcorn movie but a lot of scenes in this one are darker, and his character is a tad too silly to fit in to them. Will Turner gets the most interesting story, and Elizabeth Swan gets, well the background really.As for the villains, they are possibly the movies greatest downfall. Davey Jones is not an intimidating character, and his crew of sea creature folk have little or no character. Full props to Bill Nighy for creating an interesting character out of nothing, but in the end he simply doesn't live up to the charm and menace that Geoffory rush brought to the first movie. The real villain of the piece is the Krakken and once that thing gets going, you know sh*t is going to hit the fan.The movie as a whole isn't all that bad, it's certainly better than most blockbuster flicks, and would work a lot better on it's own but following on from the first film it's just a slight let down. It could easily lose the first half hour as it's really forgettable. There's a side story involving, well I wont give it away but you'll know when you see it that it's really not interesting in the least. The general feel of the film also feels too broken up, there really isn't a proper flow to any of the proceedings and often, the story just feels like a mixture of cool ideas, but without one story to tie them all together properly.The movie does have high points, scenes which really make it worth seeing, but it's a case of too little, too late as they mostly occur much later in the movie. These include the 3 way sword fight on a giant rolling wheel, the Krakken scene, and the rather hilarious chase for the titular chest. Special note must also go to the special effects which are, simply put, the most believable CG shots ever put on film. The CG characters that reside on the Flying Dutchman (Davey Jones ship) and Davey Jones himself are so believable, you wont even find yourself thinking they aren't real.So, in the end, it's a fun ride (more so in the second half) with all the great character returning from the first, only hampered by slightly weak villains, a ridiculously long run-time, and a weaker story. The action is fun on a bun, and the twist at the end certainly brought a smile to my face. I can only hope the third film is slightly better and more fun.3.5 out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
about as twisty and preposterous (and illogically fun) as a summer blockbuster gets,"I didn't expect the moon to be delivered by the sequel to the Pirates of the Caribbean because, frankly, the first film wasn't an awe-inspiring great blockbuster to begin with. It's a franchise based on a ride at a theme park, so you do know what you'll be getting when you enter into the film, which is a story that is less palatable as the action set pieces and sequences. In fact, I'd say I found this sequel to be on par with the first, with maybe a couple of very nice touches with two of the sequences. And, of course, there's Johnny Depp who is like both the magician and the rabbit that's getting pulled out of the hat- you don't know what's up his sleeve, but his mannerisms and facial expressions are also so obvious and over-the-top. He's created one of the more endearingly nutty and more often than not laugh-out-loud funny characters in a Hollywood blockbuster with this and the previous film, and if for nothing else he's worth seeing.But getting back to the pros and cons of the film. To those who've written (and I've read a few comments) saying this is the next Empire Strikes Back have, forgive me for saying, a screw-loose. Dead Man's Chest happens to not be too unique in one aspect- it pumps up so much contrivance in the plot turns that one is asked not to take it too seriously, but to keep it all in mind at the same time. And it's also, like with the previous Pirates entry, overlong as well in trying to fit in every note, this time mostly for the sake of part 3 coming up (with a 'wtf' twist at the very end). But, of course, most will not go expecting that logical or coherent a story, the bang-for-your buck sequences are where it's at, not to mention visual effects, and the filmmakers don't lack too much of that. The two favorites for me is the sort of wild goose chase over the island where Sparrow and Bloom and the others run from a group of crazed natives, and the big climax involving Davy Jones's huge monster against the black pearl.These scenes, with a few minor specks here and there, do make the film entertaining enough for a good 'popcorn' movie sit through once over. And there are even a couple of very funny lines or physical gags that might be worth mentioning to friends once the lights go up (and Davy Jones and his crew are a nice step-up from the skeletons in the last film). It's shame then that the same good in what can come with shallow, big-budget flicks like these don't carry the same creds with a good enough story. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth the price of admission? Yes!! Worth seeing 7 times?,"hmmm...I cannot imagine a movie I have wanted to see more (since birth). Pirates. Arrgh (and all that).

The Johnny Depp show?!............,"The Curse of the Black Pearl was a good film to watch it was funny, witty, spectacular and well paced entertainment, basically it had everything it needed to have to be a MASSIVE success.Dead Man's Chest really does do much of the same to be honest. Did they need to make a sequel though?!...Probably not buts its all about the $$$$$$$. The first movie did amazing numbers at the Box Office and DMC seems to be doing much of the same and BETTER.The problem with Dead Man's Chest compared to its predecessor is that its not a lot different and if anything its a wee bit inferior. Its become a little self indulgent in regards to Johnny Depp's character and has just become the CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW SHOW.The other characters in the movie do not develop any further from the first. The Villain is played wonderfully by Bill Nighly but is no match to Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa in Black Pearl, The plots not as quirky and is possibly a little complicated for the target audience. The CGI is spectacular but over-used and the running time is TOO LONG by about 30 minutes.Overall its a good effort for a sequel and I hope that the 3rd in the trilogy will continue this trend, but we will wait in see.6/10, Entertaining and enjoyable but a bit too long and inferior to the wonderful gem which is the first movie, Pirate's of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Rich Special Effects, Sometimes Entertaining, Too Long","Immediate reaction was I was wasting a beautiful afternoon watching a pirate movie which is only about half as entertaining as (recent DVD release) Yellowbeard.Dead Man's Chest is yet another film turning to moments of crushing boredom as it drags through scenes which really answer the question ""at what point does brilliant become passe?"" The first Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Peral was pretty good. This I had high hopes for, but found myself suspecting Dead Man's Chest was going to become a marketing vehicle for a whole new theme park of pirate rides.This isn't to say there aren't some good bits, I rather think Bill Nighy as Davy Jones delivers a delectable amount of menace, but Bill's an outstanding actor (see him in Love Actually or Girl in the Cafe.) The rest really fit into B movies in terms of credibility. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, however, is unconvincing as a pirate captain. He strikes me as a twenty-something in charge of a ship of 40 somethings. (Might this be a parallel to the way today's businesses are managed?) Perhaps Tim Curry could have reprised his Long John Silver from the Muppet caper.All in all, the viewer should know by now that PotC is another in a series of films with the second and third installments largely done at the same time to form a serial. There will be the culmination (one hopes) of this buccaneering (without ever actually looting one Spanish galleon of a single piece of eight) featuring Keith Richards as somebody'd father in 2007.

"""There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""","The quote in the summary is from Shakespeare and while not wanting to appear pretentious, I thought I would try something different in this mini-essay, something more along the lines of a critical assessment than an actual review (irrelevant now -- the audience has spoken, decisively) because I believe many of the A-list critics (see www.rottentomatoes.com for the grim details), missed the boat on this wonderful film.This is a fully and beautifully realized world of myth, magic, and voodoo and happily everyone keeps a straight face as they confront it. If the symbology is a bit too literal at times, well, the sea brings that out in people, particularly in this part of the world of three centuries ago. Where creatures, such as the Kraken, a beast of relentless fury, can be slowed but not stopped. Where the ""heartless"" Davy Jones collides with the Flying Dutchman (a conflation that I believe is a first). And where, despite the rich fantasy, the emotions, conflicts, psychologies are all too real, even in Jack Sparrow (the role Johnny Depp was born to play). He is heading for a terrible fall, as in truth are all the major characters. Elizabeth has come to understand that whatever the degree of her attraction for Jack, the man simply cannot be trusted. His core is hollow, which I suspect Jack himself now realizes and is at the root of his deep problem that he no longer knows what he wants. He knows what he doesn't want, to be sure, yet it is unclear to what degree he can fight back against even that realization. And poor Will Turner, clearly stretched to the limit, is in a situation nearly as bad. Others are also in supreme jeopardy. (One of the great things about this film is the taking of minor characters from the first film, such as Norrington, and putting them head to head against Sparrow and Turner -- and watching them hold their own as they come to grips with their own fate.)In short, there is the possibility for great tragedy here -- if the writers have the courage to follow through (no more rum and cross-dressing jokes, please!) Could we have a Hamlet on the high seas? I believe we could. The elements are there -- but will marketing permit it? It's anyone's guess. Following the analogy of POTC:DMC being the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy, we all know what happened in that case: will a great opportunity be lost as we endure the sea-going equivalent of ""Ewoks?"" Or worse? I am worried. As is well-known, shooting of the third film began before the script was complete, a bad sign. The next installment could go all the way (on the order of ET and Titanic), but it would be foolish to count on it.Still to have come this far is an incredible achievement. To those A-list critics (3:2 against) who either did not watch the movie or could not bring themselves to view the first film -- there's a reason it's called a sequel, guys -- for shame. But as noted, the public, and indeed the world, has spoken. Good luck to all people involved in the production of the concluding film : ""At World's End.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An excellent sequel to an excellent movie.,"This is my favorite movie so far this Summer. Click was also a fantastic film, but this beat it out by a long-shot! First of all, let's display the GOOD qualities.The CGI(Computer Graphics: Special Effects: Phenomenal... Absolutely fantastic. I usually can't tell what's real or not in this film. A 10/10Story: Davy Jones has been mentioned in various movies, but NEVER has he been done as an actual character. Now, everyone will finally understand why Davy Jones is part of the sea... A 9/10Cast and Crew: I've watched some of the footage taken from the production of the film, and saw how much blood and sweat was used in the making of this movie... Johnny Depp is reprising his role as expected... A drunk pirate that moves around as if he had Cerebral Palsy, however, Orlando Bloom isn't doing quite as well.. I never was a huge fan of him, but he does a decent job as a swashbuckling pirate that forgot to buckle his swash...=) Keira Nightly is just as believable as Depp in my opinion. She was interested in Piracy in the first film, and she Tris to live it in this one. All of the other actors are also impressive. Bill Nighy is a fantastic Davy Jones, along with many of the Flying Dutchmen. A 8/10All in all, this movie is the best movie of the Summer. It has all the qualities that make and action film fun: An action-packed, love story with humorous, swash-buckling fun! Thanks for reading! A 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun but a bit disappointing,"I don't know what it is about the film industry at present but there appears to be a general effort to ""cash in"" on good story ideas by dragging sequels out into two films. We see it often where they produce a good and successful film (the Matrix, Back to the future, etc) and then decide to create a double bill sequel. The trouble is that they don't really have enough story to make a second and third film so they have to pad out the script with dull and irrelevant scenes.Sadly Pirates 2 falls inside this category. Sections of the film are outstanding with Mr Depp's character of Captain Jack Sparrow probably rating as my favourite comedy character I have seen in an film. It also illustrates what a superb and versatile actor he is. Other sections of the film you just cant wait for them to be over because they just don't add anything to the story and arn't very interesting to watch.Sadly the film is let down badly by a script that has just been stretched too thinly over the two sequels and the result is a film that starts well but looses its pace and becomes a little dull. My least favourite part of these ""two parter sequels"" is that we have no ending. The film just sort of stops with out any conclusion.In conclusion I would describe this as half a film who's quality will depend heavily on how the third film concludes the story. It is worth a watch but I would save it for the half price ticket day at the cinema or perhaps even a video rental just before the third comes out. It is just not a patch on the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Worst, worst, worst movie I have seen in years","The first installment was charming and a lot of fun. The sequel was beyond awful. The sequel was insulting. I wanted to leave at about the halfway point, and it turned out the two people I went with were thinking the same thing. When, after about half an hour, it became obvious that the fresh script and swashbuckling magic of ""The Black Pearl"" had been prostituted in the name of effects and lame stunts, I started hoping for at least a good naval battle, or something, to fall back on. Unfortunately, even that bit fell short. I feel like I just sat through ""The Phantom Menace"" again. Remember how disappointing ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was? Dead Man's Chest is worse. I feel so completely ripped off. I am two and a half hours closer to my grave with nothing to show for it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very disappointed, but a worthy see-once-movie","I was really disappointed by The Dead Mans Chest. The first movie was excellent and had really smart jokes. In the second all the jokes are falling down stairs, falling down into a grave, falling here and falling there. There are some funny bits though in the movie that give you a good laugh.When the men of Davy Jones roam around in the forest it reminded me more of Power Rangers than Pirates of the Caribbean. The movie relied too much on the special effects and didn't look like it cared too much if it looked good or not. A little same like Superman Returns (2006).The plot is interesting though, but the way it was made didn't make any sense. Appears that some people from the first movie didn't die although they ought have.My biggest disappointment was the end, that the movie didn't have a clear ending. You have to see the third movie to finish the second. It would have been better that either this was a clear continuation of the first film, or that they would all three independent. But this is only my opinion.Still, the Dead Mans Chest is a worthy movie to go and see.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Too much of a good thing a bad thing???,"I went in to the theater with great expectation for Dead mans Chest and to begin with it was looking good.I like the darkness of which the film started, it made me think that it was going to give a much more bleaker outlook on piracy and life on the open sea. the cinematography was brilliant, with really gloomy shots in the torrential rain. but then we are waiting perhaps a further 15 minutes before any sign of a story kicks in. and to be honest there is pretty much no link at all to the previous episode ""The Black Pearl"" apart from the characters, the ship and the setting. That wouldn't really matter if this was a great film.... but in all honestly it isn't.Firstly lets take the best thing from the original - Johnny Depp's performance. in ""The Black Pearl"" it was fantastic, funny and curious. but in ""Dead mans Chest"" the film studio have really milked it too much. Every scene has Jack Sparrow stumbling/mumbling/cracking one liners. (some of which are very good) after maybe 45 minutes we have seen good ol' Jack being chased several times doing his silly lean backwards run...... it gets really repetitive and loses its humor. i felt this about his part for most of the movie.Other characters just don't develop at all apart from Norrington, Orlando Bloom still can't act and Keira Knightly is a weak leading lady. both of their characters have no new story to tell, apart from Will turners dad turning up..... but we learn nothing new about this side story at all. so what was the purpose of his dad being in this film?The comic relief characters of pintel and ragetti are brilliant, as they were in the first adventure. There are other things to enjoy here too, The SFX, the set design and score are all excellent.I think i was expecting a lot more and maybe the 3rd installment will deliver a lot of answers and tie the stories in together better. as a popcorn movie ""Dead Mans Chest"" works OK, but i left the theater with nothing much to think about other than a character from the first film reappearing at the finale, but even this twist felt like it was put in because ""you have to have a twist"".I am looking forward to the 3rd part, but i feel let down (not matrix reloaded style) enough to not get overly excited by it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Five-Star+ Treat!,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is by far the most entertaining movie that I've seen in a very long time. I didn't think it was possible that it could outdo The Black Pearl. I was wrong! The entire cast was wonderful! From Jack Sparrow's opening scene to his final scene in this movie, I was on the edge of my seat. Depp has perfected Sparrow. I caught myself giggling and smiling throughout! The action and special effects were beyond belief. I don't know what genre to put this film in: drama, adventure, comedy, romance? It has it all and then some! Seeing these characters again was like meeting old friends. Dead Man's Chest cleverly connects with the Black Pearl through intelligent character development. I will certainly add this film to my home library!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You can touch me chest but not me booty!,"This past week I saw the midnight showing of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest and found it rather mediocre. This film just didn't deliver as the first did. The comedy was much more sharp and edgy in the first film and it just wasn't as clever as the first. The biggest disappointment though was Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He was turned into a bumbling fool where as in the first go around he was a good pirate and captain though a drunk and ever so slightly burnt out. In this he's suddenly gone daft with no explanation, it was irksome. My favorite character from the series has always been Will Turner and he has been given a far meatier role this time on an expedition to save Keira Knightley's Elizabeth from imprisonment. He has to team up with Jack to get the Dead Man's Chest from Davy Jones. I must say that the special effects in this film were nothing short of astonishing! Davy Jones, a big octopussy lookin' thing, looked absolutely real and life-like constantly moving with excellent fluidity, yet you could still tell that it was Bill Nighy. His eyes had such a penetrative presence, he really worked for me, he was vile yet likable. With the poor script that was lacking flare, it was the special effects and fantastic action sequences that saved the film. In my favorite scene, three of the film's heroes are having a tri sword battle in what appears to be a giant hamster wheel rolling across the island's forest landscape. It was scenes like this that allow me to nudge my star ratting to a *** out of four. Where the first half was lacking, including a ridiculous and unnecessary island scene reminiscent of King Kong, the last half more than made up for in terrific imagery and entertaining action sequences. So over all I give it a very mild recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp Magic!,"The name 'Johnny Depp' spells quality like no-one else in Hollywood.After powering the first of the three Pirates films to Hollywood History, debonair Depp returns to enthrall you with yet another enterprising performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. It wouldn't be exaggeration to say that Depp is the heart and soul of the film. Of course you have the vintage Bill Nighy(Davy Jones), the beautiful Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) and the eunuch-looking Orlando Bloom(Will Turner) - but its Depp who grabs the eyeballs.The story is in continuation with the first instalment and requires a preliminary knowledge about the first film. Captain Jack Sparrow, retrieving his ship The Black Pearl in the last film, is bound to pay a blood-debt to the legendary Davy-Jones(a grotesque face with dozens of spaghetti like things down his chin) or provide 100 souls in exchange. The plot turns a wee bit complicated when it is found that Sparrow, Turner, Comodore Norrington and Elizabeth are all after the same thing - Davy Jones' heart (hidden in a chest on some secluded island) , but all want it for different reasons.Davy Jones meanwhile unleashes The Kraken (a Balrog+Godzilla+King Kong like creature) on Depp. The film's ending is literally a jolt and ultimately leaves you hoping that Summer 2007 comes earlier.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp... :),"Any movie with Johnny Depp tends to be good but as Captain Jack Sparrow he excels himself. This is a really good movie and I loved every minute of it. The funny moments were hilarious and there were times when there were tears in my eyes for laughing. In fact i would say 'Dead Man's chest' was better even that the first and although this movie was a continuation of the first it could stand on it's own. If there were any negatives to the movie i was say that Keira was it. I don't know why but I just cannot stand her. I also hated the end because of the 'to be continued.....'. I really dislike when movies end like that because I am a very impatient person. Overall the script was great, the acting was outstanding and the sets and locations were beautiful. Without a doubt I will be the first in queue to see the 3rd movie whenever it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining summer movie that teeters on overkill,"Following sometime after the events of the first movie we learn about a motive that Jack Sparrow has had all along - to obtain ""The Dead Man's Chest."" A chest that contains the power to control the most frightening ship on the sea - The Flying Dutchman - and with that comes the ability to control the most terrifying creature in the sea - The Kraken. But Jack isn't the only one after The Dead Man's Chest.Following in suit with the original this is another highly entertaining summer movie, albeit with flaws. Though it does contain that same tongue-in-cheek tone throughout with Johnny Depp reprising what may become his most famous movie character.However, the mega-budget, expansive sets, multi-million dollar effects, rousing action and feel-good adventure spirit far surpass desired character development. Traditional and expansive adventure yarns like 'The Illiad' or 'Aeneid' and even films like 'Indiana Jones' had a good plot woven into them - it accompanied the escapist action and and spectacular feel. Here there is a plot, simple and quite predictable, but it's there all right. However, the effects are so expansive that the balance is teetering on total overkill. So much time and imagination must have gone into those effects and they are quite spectacular, but with the bare-bones plot they are really the driving force of the movie. Lucky for the viewer that at least the characters are likable so you can manage to forgive the lack of plot and enjoy the film, but it is definitely not as memorable or thoroughly enjoyable as the first entry. --- 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much Better Than I Expected,"Well I'll start by saying that I really liked it, not quite the first one but still the best film I've seen so far this year. The special effects are brilliant, as is the entire technical aspect of the film. Many people people are complaining that it doesn't have enough plot, I plea the opposite, in fact it has too much plot and is occasionally confusing. And now to the performances. Johnny Depp is in my opinion several steps behind his performance in the original(Which I consider to be one of the best ever) He is still quite good though. Keira Knightley has proved that she is a very good actress with two Oscar worthy performances in Bend it Like Beckham and Pride and Prejudice. Here she seems lost, and gives one of the films worst performances. Orlando Bloom surprised me with his best performance since his underrated turn in Black Hawk Down(Something he has failed to get even close to living up to) He actually gives a performance that could be considered decent. Bill Nighy should get Oscar consideration(If eligible) for his brilliant portrayal of Davy Jones. He is rather perfect. Tom Hollinder is extremely disappointing in the other villain roll, he was so good in both Pride and Prejudice and Gosford Park, and here is simply embarrassing. In all a extremely good adventure film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Can you squeeze more fun on screen? Methinks not.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has me in two minds at the moment. On the one hand, it was funnier, more energetic, more dark and scary and even more fun to watch than the first. On the other hand, right now I would absolutely KILL to see the next film (and happily fork out ten times the movie ticket price), as the ending of this one leaves things rather unresolved.The most amazing feat of the film is how it manages to tread over old jokes and still make them funny. Gods, human sacrifices, cannibals, slapstick, dialogue... Fortunately, we were spared translation jokes, but everything else you could possibly expect in a pirate movie was in it. There were also some fantastic jokes that felt fresh (especially during one big action sequence in the middle, the slapstick went into overdrive, and even Keira Knightley got laughs out of the audience) The acting, for the most part, was brilliant, too. Keira Knightley being the honourable exception, delivering her lines courtesy of a British accent rather than any acting effort.I'll definitely buy the DVD and recommend the film to all my friends - but with the warning that it makes the wait for part 3 almost too unbearable... 9/10 - one point being deducted for the cliffhanger ending.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A dark and less funny sequel,"PIRATES 2 is an OK sequel to the original, with most if not all of the original cast back for another shot at buried treasure. This time around, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and company are after Davy Jones'locker, which contains an artifact that will keep Sparrow from falling into the clutches of the undead Davy Jones. Davy Jones, who sports an octopus for a head, pilots the Flying Dutchman, which among other neat tricks can dive underwater. Along the way, Sparrow and friends (including a rather haggard-looking Orlando Bloom and the ever-luscious Keira Knightley) have various adventures including falling into the hands of cannibals. One eye-popping sequence involves a duel that takes place on a runaway water wheel! Now for the not-so-good news: P2 is considerably darker than the first movie. The (bloodless) death count is so high, PIRATES 2 truly is not suitable for small children. Also, the movie ends like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, a cliffhanger that compels us to catch the third and final installment in 2007. Other than some impressive visual effects involving the gruesome Davy Jones crew and a rather large sea monster, there's not much new here. Many of the gags are lifted from the first movie. Plus the film is easily a half-hour too long. If you are a fan, by all means see it. Just keep the kiddies away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"great characters, poor plot","I liked the movie overall. I guess it appeals to all, as a Disney made film. Swashbuckling and generally an energetic ball of adventure.Jack Sparrow gets all the best lines..and is great. The romance is fine, as is the pirate comedy. There are a lot of special effects, some of which are a little overdone. For example, the Goonies style pirates of Davy John.However, I think the plot lets this movie down, especially the laborious ending, which actually never ends but is just a precursor to the next film.How do writer's get away with this? It had so much potential and falls flat on its face in the resolution! With years of experience, I am just surprised that experienced writers cannot see where a plot begins to fall apart. I wonder if they are underestimating their audience.In summary, if you enjoyed the style of the first, then no doubt many elements will tickle your fancy... don't be too disappointed with the resolution and ending. The writer's could have done better!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great dumb fun,"I liked this better than the first one, tho I know many didn't. To me this was a lot Morey action and a lot less yammering. but then again the audience, if they saw the first film, didn't need much explanation. This was just pure dumb fun. It took me on a ride, just for the ride's sake. And that's why, where there might be holes in the plot, it really didn't matter to me. The look of the film is great, and I really liked the locations. Okay, bla, bla, bla , and some more bla, as I fill these ten lines. What can I say. See it. Turn off your mind and have fun, 'cuz that what this film is all about. Okay some more fill, blah, bla, blah, and furthermore, less we forget. Also the Davey Jones himself was a really technological feat. Where the prosthetic ended and the computer graphics began was seamless. ILM might actually win an Oscar for FX this year,...after a very long drought.

1 _ 3,"The first Pirates movie, unlike Dead Man's Chest, was a complete story. The movie's producers, directors, and actors had to make a film that would stand on its own, as there was no guarantee that it would be as wildly successful as it was. But once that first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, became so well-loved, Disney immediately shifted its focus from creating a great sequel to managing a great franchise. Thus we have a Dead Man's Chest which extends, rather than advances, the story. It is filled with the high-quality graphics, fun characters, and self-effacing humor that we loved about the first, but can hardly be called a ""movie"" in its own right. What actually happened over the course of 2 hours could have been 20 minutes of set-up at the beginning of the real sequel, which will be the final piece of the trilogy: At World's End.The bottom line is that Pirates 1 was a great movie, just as Pirates 3 will be. Pirates 2 is only there to milk the proverbial cash cow, and because trilogies seem to be in vogue of late. It adds little value to the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The absolute best movie!,"I just got home from watching the new Pirates movie tonight with my family. It was so much fun. This second movie had more funny moments, but also still was able to make me cry and jump in my seat from getting scared! The acting was superb. I cannot believe that two and a half hours could go by so fast. It was amazing. We took our 9 year old son and there was a few times that he ""hid his face"" but mostly it was okay. Some of the scenes were intense and so I do not know if the movie would be okay for most fourth graders. But he laughed along with the rest of us and thoroughly enjoyed it. Over all I highly recommend this movie for those who love the swashbuckling fun, the laughter, the adventure, and of course the romantic slant of the Pirates movies. It was so enjoyable, I will probably go see it at least once again in theaters. The only other movie that I have gone back to the theater for was Spiderman 2!

Lots of action ... Zero plot ... Insipid dialog,"How can the actors in this film not be hanging their heads in shame at the moronic dialog they had to deliver? And where's the PLOT? Dangit, doesn't ANYONE in Hollywood know a THING about creating a STORY?!?! Granted, Johnny Depp delighted everyone with his interpretation of the Captain Jack character in the first episode. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this ""story"" that develops his character further. Because the dialog given for the other characters (Will & Elizabeth) is so incredibly LAME, they haven't much to work with and fall flat. Bloom's personal charisma ameliorates the lack of substance left to him by the screenwriter(s). Unfortunately, Knightley's inexperience leaves her with nothing to fall back on with this pathetic script and she comes off as a total fool, playing the role as if she were a spoiled Valley Girl.

If it were up to me, I would have him in a nice sappy romcom with Jennifer Lopez. Keira dazzled.Though the cliff hanger ending keeps me interested, it was no X-Men 3 ending or Itallian Job finish. I liked the jokes, but I felt that some of them were more references to the first movie and I would have preferred more originality in the script.

PASTICHE of the Caribbean--SPOILER,"This movie throws everything but the galley sink at the wall and only some of it sticks We have the ship named Flying Dutchman, but not the actual Flying Dutchman, which irritated the heck out of me because he'd have been a lot more interesting given the lovelorn theme than Davy Jones. We have mythological beasts, legendary seamen, and voodoo priestesses with hard-ons for Johnny Depp.Well, I suppose the last bit isn't quite so unrealistic.But she dug Orlando Bloom on sight, and I don't get that at all.Anyhow, there are some huge problems with this movie, and not all of them could be resolved by tying the plot points up neatly at the end of the third movie. First, we have too many derivative echoes of Star Wars. I've read as much Joseph Campbell as the next nerd, but it gets tedious seeing the same romantic triangles played out over and over, and the same dynamic between the cursed and hideously-deformed villain who was turned to evil because he was unsuccessful in romance set against a young and pure-hearted protagonist.I swear to high heaven, if Will and Elizabeth turn out to be brother and sister in Pirates III, I will flipping throw my large Diet Pepsi--ice, straw, soda, and all--at the screen. That will most seriously displease me.Which brings me to my second complaint, namely--watching Keira Knightly vacillate between Will and Jack is rendered absurd by the existence of what a lamer Orlando Bloom is in one of three key heroic (?) roles. OK, OK...put the man in platform shoes, give him blond hair extensions and blue contacts, and he's otherworldly beautiful. But he. Can't. Act. His way out of a paper bag, let alone off a ship full of cursed sailors who look like walking, talking, barnacle-encrusted bits of flotsam and jetsam. He's just not got the juice, and you put him next to Depp on screen and it's clear that any reasonably piratical lass would opt for a dirty weekend and a trip around the bay with Captain Jack as opposed to a lifetime of boredom with nice-guy Will.But wait, there are glimmers of hope. Our plucky, lightsabre (I mean sword!)-wielding heroine turns out to have a rather machiavellian side to her, before plunging into regret for her actions. Will showed promising signs of jealousy and violence, before reverting to Luke Skywalker-esquire mastery of his anger. And Captain Sparrow seems to me to be ripe for the picking in whatever passes for a piratical version of a male midlife crisis, though Mr. Rochester-like, he's bound to be permanently maimed, first, before he's rendered fit for a lifetime of being press-ganged by anything in petticoats. The best dynamic in this movie wasn't (sadly) between the nominal villains and the heroes, it was between two of the heroes; Jack tells Elizabeth she will be tempted to try being truly self-serving because she is curious and will want to know what it feels like, and Elizabeth very pertly (because we're talking Keira here whose jaw is the only thing more aggressive and jutting than the toothily-armed prow of the Flying Dutchman in this movie) tells him that he will in turn wish to sample the joys of being a decent fellow doing the right thing, and enjoying the respect and admiration which comes from being a good guy and hero.I could almost hear Han and Leia bantering, or Rick from Casablanca saying ""I stick my neck out for no one"".Long live the antihero, and may he always get the girl, or at least stride off into the sunset with Claude Raines.OK, here's what you really need to know. The pacing is not good in this installment. There are parts which are just too loud and go on too long. The waterwheel sword fight, however, is all it's cracked up to be, and then some. The script neglects to give its most charming characters any memorable lines. Davy Jones is well-voiced, and beautifully (which is to say disgustingly) CGI-rendered, as is the Krakken. I thought I'd crave sushi after this film, but found I did not. I was pleased as punch to see Jack Davenport's Commander Norrington character return, mostly because I had girlfriends who dug him in the first movie. He has a heckuva voice, and looks better with a tan and some dirt all over him.And there will always be an England so long as there are superb British Character actors like Tom Hollander to add an elegant and silky menace to cardboard villain roles, and McKenzie Crooks to be alternately Gareth from The Office (BBC) and the austensible (sic) comic relief other than Johnny Depp in this one. And.............SPOILERS I'm thinking the real beating heart of the Davy Jones character is that music box. They didn't try to turn him into the Phantom of the Opera for nothing, IMO.Just please, please, PLEASE do not let his long-lost love be the unintelligible voodoo priestess.

A dark and frolicking sequel,"It's obvious from the first rain-soaked opening shots of Dead Mans Chest that this film has a darker nature than the often merry ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". (If you consider rotting, undead corpses on a ghost ship merry, that is.) What's less obvious is this movies beating heart, which lies at both the literal and figurative center of the story.Old characters are back, and although some reviewers accuse them of being well, out of character, I didn't notice a great change. Will is still noble, slightly bumbling, deadly-with-a-sword-ready-to die-for-love-and-honor-Turner. Jack is still a drunken scoundrel with a decent streak that often lands him in trouble, and Elizabeth is still torn between being proper and being Elizabeth. If the character have seemed to have lost something, it was probably innocence. And quite frankly,who can blame them after everything they had seen?There is a plot, of sorts. Granted, it won't win a guild award, but it doesn't have to. Like a dime store romance (or a great swashbuckler) the plot(having something to do with an angry squid named Davey and a magical compass)only has to serve as a means of getting our hero(s) into one pickle after another. But it does more than that, giving us more history about the first movie (origin of the Black Pearl, The nature of Jack's broken compass)and moments that surpass the first in impact ( watching Jack come face to face with the Kraken is worth the price of admission) All in all, if your looking for the next ""Citizen Kane"" (or another ""Curse of the Black Pearl) you'll be disappointed. But if your looking for a swashbuckling, arse-kicking sequel, you'll enjoy it from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This one is lacking some luster,"I can see that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is going the route of ""Harry Potter"" in that there are going to be a series of adventures for the main characters. The first two movies are going very much like a book series. And whenever you have books or movies that make up a series it is essential that the main characters be endearing or likable. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a colorful character as is his crew, but I don't find much interest at all in William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). In ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" we were getting to know Jack, William, and Elizabeth, and it was creative how they were all tied together. With that aspect now gone the writers have to go a new route to grab the viewers attention. I wasn't that impressed with the route they went in ""Dead Man's Chest"".The adventure and the villains in ""Dead Man's Chest"" are intriguing but this movie failed to bring me to the edge of my seat. Of course they set the movie up for a part three, but I think they need to do something drastic and radical to maintain fanfare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

While the film clocks in at a long 150 minutes, Dead Man's Chest has so much going for it that you will not mind, even if the pacing is not that of the typical popcorn flick.The pace of the original Pirates movie starts out slow and then speeds up especially towards the end. Dead Man's Chest does this same thing, except its even slower in the beginning, and then really picks up in the middle and ends with you gasping for air after all the disbelief and unbelievable moments shown on the big screen. The story this time centers on Jack Sparrow as suddenly his time to end his debt with Davy Jones, a very-feared and legendary captain of an evil ghost ship, is running out. With this dilemma at hand, he once again brings Will and Elizabeth into the adventure, as well as some familiar faces from the original. In the meantime, conspiracies and mysterious circumstances are brewing up in Elizabeth and Will's homeland. The plot is much more constricted and tangled up the second time around, even though the writers were able to add some seemingly unnecessary scenes for some comic relief.Johnny Depp seems to be born to play the part of Jack Sparrow, because he does it so well, perhaps too well for his own good. He is just as funny, just as entertaining, and just as cruel and unusual in the second installment, as we get to see much more of him. Knightley and Bloom were not half-bad as the love struck victims of the entire ordeal, and while Bill Nighy is most certainly no Geoffrey Rush, not even close, he does a good job as the fearful captain. Unlike the average summer flick, the acting was decent, not Oscar-worthy (besides Depp), but passable. When the actors are not talking, its all the action-packed sequences and spectacular special effects that fill the screen. Without a doubt, some of the best-looking effects in recent years are displayed here, ranging from the disgusting-looking pirates, the Flying Dutchman itself, and the sea monster that gets summoned a few times. Davy Jones looks menacing and the staff does a great job in not overdoing the special effects and CGI.While the action may have been lacking in the beginning, its everywhere in the second half of the movie. The first half was the introduction to the conflict and to the enemies in the movie; the second half is everyone going at it, whether it's a ship against a monster, or a three-way fight, or pirates against an invincible crew of damned souls, or a silly humorous fight amongst a bunch of drunk pirates and convicts. While Dead Man's Chest is not for mindless action fans, the second half has so much carnage and swordplay and unbelievable moments that it will make the average fanatic drool with anticipation for the next big moment. The three-way fight hands-down is one of the best action sequences you will ever see, guaranteed. Starting with just three people going at it, it escalates into amazing lengths, as Gore Verbinski stretches a simple fight into a complex turn of events with fun twists and never-ending fights between the hero of the story, the main character, and a third person who will not be mentioned in this review.Like the original, Dead Man's Chest has a bit of everything: plot twists, action, humor, horror, drama, romance, and a lot of fantasy. The best part is, it has plenty of nods to the original movie, and plenty of references to the ride as well, and even to older literature. Has a bit of everything for the average viewer to enjoy, and while it is most certainly the most violent thing to garnish the Walt Disney name, it still has that bit of Disney magic that has made us return to Disney films time and time again. It is a ride through the open seas as you get to see it all, beautiful women, evil villains, colorful characters, huge monsters, treasure, and more stories to keep your thirst for nicely-woven sea tales quenched until next year, when we see the grand finale. Oh, the ending to this movie was grand as well, with a few pleasant surprises.Bottom Line: Not as fresh as the original, but just as entertaining, as it has a bit of everything, and more Jack Sparrow. Action, comedy, drama, and a hint of horror, Dead Man's Chest is in every way a good film, as it stacks up well to the original, and to action sequels in the past. This is quickly gaining potential in becoming the best action franchise since the masterpiece Indiana Jones movies of the 1980s. Recommend to everyone, and as long as you can put up with the slow pacing, you will not leave the theater disappointed.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Empire Strikes Back Redux,"Here it is: the long awaited sequel to everyone's favorite pirate movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Was it worth the wait? In a lot of ways, yes it was. The movie delivers in many facets: humor, action, adventure, and of course, detestable villains. The actors stay consistent in their roles, never catering to over-the-top caricatures of their characters.However, the movie suffers from overall plot structure. The first ludicrous twenty minutes is completely useless to the story (except if you consider the end at the credits). Dead Man's Chest feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back in plot, but that can be forgiven. What make me maddest about the plot though is the fact that it has to be told in two parts. This makes the first movie stand alone and the next two linked together as one self-contained story. Pirates is no longer a trilogy, but two films, much like a preceding ""trilogy"" like The Matrix.Dead Man's Chest also guises itself as a rehash of the first movie. Many jokes are reused and the enemies are very similar (invincible). However, this one is different in the fact that it is more of a cartoon. Jack and Will should have died in a few places, but I guess they were suffering from ""Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible III Syndrome"" (it's impossible to die!).Alas, these last trifles are minor and the movie is very entertaining for what it's worth. And it does make me excited for the third movie coming out in 2007. Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an enjoyable sequel, even if it is shadowed by the greatness of its predecessor somewhat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A cruel disappointment from the first movie.,"If I could have gone lower then (1) I would have. This movie had none of the great one liners of the 1st movie. I was bored from the beginning. The character interaction was just not there, like part 1. Without giving anything away, I did see a couple new amusement park rides that will no doubt be out soon. I would compare this movie to Back to the Future 2 and Matrix 2, both of which had no real story line or reason for watching them, other then to lead up to part 3. The creatures they added into this movie, reminded me of cartoon characters from Shark Tales. I think I will wait for the third installment of Pirates to come out on DVD. I don't want to waste more money and time. I could have been cleaning my house and been more excited.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"dead man's chest, should of stayed buried.","A terrible way to tell a story, considering, there IS no ending.You can still have a sequel with a bang up finish like Indy Jones. We all knew Stars Wars to be continued, but this dead end, ending is not fair to the $10 movie goer.Effects were great only, film way too long between laughs.Saw it with a crowd of 50 Friday pm, we yawned more than chuckled. Not a film for kids 10 under or dentists. All actors mumbled through lines. The dice game made no sense. Bringing back EVERYBODY shows no imagination considering writers are a top notch team.Scenes with the mystic lady, the Governor, the New Governor and the opening tribal scene were way tooo long, considering nothing happened. Too bad they could not cut them all out and keep the Monkey and Kracken, now they were fun.Too many little subplots, and no real main plot. If you like this, you were taking in by the hype. and there is no cure.Since dead man has no competition, being a box office was a gimme.So alas, me heartys, tis be bad storytelling versus hype, and hype wins again.

"""I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt and guess what's inside it?!""","After watching this movie once in the theater, and no telling how many more times on DVD, this sequel to the predecessor - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, becomes one of the most spectacular fantasy movies to date, and the most popular...but maybe not the best, but definitely worth a watch if you're not too picky.Unlike other comments from people who seamed to not like this movie, thought it was too long, the action scenes were senseless, unnecessary, and thought the movie was all out terrible. I'm going to right my comment in a critical and pleasant manner and not bash the movie just because a flaw is irritating to my mind. But I don't let flaws do that to me, unless it is a completely impassable flaw that ruins everything else.I realize that Dead Man's Chest was a pretty difficult movie to get through for the filmmakers, as for being years since it's predecessor and with no complete script, etc. But how'd they pull it off without completely messing it up too badly is inspiring.For me, the second one lacks some of the style and believability the first one had. Ha-ha, but it's been years since they did the first one, and that's why I think they should have planned a sequel from the very beginning. I mean, you can't just put out a Pirates movie with the most memorable, most treasured and hilarious Pirate, Mr. Jack Sparrow and not plan for a sequel, c'mon! That's where the filmmakers kind of screwed up, in my opinion, they wasn't aware the fact that Jack Sparrow was going to be so memorable and treasured, and will eventually become a legend in years to come that he would be worth a sequel! I'm just glad to see they did a swell job on this one and not a terrible job. The third one will be better than DMC no doubt, but I don't think any will stand up to the standards what made the first one which stood out on it's own without much attentions for a sequel.What gets me is how the second one and third one is back-to-back and the first one is a stand-alone while they are still in the same trilogy collection. Yeah some parts connect, but not fully. But there's just nothing else that can be done as of now. What is done is done, and the third one has already set sail, and I'm looking forward to seeing it! Anyway, before I close this comment off, I would like to lay out some slight flaws that would have made this movie a 8 for me instead of a 7 if they were avoided/fixed. But the rest of that 7% is full of nearly flawless sounds, amazing special effects, some good acting, fun action scenes, a fairly dark, stylish story, etc. I rate it 7 because of the lack of believable acting, sense of humor, and style that the first one did somewhat better on. But DMC beats TCotBP on the action/adventure part, no doubt about that.Bill Nighy who played Davy Jones, in my opinion, was the best actor out of all of them in Dead Man's Chest. Either he was flawless, or his flaws were well covered by the amazing special-effects. Yes, I even think he was better than Johnny as Mr. Jack. I mean, he was more worth the watch as far as acting goes and style. Johnny was only at times unbelievable, only some lines were somewhat lame, eye-rolling like jokes, whatever. But all else he is pretty flawless...don't get me wrong...he was just better in the first one, in my opinion, or flawless mind you. Keira Knightly wasn't too bad in this one, she was probably below Johnny's acting standards, but Orlando however wasn't as believable as he was in the first one, but just by slightly, he's nowhere near impressive but more along the line of just okay. All other actors and actresses were well passable and some were very believable and flawless, then some just didn't stand out at all, but nor were they in a big role.Over all I rate this 7 out of 10. If it weren't for the slight flaws, it would have been an 8. Believe me, I would love to give this an 8, but I went ahead and put my critical thinking to the test. But, no matter what, I enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean better than any film I can think of!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great movie.. Really makes me want to see 3rd one.,"Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Cheast is much better than the original Pirates of the Caribbean. I only say that because in this movie, it has more action and comedy, plus Johny Deep's performance is awesome as Captin Jack Sparrow. But I take points down for over-acting in some of the roles. Like how Johny Deep seemed to use his hands more than his mouth like he did in the first one, just he did it a bit more in this one.This movie makes me want to see Pirates of the Caribben: At Worlds End just because of how it ends...And the ending to me was a huge twist of things...So I say go and see that movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dirt vs. slime,"Most people say that POTC 2 was completely horrible and put shame to the first movie. But the sequel is just a different feel to the first one. In the first one, everything was dirty, the pirates, the ships, the towns. But in Dead Man's Chest, it was more slime, Davey Jones men, and the cracken. So really the movie wasn't worse than the first, just different. It was definitely no Spiderman 2. Also, as an observation, it seems Keira Knightley was about half as skinny as she was in the first. In the first she was much more healthy, still skinny, but healthy. I personally didn't like her character as much in Dead Man's Chest. The whole "" i love Jack Sparrow"" thing was not very good, and how she fooled him so she could save Will Turner made her seem more evil than just a strong woman. But through all that, the movie was good, but still didn't match up to the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply LOVED the ending,"First of I thought the first movie was better than this one but it's still a very good movie with great action sequences and great humor. I did think the movie started a bit slow, the first one has action almost immediately here you have to wait for it but it's well worth the wait.I laughed my ass of on several occasions and the action has you nailed to the edge of your seat. I especially loved the scene with the cartwheel. And Johnny Depp plays his character very well and proves once again why he is (imo) the only actor capable of playing Captain Jack Sparrow. My advice to you is to go see the movie, you won't regret it and it will leave you eagerly anticipating the third one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Gah, Reloaded With Pirates!","Rating: 12A Main Cast: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy Director: Gore VerbinskiThe good: massive epic scale, brilliant set pieces and action sequences, Bill Nighy is amazing.The bad: Orlando Bloom, not as funny as previous film, bit confusing, tries to cram in too much.Quick Summary: This is no Toy Story sequel, this is a Matrix sequel. This film lacks the originality and humour of the first, and Johnny Depp seems to have been forced to be annoying at every possible point. In the first he was funny, now the writers have written him like he performed and he now just gets annoying! The effects are decent though look a bit cartonney, Orlando Bloom cant act and Keira Knightley is probably just there to look pretty. However there's no denying the epic scale of this film, plus Bill Nighy is very good although I miss Barbossa.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"wretched, worthless waste of your time","For a sequel to a basically fun and swashbuckling first offering, this one is completely UNfunny, aggressively puerile and offensive, disjointed and confusing in its direction, and has nothing at all to offer but gross-out scenes and a tired parade of pirate-movie clichés. Five year olds could have come up with a more cohesive and entertaining script, and certainly could have written something less disgusting. A hodgepodge of gratuitous scenes that can't distract the viewer away from the fact that they have yet to be given any reason to care about any of these characters or events. NO humor whatsoever, and for something so poorly glued together, it takes itself way too seriously. The first one didn't even try to be serious, knowing everything was silly fantasy, but the tone this one tries to keep is that this is actually straightforward and not tongue-in-cheek! As it jumps abruptly from one ludicrous scene to another, it fails to make any sense or entice the viewer. Constipated overacting, ham fisted direction, and if it has a plot, you won't see any sign of it for a good long time. My husband and I walked out after a totally unpleasant half hour and got a refund. Don't waste two hours of your life. This is the typical sequel scenario, where they KNOW most everyone who saw the first will see the second, so they don't even bother trying to make it good. I used to have respect for Johnny Depp, but I guess he was either contractually obligated to do a sequel, or just sold out for a buck. He's not really the problem here; it's the lousy writing and direction.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thank you Gore Verbinski!!!,"Like Captain Jack Sparrow swore a blood oath to Davey Jones, I think we avid movie goers should bear allegiance to Gore Verbinski for giving us a summer film we can sit and enjoy! Too long has this summer been with disappointing sequels (xmen 3 namely, and i think any film with the name 'fast and the furious' is already drifting its way off a cliff), pretentious indies (nacho libre), and movies that Jesus himself couldn't get made (""the little man"". >sigh<), that we have a summer blockbuster that truly delivers. OK, 'superman' was entertaining, but dear lord i expected more, especially from brian singer.Last year 'batman begins' took the cake as my favorite summer blockbuster of the year, and I think these pirates have seized this one. Yo ho. And dear lord what an ending.But seriously, Xmen 3? Brett Ratner should be crucified.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Depp saves this boat from sinking,"It's a mere mathematical fact that most Hollywood sequels are languid rehashes of their predecessors, vitalizing in the same exact elements as if they were trying to give audiences the same exact experience they had with the original carbon copy of the story. In the case of ""Dead Man's Chest"", the second entry in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, what can be safely said and done is that a crowd-pleasing character that's in the ranks of Captain Jack Sparrow can do anything he wants whenever he wants and the audience will not squirm in their seats for a second. Without Sparrow and his crazy pirate antics, this sequel would be like rum without alcohol and butter-less summer popcorn.Starting off where the original ended, Dead Man's Chest opens on the wedding day of Elizabeth Swan and William Turner. Yet, their warm day of happiness turns ice-cold once Lord Beckett, a mysterious and rather cold-hearted sort of general, places the two under arrest for their relations with the infamous Jack Sparrow. We soon discover that Beckett is a man who is not interested in either of them, but rather in Sparrow's enigmatic compass, offering Turner a chance at freedom if he hunts down his pirate friend, retrieves the compass, and brings it into his hands. Will automatically accepts the offer and is off on a journey into the open world, in search of the eccentric pirate that can't help but be a magnet to trouble.As it turns out, Jack Sparrow is on the run from the villainous Davy Jones, a man trapped in a monstrous mollusk embodiment. On the verge of literally selling his soul, Sparrow makes a clumsy deal with Jones, offering one hundred souls in exchange for his. Selfishly, Sparrow allows Jones to hold William prisoner, making the young man captive on the demented Flying Dutchman, where he finds himself reunited with his long lost father, Bootstrap Bill.Throughout most of its lengthy running time, the film takes on a sort of ""Empire Strikes Back"" routine, having each of the central characters on their own and with their own amount of isolated screen time as we take the time to notice their own personal struggles and needs. Although this notion doesn't entirely work for every central character, specifically Elizabeth Swan, it does work greatly for the character of Will Turner. Will Turner is like a plain square when compared to his opposite, Jack Sparrow. Yet, the relationship between he and his father adds another dimension to both characters as we see how their rocky relationship turns into an emotional bond once they find themselves in the worst situation imaginable with the wicked Davy Jones. It may be a sort of lukewarm attempt to provide a subtle layer to a not-so-subtle summer blockbuster, yet, it makes the film a much more respectable effort nevertheless. This attempt is also utilized when it comes to the ""redemption"" factor of Jack Sparrow. Will he ever grow out of his selfish wits? And then there's the ""temptation"" factor with Elizabeth Swan. Is Jack Sparrow, the dangerously adventurous wonder, really the right man to fulfill her? The best thing about the original Pirates of the Caribbean was the fact that it was a freshly new adventure with a colorful character (Sparrow) that would prove to be of the most memorable of the decade. It followed that classic analogy of storytelling that parallels that of Star Wars, in which a self-less farm boy sets off on a grand adventure with a selfish pirate in order to save a beautiful princess. These nuances and factors worked terrifically for the film, preventing it from sinking into the mundane abyss of summer popcorn. Does ""Dead Man's Chest"" work on the same level? Not quite. Sure, it's a summer action film; yet, its action curiously lacks the same level of excitement that was built in its predecessor. What saves the film from becoming a languid and lukewarm effort are the colorful characters, specifically the ever comedic Sparrow and the treacherous villain, Davy Jones, who is wonderfully voiced by the criminally underrated Bill Nigh.Nevertheless, consider ""Dead Man's Chest"" to be a grand weekend rental and a movie anyone can have a good time watching with friends and family. Johnny Depp has found himself a role for the ages with Jack Sparrow and aces the character to uncanny potential. With Sparrow on board the ship, you won't have to worry about seat-squirming for a second.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not a superior sequel, but still somewhat entertaining despite it being a bit longer than it should be with it's simple and narrow plot","Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow and he seemed to have a lot of fun playing this character as always. It's good to see the actors or actresses enjoying their roles, but that seemed to be mostly the main aspect of this movie. In fact watching this movie was like watching the characters running around a theme part and getting on crazy rides. But that just isn't really enough to engage the audience or make the story interesting or all that entertaining. In fact the main flaws of this movie is the plot, I know the creators are saving it for the 3rd movie but this one just lacked plot. It has one but it mostly revolves around Jack Sparrow and the other characters running around and acting all wacky in the jungle that seem a lot like some cool theme park. Some say the subplots in this are overlong and I sort of agree, but it wasn't really irritating to watch or anything and sort of had it's moments. This one has a bit more action compared to the first movie and I can see why it was a huge hit in box office.

Pi-Rights.,"Wonderfully fun and entertaining sequel dominates due to the technical aspects of film-making and always intriguing characters. Most everyone from the first installment returns as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, arguably doing equal if not better work than in the original) has a debt to pay off to supernatural captain Davy Jones (the always outstanding Bill Nighy) or otherwise be condemned to an eternity of servitude on a ship of lost souls. Of course all this causes the wedding of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley to be crashed and they get thrown back into high stakes adventure in the Caribbean. Director Gore Verbinski's franchise works most because of Depp as he becomes a cross between The Little Tramp, Detective Clouseau, Indiana Jones, James Bond and even Wile E. Coyote. Depp's character is one of the most textured and likable the cinema has ever seen (even though sometimes you don't know whether to love or loathe the guy). State of the art makeup effects, visual effects, editing, cinematography and art direction cover up the fact that the stories in the series are just window dressings to put seemingly every star and role player in breathtakingly action-packed dramatic and comedic sequences. While flawed (like its predecessor), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a wickedly enjoyable summer blockbuster that does admittedly make me look forward to yet another inevitable installation. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You leave thinking Rum Swilling Pirates put this film together...,"I was introduced (dragged rather) into Pirates when the first film came out. I NEVER expected to like the film, and from a distance, it was not a film I would have ever gone to see on my own. What I wonderful surprise it was that the first Pirates film was so fantastic! The whole story for Curse of the Black Pearl was excellent. It had a clear beginning, middle, and end. Also, potentially ambiguous areas in the story were quickly and identified and cleared up (I.E. Jack's prior involvement with Barbossa, the whole bit about the gold and the curse, Will and Elizabeth's background and friendship, and so on). This level of attention to detail made the rather long film entertaining and enjoyable for the full 2 ½ hours. Even the open-ended nature of the conclusion of POTC 1 left viewers wanting more.Dead Man's Chest however, fell VERY short in many ways. I have probably seen the first film 100 times, and I watched it before I went to see POTC 2. Thank goodness I did or I would have been totally lost! Frankly, a viewer of Dead Man's Chest would NEED to watch the first film in order to ""get"" all the repetitive jokes in POTC 2 since they all refer to events that occurred in Curse of the Black Pearl. Not only is the first 20 minutes of Dead Man's Chest a massive ball of confusion, but also after the first 20-30 minutes you want to say, ""wait a minute, could you rewind that?""There is no clear clarification on the actual involvement/purpose of the new Lord Beckett. There is no explanation about Captain Jack and the disbanded members of the old (but familiar) crew. The sudden introduction of a Voodoo woman (Tia Dalma) speaks with such a thick accent that her words are barely discernible. Commodore Norrington's role is very different, and although Jack Davenport's acting is superb in POTC 2, we really don't know what happened to him or how he ended up where he did. Even the entire plot surrounding Captain Jack, Bootstrap Bill, and Davy Jones is blurred by spotty explanations and additional elements that just add to the confusion.One would think that with everything going on in POTC 2 that Elizabeth and Will would be fully included. It was disappointing to find that Elizabeth's character is flighty and exhibits little structure, and other than a few sword fights, Will is lost in the crowd. A very positive aspect of the film is that Captain Jack Sparrow is just as wonderful and swaggering as ever. However, witty and clever elements in the first Pirates flick become cheesy and cliché in Dead Man's Chest, which left this viewer thinking that the director ran out of ideas or was rushed.The ending of Dead Man's Chest was captivating enough to make viewers ""want"" to know what happens next, but everything that happened prior to the ending was choppy at best with little more than spectacular graphics to hold the film together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Taking on Water,"When ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" first came out in theaters back in 2003 it surprised moviegoers who were expecting a campy, but child-friendly movie about pirates and ghosts - the typical kind of thing that normally comes with the Disney brand name. Quite frankly, considering the film was easily identified with the famous theme park ride, who could blame those initially wrote it off?However, the ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" went on to surprise audiences with its stunning visuals, intriguing story and the introduction of a character so captivating that he single-handedly revolutionized Johnny Depp's career by finally putting him into mainstream public's eye. Considering that makes for one stiff bill, it is easy to understand why ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is such a disappointment.""Dead Man's Chest,"" which opened in theaters Friday, is the 150 minute follow up from where ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" left off. On the wedding day of William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) it is revealed that Will and Elizabeth are to be imprisoned and sentenced to death for their hand in helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) allude being captured at the end of ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" Will is given an opportunity, however, to avoid such a fate by hunting down Captain Sparrow and stealing his compass, which he can then exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom.As it turns out, Sparrow also finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he learns that a deal he made with the spirit of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) has expired and that Jones is coming to collect the agreed debt  Sparrow's soul. This all boils over with another misadventure at sea as Sparrow and company attempt to find a way to avoid an eternity of damnation and servitude to Jones and clear the names of Will and Elizabeth.Unfortunately, the film's plot doesn't pan out as smoothly as its outline would make it seem. Despite having what seems to be an interesting plot, much of the intrigue and mystery that made the original ""Pirates"" so popular gets muddled over to make way for numerous action sequences that lack originality and, to be honest, are downright pointless considering the film's plot. Rather than sticking to the original film's guns, director Gore Verbinski chose to make ""Dead Man's Chest"" action heavy rather than trying to focus on telling a good story.For instance, within the half-hour of the film viewers are whisked away to an entirely ridiculous visit to what can only be described as Cannibal Island, where Will, Sparrow and his crew must escape the man-eating natives. Not only was the entire scene unfunny, but also so childish and stupid that you actually begin to get the feeling that you're watching a kids movie and not a pirate movie that had an opening scene where crows peck out the eyes of prisoners.Possibly even more depressing than the mishandled plot would be in watching a great character in Jack Sparrow get ruined by bad dialogue and confusing side-plots. Sure Depp has some memorable lines that have the zest that the first film was chalked with and he again steals the show with another incredible entrance, but those positives are quickly tarnished as you watch Depp's character head into a new direction.Sparrow now seems more cowardly than dashing; choosing even to flee the Black Pearl while his crewmates fight off a sea monster. Ask yourself this: would the Sparrow from ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" have abandoned the ship he was so passionate about? Considering what he went through just to regain control of it, one could only conclude that the answer would be no.Depp's character also suffers from contradictions made in the first film. Back in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" Will and Elizabeth were willing to stand and die alongside Sparrow because they knew Sparrow was a ""good man."" However, throughout this current adventure an underlying theme between Elizabeth and Sparrow is that Elizabeth is convinced that Sparrow wants to know what its like to be a good person, which is why he is in capable of being completely bad. Now, that would have been an interesting side-plot had they not already concluded that he was a good person in the first film  leaving intelligent viewers wondering whether or not the original film's script was ever consulted before they went ahead and filmed ""Dead Man's Chest.""Its unfortunate, but the newest film in the ""Pirates"" cannon falls short (and sometimes fails completely) in so many ways that it is undeserving of its title. Rather than having another terrific story supported by superb acting and stunning visuals, we're given a bunch of cheap thrills, confusing side-plots, a few zesty one-liners, only one real bright spot in what will be known as the ""giant wheel fight scene,"" and another annoying Hollywood cliffhanger ending that'll leave audiences with a bitter taste in their mouth  much like that of ""Matrix: Reloaded,"" which ironically has a plot that is eerily similar to ""Dead Man's Chest.""Overall, people who can't look past their sentimental attachment to the first film will proclaim the sequel as a success. Unfortunately, the rest of us will know that isn't the case",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jack is Back and Totally Rocking,"When I found out they were making a sequel to my favorite movie ever, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, I was thrilled and yet frightened at the same time. It's no secret in Hollywood that sequels are usually pretty bad compared to the original movies. That was my fear for Pirates 2, all up until actually seeing the movie.Reading the reviews before the movie, the critics were mixed about it. Some though better than the original, some though total waste of time. Yahoo's average critic rating was a B-, MovieFone's was a 52/100.That helped sky-rocket my fear even more. Until I saw that MovieFone also gave Pirates 1 a 60/100. So I realized, what do they know? But going to see the movie allowed me to give my own opinion. And let me tell you, the movie DID NOT disappoint.Most say the movie was somewhat slow in the beginning, I say it was character building. Most say the movie was too long, I agree it could have been shorter.That's about it though. The movie had stunning special effects, great characters, more humor, and more Captain Jack than in the first movie, which after all is the reason we see it right? :) While the first is still better, the second is enjoyable, as long as you make your bathroom trip before the movie.Some people say waste of time. I say look at it this way, if you walk into the theater expecting to be blown out of your mind by the amazing sequel to '03's hit, you will be disappointed. But if you enter the theater expecting to watch a movie based on a theme park ride (just like most did going to see the first), and...get this...have pirates in it, you will be satisfied.Just my two cents ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Disappointing, but Nonetheless Enjoyable,","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and an impressive cast. It is quite gripping at times, as we see Captain Jack Sparrow in even more peril, Johnny Depp is still in great form the second time around, his grace and charm in the role is always the highlight for me.Will and Elizabeth's relationship is poorly developed here, which was the biggest let down for me. It was established very well in Curse of the Black Pearl, but we really do not get anything new about their life together here, it is the very same as the predecessor. As well as that, the plot is simply not as good, we are given so much in this movie, but it is lacking the magic of the first, despite all that is presented, I still finished it not feeling stimulated. It may be a let down, but Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is still fun ride, worth the watch if you are a fan of the original, or if you are looking for a good action or adventure.Captain Jack Sparrow heads on a journey with his crew to find Davy Jones' heart in order to avoid becoming his slave. He soon discovers he has many rivals looking for the very same thing.Best Performance: Johnny Depp",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Entertaining yes, but not half as good as the first one.","Well, of course stakes were high to the sequel of the wonderful and hilarious first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. After watching the second one now, I must say that I am a little disappointed. As always in those blockbusters they try everything to top the previous movie and so they did in this one, CGIwise. The CGI was even more elaborate than in the first movie, the ghost pirates ghastlier, slimier, whatnot. Thing is though, if you do a thing like that, don't forget to add the charme and inventiveness story-wise that made it all worthwhile watching in the first place!Seriously, the kraken was great. The ships and island design was marvellous. Davy Jones and his crew are frightening and creepy, but after some time you get tired of seeing another detail to a pirate-turning-into-sea-creature CGI and wish to have a little more story to hold on to. And that in fact is the biggest let-down of the movie. At times in the movie I was vividly thinking of the first Pirates movie and found myself wishing they had done some things different.The hunt for Davy Jones's chest is nothing more than a repetition of the story of the first movie in a slightly varied form. There's no character development whatsoever for all of the main characters, especially and sadly so, Captain Jack Sparrow. Heck, of course I loved Jack Sparrow in the first movie, but in this movie there's no new side to him whatsoever and even some of the jokes his character pulls off (some of the best in all the movie) only entertain because they refer to the first movie. I wish they had given Johnny Depp and thus Jack Sparrow a little more to do than just repeat the whole routine of the first movie. A wicked love twist, a turning point where he gets to reflect some of his motives of becoming a pirate, whatever... something that would have made him a little less shallow. Yup, the wonderful Jack Sparrow has become a little too flat in this one character-wise and that's my biggest complaint. Calling him a caricature of his own character in the first movie would probably go too far but I guess you know what I mean after watching the movie. God, it's Johnny Depp, give the man something to do and he'll shine so why not try something new here?Orlando Bloom as Will and Keira Knightly as Elisabeth get the plot twists in this one, which is nice to see and gives their characters sort of a more round feeling. I loved that Norrington was back in this one in a very different ""shape"" as in the first movie. And I loved the ending ""surprise entrance"" of one well beloved character no one was expecting to show up. But the cliffhanging itself was a little annoying as the movie was too obviously ending to make you go see the third one. A little more subtlety would have helped here.The movie does entertain, no doubt, and it was great to see the characters back in action. But all in all the first movie had much more to offer, most of all a heart and soul, which somehow was lacking in this movie. Sadly, because you think after making such a wonderful first movie, they would have learned what the audience cares about.Elaborate CGI, great. But the story and characters were what carried the first movie. I hope they remember that when they finish the third Pirates of the Caribbean.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Excellent Movie, it's everything i was expecting!!!!","Excellent Movie, It's everything I was expecting!!!! What I like the most, of course, It's Jack Sparrow (Depp). And we have been able to enjoy a stronger performance of Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will's character (Bloom). The addition of Bill's character it was necessary, Davy Jones it's a terrible man marked by a terrible past as well. And the fact that this sequel is based on Love tragedies, like Jones and Turner's It makes me involve more intensely on the movie, and in the one to come for next year. I don't know how it's going to end, but I want a happy ending for this story.

Repulsive looking Davy Jones but Captain Jack is still a Charmer,"I'm a big Johnny Depp fan and a BIG Captain Jack Sparrow Fan (I even have a Captain Jack Sparrow T-shirt I wear all the time). This being the case, I don't think it would've been possible for me not to have liked Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest at all. However, I was hoping to come away from the movie just as excited about it, as I was after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl, but I wasn't. The sequel fell short of the originality and nonstop excitement we got in the first.The biggest disappointment in Dead Man's Chest is the character of Davy Jones played by Bill Nighy. It seems ironic that Jack Sparrow's character was a sure sign of genius and ingenuity from the creative mind of Johnny Depp, and is what made Pirates of the Caribbean the phenomenon it is today. Yet in the sequel, someone came up with a repulsive looking Davy Jones who is half man/half sea creature. He had the characteristics of cross-between a Star Wars and Lord of the Rings monster with eyes befitting a mass murderer from some horror flick. I found it difficult to look at the screen when there were close-ups of him, which was often. Bootstrap Bill's character, played by Stellan Skarsgård wasn't as bad, but unimpressive as well. He looked like some kind of freak in a costume someone would throw together on Halloween night.Other than a few characters missing, the cast from Curse of Black Pearl was in Dead Man's Chest and it was enjoyable to see an ensemble of the old delightfully original and charismatic characters again.As for Captain Jack Sparrow, well as can be expected he was the star of the show; however, Depp appeared to play the character with less flamboyance and animation this time around. I wondered if Depp might have enjoyed pretending to be a real-life pirate more in Curse of the Black Pearl than he did in Dead Man's Chest. The thrill of it all might have faded just a bit, which wouldn't be hard to understand considering Johnny Depp's apparent need for unusual, offbeat and eccentric roles.The best part of the Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest is the ending which makes you leave the theater wishing the Part III sequel was playing the next day. There is an unexpected twist that will keep you wondering how it will play out in the sequel.Bottom line... Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it as good as the first? Unfortunately not.

"Religious symbolism, great film, enjoyable plot","I went extremely early to get in line for this movie. First in line to get in, and it was well worth the hour long wait.The movie starts off with a gruesome beginning, I don't really understand the whole reason, but just watching the first five minutes, you are just flown into the beautiful camera-work, as opposed to the first film, where the slightest move and the camera went shaky.All the actors are amazing, beautifully portraying their characters, and so much detail into their personal lives. You learn secrets, betrayals, and loyalties during this movie, which leaves your head swimming by the time the credit rolls.I must admit, I went and watched this movie again, trying to figure out exactly all that went on. Be ready to ""jump in"" and try to piece the puzzle together. This movie was very long, but very entertaining. It took another go for me to figure out all the details that the movie gave for this and the next film, but I will gladly suggest you go see it, if you haven't already.The movie is a lot of good vs. evil, and there is a lot of religious symbolism, or at least I thought so.

And The Rum is Back!,"I should probably put this out on the table right away: I'm possibly the biggest fan of Pirates of the Caribbean ever. Biggest fan as in: I know all the words by heart and I remember 99% of all the tidbits I've ever picked up. And it shows. End of story. Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, let me get on to reviewing POTC: Dead Man's Chest. I've read several newspaper reviews and most of them say the same thing, that although the critics enjoyed the movie, they found it to be rather rambling and they were irked by the ending (or lack there of). I can see the truth in what they say, but that doesn't mean I necessarily agree with it. Dead Man's Chest rocks. It's 150 minutes of pulse racing, jaw dropping, swashbuckling fun. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:+ Everyone has returned for a second time around on the ride. And I can guarantee you that this wouldn't work without the original cast and crew. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio create another wonderful script for our enjoyment, full of the same enjoyable banter that we had the first time around. Many of the funnier lines are jokes that you will probably only get if you've seen The Curse of The Black Pearl, but that's not a problem in the slightest. {Jack's lines: ""Elizabeth! Hide the rum."" and ""I'm still rooting for you mate""; Elizabeth fainting to get attention; as well as the constant correction that it's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow.} Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer return as director and producer respectfully; so the style is much the same, only a few shades darker. Hans Zimmer's score completely blows me away. It's not all brand new, which helps to link The Curse of the Black Pearl to Dead Man's Chest. The pulse racing music from the sword fights is redone, so that it's the same, but different. There are several scores using the organ, which adds this wonderful spine tingling atmosphere to the movie. A round of applause to whoever designed Davy Jones and his crew. And you thought that undead skeleton pirates were cool. If Dead Man's Chest is not nominated for Best Make-up at the Oscar's, it is a crime. + Captain Jack's back my friends. Johnny Depp delivers once again as the flamboyant, perpetually drunk captain of The Black Pearl. Some people may consider him to be TOO over the top, but I didn't see it that way at all. I doubt if he'll win a second Oscar nomination, but he's wonderful anyways. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner is much more self assured, and far less pathetic this time around. 99% pirate, we're almost there Will. Of our 3 main characters, Elizabeth is the one who's changed the most. She's learned to handle a sword, and she's much more independent. But man is she making the rounds! I have to say that by the end of Dead Man's Chest, I hate her  in the best way possible. Major snaps to Keira Knightley for her brilliant job. Not only does she deliver the most hilarious monologue in the movie, she's also an amazing swords-woman. Another brilliant return is Jack Davenport as the dethroned James Norrington. We encounter Norrington about half way through the movie, and he's no longer the prim sophisticated Commodore. Now he's a drunk, pot head, half out of his mind who's only wish is to regain what he's lost. Even going so far as to sign onto The Black Pearl. Kevin R. McNally's back as Mr. Gibbs and we love him. The gruffest, sweetest pirate around, he's wonderful. But the best performances would probably have to go to two new comers. Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy. Skarsgard delivers as Bootstrap Bill Turner, one of the few crewmen of ""The Flying Dutchman"" who haven't lost their humanity. His performance as Will's father is touching and if you're sentimental like me, parts of it are down right heart breaking. But Bill Nighy steals the show as Davy Jones. He just looks astounding! His range is amazing. He jumps from a cruel captain to a broken hearted romantic in a second. I don't know if he's applicable for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but I really hope he's nominated. + Just like its predecessor, the sword fights in Dead Man's Chest are spine tingling. If you thought that a sword fight in and out of the moonlight was cool, check out this three way sword fight  part of which takes place on a detached water wheel. It gave me chills.I understand why some people may not be completely enthralled by this movie. Like all movies, it is flawed. But they don't detract from the finished project in the slightest. But here they are anyway:The movie does ramble and I suppose that it is rather long. The entire thing on the cannibal island  though entertaining  does nothing for the plot. All the same, it's entertaining, and I wouldn't take it out. - The entire crew of ""The Black Pearl"" is back, with the one exception of Anamaria. Her character is just  gone. She's never mentioned, so it leaves me wanting to know what happened.And you've probably heard it by now, but I'll repeat it: Dead Man's Chest doesn't really end. It is the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers. Bah humbug. There's the huge shocker, and then the credits roll. So your sitting there, thinking, ""What? It's over? No way. They can't do this! No! I want to see it now!"" But alas, we will have to wait until Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opens. Still the more I think about it, the happier I am about it. It's a ploy to get you to see the third movie, but who cares! It works, while still rocking the house. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Improving a little on the first entry, Dead Man's Chest is not dead on arrival.","The stakes have been upped for ""Dead Man's Chest"", the 2006 sequel to the immensely popular, though I thought generally underwhelming, 2003 effort ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"": said Black Pearl, a haunted pirate galleon, has been replaced by the even more efficient Flying Dutchman; Geoff Rush's un-dead captain, Barbossa, and his motley crew of zombies have been replaced by a sadistic freak-show led by Bill Nighy, and the appearance of several new characters, not the mention the fleshing out of one or two old supporting ones, gives the film a broader sense of both scope and appeal.The film is, I suppose, little more than a romp around a series of photogenic tropical islands, but is never-the-less good, clean honest fun; a sort of physical incarnation of all those games of Lego pirates & soldiers you might have played when you were younger on bases decked out to look like desert islands or within the confines of stone-carved fortresses you'd first have to build from the instructions. There were swords; muskets; treasure chests; an assortment of characters and palm trees housing monkeys you could clip on at funny angles.""Dead Man's Chest"" essentially covers the plights of two separate lead characters, a good looking clean-cut civilian with an honest trade, in Will Turner (Bloom), and a roguish, smooth-talking pirate in Jack Sparrow (Depp), whom nobody ever seems to truly get along with within the confines of the film yet nevertheless everybody loved within the public domain after his debut in the 2003 original. In the Bermudan town of Port Royal, stronghold it would appear of the British navy some two hundred years ago, and certainly in an alternate universe, Turner and his love, Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) are arrested on grounds of treason for helping a condemned man escape justice. The local governor hatches a plan to let them both go, but only on the grounds that Turner venture forth and bring back a particular compass belonging to Sparrow...Sparrow, meanwhile, is busily making his own escape from a gruesome island prison which seems to be the sort of place that locks prisoners up and forgets about them, an early indication that the film is unafraid of going to some fairly nasty places. He is introduced as a resourceful chap prone to bursts of oddball comedy, playing dead and getting away in one of the many coffins prison employees are tossing away into the sea (something which calls to mind James Bond's escape from behind enemy lines in ""Octopussy"") before rather mercilessly shooting open the casket and wiping out a bird that had followed his vessel out to sea. Not too long after this, he encounters an island occupied by a tribe of cannibals who elevate him to a God-like status - a mere reflection of what the public did to him after Depp's initial performance.As Turner seeks Sparrow's compass, Sparrow himself seeks the key to a certain treasure chest to whit only his compass will guide him. Hot on his heels for mostly unrelated reasons is Davy Jones (Nighy) himself and a crew of un-dead body-horror inclined psychopaths who look to settle a debt with him. And what a crew they are: barnacle and rot-covered fish-like creatures, wavy tentacles and pained expressions, involuntarily vomiting up seawater - disgusting to look at but a technical marvel within the confines of filmic imagery. One of these monsters, played by Stellan Skarsgård, turns out to be Will's father and it is surprising how affecting the scenes are between the two characters as they converse about their respective situations.Broadly speaking, the film attempts to re-enact ""The Good, the Bad & the Ugly"" on water - vast, open swathes of desert become the open seas; horses are traded for boats and six-shooters become cutlasses. The American Civil War is substituted for some kind of battle for naval supremacy between rival factions. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun encouraging the audience to root for Bloom's character to succeed in his mission and save the day so that he may go home and walk off into the sunset with his soul-mate, but that means forcing the audience to go against the character they like the most, which of course is Sparrow, who will meet a grizzly end at the hands of Davy Jones should he fail.This interplay, like with the aforementioned Leone opus, between the varying sides keeps both the energy and interest levels high. It is something which culminates, of sorts, in a standout sequence involving three different characters sword fighting with each other across the beaches and forestry of a desert island; into the ruins of an old church and then on top of the most durable waterwheel in cinematic history. This is then further ramped up when members of Jones' gang turn up looking for something one of the initial three has on their person.""Dead Man's Chest"" is not great art, but it brings a smile to your face - whether that is through two pirates, who used to be un-dead, but are now alive, conversing about mortality, or via the head-spinning yet strangely steadfast logic of Jack Sparrow as he bargains his way out of another sticky situation, is up to you. For me, the film seemed to iron out all the problems I had with the first one, in terms of pacing and why I was supposed to at all care about those on screen, and run with a similarly magnetic approach, the likes of which I can't say I didn't enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best bit of the film was the end credits scrolling up the screen and the realisation that after too long sat in a cinema seat wasting time watching this utter drivel that it was thankfully time to go home.Unfortunately, it's going to be necessary to watch part 3 to see if it can redeem the trilogy by being as good or better than the first film.

"All Hype, No Substance","Back in the company of Captain Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp) we are again taken on an escapade of the melancholy and mischievous sort. This time Jack is on a search for the the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop ""comedy"" and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality it's a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. ""I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on"", said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
indescribably spectacular,"'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is not only a worthy sequel to 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', but stands alone in the strides it has made to outdo its predecessor, which is easily done. From the incredibly amazing action sequences, to superb performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Bill Nighy, to an unpredictable climax, 'Pirates' 2 is a spectacular piece of film-making from Gore Verbinski.The plot is simple enough. Jack Sparrow (Depp) must repay a debt to the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones (Nighy): his soul. Eventually, Jack barters with Jones so that Jack can be spared if he provides 100 souls as his replacement. Meanwhile, back on Port Royal, Elizabeth Swann (Oscar nominee Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) have been arrested for their actions in the first film (aiding the escape of a pirate). Will negotiates a deal with the new ruler of Port Royal, which is to retrieve Jack Sparrow's mysterious compass, in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom. And it appears Mr. Norrington has vanished without a trace since resigning his post months earlier...This movie is full of twists and turns, which do not stop until Gore Verbinski's name appears on the screen. I could tell you them, but that would be nothing short of torture. What stands out most to me is the fantastic writing and direction, because without this, everything short of Johnny Depp's performance are impossible. The action scenes are utterly fantastic, and in terms of 'wow factor', they compare with last year's best visual effects film, King Kong. Incredible sword fights are ripe here, much moreso than in 'Pirates' 1.The acting is nothing short of phenomenal. Johnny Depp is in prime Oscar form, and to say another nomination (or possibly a win) for playing Captain Jack is not only possible, but probable. The way he can make this character his own is unbelievable, but every movement, every line...it all seems like Depp has it premade in his brain. I don't think I've ever seen someone play a character like Jack this well. I actually enjoyed Orlando Bloom's Will Turner this time around, because he didn't mess around. He gets straight to the point, no hesitation. Good acting on Bloom's part. Keira Knightley doesn't have as much screen time as before, but still flourishes with what she's given. She does lose a little bit of fanfare for her 'actions' later in the film, but her performance is well done, and I know this because I couldn't picture anyone else in the role but the young Oscar nominee. I absolutely loved Bill Nighy as the film's villain, Davy Jones. He has this certain presence about him that is in effect BEFORE he appears for the first time. You keep wondering when this fearsome villain will appear, so I will not tell you when he does, for that would ruin the suspense of his appearance. He does an excellent job, despite having little to no face to work with. Another performance I thought was very well done was Stellan Skarsgaard as Boostrap Bill Turner, aka Will's dad. 'Wait, wasn't he dead?' His mysterious survival is explained very early on in the film, and it makes a lot of sense. Skarsgaard does a great job of making the audience feel for him, feel his pain. He and Bloom only share a handful of scenes together, but you can definitely feel the chemistry as father and son between them. All the performances are great, even the creepy one, Naomie Harris (28 Days Later...) as Tia Dalma.Gore Verbinski has constructed an epic masterpiece that is good for everyone above age 9, because there are some scary jumpy moments that made me shudder. The humor you've come to expect is right there, complete with plenty of rum jokes...'why is the rum always gone?'. 'Dead Man's Chest' is one of the best films of recent memory, and surpasses 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' in every aspect comparable. You must see this film, because it's one you'll never forget.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST 10/10 --spy",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Ayyy, The Rum Too","Greetings again from the darkness. Must admit that the first POTC was one my favorite films of 2003. Filled with action, humor and freshness, it brought a unique approach to the screen. Of course, sequels are always challenging and usually a let down. Although, I hesitate to call Dead Man's Chest a let down, it does lack the spontaneity and spark of the first. That said, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie-going experience and one not to be missed.Director Gore Verbinski returns with a bit darker, less tongue-in-cheek approach as Captain Jack Sparrow (the amazing Johnny Depp) searches for the key to regain his soul. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also return with a lame love story that luckily gets very little play after the first 15 minutes. The darker approach this time includes a fascinating pirate character named Davy Jones, who may be the most eye-catching creature ever captured on film. You simply can't take your eyes off of him! Jones is played by the totally unrecognizable Bill Nighy (who everyone remembers from ""Love Actually""). Watching Davy Jones play the organ is itself worth the price of admission.Also new to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard (""Good Will Hunting"") as Bootstrap Bill, Bill Turner's (Bloom) lost soul father forever banished to serve Davy Jones. The scenes with Skarsgard and Bloom lacked the punch one would have expected. Actually most of the scenes with Bloom lack punch. Maybe we have grown a bit tired of his simple eye-batting method acting.Depp, of course, is the real star. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the more popular screen characters of all time. Kids and Adults love him. He is not quite wicked and not quite a good man. We can tell Depp has fun with the character, but it is easy to take his performance for granted the second time around. Try not to. It is a real pleasure to watch.Yes, the story is pretty weak and very little character development occurs. But that's not what this series is about, is it? The new sea creatures are remarkable (putting the first of the new round of ""Star Wars"" to shame).

I love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom as actors and i enjoy watching them act because they have great chemistry. if you loved the first one the second one will blow you away. at the end it keeps you wanting more. from the beginning you are eager to find out more and more. i just can't wait until may 25th 2007 when the third and final one is released. also, that 7 hour wait line there was at Disneyland in California for the re opening of the pirate line was completely worth its wait. these are the best movies i have ever seen and i want to watch it again; i cant wait until it's released i want the movie!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!!!!!!!!!,"This is probably one of the most exciting movie of all time. It has everything to consider it that way, simply excellent. I went crazy on the cinema, I couldn't stop watching the movie....i didn't even blink. For starting, the story is absolutely fantastic...when you think the action is going to stop, you r wrong......something new come up. The acting of Johnny Depp is amazing.......the way he plays a pirate. Orlando Bloom is great too. The effects are awesome!!!!!.....more characters appears, and the old ones are present too, making this movie one classic from now on. I am not going to tell you about the end, because its what gives sense to the movie.......but I tell you that I couldn't get up from my chair. Totally recommended!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Breath-taking movie, outstanding Johnny Depp","When I saw the first movie I thought: Johnny Depp could get a nomination for this one. And so he did. When I saw the sequel yesterday I said to my friends: Depp deserves an Oscar for this wonderful performance! And I do believe it! You should agree that despite all the effects, the story and the funny characters, without Johnyy Depp it would have been just another Hollywood blockbuster. But I certainly do not underestimate the power of Gore Verbinski's production. It will grab you from the beginning and won't let you even in the end, simply because the adventure hardly begins. Now we are waiting for the final of the trilogy, hoping to be even longer than 150 minutes, because lately there are not many movies that can make us both laugh and admire the effects for that long.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"In the oily sea, the killing ground","When I left the theater after having seen the first Pirates sequel, I overheard two guys behind me talking about the movie, one of whom importantly summed up the movie with the words, ""It was like, all action no story."" I didn't look, but I'm sure he puffed out his chest as he said it, too. While I'm sure that I am guilty of something like it from time to time, there is nothing that irritates me more than people who walk into a movie like this, sum it up with some cliché, and then fold their arms triumphantly, sure that they are superior to everyone involved in making the movie. What a tool.On the other hand, my reaction may have something to do with the fact that the story in this movie is so huge that I think I would have to watch it at least three or four times before I really caught everything that was going on. The plot is hardly Shakespearean in its intricacy, but for a summer popcorn blockbuster it's pretty intense.The movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but for sheer entertainment it resides comfortably near the top of the list of the current releases. Granted, it's too long by about 45 minutes, Keira Knightly has not done much to shake that pompous Britishness that made her role in the first movie (and this one) goofy almost to the point of being intolerable, the great Johnny Depp comes dangerously close to overacting once or twice, Orlando Bloom rarely stops overacting from beginning to end, and the action sequences are so long and so CGI and cut together so dizzyingly fast that there will be times when you will want to close your eyes, not to mention that some of the action setups are just ridiculous. Captain Jack's rotisserie situation, for example, shocked me because I didn't think I would see something this soon which would outdo the stampede sequence in King Kong for absurdity.However, the CGI effects are certainly impressive, Davy Jones is a phenomenal villain (the effects that created him and that make up his facial expressions remind me of how impressed I was with Gollum in Lord of the Rings), and like I said, I was highly impressed with the depth of the story. I think the movie definitely suffered from an obviously exploded budget, there are times when it seems that they didn't know when to stop spending money on the movie, but for the most part I think they were able to keep it in check (the swordfight on top of the rolling water-wheel, however, is not an example of keeping limitless spending in check).I didn't love the movie as much as I had heard I would, I liked Captain Jack Sparrow a lot better in the original film, and by the time this one was finally over I was numb from the waist down (and around the eye-sockets, somewhat), but there is a hell of a lot of movie here, and the closing scene will have you jumping out of your seat for part 3",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nearly as good as original,"Dead Man's Chest, the middle child in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy-to-be, really is a lot of fun, if not as wowing as the original. The main story - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must come up with 100 souls to satisfy a debt to supernatural Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), while Will (Orlando Bloom) must retrieve Jack's compass to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from certain death - happily takes center stage, relegating the latter's romance to second-banana status. And that's a jolly good thing, too, because if there's anything to sink this wave-soaring vessel, it'd be a treacly kissy-kissy subplot.From the outset, bad things are afoot. Jack finds out the time's come to repay his debt to Jones, who commands a huge kraken to destroy ships. So Jack sets aground on a small island, which unfortunately is the home to a cannibal tribe. It's okay, though, because they think Jack's their god, but not so okay when they decide they need to free him from his fleshy existence - by killing and eating his crew.Will's sent by the new Lord, Cutler Beckett, to grab Jack's compass, else Will and Elizabeth will be killed. See, the compass leads to a key, which leads to a chest, the chest of one Davy Jones, and isn't it nice when the plot kind of comes full circle like that? I've always loved Johnny Depp. This is his first time in which he plays the same character in more than one movie; he's long been known as a stylish character actor, and the original Pirates made him more of a leading man. His Jack Sparrow is at once iconic and iconoclastic, daring you to like him and root for him despite all evidence to the contrary. Is he a treacherous scoundrel, or will he fight for his friends? Depp is clearly in his element here, making Sparrow his own - I don't think Disney would be able to find a suitable replacement, should the need arise.Bloom his more than his equal as Will Turner, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him in the original, of course, but I thought he was a bit overshadowed by the nuanced Depp performance. Bloom's Turner here, though, is more commanding and charismatic, idealistic where Sparrow is ambiguous, a powerful performance.Knightley could have been just another pretty face, pouting and showing off her gleaming choppers, she instead is every bit as towering and rambunctious as her male counterparts, slashing and dashing about in a mad frenzy of catlike grace. Compare her work here to that in Domino, which featured a modicum of violence of its own sort, and it's a favorable comparison indeed. Where's the mouselike Knightley I see on red carpets? The final big star of the movie is the special effects and action scenes, from the massive kraken to sinking boats, from plenty of swordplay to chases through jungles and forests. It's a true testament to the on screen magic that while one never stops to think, ""How could this possibly happen?"" one is also never overwhelmed by the bigness, the spectacle, the exasperating premise that louder is better. But the Whoa factor is in full effect, make no mistake.Full of spit and verve best suited to an angry pirate, Dead Man's Chest is full of what The Curse of the Black Pearl gave us. More of the same, in this instance, is well worth it, matey!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
boring,"The only impressive things about this movie was the incredible CGI, other than that it was completely boring and drawn out. I almost fell asleep in the middle from all the useless dialog. Oh yeah i almost forgot, why does everyone laugh at these petty ""jokes"" throughout the whole movie. If you want to make a comedy, title it as a comedy, not an action adventure. This movie simply didn't keep my on the edge of my seat. I was waiting and waiting for the action to happen and finally it came at the end for about 20 minutes, the best part of the movie. A lot of redundancy with the rum as well, seemed as though the director just ran out of personality. Not nearly what I expected. What's with these summer movies?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Darn,"I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Loved the acting the humor and the interesting twists and turns...and couldn't wait for this one. Darn. I love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and I hated this movie. It was the slapstick version of the original. What if we all acted like the Three Stooges and re-made the movie. And it's not the actor's fault. It's probably Disney's fault...certainly the writers and directors and the folks that could have said Stop! The character of Captain Jack disappeared somewhere in the bad comedy though he did a great job with what he had to work with. Orlando Bloom was in it wasn't he? With a few excellently delivered lines (he can't do otherwise) he seemed to be kind of melded into the special effects. And for anyone who saw Underworld...come on Davy Jones! get a new character! we could see you through your huge makeup and we wanted to see someone else. Too much CGI. Too little of what we watch Pirates to see...Johnny Depp...acting...being Captain Jack... I was greatly disappointed. Sorry. I hate saying bad stuff about people I love. Lots of good people (I have to exclude K. Knightly...someone please tell her how to hold her face naturally and quit with the lip thing...)with not much to do.

Purely Amazing!!,"I could NOT believe that it was over when it was!! This movie was chalk full of thrills, laughs, scares, and everything else that makes a Blockbuster film. Johnny Depp returns with a bigger and better performance, and had me hanging on his every slurred word. The action scenes are AMAZING, and the twisted romantic plot line really had me hooked. The many different plots coming together was definitely what sets this movie apart, and what earns it a 10! I've seen it 3 times, and if I can find more people to go with me, I'll keep going until it's out of the theaters!! I LOVED this movie, and I recommend it for everyone!! I know a lot of people who said they didn't like it, but I'm sure they just couldn't follow the purposefully confusing storyline. But, I know an equal number of people who say they LOVED it, so just go see for yourself!!

Solid Entertaining Movie,"So I finally saw the movie that the entire nation has been buzzing about (top 1-day gross, beating Star Wars Ep 3, and top 3 day gross, beating Spiderman 2), and I must say, it was an entertaining film, though not as deep or complex as the first one.Again, like the first movie, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", the movie is fun, entertaining, has good graphics, and supported by a very strong cast that includes the great Johnny Depp, as well as Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Other than the sometimes hard-to-comprehend ""pirate talk"" and a somewhat confusing/convoluted plot line, I enjoyed my 2.5 hours in the theater.

"Critics drop the ball yet again. The best movie of the summer thus far. Yes, even better than Superman.","Let's start by showing what the critics are saying about this film.""Pirates of the Caribbean returns to theaters for more summer swashbuckling, only they may have forgotten to buckle their swash."" -Joshua Tyler, Cinemablend.com.""Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."" -Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly.""This sequel is appropriately named, because that's what you'll be staring at for nearly half the movie: dead men's chests."" -Diana Saenger, Reeltalk Movie Reviews.Oh, thank you critics. You make your misguided opinions so much easier to discredit when you think you're being funny. Aside from the obvious smear campaign these critics are trying (and will undoubtedly fail) to pull off, there was nothing about this film that didn't work for me.First thing's first. Did you like the first one? If so, you can proceed to ignoring half of the negative reviews already -- the people who ALSO did not like the first one. Do you like the character of Jack Sparrow? Then ignore the other half, who seem to have a problem understanding that in sequels, characters are expected to return and continuity problems would arise if the actor would change the way he played that character.Truth be told, this IS like a theme ride. But like the first one, it's like the best damn theme ride you ever rode on. The action sequences and special effects were top notch. The CGI didn't bother me so much because it didn't look like CGI. Most impressive was the way they handled Davey Jones. You really can't tell where Bill Nighy's extensive make-up becomes CGI tentacles. It's brilliant. I couldn't help but wonder why all Blockbusters couldn't be like this one. And the swordfighting? Well, don't get me wrong. These are among the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen on film. However, it seems to me someone forgot to buckle their swash. I don't know what that means, but evidently that got to SOMEONE.All the characters are back in pure form and then some. Jack Sparrow now deals with inner turmoil, and if anyone can do that, it's Johnny Depp. Not only that, but he still retains his charm and remains just as likable in this film as he was in its predecessor. Keira Knightley gives one of the best performances of her career (topped only by her performance in Pride & Prejudice). Orlando Bloom's acting has improved as well. New additions to the cast such as Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as another important character (not saying who) also add another layer of excellence to the film.The film's atmosphere is much darker this time around, and I gotta say I freakin' loved it. It was like all the fun of the first film with a sense of impending darkness. In fact, the film opens up on a pretty down note, and by the end, any shred of innocence the series may have had has been shot to oblivion... once again, making me glad they went for the PG-13 rating as opposed to PG.As I said before, the climactic fight scene is one of the greatest fight scenes ever seen on film. This is the kind of stuff that would make Errol Flynn say, ""whoa."" It was a beautifully choreographed triple threat swordfight in the midst of an epic battle, and let me tell ya, THAT was the most fun I've had within the last three summers.Sure, it's a lengthy picture. In this case, that's a good thing. Because in its entire running time, I never got bored. They don't give you a chance to get bored. When they're not fighting, the characters are always enough to keep you going. The story is NOT lacking as the critics will have you believe, it did NOT lose its heart, and it most certainly is NOT guilty of double-dipping. This is the best movie of the summer, and it's not Verbinski's fault, or Depp's fault, or the screenwriters' fault that critics are too thick-headed to realize that.And a note about the ending: not only will you NOT see it coming, but you will most definitely WANT to see the third one. Sure, it's a cliffhanger ending, but I assure you, at the very last line uttered in the film, you will cheer.100%",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Slightly Disappointing...,"Okay, so the first one has to be hard to follow, but this was slightly ridiculous. Sure, it's your standard special-effects filled action packed hilarious film. Johnny Depp is amazing in it and Jack Davenport does a bang-up job, but until about 40 minutes from the end (of a 149 minute film!) the plot has little discernible continuity, and jumps from one storyline to another WAY too much to hold much concentration.It definitely pulls together at the end, leaving hope for a promising 3rd film, only to be almost completely ruined by a completely god awful slow-motion shot of Jack Sparrow..Certainly worth seeing, but don't get too excited. Look forward to the 3rd!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
CGI smothers plot,"1) I got the very strong impression that Disney was more intent on promoting new additions to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme park ride, rather than articulate an adventure to us. How many more scenes of huge structures containing people, rolling through the jungle, can one endure in a single movie? I say again, ""huge structures CONTAINING PEOPLE, rolling through the jungle""(get ready to ROLL, Disney theme park fans!) The one involving the water wheel was a bit too long, especially following the rolling CAGE in which the pirates had been held captive. One gag depicting a large object, rolling through the jungle, filled with disoriented characters (still not getting it?) per movie is quite enough, please. 2) This is a classic example of CGI effects overwhelming story. There were way too many distracting, living sea creatures, popping out of the bodies of characters who surrounded a speaking actor, for me to keep up with the unfolding story. Many times, an actor would deliver his/her lines in desperation as antennae, eels, tentacles, etc., waved about his or her face, in the background, as well as the foreground. This was fascinating, but distracting. On further reflection, I had the identical feeling of confusion experienced after viewing ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (I was tempted to go see the Riddick turkey again, in the hopes of clearing up the confusion). Sorry, some may find this comparison insulting, but the problem of CGI domination held sway in both of these movies. The single responsive word in my mind as I left both flicks was, ""Wha...?"". 3) As for the voodoo woman in the swamp...what the he** was she saying? Her accent was too thick; authentic, possibly, but too thick, and delivered in a tone which was too soft. What might be more important here? Authentic accent, or successful communication? I simply caught little of what she said, except the part about the jar of dirt, a very weak gag that was just a flash in the pan. 4) Ditto for the squiddy Davey Jones character...just what the he** was HE saying? Under all those fleshy, invertebrate protuberances, his lines were almost impossible to discern. 5) Just as Johnny Depp's character rose out of his throne to address the issue of a larger fire, watch as he seems to suddenly remember to employ the Keith Richards characterization of his body movements. Watch in particular his hastily extended right arm, just as he rises from the throne. It was as if, ""Oops! I almost forgot to move about like Keith Richards! This production is killing me, and another is yet to be wrapped!"" He seemed to jerk himself into character. I think that during shooting, Johnny had been enjoying his rest upon that movie prop, and suddenly, the director shouted, ""Roll 'em!"", or, ""we're not paying you all that money to sleep on the job, Depp!"", totally taking him by surprise(don't get me wrong...I'm a Depper, myself...) I made a point to carefully observe the audience, once this overly-long movie had ended. By the looks on their faces, they were as confused as I was, and in quite a lot of pain as they rose stiffly from the chair they had been seated in for well over two hours. Also, the reintroduction of Captain Barbossa at the very end seemed to be a slap in the face (What's this? You add yet ANOTHER twist to this already convoluted plot?) POTC seemed to be in competition with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy at this point, an effort to one up THAT most excellent trilogy. It should have been acknowledged, however, that the LOTR trilogy has been thoroughly time-tested. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now seems to be running a marathon (weighed down by carelessly applied CGI, as well as a patchwork plot), in direct competition with LOTR, a strange ""keeping up with the Joneses"" phenomena in movie-making(""We gotta have OUR trilogy too, Frodo!"") This time, my ticket had been free. I will likely return, though, paying for a ticket this time around, hopefully in order to clear up some of the confusion. I will try to listen far more intently to ""voodoo-woman"" and ""squid-man"", endeavouring to filter out more of the waving sea-fauna/flora which fought for my attention. Maybe this is just another case of ""organized confusion"" to persuade me to purchase a ticket. You got me, Disney. I'm there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jack Davenport got his wish.,"This is a great fairy-tale of a movie. Even more slap-stick, far-fetched, & outrageous than the first. For these reasons, it is a great ""I-need-a-break-from-my-daily-grind"" movie. So, sure, the plot was a little underdeveloped & so they stuck that extra little bit about the natives in there at the beginning to make up for it, & so what if the cutting back & forth between the story lines was a little chaotic...I still loved it, even though it became rather difficult to understand the dialogue occasionally. I had heard the ending was a frustrating cliff-hanger, so I expected the credits to roll at any crucial moment towards the end of the hefty two & half hours; however, when it did come, it was by no means as maddening as the Two Towers, or an Alias episode finish. So, not to worry. Go see it, laugh all the way through at the flawed, over-confident Captain Jack, & most of all, enjoy all the little scenes from the ride.

A Breath Of Fresh Air,"Wow. Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest is the first movie I've seen in a long time that I didn't feel like taking my 8 bucks back after seeing it. I've been watching a lot of movies recently and they've all been sad disappointments. Not this one though. This film was funny, intense, emotional, and much better than the first one in my opinion. The writers deserve awards for the beautifully scripted storyline that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat as the main plot unfolds through a plethora of intriguing sub-plots. Every character wanted their own thing and while that may sound like a basic dramatic rule, many movies have lacked that recently (watch the movie to see what I mean). Excellently written characters were brought to life by phenomenal actors. We all love Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, let's face it, but Davy Jones was the best computer-animated character since Gollum in Lord of the Rings. I own the soundtrack which contains a palette of moods from deep-villainous organs to lofty circus music to tribal dance beats. Simply put, I have to thank everyone involved with this film.

I have to say that the film is a slight bit darker than the first, but it all fits together very well and the roller-coaster ride style of the film is sprinkled with constant comedic timing just like the first. I wouldn't recommend it for the extremely young crowd (there were a couple loud groans from the audience during certain slightly gory bits), but other than that it is an amazing film.One friend of mine was angry because she thought the film to be very ""un-finished""--keep in mind that there is ANOTHER Pirates film coming out next year!See it.

"'ad Too Much Rum, Luv?","If you enjoyed ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", this second helping is more of the same. Make that MUCH more of the same. It all comes to a rousing conclusion, so stick it out - but, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is exhaustingly loud and long, and you tend to forget plot strands during the running time.Slosh-buckling, swish-buckling Captain Johnny Depp (as Jack Sparrow) is back, of course (and, undoubtedly a richer man for it); along with handsome hero Orlando Bloom (as Will Turner), drop-dead gorgeous Keira Knightley (as Elizabeth Swann), and a bunch of familiar faces. Old hand Geoffrey Rush is only a tease, unfortunately - but, tentacle-bearded Bill Nighy (as Davy Jones) is an entertaining computer-generated villain.In short, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise film series goes overboard with blockbuster sensibilities herein, leaving a good measure of charm and originality dead in the water. Still, the Jerry Bruckheimer production crew performs expertly.

Without a doubt the worst pirate movie I've ever seen...,"I thoroughly enjoyed the original and went to see this movie with a very positive attitude. However, this film is over two hours of special effects and needless events. If you look past the sword-fights, weird characters, and Depp's popular pirate impersonation there is no plot development. Quentin Tarantino once said ""Good movies tell a story and bad/poorly written ones describe a situation. Unfortunately most movies that end up in theaters fall into the latter category."" ""Dead Man's Chest"" puts the same lovable and unique characters from ""Black Pearl"" into a very very long string of meaningless situations. After the first 90 minutes or so, even the characters from the first film (yes- they are all back) lost their luster. The director quickly overused the character traits and quirks that made the cast of the first movie so unique. My father (also a fan of the first film) and I compared our reactions and both drew the same conclusion: This movie is nothing more than a setup for the third, with an ending that cheaply ensures you'll be back next year. If you like Depp's face, computerized sea-creature-men, and battle scenes, then this is the one to see. However, if you are looking for substance, character development, or a plot, then I'd recommend something else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Few Good Spots but Way Too Long,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)** (out of 4)Sequel to the 2003 blockbuster has lovebirds Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) being arrested for ""helping"" the pirate Jack Sparrow. The two are facing the death penalty unless they can get that magical compass from Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and so begins another overblown storyline. I wasn't the greatest fan of the original movie but I thought it had enough good moments to make those summer blockbuster fans happy. I read a few reviews of this sequel and noticed that it too made a killing at the box office but for the life of me I can't understand why. It's fair to say that I'm just not a fan of the series. It's also fair to say that I'm wrong in my thoughts on it. I guess it's fair to say that I'm being overly harsh towards this type of movie but for the life of me I can't figure out who could be entertained by a 151-minute ""B"" movie that seems to forget to be fun in the first place. I wasn't too happy with the extended running time for the first film so added even more time just hit me by a complete surprised and I just don't see why it was needed. It's not like we're dealing with an epic story or something series. We've got a ""B"" adventure film that used to play to kids at matinees each Saturday back in the day but for some reason they take this simple genre and try to make it something bigger and in my opinion they failed big time. There are countless problems with this film but the biggest is the fact that both Bloom and Knightley have their characters cut down to the point where both are incredibly boring and neither adds a thing to the picture. Bloom seems to be sleepwalking through the part and for the most part Knightley just stands around waiting to be rescued. Depp is back and needless to say he's the best thing about the picture but at the current running time I was even growing tired of him by the 90-minute mark. Depp at least seems to be in on the fact that this is a ""B"" movie and makes his character fast and fun. The rest of the supporting players were all rather bland but I will say Geoffrey Rush was good in his few moments. Once again the film is full of CGI, which is both hit and miss as there are times where it completely overtakes the story with outrageous and unrealistic action scenes. The monsters this time out are rather unique looking because of how strange they are. I'm not sure I'd call them good looking monsters but I found the visual look of them to be interesting.

My last point is that I feel the ending of Dead Man's Chest was left way too open. I mean, come on, they might as well of just call it Dead Man's Chest part 1.

The best fun I've had all year!,"I saw the film last night and have to say I had so much fun. The original Pirates film didn't seem to click with me when I first watched it and I couldn't quite understand the hype around it - however, the more I watched it the more I liked it and I ended up being quite excited about the sequels coming out. Last night as I sat in the cinema, I surrendered myself completely to the film and was completely blown away by how wonderful it was! Here, finally, is a film that has IMAGINATION to back up the special effects. So many movies lately have been about ""hot"" actors and ""special effects"" with very un-imaginative story-lines, very little plot, and bad acting. This film is the complete opposite. Though the actors are in fact considered by many to be ""hot"" (Depp, Knightly, Bloom etc) it isn't the focus point of the film - for example, you watch Kiera Knightly and think ""Wow, she's really stunning"" but you don't really care because you are more interested in what she is doing as a character! The story is Beautifully convoluted, outrageous and over-the-top it is totally refreshing. The many and various twists, and changes in loyalties and objectives by the assortment of characters is so old-fashioned that it just might be avant-guarde and therefore it is genius! At no point in the film can you predict what each character is going to do so everything that does happen takes you completely by surprise. The fighting too is taken to a whole new level - set in almost impossible locations and yet the wonderful imagination of the writers (and most probably a collaboration between the production designers and stunt choreographers) manages to produce breathtaking and hilarious fight scenes that you totally believe! The film is also LOADED with special effects, and yet they are totally justified (which is a point that the big studios seem not to understand these days.) There is a reason for each CG shot, and each special effect that you forget you are watching special effects. But that is also because they are done SO well! you buy into everything you see - nothing makes you think ""boy, that looked fake"". The acting is fairly solid, even from Orlando Bloom who I have never really thought of as a good actor. He is probably the weakest actor in this film but he is much better than in previous work of his. Bill Nighy is one of the most outstanding members of the cast - he plays the new character of Davey Jones and he does it marvelously, albeit he is mostly obscured by tentacles. Naomie Harris, who plays another of the new characters (Tia Dalma) is excellent - so much so that I wanted to see more scenes with her in it. Kiera is solid, as she always is. It isn't her best work but then its not a film that requires her best work - she does exactly what is needed for the film and therefore is totally competent in the role! As for JONNY DEPP...he is talented. Even though he is such a legend, even though he is my idol, I completely forgot I was watching JONNY DEPP...I believed him from start to finish and my admiration for his talent grew even more. His performance was even better than I could have imagined, and if this doesn't get him that illusive Oscar, I don't know what will! (the academy will probably be politically correct and give it to him for the third movie!) Having said all of that, I now want to go and watch it again. Its not Shakespeare (as the saying goes) but for this day and age in movies, it just as well might be! The only reason why I didn't give this 10/10 was because it ended...if I had it my way it would be a never ending movie! Oh, and P.S.: Gore Verbinski, you are a legend mate!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
loved it,"A great film, more enjoyable then the first as it has Johnny Depp being thoroughly more camp and wacky then before. While I did enjoy the first movie, I wasn't a huge fan by any means. I guess it all just seemed a bit to contrived and lacking that great entertainment value which I was led to expect before seeing it. On the other hand I could tell that part was going to be pure entertainment merely from the trailers alone and I wasn't wrong. Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow and both Orlando and Keira were great to boot, not to mention a very good support cast which helped this shine ever more. This is simply a great fun flick that will leave you with that taste of wanting more. Loved it heaps.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Pirate's Life for Me!,"I just returned from seeing POTC: Dead Man's Chest and all I can say is: WOW!

The story is fresh and exciting, with a huge cliffhanger at the end that will have you screaming "" What happens next?!?"" There are amazing action scenes and even more laughs than the original! At some points, I was laughing so hard I was crying! And in some scenes I jumped out of my seat! All in all, Dead Man's Chest met and exceeded my expectations.

Not what I was suspecting,"After watching the first Pirates movie a couple years back I was psyched to see a repeat on screen this summer. As a film maker I take into consideration all sorts of things that many other movie goers might not really think about too heavily such as lighting, editing, CGI, writing and plot development. The first Pirates movie had some of the best cinematography I have seen in recent years. Dead Man's Chest however didn't repeat it's spectacular art direction and cinematography seen in the first film. My biggest complaint was the CGI used for the main ""bad guys"". The CGI characters just weren't ""believable"". The textures were off, the lighting didn't match up, even the water for the opening sequence looked more like liquid metal than water to me. I noticed the same problems with the first Pirate movie, but this movie relied on CGI so much to carry it that it really ""sunk"" the movie (man I feel corny).The writing was a big disappointment this time around. Either the actors didn't make it believable, or the writers were trying to push some new ideas too hard. To avoid spoiling the plot I'm going to redirect subjects... The overall length of the film left me anxious at the end to finally get it over with. The climax point comes and then you are left in your chair asking yourself ""what now""? Rather than dragging it out to finish off the story they leave you hanging for next year's Pirate release to finish the story from this release. It's the Matrix all over again!Seeing how many kids were in the audience and taking into consideration that this is a Disney film I was surprised at how much suggested violence there is in this movie. There's one shot that pulls away just as a bunch of captives are about to be killed on their knees. Not something that I would complain about, but Disney usually doesn't let any content of this sort on their films (they usually re-brand it as Miramax or Touchstone).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2.5 hours of my life I won't see again,"Like most of the planet, I loved the original Pirates film. This film however was not a worthy sequel. Plot ? There isn't one. I could put spoilers in this review, but it would make no difference as the plot is essentially a device to go from one CGI scene to another. It's a shame when there is acting talent available, big budgets but the most important thing - a story - is completely missing. I would advise anyone with more than 2 brain cells to avoid seeing this film; and as for other reviewers who have compared it to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I'll have some of what you are on, because you must be out of your mind. This is at least as bad as the second Matrix film, which says it all; if I could have walked out without upsetting my 10 year old daughter, I would have done. She'll have to go and see PotC 3 without me next year; life's too short for this bilge.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as the original,"It seems that this movie already has scads of positive reviews. I must say that after seeing the movie last night, I was very disappointed. However, not all of it is bad; the acting was great, for the most part, and the special effects were top-notch.It is important to view this film and the upcoming movie as one. As a story, the movie does a good job of setting us up for what is going to happen in the third film. However, as a stand-alone movie, I don't think this movie is as good as others are saying. I remember watching a half-hour in thinking that the movie would get better. It didn't. Mindless action sequences (and some were downright stupid; the prisoners inside the bone-cages reminded me of human hamsters on wheels) did nothing to help this film, and there was very little plot development--at least not enough for my tastes, considering the length of the film.However, I am going to refrain from passing final judgment on this film until I see the third movie. If the purpose of the movie was to build up the plot for the series's climax, then Pirates 2 did an excellent job. I think my problem was that I went in with higher expectations than I should; contrary to what others are saying, this movie in no way equals the first. However, concerning the series as a whole, it is paramount.Not great, but we'll see what happens next.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie wasn't that Great,"I thought the visual effects in this movie were spectacular and is a reason to see the movie by itself. However i felt the acting in this movie was below par and that the acting was better in the first one. I didn't believe the characters in a sense. I also feel like the writers of this movie took advantage of the viewers. Anyone who loved the first movie felt compelled to see this movie because they expect it will be just as good. However i think the writers realized the plot of the sequel wasn't as good so they found a way to ensure people will see the third one, the ending leaves you with too many questions and i feel this was wrong. I despise when a movie ends in a way you know anothersequel is coming, if it turns into a Jason and or Freddy series i will be annoyed, stop ruining the integrity of a good movie and rather then be lazy and milk a good movie, think of something new. Despite my dislike for certain aspects of this movie, i will see it again, simply because i love Davy Jones army/ship/Kraken. They were able to combine my joy of pirates/marine life/supernatural elements. So essentially i prefer the first one, the sequel could have been better and i await the FINAL one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Caribbean -- Dead Man's Chest,"Just saw this movie yesterday and absolutely loved it. There was a lot more action sequences in this film, much more humor, and Depp did a fantastic job as usual with the Jack Sparrow character. The special effects on the Flying Dutchman's Crew as well as Davey Jones were phenomenal! I would highly recommend this film, and if you go, stay until after the credits because there is an extra sequence at the end that you don't want to miss. It is hilarious as well. The scenery was breathtakingly shot and the views of the water alone on one of the islands makes you want to walk right through the screen to be there yourself! This movie makes you extremely anxious for Pirates 3!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good fun!!,"know i'm the first to admit that this film is no way as good as the first. Although i thoroughly enjoyed partly because i love swashbucklers no matter how bad they are(except from cutthroat island)i enjoy them.I think most people will just be expecting too much from the sequel.Even though it's a sequel it's a really different and more grown up film than the first.It's a more darker story and we get to see more character development for our main characters, coupled with amazing effects and great monsters it makes for an exciting watch.Main complaint from would be that it's too long.

"A thrilling tale of Pirates, buried treasure...and the horrors of the sea","Well, what can I say? Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest has made a tense, action-packed, scary, and devastating sequel to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" For a start, the locations are fantastic; not only was this film shot at such exotic places as St. Lucia, the Bahamas, St. Vincent and Granada; the film includes a wide variety of settings which are compulsory for a film about pirates; a tropical island with hostile natives, a filthy pub populated by drunkards (an ideal place for a riot scene), as well as a ghostly shipwreck.The characters in the film are also great, or greatly developed from the first film such as Elizabeth Swann becoming skilled with the sword and the unfortunate new fate of Commodore Norrington. They even restored the two comical pirates, Pintel and Ragetti (Ragetti is the one with a false eye) from the first film, which I think is great, as they are two people who are, although evil, funny and lovable. There is also an ethnic Caribbean wise woman, who was clearly thought up with great imagination, as well as her home, in which Ragetti stands beside a hanging jar of eyeballs, here we see an example of hilarious surrealism. What I would say were especially intriguing though were the villainous phantoms of Davy Jones' crew; unlike in the first film, these monsters are actually themed with the sea, i.e. barnacles growing on the faces, crab's claws, squid tentacles. The other great thing about the crew is that they are all individually unique (again, unlike in the first film, in which they were all just skeletons); a member of Davy Jones' crew is not just one of many ugly monsters, but he has something special to show to the audience, one pirate for example has the head of a hammer-head shark, another has a head that comes off and is able to follow its body by becoming a hermit crab. The portrayal of Davy Jones furthermore speaks for himself, and has been gruesomely but skillfully made by the costume designer to stand out as the authority amongst his crew. The conceptual artists of this film had a very gifted imagination I must say.The music score for the film is great, they kept the action theme tune from the first film, but added an extra 'B' part to the music, which, I think has been a success, as it sounds good and goes very well with the 'A' part. As I recall from one scene, as Captain Jack, Elizabeth Swann, Norrington, Pintel and Ragetti are walking across a vast beach towards the camera, the zoom focuses in quickly as significant beats of the music strike. I don't think I have seen this sort of correspondence before in a very instrumental, ""thick"" piece of film music, so I think the director Gore Verbinski was good in not being afraid to try something new. The script of the film is also brilliant and is very funny. Lines come up which you wouldn't really expect as well. These are too hilariously unexpected that I will not mention any examples (it will spoil the moment).A few aspects of this film are comparable to Steven Spielberg's version of ""The War of the Worlds"", namely towering tentacles rising and swirling themselves high above ships crow's nests, snatching the odd extra and flinging them through the air now and then, and the dreaded roar of 'the Kracken' (The Scandanavian grim-reaper of the sea), who is comparable to 'the sarlacc' from ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" in a way with its infinite teeth circling its whole mouth. Believe me, Walt Disney knows what he's doing here, as they did a version of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", which, as we all know contains a giant squid. The other great thing about the Kracken is that we don't see its whole body at first. The sight from a distance of enormous tentacles dragging down a helpless ship is enough to send a shiver down one's spine. Furthermore, we have a sense of overpowering mystery when we don't see the whole thing. We see it underwater briefly through the eyes of Will Turner as he watches the fate he brought upon an innocent merchant ship.For thrill seekers, fun lovers and film lovers, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a god-send. Although it doesn't have all that much of a plot, it contains all the classic aspects of a true piracy film; a treasure map, buried treasure, chases, hostile island natives, sword fights and plenty of them, sword fights on top of big rolling wheels, a snifter of romance and drama, a crew of pirate monstrosities, and even a terrifying, tentacled sea monster! All of these aspects lead the audience to a thrilling climax, which gets the audience eating their popcorn quickly. Trust me on this, if you watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, your eyes will be glued to the screen! A film that I would recommend to everyone.-Reviewed by James Ord in the United Kingdom",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Makes both Matrix sequels look like crap.,"Not that they weren't to begin with...But wow. Just got back from this... and I loved it. Absolutely loved it.Before you pre-judge my review, I hated the first one. I found it to be a typical Disney blockbuster... and I just couldn't find enjoyment in it (with the exception of Depp). This one, however, brought me into this series.I shan't go on about the plot... as... well, it's hard to explain, and not worth spoiling.Lets just do a quick checklist, shall we?Depp? Check.Knightly? Check.Special effects comparable to Peter Jackson's King Kong's? Check.Super bad ass enemies that make you sick to look at? Check.Disney clichés? Somewhat, but not enough to make you sick.Undead monkey? Check.So there we have it. Perfect summer blockbuster that is of ""modern classic"" proportions.

Next Summer Can't Come Too Quickly,"As a sequel, this is a great movie. As a Disney movie, it is a FANTASTIC movie. Disney has, of late, become sequel crazy. Hunchback of Notre Dame 2?

I'll be there. And so will YOU!They may have to build three versions of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney land, maybe switch them without warning. Who knows? Maybe a ride where you yourself BECOME a pirate, and dunk someone else in a well?

Only slightly above average,"Pirates of The Caribbean 2 has the problem that all legacies face: being compared with itself. The original fare was a massive success and loved by all; with this said, it is unfortunate that I have deemed the sequel only slightly above average.First the pros: the CGI is top notch and the sets and cinemotagraphy are beautiful. The costumes are also top notch and should be given a nod come Oscar time. But now to the Cons: in my opinion, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the character everyone came to fall in love with, fell short in this movie. It seemed as if his purpose was minimized as only to provide comic relief. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) does fairly well as he has certainly matured since the last movie but Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is nearly nonexistent in this movie. Though the parts were acted well, the three stars did not live up to the first.The secondary characters had an excellent opportunity to shine in this one, which I felt was a great addition.Long....this movie clocked in at around 2 1/2 hours - I felt much of it could have been cut out.But through all of this, I will say this: I am guaranteed to see the final POTC. Like the Matrix trilogy - though the second one may not live up to the first, maybe because the first set the bar so high, or because it simply fell short on all angles - I, like others, will want to see the final chapter; to see how it all ends.But in conclusion, I'm not saying don't see the movie, but don't let the hype get to you. I feel as if so much hype was around this movie (I mean I went to a premiere in which +100 were dressed as pirates) it couldn't live up the bar which was raised. So go into this movie w/ the goal not to judge it against the original, but by itself. And by itself, its above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Complete and utter Hollywood tra$h of the worst kind,"I don't know if I'm completely qualified to write this review as I walked out after about an hour, but this has to be one of the most recycled, uninspired sorry excuses for a real movie I've seen in a long time.The actors, including Johnny Depp, seem to just be completing their contract obligations, and the director has absolutely NO, em, direction. Nothing makes sense, everything is overdone and the jokes are all parodically rubbish.This is a classic example of fitting the plot around the characters and effects, rather than the other way around.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great movie, Not a Great sequel","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was filled with action out the wazoo. The CGI was fantastic, the ships and over all feel of the era was clear, the story however, took a wrong turn. In comparison to the first installment to the now Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, the movie feel episodic and epic. It had story and character development and everything flowed smoothly. The Curse of the Black Pearl was amazing when it came out and still is to this day.The main problem that I found with Dead Man's Chest was that the story seemed to drag on, only trying to keep the audience interested with special effects, versus story plot. The characters, minus Jack Sparrow, have all evolved into something completely different from before. They don't act the same, and really don't feel the same. Not to give out any spoilers but Elizabeth's character was the one that upset me the most. You will have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about.Don't get me wrong, it was a fantatsic movie, but I wanted to see a franchise built out of this, not a trilogy, the world has enough of those already. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is worth seeing, just don't expect a great sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Top Notch Sequel,"""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" builds upon the good will of its fun natured predecessor with the typical ""bigger, better, more"" attitude of the standard blockbuster sequel. What's so refreshing, is that it actually delivers on the motto and gives audiences exactly what they want.Unlike the first film, which benefited from originality and lengthy exposition to set up the action and humor, ""Dead Man's Chest"" gets off to a clunky start with the reintroduction of just about every character and theme both major and minor from ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" It makes for a somewhat confusing first hour, as I honestly hadn't watched the original since its theatrical run three years ago and didn't quite remember who everyone was and why they were in their current convoluted predicaments. Once the action gets going, and you settle into the preposterous plot that involves plenty of double-crossing, pillaging, tall tales from the sea, and some sort of hocus-pocus involving the mythical Kracken, the audience is treated to a visually stunning ride full of healthy doses of action, humor, and spookiness.Once again, what makes the film stand out from the rest (aside from Johnny Depp's now iconic Jack Sparrow role) is how director Gore Verbinski handles the material and stages the freak show. He's probably the only commercially trained for-hire director who knows how to sustain a beautiful shot. It's also nice to see him get a little more artistic with his direction, as anyone who has seen ""The Ring"" or even odder his more recent ""Weather Man,"" will pick up on concurrent themes in his breathtaking visuals. More developed in this film is his classical take on dissolves and dolly shots that are nothing short of fantastic. With a bigger budget (upwards of $200 million) he's also one of the few big time blockbuster directors who makes sure every penny is seen on screen. The special effects were shockingly detailed and crystal clear, especially the insanely creative and unique look of the Davey Jones Crew and the aforementioned Kracken. The visual effects team has taken computerized images to new heights beyond even the superb work done with Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The amazing effects dance across the screen hand in hand with sweeping natural vistas, brilliantly staged action sequences and elaborate sight gags (witness the human shish-ka-bob scene) that seem as equally inspired by old time Serials and the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy as they do by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and other silent film classics. Despite sometimes the humor falling flat, this infectious combination of old-style film-making with new fangled state-of-the-art technology translates wonderfully into audience satisfaction and perfectly calculated box-office gold.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.,"I am definitely not a film critic, but to me, Piarates of Caribbean: Dead Man's chest,is the best film I have seen all summer. I enjoyed it so much I paid no attention to a goof or two. I was so caught up in the adventure, that when Jack was back running in the wheel,I just thought the metal bar had fallen out when he did, after it cracked him in the heat. The bloopers only added to the fun. Romance, mayhem, treachery, fantasy, mythology, adventure and much more, but especially the comedy made this film worth seeing it more then once. To me, this movie was ever bit as good as the first, and I will be waiting anxiously for the 3rd to come out. I would be extremely difficult for me to pick a favorites part of Piarats. Hurray to all the cast, even if there was a bit of hamming occasionally.

"Fun Time at the Movies, but Ultimately Underwhelming","The short summary is that Jack Sparrow now owes his soul to Davey Jones and Will Turner and Elizabeth end back up together to prevent this from happening. They are searching the seas and isles for a special key that leads a chest of an unusual nature. All that stands in their way in another grisly crew of another haunted ship, not to mention the mythic creature that is trying to swallow the Black Pearl.Overall, I will say, that this film is entertaining. Johnny Depp shines brightly and just as in the Curse of the Black Pearl, makes this film much more enjoyable. Keira Knightley puts in another solid performance and Orlando Bloom does fine as well. Dead Man's Chest is a bit darker than the first, but maintains much of the spirit that a Disney film offers (see scenes with bone cage and again with the big wheel).Although I was entertained I was underwhelmed by the film. I thought the story was loosely put together and was not driven by a solid plot. It did not seem like the writers did not put much thought into how they were going to bring Jack, Will, and Elizabeth all back together and that lack of thought continued into much of the film. They tried to cram too much into the already long 2 1/2 hours that the film runs. Contributing to this problem is the plethora of characters. Although the plot centers around the main cast they bring back a lot of characters we did not need to see again from the first film and many new characters that did not add anything redeeming.As previously stated, I enjoyed the movie and would not tell anyone to not go see it. I just think that it had too many faults and that not enough time was put into the thought process that led to what we saw in the theater. I am happy people are going to the movies, but not worth achieving the status as top grossing film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Long,boring and chaotic.","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When a sequel is coming for a successful film you can be sure that on one thing. The makers of the film will do their best to milk out the success of the original. This film is no different. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and film distributor Walt Disney, have done that to the maximum. On it's way to the financial success of this film they managed to take any freshness from the first film and left us with one boring, long and chaotic film. Everything that was working to the advantage of the 1st film has become a disadvantage of this sequel. The characters are as shallow as the sea level after the high tide(and when you see they are credits for 4 writers for characters, one can wonder what were they paid for). The jokes are not working. The action sequences are too long and make the film longer than it actually is. Its 150 minutes playing time seems like eternity. You want the film to end but had to endure more and more of this nonsense. The script is full of holes and can be summarised in one sentence(as 2 of the characters do, somewhere in the film). The script and therefore the film has no logic and serve only as a point to promote the Disney's attraction its based upon. The film doesn't even try to explain why some of the things happened it basically says: That is how it is, live with it. You want logic, look somewhere else. The open ending(and not only ending-some plot-lines remain unresolved) suggest that this film is a long exposition for the 3rd installment of this franchise(logic when you know that part 2 en 3 were filmed simultaneously).In 2 sentences: A waist of time and money.

"Dead Man's Chest not as good as first, but just as fun!","I was lucky enough to win two tickets to see the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest preview before the release date. I looked forward to it so much and I have to say, it was past my expectations. Being a sequel to the highly successful first Pirates film, many people thought it would just be a shadow of the first film, but I am happy to say, it was not. The acting of Johnny Depp (Captian Jack Sparrow), Keria Knightly (Elizabeth Swann) and Orlando Bloom (William Turner)was just as good, if not better than the first. Also, many new and old characters did well in making the film very enjoyable. The plot unfortunately was all over the place and difficult to understand, you could see the writers wanted it to be a little bit more depthful than the first. I guess you could say though, 'depthfulness' Dons't really suit the film! The humour was up to its standard, just as hilarious as the first, but they seemed to use many jokes from the first film which sort of ruined it a bit. I will tell you this though: Captain Jack Sparrow's entry into the film is just as funny as in the first one! I think the main thing that pulls you into the film is the uncanny darkness the other film Dons't have. It was a bit overwhelming at first but you got used to it after a while. I'm sure many people would agree with me when I say that there was not enough action at the beginning and too much at the end as well, but I guess it all adds up to the next Pirates film, which I am so looking forward too!

10/10 (No spoilers!),"This movie was very good. It's a lot darker and grittier than the first Pirates movie, but all the main characters seemed better developed, as well. Orlando Bloom is believable as a dashing young swashbuckler and is less the bumbling idiot he was in the first movie. Johnny Depp also shines in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow and is great for comic relief. Keira Knightley is a slightly haughtier but more tough version of her character in the first movie and is impressive with a sword (or two). I really could have done without all those sea creature/men hybrids (the octopus one was especially disturbing), but all in all it made for a very enjoyable film. The ending of the movie actually caught the entire audience by surprise; not so much for what happened but more for the *way* it ended. Can't wait for the sequel next summer!

Non-stop action and great entertainment,"Three years after the surprising success of Disney's swashbuckling adventure inspired by the theme park ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", a new adventure of the gang of buccaneers appeared on the big screen with higher expectations than the ones its predecessor faced. While it lacks the originality and ""surprise factor"" of the first film, it's safe to say that Gore Verbinski's new entry on the series fulfill the expectations nicely and delivers its fair share of entertainment and adventure with a joy rarely seen on screen. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one of the most entertaining and funny adventures of the last years.The story begins with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)'s wedding canceled when the couple is arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his escape. Sentenced to death, Will is offered a chance to save their lives, he must bring Jack Sparrow and his magic compass to the hands of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Company. At the same time, Sparrow faces troubles of his own, as he has a debt to pay to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the supernatural captain of the ghostly ship named ""The Flying Dutchman"". Will and Jack's interests will conflict and a quest will start for the Dead Man's Chest, a mysterious artifact that holds the key to their salvation.Written again by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the film continues delivering the same style of swashbuckling action and light-hearted comedy that made the first one successful. With the advantage of having the characters already established, the film goes straight to the action and turns the ""Pirates"" series into an epic quest that without a doubt will be fulfilled in the third entry of the now trilogy. This is probably a two sided blade, as unlike the first film, this one serves as a build up for the third and could be said that it lacks a proper conclusion following the style of movie serials of old or more recently, the ""Star Wars"" series.Director Gore Verbinski once again becomes the mastermind behind this ambitious sequel, and carefully builds up the epic adventure taking it to the realms of fantasy with the aid of very good special effects creating incredible monsters and supernatural creatures. This mixture of historical setting and fantasy elements is nothing new, as the first one had its share of it, however, here the effects are bigger and of greater importance, although surprisingly, not entirely overwhelming. Verbinski's daring mix of special effects and extensive plot is risky, but fortunately it ends on a positive note.Johnny Depp once again leads the show, and while certainly both Bloom and Knightley have improved, they still look overshadowed by the imposing presence of Depp's talent. The addition of Bill Nighy is an excellent one, and he manages to challenge Depp's domain of the film and successfully steals every scene he is in. Even with his face completely covered with Computer effects, Nighy delivers a performance on the level of the best swashbuckling villains of all time. The rest of the cast remains basically the same as in the previous movie with few improvements, although Stellan Skarsgård surprises as the ghostly incarnation of Will Turner's father.""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very entertaining and well-done film, but it has some severe flaws that by now most critics have pointed out. For once, it's the overlong runtime, that wouldn't be a real problem if it weren't for the fact that some unnecessary scenes are the ones that cause this extensive runtime. Particularly the introductory scenes seem to go forever making the rest of the film look rushed and some character's decision seem out of character. While some have criticized the plot as ""incoherent"", personally I think that it's very good despite its slow and overlong start.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" may not change the world of cinema, nor leave an everlasting impact as the previous entry; but at least it serves as the beginning of a new adventure that explores this romantic idealization of the pirate's life. It's great escapism and healthy entertainment that hopefully will have a terrific conclusion in part three. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,It was not as great as the first one i will give you that but no story line???!!!! what?? If u watched the film like i did u would see that the 3rd one will have the whole story after all Barbossa has come back to help out Will and Elizabeth....

Doesn't Hold Much Water,"Well, to be honest, I'm somewhat disappointed. The premise of the storyline was decent enough, the acting was on par with the first installment, and the chemistry between all of the main characters was great. My beef is with the grossness of it all. For those who have seen this movie, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, all of those sea creatures. I'll even go as far as to say that I thought the idea of the evolution of the men to creatures was interesting... but the reality of it, or the visual effects of it, were disgusting. In fact as times it really took away from the story.All in all I'm not sad that I went, but compared to the The Black Pearl, it doesn't hold much water.http://www.suggestamovie.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good...but far too long!,"As a fan of the first movie I was eager to see this one and as it was released on the day of my birthday I was determined to be off work and see the first showing possible - which I did. I sat anxiously waiting for it to begin and as soon as the trailers were finished and it started I was acting like a seven year old kid who had just been given a brand new bike. It started well and had a good grip on it from the beginning, but thirty minutes or so into it I just wanted it to be over. Yes, Depp was excellent, Knightly was entertaining and Bloom wasn't half bad (I'm not a fan of the Bloomster) and Bill Nighy was brilliant as always and made Davy Jones seem like a real bad guy who you hated so he did his job well. But the problem I had was with the length of it, it just seemed to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and just didn't seem to know when to stop. However, when it did stop it left me dying for more so roll on the next instalment, I just hope that they don't make it an epic at 3 hours+ and leave out some of the rubbish filler that made this one just that little bit disappointing. Go see it and enjoy it just make sure you take some munchies and maybe a cushion for your rear!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A high budget sequel that barely captures the feeling of the original.,"So I went into this movie with hilariously high expectations. One may assume that those expectations could have ruined the movie, but I don't believe in that sort of thing.I remember seeing PotC 1 and I also remember having the time of my life. I bought the movie and have watched in many many times since. The movie perfectly captured the essence of a good pirate film. Unfortunately, the sequel has few of those characteristics.Lets start with things I disliked: 1. The movie is just way too long. I saw it with 3 of my friends and my girlfriend, and I found myself waiting for it to end. I was bored! In a action-adventure movie! Don't get me wrong, I just looked at the lengths of both movies and there is only a seven minute difference. The fact is, the movie did not keep my attention.2. The action sequences were too CG, edited, and complex. Some scenes were OK, but the majority of them were just too much. I miss the (comparetively) simple fight scenes in the first one.3. The plot skips around all over the place. From ship to ship, different islands, it was just hard to keep up with.4. What happened to the classic theme and the epic scenes of the first movie. See: The beginning of PotC 1, Sparrows entrance.OK, now for the good stuff:1. Of course, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job of portraying the delightful Sparrow. Sometimes it felt like his part wasn't as cleverly written.2. Absolutely amazing special effects. I didn't even think that Davy Jones was CG, and found out after the movie that he was indeed.Overall, a terrible disappointment that I won't see again. Of course I will see number three, hoping that PotC 2 was just being an in-between film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lot better the second time around,"The first time I saw this movie, I was really disappointed - it just seemed like a frenetic (and incredibly long!) series of action set-pieces, trying too hard to cash in on popular catchphrases from its predecessor, and entirely lacking in the overall direction, coherence and character development which was present in the first film. Probably expecting too much from it, I was bored and unengaged.Second time around, though, it was actually very enjoyable. Once you know what's going to happen, you can start to see how it all fits together. The plot is still pretty slender, and most of the characters are much more cardboardy and less interesting than the first time round, but if you know that before you go in and don't expect too much, it's good fun. Worth seeing, at least as a precursor to film 3.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A quadriplegic gave me more of a kick than this movie.,"The movie was overstuffed like the fat man eating popcorn next to me and the dialog was as uninterpretable as the plot line, but the great special effects and the unforgettable performance of Johnny Depp made it bearable. If you have seen the first, see this one as well. If you haven't, watch the first and leave it on a good note.The first (Curse of the Black Pearl) and the second (Dead Man's Chest) movies are essentially the same exact movie only there is a talking octopus instead of a skeleton. The first movie was nice and short, but the second was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, (longer than the string of ""o""s I typed to make the minimum amount of lines to post this review).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
corporate scam + enormous commercial for 3rd movie,"This movie blowed goats.I felt violated after going to see this, I was sucked in big time by all the hype and my liking for the first movie. This film however , is just a cash in on the interest generated from its predecessor and didn't need to be made.NOTHING happens in it.Well apart from the last 45 minutes , which is a huge advert for the third film. Plus , Knightely - did she actually have any lines in that film? Brief plot synopsis- Jack Sparrow and his mate Bloom have a sword fight on a big wheel while Knightely pouts.I will definitely not go to see the third one. Id rather pour acid down my pants.Avoid this movie unless you are completely brain dead or want to feel like you have had your wallet stolen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Swashbuckeling Good Time,"The first Pirates was a solid film. Gore Verbinski, who directed this and the original (as well as the next in the series) does the pirates well with stunning visual effects and well put together story-telling. In this installment the audience catches up with Captain Jack Sparrow as he becomes forced to pay back a debt he owes to Davy Jones.With the introduction of the legendary Davy Jones, the audience is thrilled by the cutting edge costume design, make up and visual effects that dazzle the mind. Don't think that visual effects are all that drive the film, the story is both solid and laugh-out-loud funny. As Captain Jack's adventure unfolds the movie proves that it can please on all levels from comedy to drama. Captain Jack as well as Will Turner, reprised by Orlando Bloom, are thoroughly delicious characters that the audience come to care about and delight with each plot twist.Johnny Depp brings Captain jack Sparrow to life with an acting job worthy of his many memorable past roles. Depp has proved again and again that he can bring any character to life and stun audiences with his in-depth performances. With cast accomplices of Orlando Bloom and also the return of the gorgeous Keira Knightley who plays Elizabeth Swann, the cast is strong and even the secondary characters are memorable in this terrific Pirate romp.In a summer of what should have been hefty competition with the likes of ""Superman,"" this pirates movie has hijacked this summer's box office. With an opening weekend over $100 million, the film is on track to be this year's biggest summer blockbuster.""Pirates"" is going to be with us a long time. An ""A"" movie this fun film will leave movie-goers thirsty for the next installment. Yes, there will be another Jack Sparrow adventure. Depp is already filming the sequel to ""Dead Man's Chest,"" currently titled ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" due out for the summer of 2007. We can't wait!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Everything you really should expect,"Now first, let's be honest, all the first movie had going for it was two great actors, Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush being eccentric, and a host of fabulous one liners. That was enough.Now, we all know an accidental happenstance of fabulous like that can not be distilled and recreated in a lab. Knowing that and the rule of sequels, NO ONE should be expecting great cinema here.What we SHOULD be expecting is lots of silly adventure fun, good terrible puns, cute jokes, subtle-enough-that-the-kids-don't-get-it innuendo and Johnny Depp to be Johnny Depp.While Captain Jack's groove is somewhat subdued in this film, the flip side of this is that all the other characters are a bit wittier, and Orlando Bloom has gained a milligram of acting talent since the first one.All in all, it was a fun, family film. FAMILY FILM people, by Disney...with a little bit of John thrown in to edge up their Paul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Jack Sparrow on Meth?,"After the notable success of the first movie ever made from an amusement park ride, the writers and directors were trapped. They had to make a sequel -- and probably another sequel, and another, and another. You get the idea. What to do about a plot? After all, the first movie didn't have a story to draw from, no novel, no play, nothing. So they hired some writers and concocted a tale involving lots of pirates, British soldiers, a beautiful damsel in distress, -- a piece of cake. Voila, huge success beyond their wildest dreams. We were ready to forgive the cookie cutter plot drawn from all the pirate movies since Erroll Flynn plied the trade, because, ...well the girl was soooo beautiful, and Jack Sparrow so quirky in a charming sort of way, and everybody else was so earnest, the monsters so scary, etc. We just bought it, big time! Enter the second installment. What to do now? No problem, just bring back Jack Sparrow, only make him ten, no twelve times more annoyingly quirky (I swear he was on drugs through the whole movie) and throw in lots of pirates, the same beautiful girl, and lots of British soldiers, corrupt politicians, monsters from the dead, etc. Another piece of cake.And, judging from the box office, I guess it really is just that easy. Another huge success for a movie... based on an amusement park ride. Who needs an engaging story, or clever plot devices, or great acting? Hey we have scary monsters and lots of computer animation! I have to admit I did enjoy the ride. I just wanted more. I wanted Daniel Defoe. I got Billy Silly Bones instead.It isn't a terrible movie. It is, in fact, the 2nd best movie based on an amusement park ride ever made. It just confirms what everybody already knows: It takes more than lots of sword fights, swashbuckling, sea monsters, cannibals, and pretty heroines in peril to make a really good pirate movie; but if you have enough computer graphics, it won't really matter -- you'll still make a ton of money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

2nd In Series Confirms Pirates As The Most Compelling And Original Movie Scheme Filmed During The 21 Century!,"Tired of dried up sequels and monotonous remakes? Not to worry. Cast and crew of this second in a BRAND NEW, never before read or seen trilogy, have catered to fan's hopes and beyond.The movies' incredible eye-popping details shock, confound, amuse and at times send audience members cringing in unison with Captain Jack himself. This movie follows our favorite characters from the first Pirates film as they continue on with their endeavors and their destinies are woven out before them. With Sparrow restored to his command as captain of the Black Pearl, viewers witness what a pirate's brutal life plundering at sea is all about. You might even find yourself feeling as if you are aboard the long loved Pirates of the Caribbean ride a couple times.Unlike previous trilogies such as Lord of the Rings, the makers of the Pirates films have no book to lean on whilst scripting and designing sets and scenes. Even so, an impossible amount of innovative detail was poured into this film as tastefully as hot maple syrup over a stack of pancakes. The originality and creative particulars are undeniably refreshing when so many movies continue to flow onto the big screen void of any resourcefulness and harboring painfully obvious plots.The makers of Dead Man's Chest have delivered a spectacular and captivating film that will keep the wheels in your head spinning without being strictly serious. This movie's got humor, action, horror, adventure, fantasy, heck, even a spot of romance. It's a must see, and if anything will leave you entertained and poses the threat of drawing you back for more next year.WARNING!!! THOSE WHO DO NOT ENJOY CLEVER CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND WOULD RATHER SKIP TO THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE BOOK MAY NOT LIKE THIS FILM.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I have to admit...I really enjoyed Dead Man's Chest,"I'm going to present a somewhat 'unpopular' opinion when I say that Dead Man's Chest is probably my favourite of all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The film is frequently overlooked, seeing as it is sandwiched between the surprisingly brilliant Curse of the Black Pearl and the confusingly bloated At Worlds End. Does it have faults? Of course it does, but it doesn't take away too much from the extremely enjoyable adventure that it is.This time round Captain Jack Sparrow is informed that he still has a blood debt with the legendary Davy Jones. Jack realises that he must find Jones' heart in order to rid himself of Jones and potential damnation for all eternity on the Flying Dutchman. Both Will and Elizabeth are roped into things when they are arrested and told that they will only be released if they find Jack's compass for the seedy Cutler Beckett. Believe me when I say this, there truly is a lot going on within the films plot. It's good that it doesn't get too complicated to follow, but it is constantly building upon itself. It could get away with a flimsy plot due to the concentration on adventure, so I'm glad it is trying to create an interesting storyline.What I really enjoy in the film is that it is just shamelessly entertaining, you don't get the feeling that the film is trying to do anything but keep you entertained and tell a gripping adventure tale. Sometimes films like that can feel pointless or forced, but the film has its heart in the right place and it never tries to be something it is not. It does remind me of swashbuckling films of old that simply relied on offering you some fun.After his Oscar nomination from the first film Johnny Depp returns and is just wonderful as everyone favourite pirate Jack Sparrow. There is just something so likable and entertaining about the character that Depp manages to play out to perfection. His slightly surly confidence and clumsy attitude is what does the trick, Depp just has the mannerisms that fit the part and even the slightest actions is made hilarious by him. When he is on screen things light up and I cannot help but laughThe supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy adds his usual quirky ticks and style to Davy Jones under heavy CGI, making an intimidating and complex villain. I really like Kevin McNally as Sparrow's superstitious right hand man Gibbs, it's a very likable and laid-back performance again. Jack Davenport is back the now run down drunkard Norrington adding more layers to the character. Stellan Skarsgard is solid as always as Will's haunted father and Tom Hollander is enjoyable are the slimy Beckett. The whole crew of the Pearl are always very amusing and have some very funny traits, like Cotton's parrot.The only actors I really have issues with are the other two leads. Orlando Bloom hearkens back to the good looking leads of old adventure flicks, but the guy is just plain dull. He just a bland actor and his stifled delivery always comes off as awkward. Keira Knightly is not much better, she just comes off as annoying and is also just a bland actress. I don't think the characters are bad, just the actors weren't right for the roles.The visuals of the film are extremely impressive. The locations alone look fantastic, whether they be at stormy sea or a white sand beach. The sheer amount of money the film cost to has clearly been used very well in order to make the film a visual feast. The CGI is amazing. The crew of the Flying Dutchman for example are all CGI added on to actors and the details look so lifelike is it hard to believe it isn't. The CGI on Davy Jones looks incredible and the sheer detail that has been put into his creation must be applauded. The seas look vast and dangerous, adding levels of suspense as the crew travel from place to place. The Kraken is another CGI piece that is used well and looks amazing. The action set- pieces are excellent as usual. The triple sword fight inside a rolling water mill is absolutely superb, both from a visual standpoint and as an entertaining action scene. The climatic ship battle is also outstanding.The films tone manages to be balanced nicely. Is the humour still here? You better believe it. Jack's first appearance and escape from a native tribe are truly hilarious. It's the small amusing things that complete the comedic sensibility. Depp's spaced out expressions, the quirks of the Pearl crew and even Tom Hollander's droll delivery are all small things that add to the humour. There are some darker elements, but the film only concentrates on them slightly which is understandable. Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent score which creates a sound that evokes the perfect balance of excitement and tension.Dead Man's Chest is the example of a middle film done right in my eyes. It doesn't try anything too different to the first film, but it does move away enough to feel like its own entity as well as a continuation of the story. The film was by no means perfect, the plot does have a bit too much going on at times and the large amounts of CGI can get excessive. Yet the pure entertainment style is very welcoming, the action is spectacular, Johnny Depp is hilarious once again and all kinds of humour are present here. I think Dead Man's Chest is as good as the first and an exceedingly enjoyable adventure romp.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Action and adventure in the Caribbean,"We attended Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest at an establishment that managed to sell out 4 theaters at the same time, all showing this movie! It was great fun - everyone from the small children, teenagers, university students, adults and on up were good natured and enjoyed the film. This film shows us a new darker side of Captain Norrington, introduces some interesting new characters, and brings back a few old favorites. There's also lots of action, plot twists, great ""one liners,"" and a wonderfully choreographed sword fight. Downfalls to this movie? Johnny Depp seemed out of character (just not the same Jack Sparrow) and my favorite two British seamen were not in the movie. However, it seems there may be a reason for Depp's different portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow - so I'm looking forward to next year's Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to see just what is in store for the audience and Jack Sparrow!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Magnificent Romp,"It was always going to be tough to beat the 1st movie, to even equal the magnificence that is POTC 1 would be a challenge, but I think that this film eclipsed it!! Funny, Interesting, captivating and spectacular are all words that could be applied to the latest instalment of POTC. There are so many trilogy's that have failed their audiences at the second helping but I have to say that this movie was not one of them. There is more action, better special effects and a well written storyline that beautifully follows on from the first one. The humour is still present and correct, and further development of the characters only serves to make you love them even more. This movie feels more in depth. The first only served to skim over the surface of what these movies are about, setting up a taster of what is ahead. New characters enrich the movie and all of the actors (with the exception of Depp who is always captivating to watch) seem to have got better at what they do. POTC - Dead Man's Chest is a fantastic movie with an unexpected ending that leaves you begging for more - I personally cant wait until next summer and if I could I would book my seat now!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rocks My World!,"Mr. Depp, once again, has given me a reason to set foot in a theater. The story is brilliant (if you look at it as one of three, not a stand alone) and the acting is truly inspired. The CG effects are awe inspiring and the the scenery is breath taking. I recommend this movie for any pirate lover. It may be a little to scary for the kiddies at home, but definitely acceptable for the older youngin's. There are some scenes of violence that are not grotesque, but questionable. There is no sex, some kissing, but very clean. Some jokes are little ""grown-up"" for some kids, but the adults will definitely like them. I give this movie as thumbs up as I can.... which is only two, but if I had more I would give more! I love Johnny Depp even more now for this movie.

3 years later and this is the best they could come up with...,"Thank God I didn't see this garbagepiece at the theater and waste $25.00 on tickets and snacks. HA! A lot of fools wasted their money on this. 435 million box office receipts! What the hell is wrong with this country. Only a brainless fool would like this mess. I can't understand moviegoers would go see this. From the previews I knew this was going to be bad. I hated the first film, so there was no way in hell was going to see this pile of dung. So after all the chaos died out, I just rented it this weekend while many more fools were flocking to see the third film of this overrated trilogy. Everything I expected, plus more garbage. This makes the first film look pretty decent. If I saw this at the theater I would've been swearing to myself for weeks on why I wasted my money, gas, and time on such crap. Well, after renting it I don't feel the same way. Four dollars down the drain nothing more, nothing less.The movie itself now is a complete washout. It's awful, pathetic, and just bad, very, very bad. Same plot. Looking for some stupid treasure, fighting the baddies, and once again the baddies are from the depths of the sea. Decomposed bodies that aren't the least bit scary. The whole movie consists of endless, painful comedy and very far out action sequences that aren't the least bit entertaining. I found myself laughing at two jokes and both came from the parrot. The movie's running time of 2hrs and 21 minutes, not counting the 9 minutes of end credits is a complete waste of money and time. About two hours of the movie feature scenes of running and chasing from the natives and ships being brought down by the kraken and none of it tells any part of the story. The movie also features way too much gross moments of make-up and special effects. Especially the scene that features Noami Harris. YUCK! That face with that make-up is ultimately gross. Now Harris also was in the crappy Miami Vice movie, and that film sucked badly. But compared to this it's a pretty damn good film. The whole movie consisted of endless parody from other films. Especially from The Mummy Returns, the Indiana Jones films, Captain Blood and other pirate movies. However, the movie that it was highly influenced by was 20,000 Leauges Under the Sea.20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, now that's a terrific film and a classic. Great special effects, breathtaking underwater photography, and a wonderful cast featured in a action packed pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest was a remake of that film. In fact Davey Jones reminded me of a mutinied Captain Nemo with his ship and men and his organ. But Nemo had a motive and was a genius. Jones is a buffoon and an idiot, along with Jack Sparrow and the rest of the cast is this awful, soon to be forgotten piece of garbage. One of the worst films I've ever seen. You want a great pirate movie. I recommend these classics: Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. Nobody beats Errol Flynn the king of all swashbucklers. Also take a look at: The Black Swan and of course 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The classic one with James Mason and Kirk Douglas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow this one was WAAAAAY over Hyped,"I went to see this movie Saturday of its opening weekend expecting a great movie. Having seen Superman Returns the night before, this movie was a total bore. The movie went nowhere. I don't think there was one part where I really laughed or really enjoyed part of it. It was very canned viewing, very stereotypical pirate/island fantasy story. The whole sequence with the natives was absurd, and hugely playing upon other movies with island natives, no original thought( I know this was a movie but I couldn't help notice the large rock formations and high cliffs that are definitely reminiscent of Thailand or Indonesia, definitely NOT the Carribbean.) There was no real flow to the movie. The plot was sorta there, get the compass, get the key...not gonna spoil it, but it seemed like it was too simply executed. The creatures on The Flying Dutchman were totally stupid, Urchinboy, blowfish man...etc. The only character or actor for that matter with any merit was Bootstrap Bill Turner played by Stellan Skarsgard. While I'm on the topic of actors sorry to all those 13yr old Orlando Bloom fans, but HE SUCKS! He can't carry a lead role in a film, that's why ""Kingdom of Heaven"" did so poorly( what could have been a great film with Ridley Scott and Liam Neeson).Johnny Depp's character was not nearly as good from the first movie, he must have said ""Bugger!"" 30 times. All in all it was too thin of a movie with Michael Bay's best in fake action and CGI. Keira Knightley someone with a good deal of talent had too few scenes, including probably the best of the movie, the bar fight. This movie is nowhere close to the original. It seems its only use is as a minor conveyance to the next PIRATES Movie.All in all I was totally unimpressed, especially since 2 of the 6 of us who went FELL ASLEEP!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Typical Part 2 Filling,"Let's be honest: the decors looks great, the music is delicious, Johnny Depp is funny and Keira Knightly is hot. Very cute, but a sequel needs more, especially when it comes to the second part of a trilogy.What bothered me was that I had the constant feeling the producers only were trying to make sure the public would want to see POTC 3. All that, while the actual story didn't really move on. It's a common scenario in trilogies when it comes to Part II. Look at The Matrix and even Lord Of The Rings. The complete story has been written, part one was stunning and part three contains all the clues. But part two is used to create questions which are answered in part 3.Therefor, a trick is to suggest there's happening a lot of things, while actually the movie only contains fillers. A lot of action, jokes, special effects, massive destruction, but when you sum things up, very little is told. The action is good, have to admit that, and a couple of jokes are indeed sharp though it sometimes hits the edge of slapstick. But yet, That's a shame, for it makes the movie a little bit empty in my opinion, and not worthy watching it a second time.Spider-man 2, good example. That did actually work, because it was a totally different story. The sub-plot was interesting enough to create a hunger for the final part, but it wasn't the main storyline.My conclusion: you need to see Dead Men's Chest, if you're a Pirates lover, but one time is enough (well, women might see it hundreds of times for Johnny and Orlando...typical). But prepare for a lot of questions at then end, and a whole year of waiting in doubt.Oh, and I gave it seven because of Johnny Depp, the music and the wonderful sets. And Keira. A little bit.Remember, it's just an opinion. From a Dutch person. So what's that worth, right?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An entertaining ride!,"One word, ENTERTAINING! :-) ... I think I may just have to go back next weekend.If you liked the first movie, I don't know how you wouldn't like this one. If you are looking for a deep plot with profound undertones, sorry. If you are looking for another pirate adventure with everyone's favorite Capt'n Jack Saprrow, you have come the right place! Like the first movie (and the Indiana Jone's movies), this adventure departs from reality that take us on an entertaining journey through uncharted waters. The plot may be a little twisted or confusing (not really), but I think of movies like this as a ride. You get on and see where it takes you (hmm, kind of like the one at Disneyland :-D ).Also, one should keep in mind that this is the second movie in a trilogy Don't be surprised (or upset) if this movie leaves you feeling like there is more to come (cough, ""The Empire Strikes Back"") because there is more to come, the last movie :-) And I can't wait!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Ride- With A Great Cliffhanger,"Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Mans Chest Takes is a twit of different plots from start to finish. Although I was afraid this movie would struggle because the story almost concluded in The Pearl, I was surprised to find that it was done quite well, having a great new plot with two completely new villains Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones and his crew of waterlogged miscreants. The story involves Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and Will (Orlando Bloom) setting out on a quest to find Jack (Johnny Depp) to save their marriage and their freedom. Dead Mans Chest, although taking a while to warm up, has a much deeper and darker plot, exploring and deepening each character, twisting comedy, romance, horror and adventure all into the one movie. The last 10 minutes is very intense, and the end is a cliffhanger that makes you want Pirates of the Caribbean 3. Apart from this, the movie still has its funny bits and the same great humor form Cpt. Jack. It's a Great Ride, doing Black Pearl the justice that it deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It rocked!,"It was fabulous! Even though it was 2 1/2 hours long, you were glued to your seat till the very last second. And what an ending! It was spectacular and would leave your jaw open, thinking for a long moment ""How the hell did that happen?"" Depp was awesome as usual, but what made the movie different from the first was that it concentrated on the other characters as well, namely Will, Mr. Gibbs, Davy Jones, Ragetti and Pintel. There was humor and non-stop action, and so many twists that makes you want to see the movie again. The CGI was top class, and the action sequences well thought of and executed. The ideal block-buster movie for the summer. I am not surprised at all that it broke the box-office record for the opening weekend, and I think that it was as good as the first movie. And I know that the third movie will be as good too. I can't wait for it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great second film, funny and entertaining","Loved the first and this was even better, made better because you are on the look out for the one liners and facial expressions. Jonny Depp, is great at Captain Jack Sparrow, though the mincing walk got on my nerves somewhat. Orlando Bloom seemed to bloom into the role, definitely worth watching.In a way the ending spoilt the excitement of the next movie, you know who is going to be in it... no point in the next film otherwise! Laughed a lot, plot was thin but you don't watch it for plot lines, you watch it for the action and the interaction between the characters. The waterwheel and beach scene is total slapstick, laughed so loud that I scared the dogs.Keep an eye out for a certain rock n roller, don't blink you might miss him!! All in all a great romp and totally worth watching",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Too long, and too complicated, but apart from that...........","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was really disappointed because it made the film look rubbish. But went to see the movie, it was much better than I thought it would be.However, the film was way too long and it became hard to concentrate on what was going on. Also, the plot had so many parts to it, and was so completely muddled, that you spend most of the film trying to work out what the hell is going on.But it's not all bad, as with the first movie, it was'nt the plot that was important, but the visuals and Johhny Depp. (ehehe) Firstly, the CGI effects are amazing, especially on the squid-like Davy Jones, who's tentacles move around in different directions; his fishy like crew are also very cleverly done.There is also much more humour in the DMC, compared to the first film. Many hilarious laugh out moments provided by Jack Sparrow, which were probably the highlights of the film.The fight scenes are very spectacular too, combining humour and amazing stunts, one scene included a sword fight on a rolling waterwheel.Johnny Depp on top form (as usual) as Jack Sparrow, as is Kevin McNally as Gibbs. However, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom did not act very well, and they did'nt do much in the film except stand around look nice.Overall the movie, was too long and too complicated, with some poor acting. However, stunning visuals, comedy and piratey fun make this movie, good, light entertainment. Just make sure you've seen The curse of the Black Pearl first, or you won't get many parts of the film.see this if you love the first movie and Johnny Depp, but prepare to be slightly confused.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It rocks,"This movie is amazing. But if u read the plot of the next movie it doesn't really follow up. This movie is a thrill ride. There are ships sinking and people dying a horrible death. There is love and anger and deception. Jack appears to die at the hands of Davy Jone's Kraken and the Lord of the islands now possesses Davy's heart. There is a creepy voodoo like lady living in a swamp. The original Captain of The Pearl is back ready to lead Will and Elizabeth to the corners of the earth and beyond. I give it a 9.5 out of 10. P.S. The man who was originally engaged to Elizabeth is back as a scurvy mate on Jack's crew (Jack secretly wants to sacrifice one hundred souls to Davy Jones (to save his own soul). The former man of honor wants to deliver the heart to the new Lord and he does. Will meets his father on Davy Jone's ship "" The Flying Dutchman "" and vows to save his soul from the Dutchman by stabbing the heart of Davy Jones. Jack wants the heart to control Davy Jones. If you are wondering, Jones put his heart in the chest because of his one true love that isn't revealed in this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent sequel,"I'm a huge fan of the first ""pirates"", because it was just a helluva lot of fun. Luckily the sequel retains the sense of fun of the prequel. However, it lacks the surprise the unexpectedly brilliant first did. That's not to say that this is a poor film. Not at all. Indeed, the central action sequences (the island escape near the beginning and the climatic big wheel sequence especially) are terrific, with an excellent sense of humor that had me laughing out loud, to use that annoying internet phrase. The CGI is excellent, especially Davy Jones himself. And of course, Johnny Depp. What can I say, this man deserves an Oscar for his wonderfully campy Captain Jack - he was so cruelly denied one first time around.Yet this film is not perfect. The film begins very slowly indeed, taking a good half hour to really kick off, with some confusing plot strands required to set up sequences of events (indeed, the whole cast is not reunited until well past halfway into the film). Yet the major problem lies in the poor casting of Orlando Bloom, whose quite frankly irritating hero struggles to hold the screen when Capn Jack is absent.Overall however, this is a fine film. The surprisingly lengthy running time flies by, and Pirates is many times more enjoyable than 90% of other blockbusters due to it's sense of humor, style and fun. I must admit I'm looking forward to chapter three of this continuing quality franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why does the entire movie industry suck?,"I rated this movie as a 1 out of 10 only because 1 was the lowest optional number, otherwise this movie, if one can call it that, deserves a zero. I'm inclined to question this ""film's"" authenticity as a real movie because movies are actually supposed to have plots. A plot includes a beginning, a middle and an end. An end does not just mean, OK let's throw some confusing crap at the audience then show the credits, it means a conclusion. This movie had no such conclusion. I understand that this is because there is going to be a third movie. but, if they had done a better editing job and not made the movie a painful 2.5 hours long, they could have put both the 2nd and 3rd ""movies"" together and given it a satisfying ending. this movie was just a teaser for the 3rd. it was a scam to get money, and that's it. Watching a trilogy is supposed to be enjoyable. like Lord of the rings or star wars, or even batman, though those movies sucked mostly. POTC wasn't enjoyable. it was boring. the acting sucked. the movie makers overcompensated with special effects in place of reliable and relevant themes. what happened to good plots, and good stories that unearth the depths of human emotion? movie makers have out done themselves, and now they just rely of special effects to make money. creating those special effects must be difficult, but not as difficult as it is to write a truly meaningful story. this movie made me so angry. it wasted 2.5 hours of my life that i will never get back. and now I HAVE to see the third one, otherwise i'll never get this bitterness out of my soul. why did they do this??? Walt Disnet rolled over in his grave when this shitty movie premiered. mickey mouse was created to entertain and to bring joy to people, not to scam them out of their money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A big disappointment!,"Well, this film should have been the great continuance to the first Pirates, so I expected quite a lot from it. Nonetheless, I was a bit dashed. Why? The story is not sound, rather mishmash. The music is nearly the same as in the first film, using mainly two themes. There are some jokes that aren't funny, and bunch of scenes were very unrealistic. Despite that, the second half of the film enlivens you, it's full of action. After all, you'll say well, it was a good film, only if I haven't got such expectations.As far as the actors are concerned, they made an ordinary appearance. Nothing special, but professional, as it is expected.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The sequel is a new adventure,"I liked this movie. It is a sequel that begins a new quest, this time to find dead man's chest. It ends set up for the third film that is its conclusion. The first film stands alone, but sets up many of the characters in this new adventure.The special effects are just as good and there is a new villain, Davy Jones, whose tentacles have a mind of their own. The new dead pirates on Jones' ship were cool, there was the one with the hammer head and shell head, just really cool. We don't get to see much of the Kraken until the end, but when we see it's mouth, wow! Also, Johnny Depp is once again great and the humor is back. I thought it was almost as funny as the first. And I thought the plot made sense. I don't agree with all these reviews saying it was too long, plot hard to follow. I thought it was very entertaining.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first, this is a must see. I will go see the third film in the theater.

The Best Summer Movie of '06,"What other summer movies have tried and failed, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest succeeds. Maybe the plot is a bit convoluted and the characters not all that well developed, but for pure action and adventure, I promise you won't find a better swashbuckling adventure.Johnny Depp, in his first ever sequel, plays Jack Sparrow as well as he did in the first movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are much improved from the last movie even though they at times may come off a little grating. The CGI on Davy Jones is quite good and the supporting cast in this movie does a great job supporting the main characters, despite how absurd the situations get.Much like other second movies, this film tends to get darker and a lot less humor is incorpotated. What this film does have is some great action sequences, some good special effects, and a twist ending that will make you circle the date of when the third movie comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A must see!,"A fantastic fantasy! Jack Sparrow fans will not be disappointed. Terrific special effects and having the original cast keeps the fantasy going. The whole family, except very small children, will love it!

There are some funny moments in Dead Man's Chest that will be missed if you didn't see or have forgotten the first movie. Be prepared for a fairly long movie. The action keeps it going for adults but some children may get tired or frightened of some of the sea creatures. All of the actors do a wonderful job and as usual, Johnny Depp makes us believe he really is Captain Jack Sparrow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Don't let me sway you, you should still go and see this movie.","Yet again the Walt Disney film corporation has disappointed us with a sequel. I believe that the main problem with this movie is that it felt as though it was going on forever. Further, the director made the decision to forego significant and interesting plot points for, at best, mediocre special effects. In the first movie the special effects jumped out at you because the characters were ""normal"" for most of the movie as appose to this movie, which is more like Star Wars in that the monsters are always monsters. Also the characters were portrayed abysmally. For example in the first movie Elizabeth Swan is totally revolted by Capt. Jack Sparrow and is the perfect lady throughout most of the adventure; however, in the new movie she becomes a pirate like character in very little time and goes so far as to kiss Capt. Jack Sparrow. Which was a cliché and rather predictable plot twist. Nonetheless, if you saw the first movie and enjoyed it I think that you should go see this one if for no other reason than to form your own opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
As bad as the first film was good.,"Sums it up really. The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.This was appalling drivel & I'm staggered so many have rated it as high as the first. What were you watching? Sparrow's character was one of the greatest in movie history. It was nothing here, he lacked any of the charisma or lines of the original and to paraphrase another critic here the ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" characterisation was flogged to death. Knightley seemed far too cocky in her role and Bloom was given a lot of screen time for a plot which never bordered on interesting. Although the latter could've been avoided had they merely removed the entire 45 minute tribesman / island scene near the beginning which served absolutely no point to the rest of the film whatsoever.Whereas in the original the plot was simple & yet brilliantly effective this was a complete mess & merely a selection of incoherent & unnecessary scenes lumped together and seemingly decided on 1) how much they cost to film & 2) how loud they were as opposed to whether they added anything to the film at all.The target audience seemed completely different to the first. The original seemed to be written towards intelligent adults but with consideration to younger viewers. I mean no offence here, but I got the feeling 90% of this was aimed at the average three year old, bar the concept of Davy Jones which would be asking a bit for a 12 or 13 year old to take on board first time. If you'd gone more than a couple of minutes without a good line or scene (which it frequently did) throw in a few ""man gets hit on head with rock"" or ""man trips over"" gags & all will be forgotten. Granted in my cinema they got a few laughs, but they sounded like children's laughs in comparison to the original.I'd accumulated about 250 questions & points I was unsure of within the first half hour and while some were answered later on (too late usually - as you'd got past caring) the key points were usually glossed over so quickly, presumably so the plot holes & plot jumps were not questioned. Much of this was brought about by too many characters in the film as a whole, particularly early on.A good sequel IMO, is one where you imagine the original had never existed and this was it instead. Regardless of whether the plot is better or worse does it still offer the originality & core values of the first film. This never came close. The plot was dull & sacrificed for noise & effects & the characters had nothing likable about them. The major ones never evolved at all, the minor ones just recycled the same gags & lines from the first film, which were great then but not again.I still await the 3rd film with anticipation. There's every chance it could be another classic like the original, especially if they take on board the faults of this one. Lets hope Pirates of the Caribbean follows in the mould of Die Hard with two classic films at ever end, with a pointless one sandwiched between them.Sorry but 1/10 - no redeeming qualities at all.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So many plot lines...,"If you haven't already seen the review done by ""Ask a ninja"" then go google it now - cos he's right.This has two things in absolute abundance: plot lines and pirates.Of course this isn't a bad thing, it's a pirate movie - and this one is happily setting up the sequel.The story nearly manages to top the undead pirates of the first. Don't hold your breath for realism (but then if you saw the first one... you'd know better).All your favorite characters are back, doing more of what they're good at. It's more fun than the first one - but like so many sequels, it excels because it doesn't have to do all the character exposition of the first, it can spend more time on frivolity because you already know the characters and their relationships.Probably one of the best movies of 2006 - enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Classic movie, yet average","I've only given this movie a 6 out of 10. Do not get me wrong, but I am totally in love with the way Johnny Depp portrays every character he plays, and he did fantastic with Jack. However, the movie was wrought with overzealous action scenes, such as the Kraken attacking the boat 3 times. A bit too much I think. It is not likely to earn any specific awards or outstanding achievements, but it is still a good movie to just chill out and watch. Also, I have never particularly liked the way Orlando Bloom acts, it's always stiff, with little facial emotion/expression, and it is hard for me to be enraptured by him, unlike Johnny. Though, Orlando did do significantly better this time around. Keira Knightley was quite good, yet I was disappointed in the little screen time she had. And I was completely and utterly surprised by what she did towards the end. Of course, I won't spoil it for the readers, but to me, not a very commendable attribute. I also thoroughly enjoyed watching Lord Beckett, played by Tom Hollander, because every time he spoke, I was reminded of his character Mr. Collins in the movie Pride and Prejudice. It's quite amusing to see such a small man play such strong characters. There were many times I laughed, but sometimes, the endless amount of hilarity was still a bit too much. But, even with it's torrent of clichéd jokes, it will become a classic, and I would recommend it to anyone. I heartily enjoyed many parts of this movie, and good healthy criticism never hurt anybody.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You pretty much get what you expect, but the visual effects are great and there is a lot of suspense and good action. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. The characters are still likable and at their best. All the returning characters are exciting to have back again. Make sure you stay for the end of the credits.

Shiver Me Timbers! Captain Jack Returns in a Lumbering Adventure That Improves in the Second Half,"Johnny Depp's preening cheekiness as Captain Jack Sparrow continues to be the invaluable glue that holds together this action-packed, over-the-top movie, the second in a trilogy inspired by the well-loved, nearly forty year-old ride in Disneyland. The jam-packed story picks up relatively soon after the point where the last one left off with spunky Elizabeth Swann about to marry adventurer Will Turner. Complications come in the form of British East India Trading Company's Lord Cutler Beckett, who charges the couple with conspiring to help Sparrow escape from the company's clutches. Death is their fate unless they can secure Sparrow's magical compass for Beckett. Sparrow has troubles of his own as he has sold his soul to the legendary dawn-of-the-dead pirate, Davy Jones, fabled captain of the Flying Dutchman, in exchange for the right to command his vessel, the Black Pearl. Sparrow's one option is to find the key to a chest containing Jones' still-beating heart.The story lines eventually collide but not before the main characters run into a voodoo woman, Tia Dalma, full of mystical advice on how to get the key; Elizabeth's jilted swain, Commodore James Norrington, out for revenge against Will; Will's lost-soul father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, somewhere between life and death; and a mammoth, octopus-like sea monster named Kraker. After a shaky start with far too much exposition, director Gore Verbinski gets the momentum finally going in the second hour with heart-racing action escalating in both scope and absurdity, although screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tend to layer all the developments in a most convoluted manner. Despite the pacing problems, what I do like about the film is its persistently irreverent tone and the way death is treated not as the final end but as a relative inconvenience. From my perspective, this is what makes the movie's spirit come alive for a contemporary viewer.Beyond Depp's devilishly clever performance, the real star is unsurprisingly the CGI-generated special effects, whether it's Jones and his ocean-morphed crew of half men/half sea creatures (the hammerhead shark is a particularly creepy figure to watch); Kraker and its engulfing destruction (though this gets repetitive in the story); or the variety of memorable action set pieces, such as the Black Pearl crew swinging in a ravine to escape their suspended spherical cages, or concurrently, Sparrow precariously maneuvering a pole where he inadvertently becomes part of a fruit shish kebob. My favorite set piece is the runaway waterwheel on the island where Will, Norrington and Sparrow are preoccupied with their swashbuckling and the search for the chest. The audacious silliness of these action sequences is what keeps the movie afloat.Both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return from the first film as Elizabeth and Will. Looking beautiful, even disguised as a boy, Knightley has been promoted into more of an action role here and handles her part with aplomb. Bloom is still a relatively colorless presence but fulfills the heroic dimensions of the part almost by default. As Davy Jones, Bill Nighy is able to create an intriguing character underneath the CGI-generated visage of octopus tentacles, and in a tribute to Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", has a great scene where he plays the numerous keys of a pipe organ all at once. Granted, at 150 minutes, the epic movie does run too long for the story it tells, and the lumbering series of climaxes seems excessive. Regardless, it's still grand fun thanks to Depp and the oozing, barnacle-encrusted realism of the CGI effects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A masterpiece in its own right.,"First, I totally believe that some movies need to be seen more than once; it takes time to notice every plot detail, like PotC. Every time I see this one, I like it even more; I love how everyone has interests, fears, and obsessions; I love the folklore, the references from nautical myths; I love the characters, and I love the special and visual effects.I'm not an academic, but the acting, seems to me, spot-on; even Orlando Bloom, which -it's true- acts like a robot, fits well in his character.Mild spoiler ahead...But, something has to be said: Davy Jones must be the best CGI character ever developed. For me, the movie is totally worth it just for watching the first scene where he asks: ""...do you fear death?"", just after blowing the flame for his pipe. Just for that, this movie deserved to win an Oscar, which it did.Anyway, just watch and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Pirates"" Partially Pleasing","My wife and I saw ""Pirates"" after a lengthy stretch of great anticipation. She wanted to see it because she likes the story; I was more focused on make-up, special effects and computer generation. Neither of us was disappointed.Positives: excellent costuming, great make up and special effects, and some very good computer generation. Captain Jack's First Mate pretty much stole the show, as far as I am concerned. Very strong, solid performance. Choreographed fight scenes VERY well done - lots of fun to watch.Bitter/Sweet: lots of silliness in this film. If it was intended to be silly and dumb, success. If the filmmaker was serious with his silliness, he blew it. Silly IS fun, though.Negatives: TOO LONG! Could easily have been whacked by 1/2 hour - EASILY! Editing was amateurish; choppy. Johnny Depp seems stalled out in his creativity and execution: ""Pirates"" I & II and ""Chocolat"" seem to be rubber stamp characters, though there was more heart and depth in ""Chocolat."" Overall, I consider Mr. Depp a marginal actor.Additional Negative: Keira Knightly. Difficult to look at, from a physical perspective (facially unfortunate), but more difficult to watch as a performer. Miscast in this role, to my way of thinking. It was a chance she took in her career, one she should probably not repeat.Overall: see the film. No one under 12 should see it, for several scenes are inappropriate for younger children (quite gory and graphic). 12 and over? Yes - see it as a family and enjoy!

"Waste of time -go see ""Lady in the Water"" instead","After seeing this film and being totally disappointed and bored, I went home and watched the original ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". It was magnificent, witty, rich in the values which make a film a classic.However ""Dead Man's Chest"" is just plain awful. Where were the original writers? All on vacation somewhere else? These guys had no real plot and chose to fill the time with really valueless retreads from their own lives and much better films. I believe that: 1. More than one in the group had a gerbil who rolled around in a wheel.2. Someone had watched the marvelous Douglas Fairbanks' classic ""Black Pirate"" film and lifted the ship boarding and sword fighting sequences (here done with less daring do and swashbuckling).3.

what happened,"i was excited to see this sequel since the first teaser trailers were released. when it came out and i heard some negative comments about it i assumed that these people were not into the fist one. admittedly i was skeptical of the first one too (being a childhood fan of the ride at Disneyland, i didn't know what to make of a feature length brockheimmer sp? movie based on it). but was indeed charmed by Depps performance and the over all production of the movie. So i had high hopes for this sequel. Although sequels are often spell disaster, it seemed this one would be like spiderman II or x-men II.When i watched Pirates II I was frustrated by two aspects. One, the decidedly dark overtones that throw our main characters into a love triangle. Two, the fact this movie relays so heavily on a third installment. The first movie i think succeeded because because it ran with a rather fantastic premise and was self referential enough that you actual become comfortable with the movie and just enjoy the adventure; which wraps itself up by the end.i did enjoy this movie, but felt that it hurt itself by losing the lighter elements and concise plot line of the first movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A comfortably entertaining performance,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Directed by: Gore Verbinski Date of Release: 2006 Starring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira KnightleyWell, it's been three years, and finally the next POTC instalment has hit UK cinemas. You may remember my review of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" whereby I had mixed feelings at the start, then grew to love it and give it the ultimate blessing by adding it to my elite DVD collection (read ""economic"" - erm...small).I started getting the same mixed feelings as this one started, this could have been something to do with the countless, riotous teenage girls running around the cinema in their little hooker outfits, clutching their Nokia's and texting their mates sitting two rows behind. Then five minutes later running and giggling to another part of the cinema, the last place being directly in front of Sarah and I - a few strong words and they disappeared, leaving us to enjoy the film.I think it was my inability to relax for the first 30 minutes, after which I settled into viewing mode, abolished all criticism from my mind and enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining reintroduction to the old faces.Johnny Depp continues to amuse with his drunken drool and carefree attitude, while Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly appear to be acting in a completely different film all together, while Depp eases into his eccentric character, Bloom and Knightly look like they are better off playing Romeo and Juliet at London's Palladium.The over-dramatic portrayals are very soon forgotten though, as we see some great favourites grace the waters from the previous film. Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg & Mackenzie Crook) play a much appreciated, larger part in this story and add their usual hilarious antics. We also see the return of Norrington (Jack Davenport) as a washed up drunk, after losing his honourable standing as Elizabeth's intended in the previous instalment.What really makes the film are the new characters. With new consequences, predicaments and locations, we meet people like Tia Dalma (The black witch), Bootstrap Bill and a tribe of hungry cannibals. But without doubt, by the far the best treat has to be Davy Jones, his crew and his ship, the Flying Dutchman. Bill Nighy, unrecognisable, portrays the idiom in octopus/man form who, along with his frighteningly fantastic crew have spent too long at the bottom of the sea and are barely recognisable as humans, more so as aquatic beasts. The ship itself is a sight to behold, like an organic mass of seaweed and barnacles, the whole effect makes for excellent viewing.I do have to mention the scene on the white, sandy beach where Elizabeth is trying to break up the testosterone induced sword fight -a pointless and embarrassing viewing experience. Certainly one for the cutting room floor in my opinion.Perhaps the story line itself could have been improved upon, but as a Walt Disney, 12A film I didn't expect this to be up to much and it is more than made up for by action, fantasy and hilarity.The film ends on a cliff hanger, ready for the next instalment, next year, where I am sure we will be served up more of the same, comfortably entertaining performance. Oh, and Keith Richards, apparently!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great fun!,"To begin with, this is only half a movie. If you can accept that fact then this is a very entertaining and rewarding 150 minutes. Of course it isn't as good as the first one, at least not by itself. Dead Man's Chest, the sequel to Curse of the Black Pearl is actually part one of a two-part deal, and therefore it can't be compared fairly to the original Pirates movie until both parts have been released. Black Pearl managed to tell it's entire story concisely in just 153 minutes, and that is where the Dead Man's Chest falls slightly short of it's predecessor. In places it does feel a little stretched-out, for no good reason other than to split the story across two full-length films. Dead Man's Chest just isn't as concise as Black Pearl. BUT, the action scenes never drag, the pacing is for the most part pretty fast, and the characters are all as compelling as in the first movie. I would recommend this wholeheartedly. It's ending is actually far more satisfying and ""conclusive"" than the rather unsatisfying Superman Returns (which was a great film until the ending which left every major plot point unresolved. This is especially annoying as we are expected to wait until 2009 for the next installment!). Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a very entertaining movie, and one which lived up to expectations, well ""half"" lived up to them anyway. I can't wait for the other half!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I would Recommend it,"This was well made and well written with the exception of the plot. The movie was littered of sub-plots, and this wouldn't be a big deal if there was a strong tie between them, but this was lacking. The movie is better than Curse of the Black Pearl, but is darker. Also, if you enjoy long movies, this is for you.The film is one of surprises and tense scenes, rather surprising from a Disney movie. The film is also rather dynamic, and quite expansive on the geography, which gives the feel for these pirates because you feel you've sailed the same waters that they have. The beauty of this is that, to some degree, you can choose a character to make a reference from and you still get the same experience from another character.Overall, I would recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This movie was great,"Overall I thought this was a great movie and a good way to follow up on the first. The only thing that I have to say against it is that you with all the different plots it took me a couple of times of watching it to understand what was going on (also the battle between The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman was a little iffy to me in how it was thought up but when you think about it, it's pirates so what do you expect). The movie actually reminded me a lot of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back in how something happened to the hero in both movies (Han Solo got put into carbon freeze and Jack git sent to Davey Jones' Locker) as well as how the main characters were constantly pursued by Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. One thing that I noticed the first time watching it is that you see a different side of Jack in this movie than in the first movie in that he's not the quick-witted, mad, rum-drinker but more of an urgent, sort of cowardly and sometimes ruthless individual trying to get away at all costs. To be honest the love plot between Will and Elizabeth was really getting on my nerves but the idea of Norrington coming back as a drunk was hilarious. But overall the main reason why I liked this movie was because of Davey Jones who in my opinion is the poster-villain from here on in as everything he said and did was just ruthless (I still can't get over the first line he says in the movie when he threatens the dying sailor and he's smoking a pipe as he says ""Do you fear death?"" and even worse when the other sailor declines his offer to join his crew and he signals his second-in-command to kill him)- whoever had the idea of inserting DAvey Jones in the sequel was a genius because that separated the second from the first and in effect possibly made the second into its own movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not surprised,","I just saw the movie from the midnight showing.The movie started out with beautiful scenery, really making you feel like you are out at sea. Jack's entrance was predictable yet still good, the story was going well (a bit random, too) and then in the middle of the movie, it sank.I am a huge fan, I waited over 17 hours to get screening tickets for the first movie. But I tried not to get myself too excited about this one since sequels usually eat it.Around an hour or hour and a half into the movie, nothing made sense. The monkey still had ""the curse"" yet the others didn't. Jack was acting like...well not really Jack. He lost ALL his morals and loyalty which in the end he usually comes around but didn't. The first minute I heard Will Turner talk, I thought ""You pay him millions of dollars to say lines like a soap opera star?"" (I am a fan of him and I love him but this wasn't his best movie) And Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) was acting like a lunatic slut. Everyone was out of character, mostly, except the bird on that guy's shoulder.Then after about 3 million twists, you practically want to die. There were wonderful scenes in there but they were stretched out to the extent of making me want to fall asleep. It was about 20% lower in quality as for the all around movie itself compared to the original. I did like the idea of the Crack'n (not to much of those stupid squid people) but the movie really didn't follow the rules of the plot. I wish I saw more of a PIRATE movie then a Squid-meets-Final Fantasy X. BUT THE ENDING IS AWESOME. I really hope to dear god the next one is better or I feel like I wasted over 24 hours of waiting in line from the past 2 movies.See it if you're bored and have 2 and a half hours to kill. And don't mind watching disgusting humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bad News,"A rousing action packed summer epic with lovable characters, brilliant action scenes, flawless cgi, and an engaging plot with plenty of twists.That was Curse of the Black Pearl.This film, however, fell far short of its predecessor. It's plot is shabby and convoluted, its only real climax being the revelation that there is another movie yet to come. The action scenes are well choreographed but entirely gimmicky and too long. Half of the film just makes comedic references to the first film, and the other half sets up for the sequel. Missing from the film was the charm and dry witty humor of the first, which was sadly replaced only by rum jokes. To top it all off the film is over 2 hours long, with only 1 hour's worth of content.I hate to say it, but this is Matrix Reloaded all over again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
POTC fans; Prepare to be Amazed!,"oh, the glorious day has finally come when Jack, Will and Elizabeth hit the big screen again with triumphant grandeur!! yes, it is true; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is everything you have been wishing for all year long!the only weak point of the film was the very beginning. HOWEVER, don't be fooled, as i almost was. just pay attention to all the seemingly unfitting pieces, and your patience will soon be rewarded with one of the few sequels i've ever seen that truly matches it's original's greatness.the humor and lines of the first film that have fast become a staple of pop-culture, especially those of Captain Jack, are most certainly not skipped here. nor are the magnificent sets and effects, the in-depth history set behind the plot, the unpredictable twists and turns, or the intense action sequences. you will either find yourself laughing, mesmerized, attentive, surprised, or teetering on the edge of your seat for the entire length of the film. i guarantee, no dull moment is to be found.all the characters were perfectly acted (no squirming in your seat from a horribly over-acted scene) and just as you remember them from the first film, if not better and improved to just the right extent without seeming obvious. (one character especially, and you will love him/her all the more for it.) they all, of course, change a little according to the new plot, as any character must. but the personality we know and loved from each is still there, matured to just the right amount for a seamless and believable fit to the passage of time.specifically the supporting cast, all the characters you loved and expected from the first film, and a few you may not expect, take the stage once more. it's as if none of them have even removed their pirate garb; so in-character is each one kept. and plenty of new characters also await; their stories told just as masterfully as the old ones first were, you soon know them and they blend perfectly into the new on-screen family they occupy.the verdict? take everything that you loved about the first Pirates film, expand it twice over, and you will have ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; truly the original's greatness put to justice, as all sequels should.big screen's the only way to see this one mate. Can't wait for the third installment! i hope you all enjoy!Chef13",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A worthy follow-up,"I went to the premiere Danish showing of this movie, and for a noon show it was remarkably well attended (Copenhagen's biggest theater, probably 75-80% full). I hoped the movie would be at least as good as the first one, and in fact it was. Not better, nor a terribly memorable movie; not much to think about after it ended, but while it lasted it was very funny and enjoyable - a worthy follow-up to the original.Well, one thing to think about might be the subplot about Elizabeth really being more interested in Jack than in Will... but we'll have to wait until the next movie to see if there's some real meat on that hook.I did think this movie was a bit too long. It had many great scenes and sequences, but at 150 minutes there were also some passages that were too long and boring. But it did have a lot of details, which was good.Johnny Depp was of course the spice of the movie, while Bloom and Knightley, as in the original, were adequate. Not great, not bad, but all right. Jonathan Pryce was good (as he always is), and I did wonder if Davy Jones was actually played by someone, or if he was fully CGI. Turns out he was being played by another brilliant Brit, Bill Nighy (hell, what would Hollywood do without all the British acting talent?!), which explains why he was so good.Next movie, I'm primarily looking forward to the return of Geoffrey Rush's character - and another generous helping of Johnny Depp's inimitable Jack Sparrow, of course!A pirate's life for me! Nah, not really! :-)My rating: 8 out of 10. Same as the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Caption Jack is Definitely Back!,"I am a huge Pirates fan. I saw the first movie 6 times in theaters, I own it, I love it. Seeing Dead Man's Chest was almost like Christmas morning for me I was so excited. The acting is good and the so is the story. Jonny Depp is nearly perfect, Keira Knightley is brining Elizabeth to a whole new depth, and Will is well... Will! Orlando Bloom does a decent job bringing such a previously minor character to place of greater importance. Keeping in mind that this is a Disney movie, there are no complex story lines or plot twists. Yet it was a great time. Johnny nailed the part of Captain Jack Sparrow perfectly and he is just too funny. We laughed the entire time both times we went to see it. If you are a loyal fan of Curse of the Black Pearl, go see Dead Man's Chest. If you haven't seen CotBP yet, watch it before you go see DMC or it wont be quite as funny because you wont understand the jokes.This movie fully lived up to its ""Summer Blockbuster"" tag.

"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Gore Verbinski, 2006) **1/2","I have to say upfront that I wasn't particularly impressed by the original and was very surprised that Johnny Depp's overrated performance ended up among the Best Actor Oscar nominees. This sequel proves to be an even less attractive commodity: the epitome of the empty-headed and over-produced summer blockbuster, the film is tiresomely long while providing nothing that's remotely new, very little plot (with the much-sought titular object coming to little purpose!) and an over-abundance of effects (there are about four separate attacks by The Kraken alone!) to make up for its lazy scripting.While the original was supposed to evoke the Saturday matinée' adventure films of old, this one has little real feeling for the genre; the accent is on the supernatural (what this has to do with a pirate film in the first place is baffling to say the least, and doesn't work quite as much as the film-makers seem to think either!) which allows the make-up department a free hand to create the silliest-looking creatures this side of the ""Star Wars"" saga! The stars seem to be merely going through the paces this time around: Johnny Depp overdoes the roguish charm (again!), while Orlando Bloom is as bland as ever; Keira Knightley, after her star-making turn in the original, is under-used here (as if the film-makers didn't quite know what more to do with her!). As for the 'ghosts', we have a ridiculously-tentacled main villain played by the little-known Bill Nighy (who had previously appeared in another saga which vulgarized a myth {or two}, the ""Underworld"" films) and Stellan Skarsgard (making little impression) as Bloom's 'undead' pirate father.The film ends on a cliffhanger on the lines of the first entry in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" saga and also features an uncredited bit by Geoffrey Rush (turning up at the end to reprise his role from the first installment in the series, whose third episode is already being filmed...which means that we have to suffer through another Summer of this). Mind you, the film is entertaining enough in a mindless {sic} sort of way, but it's all overkill in the end...and, really, the creators of this franchise ought to think more of their audiences rather than merely thinking of how to fill their own pockets (this film's phenomenal box-office performance is preposterous)!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Exciting, rip-roaring high seas adventure goes on and on, but delivers the goods with terrific set design, lively performances, eye-popping visual effects, and a better script that throws out new perils at just the right moments.

Much Worse Than The 1st One,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the long anticipated sequel of the 2003 hit movie. The plot centers around Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). He owes his soul to Davy Jones (Bill Nighty), who is the Captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman ship.

It's running time is unnecessarily long at 2 and a half hours.

Sure, there's plenty of chaos and sword fights and running around, which is entertaining, but to an extent.

Some films, such as Kill Bill, have plots designed over two films and it works fine for Kill Bill. However, the plot for Pirates 2 is rather convoluted and consequently, the ""to be continued..."" tag seems to mean ""we want you to pay to see the next film"" or ""we've messed up this plot and will finish it later"". Quite simply, unless you go to see the third film, you will not discover what happens. I think this is a rather shameful money making technique.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great movie, but slightly unsatisfying","Don't get me wrong: I loved Curse of the Black Pearl. But Dead Man's Chest is, in comparison, quite ugly.The film itself is quite long, which is the first problem I had with it. When watching it, I found that there were scenes that either dragged on or were just unimportant that had been included in it, consequently making the film to be quite a chore to watch. I'm also speaking in terms of the actions sequences, in particular, one sequence, which lasted quite a few minutes longer than necessary.Secondly, I didn't feel the characters as they were in the original. They seemed to lack the emotion, with the exception of Depp, who made a magnificent return. Bloom was quite bland in his acting, as was many of the other characters. Knightley was average, I suppose, but her performance was outdone by Depp's, but that's no surprise.As far as the plot of the movie is concerned, I believe it was quite satisfying and entertaining, and rather simple to follow. The plot twist and cliffhanger ending makes up for it, in the end.However, one thing that dragged from the film significantly was it's concern with being aesthetically pleasing, above all. Though the camera has captured some magic, it only highlights the rest of the film's faults.But, I loved the movie.

Back for the Better,"It's been three years of waiting and now Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew are back for more swashbuckling and adventure in the most highly anticipated sequel of the summer. This time, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley re-team with director Gore Verbinski to create a wild and crazy extension of the first film which includes more intense fight scenes, special effects, and (of course) a dabble of rum and romance.In the film, Sparrow is the target of the slimy, squirmy Davey Jones; Sparrow owes him his soul and the only way to avoid serving a lifetime on Jones' ship is to find the chest that contains his heart. And what other way could this all be accomplished without the help of his friends Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner? Familiar faces and fresh ones as well round out the roster, including a run-in with a tribe of cannibals.As expected, Johnny Depp performs above and beyond as Captain Jack. His comedic performance, as well as his serious one, set the tone for the film and keeps the audience rolling with laughter. Orlando Bloom still seems a bit stiff in his character, but it's definitely an improvement from the first film. And Keira Knightley blows her role out of the water, especially in her scenes with Depp. Finally, Bill Nighy's performance as the stunningly CGI-ed Davey Jones was incredible considering the fact that he was almost unrecognizable.If anything, this sequel proves that Pirates can do no wrong. With a comedic darkness and a wonderfully tricky ending that only Disney could get away with, it's lucky that a third film lingers on the horizon for summer 2007. Until then, die-hard fans can settle for seeing the film multiple times this July. Take it from me- I saw it twice in the first 24 hours it was released.

Manages to nearly overcome an idiotic decision.,"When the second (and third) Pirates films were greenlit the creative team had a big decision to make. They could back engineer a trilogy or write two mostly stand alone adventures. The choose the former but I really wish the choose the latter. One of joys of Pirates 1 is how self-contained and well finished it feels. It doesn't feel like introduction to a world. It feels like a complete story.I think both films 2 and 3 suffer from being overextended. It is much worse in 3 but the native Islander section is basically filler here-entertaining filler but not necessary to overall story. Likewise, Jones AND the East India Trading company being the villains is redundant. There's a much stronger story of Jack just trying outsmart Jones and dragging Will and Elizabeth along for the crazy ride.That said this is still a rousing adventure. Jones and his crew are some of the best CGI characters on film. They compete with Gollum and the Na'vi. The humor of the first film is still present and the swashbuckling is still fresh enough to be fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Curses and Creatures,"The sequel to the massively successful Pirates of the Caribbean introduced new and interesting characters along with mythical creatures which started an ongoing theme in the franchise.Davy Jones crew wasn't quite as exciting as the cursed men of the black pearl.

The Kraken was pretty awesome. Terrible NHL team name though.An ambitious story that was a tad difficult to follow, even all these years later.

"With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance","After the resounding success of the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", it was only natural that Disney started planning sequences for this great phenomenon.

Filming took place from February to September 2005 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Palos Verdes, Dominica and the Bahamas, as well as on the sets built at Walt Disney Studios. The film was recorded together with the third film in the series, ""At the End of the World"".Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Weatherby (Jonathan Pryce), is about to marry blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). However, the event is hampered by the threat of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the haunted Flying Dutchman, who owes blood to Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the couple's friend. Fearing being cursed to an afterlife as a slave to Jones, Sparrow must find the mysterious chest of death to escape the threat.This second part of the sequence manages to surpass the previous film in quality and scale. The combination of humor and adventure worked so well previously that it was maintained and expanded. Although the option is for a darker film than the previous one, the chemistry between the main actors still exists and this time even entitled to a climate of love triangle - mainly reflecting the change in attitude of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, more mature. Another aspect of the franchise is the way the legends of the sea are used to compose this universe that mixes fantasy and reality. The first film had done this with the cursed gold, and this second did something similar with Davy Jones and the Kraken. With the absence of Geoffrey Rush in the cast (at least until the final minutes), the writers, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, needed someone to match Sparrow to meet the pirate and Jones was the perfect choice, both for his characterization, as for the man who lives the character.Fortunately, the script of the duo Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott is right to bet on a different film in structure and narrative progression, by avoiding thematic repetitions of the damsel in distress or cursed treasure, preferring to keep the characters separated in different subplots and offer a much more macguffin interesting in the shape of the chest that names the film. The entire arc of Jack Sparrow running to save his soul offers more dangerous risks and really brilliant ideas from the team, from the convict crew that slowly fuse with marine elements and the structure of the Dutch Flying Ship to the imminent threat of the monstrous squid mythological giant, the Kraken.On the other hand, the duo's script does not show such care in all its parts. Inheriting one of the problems of the first film: the prolonged duration, Dead Man's Chest extends for two and a half hours, making this an exhausting adventure. Although they are probably the funniest and most creative parts of the film, the part on the island with cannibals will be totally dispensable to the story narrative, serving only for distraction and adding nothing to the main plot. This is one of the examples of the increase in the scale of the film, but the extra time is not used to delve into the machinations of Becket or Jones, but with expendable passages that have no influence on the story. As a result, some aspects become confused, since they do not receive the necessary focus, while others sound too busy, see the whole interaction between Will and his father.Since this film was shot with the third, much of the plot of Death Chest serves to explain concepts and characters that will gain more prominence and depth in the next chapter, as well as letting the film end on a devastating hook and perpetuating it as a work with no end, but which is part of a whole. Other problems include some inconclusive cores, such as the forced and artificial development of a ""love interest"" between Jack and Elizabeth, which yields only a turnaround during the climax, in addition to disposable moments of jealousy between the girl and Will - not to mention the presence of ex-commodore.
Regarding the cast, Depp maintains all his detailed physical construction and the character's mannerisms, such as the staggering gait and his arms always in motion, as if the character needed a lot of concentration to be able to stand. The character's wit and irony also return, but it is remarkable how Jack is much more comical here, see his hilarious performance when he is elected ""king"" by the cannibals of a local island. As for his scene mates, unfortunately Bloom maintains his striving performance on a single note, with Will's determination and willpower, while Keira Knightley benefits from the improvement in his character to bring more toughness to his performance, even though he maintains a femininity. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is the highlight here. A tragic and heartbroken villain, Jones is a ghostly presence that we are both able to fear and admire at the same time, and much of this is due to Bill Nighy's impressive performance capture mix with Industrial Light & Magic's photorealistic visual effects., deservedly awarded Oscar for his work here.From the first frame of the film, Verbinski's care in establishing a beautiful and realistic world can be seen, with the beautiful and melancholy image of a deserted wedding ceremony punished by a heavy rain, taking us immediately to a terrifying dungeon where we see crows pulling out the eyes of living men ... until breaking it all up with an appropriately hilarious introduction to Jack Sparrow, demonstrating his incredible control of rhythm and pitch variation, something that is crucial to the success of the production. Not to mention the Kraken's gradual appearances. The first is something practically out of a terror, with a violent suction that sinks a small fishing boat in a matter of seconds, gaining a much more elaborate resourcefulness when we get to the second attack. Here, we see the filmmaker's ability to control the spatial geography of events, keeping our focus on Will Turner climbing a mast while his camera roams the chaos on the deck and all desperate men are grabbed by the creature's giant tentacles.Verbinski and director of photography Dariusz Wolski know how to work with night scenes without making them excessively dark, using wet scenes and characters and moonlight to justify the presence of light. They capture the naturalism of the beautiful landscapes and locations where history walks, which include the colorful island of cannibals, marked by the green of their tree tops, to the climax at Isla Cruces, where we have a duel of swords on a sandy beach very white. Indoor scenes involving candlelight, especially the ship's cabin and the sequence in Tortuga, bring a typical orange of the light source flame and a remarkable contrast between the other scenes, with the color changing drastically to a heavier shade and bluish during the moments in the Flying Dutchman, creating a terrifying environment that really looks like a marine hell. In fact, the memorable characterization of the Flying Dutchman and his crew is a spectacle by the production designer and art director. Merging crustaceans with marine beings, they all gain strong visual identities, not being as forgettable as the skeletons of the first film.Hans Zimmer, Oscar-winning composer for ""The Lion King"", returned to the post of composer of the franchise's soundtrack and did the unimaginable: he surpassed the quality of the tracks shown in the first feature. With all the mythology suffered by Davy Jones around his love and hate for Calypso, Zimmer tried to compose the character's theme in a way that showed all his feelings, and succeeded. Not to mention the Kraken scenes.With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance in the right measure - but a decision was wise enough to guarantee the good result: the characters and the plot are attractive enough to guarantee the viewer's attention and make him anxious for the third part that will end the arc of this first trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"OK, but not great","Pirates of the Carribbean: Dead Man's Chest was an enjoyable movie. It had many things to please a wide variety of views - action, adventure, comedy and romance.However, the main problem found with this film was its length. It was 20 minutes or so too long. *SPOILER* The scene where those natives made Jack their God and stuff was completely unnecessary and didn't add to the story at all. I felt it ruined the flow of the film. *END OF SPOILER* If that scene were cut out, I would've given it a higher score. Also, there were a few plot holes which didn't really make sense.Even though it Dean Man's Chest didn't live up to the flawless Curse of the Black Pearl, overall, it was a decent film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worst movie ever!!!,"they talked so much good about it but it was ten times worse then the first one, the ""funny"" stuff was for kindergartens. It was so bad i almost fell asleep in the middle of the film!!!! The idea was good, the actors were good, but it was made foe small children, okay it was a Disney movie but in the first one the ""enemies"" was scary. Now they looked like a couple of goof-balls and what about the extra thick spaghetti face called captain, he was the biggest laugh in the whole movie. If i could turn back time I've never would have went to the movies to watch this junk called Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Over All Pretty Good,"I thought that this film could have been made better, but it isn't really that bad. I absolutely adored the first movie, and was somewhat disappointed with this one. Johnny Depp was superb in this, as usual. Davey Jones is disgustingly incredible. One thing that I think was the main reason I was displeased was because they didn't make the scenes blend nicely, they kind of jumped around a bit. A friend of mine phrased it nicely ""By the end of the movie, I felt like I was on a very long ride that I wanted to get off of soon."" I agree with that statement. Some of the scenes were those that were better suited for a video game than a live action film. They were very unrealistic. The costuming and make-up of the film, though, were some of the best I have seen in years. Davey Jones and his crew looked as though they have just spent the last 50 years on the bottom of the ocean, became mutated, and crawled back on land. Very nice. Captain Norrington was also spectacularly costumed. Johnny's make up was perfectly suited for his character. Over all, the film was pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Some Good Comedy Sequences,"I finally saw this at a theatre this weekend. I love movies but hate theaters. But I was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball, it was 95 degrees at the nearly shade-less softball complex, and the small town theater had $4 matinée prices. About midway through I got a headache but that could have been from the 32 ounce slushy rather than the film. Considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theater.Basically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one. It was really too long (most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this point).The assembly of the film was horrible, making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense. But it works fine as a comedy.Knightley's character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny. You could say the same for Depp and Bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast (a good thing in the cases of Davy Jones and the bubbling pair of Black Pearl crewman-a bad thing otherwise).While certainly better than recent CG mega-movie like ""King Kong"", the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand. These computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers (""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost 50 years ago) and the CG scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Big expansion,"This film is a big expansion on the original Pirates of the Caribbean film and introduces a lot of new settings and characters. These don't pay off immediately but they are set up for future plots (which were disappointing, unfortunately). There is lots of cool action and even more charming actors, adding to the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"I usually think that a good spell of time between an original and a sequel is a good thing. It gives everyone space to refresh the ideas and develop the characterisations. That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time, we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits, so can head straight to the action which for the next 2½ hours follows ""Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful ""Davy Jones"" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to enter hell. Meantime, ""Will"" (Orlando Bloom) and ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley) are having problems of their own, and when he has to try to kidnap ""Jack"" with his compass for the dastardly ""Lord Beckett"" (Tom Hollander) in return for her safety he, en route, becomes reunited with his rather curmudgeonly (and barnacled) father (Stellan Skarsgård). It seems that both ""Will"" and ""Jack"" cannot both get what they need - but can they find a solution? It's end-to-end stuff this, with loads of mythical creatures from the depths, a tiny bit of romance and a Johnny Depp very much at the top of his game. The story is solid and entertaining, as is much of the quickly paced dialogue and David Schofield turns in a good effort as the malevolent ""Mercer"". I could have done with Geoffrey Rush but otherwise this is a fun fantasy adventure with some cracking visual effects and Hans Zimmer's music adds richness to the jollity too. A big screen must, really. It's just not so good on the telly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
All right.,"Unfortunately, this is not nearly as good as the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film, for me anyway. It is a great deal more tedious, has more fighting (which is quite boring) and less plot and story. If you liked the fighting in the last film, you will enjoy this sequel more than I did, as this has a great deal more of the fighting than the last film does.Jack Sparrow (Oh wait - sorry!) Captain Jack Sparrow is craving for one thing. It is a chest, with Davy Jones' heart. Davy Jones is the pirate captain of a ghost ship, his whole crew are dead.Meanwhile, both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan have been arrested and Will Turner escapes and to free Elizabeth Swan he needs to give Captain Jack Sparrow's compass to someone else. With help of her father, Elizabeth Swan manages to escape anyway and steals on a ship disguised as a man.An exciting adventure is about to enroll...For people who like pirates, exciting films with quite a lot of fights, gory bits and pretty good humour, this film is for you.6 and a half out of ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worse than Matrix 2,"I was warned that the movie would be awful so I already decreased my expectations, but this movie was worse than everything I might have expected. It often seemed like the only relation between the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 were the names of the characters.This movie was an insulting of the paying audience. Maybe Part 3 makes everything look less stupid but I doubt it very much.Captain Jack just wasn't enough Captain Jack, William Turner was too naive for someone who has dealt with Jack before and Elizabeth Swan was... well, let's keep it the way I said above: the only thing that the characters seemed to have in common with the characters of the first movie often seemed to be the names which was very sad.The extreme over-length didn't help, the good action and effects didn't help, either... stupid movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Was there a little horror element,"This movie has never stopped to amaze me. Apart from the brilliance of Johnny Depp, this was more about the interesting cast of Davy Jones.

A decent entertaining installment.,"Like its other installments, the elements of franchisee 'Pirates of the caribbean' have been handled well. The fantasy factor (in story), black magic, relationships, anti-pirates, pirates (mostly Jack), crew, etcetera are amazing like always. The visuals are worth mentioning as well.In this installment jack is cursed for something he did in the past b y Davy Jones, will he get rid of that curse with all his wit and selfishness.The, to be praised entity of this installment and the sequel to this installment is character of Davy Jones.

Everything You Could Want in a Pirate Film,"A strong sequel following the very impressive original. Dead Man's Chest follows it's predecessor's template and gives you everything you could hope for in the sequel.The storyline was strong and linked in nicely both with the first film and classic tales. Acting all round was at a high standard, Nighy as Davy Jones was particularly brilliant, Bloom a little grating but all part of the character.Whilst the CGI maybe wouldn't be seen as fantastic nowadays, it's still passable, and some of the details gone to are incredible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was good.,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original, although there are exceptions to that. But who can resist Johnny Depp strutting the decks of the Black Pearl as Captain Jack Sparrow in the new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. If you have to be picky, I think Orlando Bloom is actually quite ordinary and Keira Knightly doesn't really have all that much to do. There's so much else going on.And on it goes. It's 2 and a half hours long and you do come to a point where you think there can be too much of a good thing. Hollywood produces so much lazy rubbish, and at least they've put enormous effort into delivering in terms of script and in terms of special effects and creations. You're just leaping from one crisis situation to the next, with gorgeous characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Chest"" Packed Full of Laughs and Thrills","""Dead Man's Chest"" is a great film, full of non-stop fun and thrills. The overall look of the film is mysterious and entrancing. It's the most land-locked film in the trilogy, allowing for more beautiful location shots and slapstick action. The Oscar-winning effects are also amazing, surpassing anything I've ever seen before in a film.The acting in the film is great, similarly to the first film. Johnny Depp is, again, hilarious as Jack Sparrow. Keira Knightley and Jonathon Pryce also give good supporting performances, though Orlando Bloom is certainly not phenomenal.The laughs are everywhere, along with the twists and thrills. There are sword-fights, burnings, and a crew of ridiculously stupid pirates. The villains in the film are much more intimidating than Geoffrey Rush's character in the first and third films. Bill Nighy is great as the cruel Davy Jones and the Kraken was one of the greatest creatures ever created on camera. If for nothing else, see it for the laughs and the effects. It's not as good as the first nor the third, but it's still an enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Colossal disappointment,"Not going to say a great deal, other than I was really looking forward to this movie as the first one was a lot of fun and although the 1st trailer had me worried, as it didn't entice me one bit, the 2nd trailer was far superior and had me jazzed. That just about sums up the movie- inconsistent.At the start we have Will and Elizabeth both defensive of their good friend ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow- However, when they meet up, you sense there is no friendship, no camaraderie, just deceit, mistrust- but not in an interesting way, just a depressingly cynical way. Is a summer adventure movie supposed to feel like this? I think not. This trio simply doesn't stand up to the greats I'm afraid- remember Luke, Han and Leia- 'nuff said.I simply didn't have a great deal of fun watching this movie- everything seemed to contrived and cynical- big set pieces ham-fistedly tacked onto one of the most poorly developed story's I've come across in recent blockbusters. I went to see this with my bro and two friends- I and one of my buddies fell asleep about 3/4 of the way in for a good 5 or 10 minutes only to wake up to find that nothing had changed, still the same boring, joyless movie. All 4 of us were deeply disappointed come the end.Even the comedy fell short of the mark. Depp did his best, but didn't have same quality material to work with this time around. The whole movie felt like hard work- I just hope the third movie sets things right, but one thing's for sure- it has a hell of a task ahead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Mans Chest,"Pirates of the Caribbean 2 may be my least of the 3 they have made so far but only because the other too are sweet. The movie is about Captain Jack Sparrow a while later and he is in trouble again this time is that he owes 100 souls to Davy Jones. The movie is really funny, has great action and does not ruin the first one which already makes a sequel 30% in my mind. The only reason I do not think this is as good as the others is because there is something missing and I not sure what. Overall I rate this high for cleverness,Funniness and action but I do not rate it as high as the others for some reason but I still rate it a pretty solid and fair 74% so go watch this film you will not be that disappointed and it is good for a laugh or two but the other too are better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Uneven and too long, but still has strong spots.","Some say that the first Pirates of the Carribean movie was too long and I didn't share that opinion back then, but with this first sequel I join in on that. Some parts around the beginning just felt unnecessary.But when Jack and co. are finished with fooling around and the plot of finding the chest to get rid of the infamous Davy Jones gets going, then the good stuff begins. And the Flying Dutchman and its crew are highlights in here, because never have I seen CGI that made me feel like it was real.Davy Jones is voiced brilliantly by Bill Nighy who makes his mark as a dispicable and merciless captain of the ship that's doomed to sail the seas forever.The visuals are the biggest highlight of Dead Man's Chest, because even though I enjoy the presence of Captain Jack Sparrow, the movie falls victim to a common fault in sequels of repeating much of the same seen in the previous movie. In this case it's only in the rather weak beginning until the main plot gets going.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp is the King as Captain Jack Sparrow,"If you want to watch this movie then just watch it for Johnny Depp having a ball as the wonderful Captain Jack Sparrow.I love this series and am looking forward desperately for Part III.Johnny Depp looks like he's having fun playing this character and it shows.My one beef with this movie is that Jack Sparrow was not on screen enough, as I guess they had to focus on the other actors as well since the first movie was such a success and I am sure it is written into their contracts that they need loads of screen time.Is it me or is Orlando Bloom one of the luckiest actors around? LOTR trilogy, Troy, Elizabethtown, Kingdom of Heaven & Pirates. He has worked for Peter Jackson, Cameron Crowe, Ridley Scott and Wolfgang Petersen a veritable who's who of Hollywood directors and I am still not convinced he can act well.In any case, his scenes in the movie are mostly action scenes and thanks to the director they are quite imaginative and fun to watch.Bill Nighy does well... and Keira Knightley is sexy with her throaty English Accent but she is still too thin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite of the series,"Unlike most people who think Curse of the Black Pearl was the best of the Pirates' series, I personally prefer Dead Man's Chest.Dead Man's Chest starts with Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) getting arrested by the evil Lord Becket (Tom Hollander) for helping Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape. Becket makes a deal, if Will finds Jack then he would pardon them and more importantly, Jack's compass. Jack is on his own mission when Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) wants to recall Jack's debt for raising the Black Pearl. Here Jack has to run to land before having to play everyone involved against for him to get his own way and save his skin. A sub-plot of the film is Will finding that his father (Stellan Skarsgård) is alive, working for Davy Jones. Bootstrap Bill sets out to do all he can to protect his son.I will get the problems out the way first. The plot is too convoluted and mixed up. It can lead to confusion and loosing interest. The convoluted plot also leads to the film being too long and a number of faux endings. Finally Orlando Bloom can't act (except in Lord of the Rings). Now to the positives. The action is excellent and you get a lot of sword fights and flint-lock gun fights. An excellent mix of action and comedy is the free way sword fight on the bench. There is comedy which people should enjoy. Johnny Depp is very good in the film, but Bill Nighy does steal the show. Nighy is alway excellent, being the best performer in Love Actually and very good in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Guest House Paradiso etc... Nighy made a brilliant villain. The special effects are amazing, some of best put to film and I expect most of the people involved will not struggle to find work. Another element I enjoyed was the sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth throughout the film and how she uses it as a weapon against him. I would have like to see more of that.It's an enjoyable enough film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"enjoyable, but not 9/10 like the first film.","Plenty of action, lots of laughs and even a bit of - in my opinion unnecessary gore. Johnny Depp wasn't as talkative or indeed around for as many scenes this time but as witty as usual. Looked less like a pirate this time - teeth too perfect, face less gaunt - too healthy altogether! Orlando was less 'Legolas' this time - growing in his role as Will Turner. To comment on Keira Knightly - what is she up to? Not acting anyway. There's a scene on a beach which should have been cut - when she had a temper tantrum - irritating to watch. I've seen her in King Arthur and of course Pirates 1 and thought she did a good job. I have only seen the film once yet so maybe I'm a bit early with my comments. Stellan Skarsgård makes an appearance - though not exactly a pretty one. Always good to watch great actors.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good...but ???,"Having loved the 1st Pirates film, it was in anticipation that I went into the dark theater to watch the sequel. I was confused almost the minute the film began. The plot of this film rushes by in a whirl of action and excitement. The scenes and stunts are spectacular, aided by the incredible performance of most of the actors. I was greatly impressed, but a lot of things in the story just didn't make sense to me. To give the filmmakers a little mercy, there was a huge storm the day I saw this film and the power went out twice. Add to that a few minutes absent from the theater, and I really shouldn't complain about constantly feeling I had ""missed something"". But I just got the impression that the filmmakers did not make everything as clear as they could have. I have no doubt that many of my questions will find answers come the release of the 3rd film. As an after note, I was rather annoyed by the character of Elizabeth Swan. She had a very abrasive personality. Whether this is a fault of Keira Knightly's performance, or an intentional addition by the filmmakers remains to be seen. But I don't remember her being that obnoxious in the 1st film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
worst film in history,"Are you people kidding? This has got to be one of the most inane and horrible boring piece of garbage ever recored to film!

The movie sounds fantastic.And of course, Johnny Depp, the only man who could possibly pull off Jack Sparrow, one of the best actors of our time.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My diagnosis is blockbuster-sequelitis,"I can impossibly outline the plot of Dead Man's Chest so I will just say that the story centres around finding the titular object with all the detours and diversions that this quest entails. Owing to these, the film is a chaotic extravaganza, puffed full of story lines, and camp as a row of tents. It scores higher with me than the original did simply because this adventure knows how ridiculous it is and how much it suffers from blockbuster-sequelitis  and Gore Verbinski makes no pretense about it. The result is fun, big, bigger, epic.Although I never saw Dead Man's Chest in the theatre, I can easily imagine what the atmosphere must have been like during the premiere week. The responsive contingent of tittering and giggling teenage girls must surely have elevated it about generic adventure movie formula. What's more is that the vivid CGI extravaganza of special effects not only merits a big screen, but demands it for the optimal experience. Dark City/The Crow cinematographer Dariusz Wolski takes a big gulp out of the lush murky jungles and the epic marine battles, creating an unspeakably captivating setting through aerial shots. There are two aspects that follow Wolski's style: polite nods to horror and shots so dark you can hardly make out the action. Nevertheless the cinematography is arguably one of Dead Man's Chest's goldmines.Conversely, the acting side of the tapestry is wristslashingly poor. This is quite a feat when employing the skills of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy, Stellan Skarsgård and Johnny Depp  so kudos on that. I don't suspect I need to comment on Bloom and Keira, but let me debunk the myth that Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Jack Sparrow. If unforgivably over-the-top and staged is your cup of tea then maybe you will enjoy his style of acting. In fact Depp displays the theatrics a high school drama student would resort to in the annual Christmas play. Perhaps Jack Davenport who reprises his role as Norrington is the light of the film. For one, he no longer looks like a Popsicle, but a scruffy, rugged pirate. Yarr! The backlot backstabbing that goes on in the triumvirate of Depp, Davenport and Bloom proves inexplicably entertaining at times.But the script is one big sketchbook mess. It is the type of thing that a 12-year-old boy would conjure up whilst scribbling down a few ideas in math class. Dead Man's Chest is bursting with the flair, comedy, fantasy, action, horror and (backseated) romance of an impatient author. Even if you are a token Disney dog you will get your own storyline. This tells me someone in charge just needs to pause for a second and reconsider serious condensation storywise  lose a few characters. Another fatal flaw in the script stage is the laziness that it applies to crafting its characters. It becomes apparent within minutes of the film that it relies solely on Jack Sparrow for comedy  and worst of all, it does not even bother to give him good lines or situations, but expect the audience to find the mere facial expressions of Depp 'hysterical'. If you are a fawning fangirl you probably will.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a dizzyingly fast paced and complex film (it gets so complex that at one point there is a pause and a comedic sidekick gets to explain the plot to the audience) with numerous layers, except when it comes to its one-dimensional characters. Some of these prove quite smirkworthy with their assigned quirks and undoubtedly little time is left to reflect on the quality of the whole spectacle. Even remotely 'serious' scenes are interrupted by pratfalls or whacked-out action sequences that boldly transcend the boundaries of logic (rolling wheel and rolling ball comes to mind). The good news is that amidst the fast-paced navigation of the marine action world, time is a non-issue. 150 minutes? Feels like 90.Still, if you want perfect adventure camp I highly recommend The Mummy (1999).6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Brilliantly, Amazing, Utterly...pointless","Yes, 'tis true. The long-awaited sequel is pointless with a very difficult, hard-to-follow plot. Characters keep appearing, disappearing then reappearing again, randomers are flying left, right and centre and Keira Knightley is one of the most annoying women ever. She tries to act manly in a sexy way which doesn't work and is just embarrassing. Johnny Depp does keep Captain Jack Sparrow up to his usual standard but the script lacks many of the brilliant one-liners that made the first film so great. Orlando Bloom has improved though, Will Turner is a more believable character and his acting has improved. Bill Nighy is brilliant as Davy Jones but it's not actually explained who he is, why he has a squid as a head and why Jack Sparrow is in debt to him. The many sword fights are entertaining, but I still feel Jack wasn't as brilliant as he was in the first movie, there was just something lacking which i feel was more the script's fault than Johnny Depp's. Going back to the plot, it was be impossible to follow if it wasn't for Gibbs giving a running commentary throughout which helps a lot and is a touch of genius form the writers. I don't think Davy Jones is as good a baddie as Barbossa, who just seemed that slightly more ruthless. And the guy who plays Cutler Beckett is so annoying (but then again, you're not meant to like him) Go and see the film just to say you've seen it, but don't expect the humorous one-liners from Jack, the riding of the seven seas or anything that will explain what the heck is going on.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Worthy sequel, iffy plot","Curse of the Black Pearl opened in white, shrouded in deep fog. Focused on whites and Earth tones, the opening was ominous and brooding. That is not the case for Dead Man's Chest, where it opens in blues and greens. Sadness and horror both are the main focus of emotion for the opening sequence. Opening with a dreadful wedding day, that sense of dread is heightened past the first couple of minutes when the real horror begins. Dark, dreary, and truly horrifying, the prison scene really sets the mood for what is to come. Dead Man's Chest is dark in a literal sense, but not so much in the story. There are many points throughout the film where it does explore some dark themes, especially with the introduction of Davy Jones' character. This character seems to be the main focal point of the darkness, which he brings throughout the entire film. The rest of the film is much lighter than the first, still maintaining to throw in some jokes, even during the darker parts of the film. The CGI is remarkable, especially with the film's release date. 2006 was when CGI really was starting to get good, and this film shows just how good it was able to be. Seeing the images before the computer images were introduced are remarkable, with the artists doing a beautiful job creating the characters that are part of Davy Jones's crew. Even the kraken does look realistic, especially with the first introduction. It's remarkable to see where CGI has went, and this really is one of the first films that I can recall that shows just how good Disney's animation was at the time. The biggest problem with Dead Man's Chest wasn't anything with the plot, but rather, the focus of the film. The focus of the film was very broad, as it introduced many characters. Out of all of these new characters, there is one the stood out the most, which would be Davy Jones. Throughout the film, any scene with this character was amazing, which is due to Bill Nighy's electric performance. This one character outshone every character, especially the returning characters. The focus should have bee more aimed toward the characters that were the main characters, not the new villain. Dead Man's Chest may not be as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it is still an amazing adventure film. This is the weakest film out of the original trilogy, mainly due to the introduction of so many characters, where the focus seemed to shift from Jack Sparrow and crew to Davy Jones and crew. Nonetheless, this film still is a fun pirate adventure that was a landmark for CGI.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pretty good...,"I saw the movie last weekend and thought is was pretty well done. I came in the theater prepared for an average movie, and this movie exceeded my expectations. All the fight scenes were good and funny due to Cpt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were like the first one, very good supporting characters. BUT it defiantly wasn't as good as the first one. This is one of those movies that some people think is the best in the world, while others think it pointless. I personally thought is was pretty good. Overall, it was pretty good with a huge cliffhanger at the end. I strongly suggest watching the first one before buying your ticket.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing - Yet Not Better,"Most of the movie was amazing, once again like the previous movie, I enjoyed this one very much. Some negatives to this movie however, in which it cannot compare to it's predecessor. First of all, I felt ""the kraken"" effects in some scenes were quite unrealistic - I won't mention which scenes to avoid spoilers. Also, I don't know if it was only me, but I did notice that Johny Depp's performance in this movie was nothing compared to his performance in the previous Pirates of the Caribbean. Seems he didn't put a lot of effort into it this time, didn't seem like he was really ""Jack Sparrow"" anymore. The movie was quite good, but the end was quite disappointing. I would have wished to see the conclusion of that - but I guess I can wait 5-6 months to see it now. Other than that, great work and great acting by the cast. Recommend to everyone if you're a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean - and even if you're not, this one you definitely won't want to miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Dead Man's Chest is still second to the Black Pearl.,"First, let me say that I really, really wanted to like this movie to the fullest. I felt that the first movie was over-hyped, but good. This one is also good, but over-hyped beyond comprehension.Will and Elizabeth are finally facing the consequences for their actions at the end of the first film. The punishment? Death. There is a chance that one of them can receive a pardon (it's never made clear which one exactly would actually get it) if Will brings to the new leader of the East India Trading Company, Lord Beckett, the compass that belongs to Captain Jack Sparrow.Jack meanwhile, is trying to find the key to the Dead Man's Chest when he gets an unexpected (and rather creepy) visit from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. He informs Jack that the deal he made with Davey Jones thirteen years ago to raise the Black Pearl from the depths of the ocean and make him captain of it has reached its limit. His soul now belongs to Davey Jones, or else he must suffer the wrath of the Krakken. He rushes toward land, any land. Which happens to be Cannibal Island. There's a bit of a ruckus, but in the end Will has found Jack, Jack takes him to Tia Dalma (a voodoo priestess) who informs them of the importance of the Dead Man's Chest and where they can find the key to unlock it, revealing an item that might just save Jack's soul. There's much more to the plot, but it would take too long to give even a brief description of it. Long story short, Will gets the key from Davey Jones, and gets to meet his father. Norrington has had his life destroyed due to Jack Sparrow, and Elizabeth is torn inside trying to decide between Jack and Will. All this while everyone is trying to get the Dead Man's Chest and the treasure within.This can get very confusing. The plot is a mish-mash that could have been split into another two movies. The action is what carries the weight here, and it does get very exciting (and half the time it's also very humorous). Jokes from the first film are used again, but it seems more in line of continuity then lack of originality.The big problems with this one include some slow pacing (we really didn't need the whole Cannibal Island sequence), some rather violent images (sometimes this felt like a sailor's horror movie), and the general darker tone to this compared to the first film. It's just not quite as fun.If you're a good ol' rumrunner that is looking for adventure on the high seas fighting against the paranormal of the briny deep aided by astonishing visual effects and can follow many, many plot lines woven (loosely) into one that feels like it relies on two big names and tremendous action sequences to be a success, then this is a movie for you. If, however, you prefer a story that focuses more on characters, is easier to follow and has a more upbeat tone to it, I recommend you sail for different waters.

I was disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with this film, everything that made The Curse of the Black Pearl the outstanding masterpiece it was is lacking in Dead Man's Chest. The personalities of the characters are even different, often noticeably so. A complete waste of an amazing cast.I own The Curse of the Black Pearl on DVD, it's one of my favorite movies. I plan on going to see Dead Man's Chest once more just because I feel like I must have missed something, but I sincerely doubt I'll purchase it.After The Curse of the Black Pearl, I was expecting another exemplary addition to the Pirates of the Caribbean saga. In that, I was utterly disappointed. In my book, Dead Man's Chest goes down as another horrible sequel that never should have been attempted since it's obvious no one cared about getting it right.In closing, please note this is my personal opinion. The friends I went to see the movie with loved it, I often tend to hold movies to higher technical standards than the average viewer.You know what's even worse than watching a horrible movie? Knowing it could have been so much better. There was so much potential here... ruined.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Deja Vu All Over Again...,"All the while I was watching ""Dead Man's Chest,"" I had the funny feeling I had seen this movie before.We're introduced to new villains, new motives, and a new storyline that don't quite work as well as the tightly written, snappy original, but we still enjoy it because it features the characters we've come to know and love. Furthermore, because the third portion of the trilogy was filmed simultaneously, there's an odd feeling of sadness and discord in that the film is merely only a bridge to the third, a whetting of the appetite if you will until the final resolution.In other words, it's ""Back To The Future, Part II"" all over again.Not that that's an entirely bad thing. Johnny Depp is pure eye candy on the screen; no matter how ridiculous the plot, how implausible the situation, he holds our attention, and rightly so, because he IS Captain Jack Sparrow, and he's so wonderful at it. Keira and Orlando are in fine form too, with both quite possibly looking even more lovely than they did in the first film. And, oh, are they all having fun up there.So when you see it in the theater, and everyone should see this on the big screen, just keep in mind that BTTFPT was the weakest of the bunch. But rejoice in that our favorite characters are back and happily cavorting on the big screen once again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SEQUEL & AS GOOD AS THE CLASSIC FIRST FILM,"What a fantastic sequel to a Classic.
""Dead Man's chest"" is another Masterpiece like the first film by the brilliant visionary director Gore Virbinski, a stunning piece of filmmaking with some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie!!!
This time Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth are mixed up with the Mystery & Legend of Davey Jones Locker & what we get is an Amazing swashbuckling, Cannibal, Jungle & sea creatures action adventure flick.
The look of the slimey octopus mutant Davey Jones is just amazing & his sea creatures mutated crew all look fantastic & scary & so richly detailed they are a work of Art.
The first time we meet the Deep sea monster crew is an incredible sequence that feels like a Horror movie it's done so well with such a creepy atmosphere, i loved it.The performances are all great again & Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was actually better this time around as he was toned down i felt with his bizarre ways & it was better.
Orlando Bloom is great again as the real action hero of the movie Will Turner & his beautiful bride-to-be Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley is funny & cunning. The real star of this show goes to the Amazing performance of the main monster himself Davey Jones performed & voiced by Bill Nighy under alot of c.g.i effects but an incredible creation.Dead Man's chest is a such a fun & beautiful looking Gothic monster movie with beautiful cinematography & richly textured & detailed sets & characters.
One of the best Adventure films ever made in my opinion. Another Masterpiece that's a joy to watch over & over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Gave this title a 8 out of 10 stars,I enjoy the CGI on this title more then the other pirates movies probably because of Davey Jones. I just love the concept and after this movie it seemed like they started reaching in the plot and had no real direction.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
disappointed in the second film,"I wasn't really that impressed with the second film as all it did was regurgitate the same characters from the first with the exception of Lord Beckett and Tia Dalma (freakin hottie btw), plus, I know this is more of a Jerry Bruckheimer film than a Disney picture.

Pirates return to attack with another success,"This movie continues the story told in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Prevented from marrying Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and accused of piracy, Will (Orlando Bloom) leaves Port Royal with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in order to seek the heart of Davy Jones, the fearsome commander of the ""Flying Dutchman"". But Sparrow hides that he has more selfish reasons for that search: try to catch the man whom he promised his own soul. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other Collaborators.As often happens with big blockbusters, this is the predictable and awaited sequel to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The cast brings some new faces: Bill Nighy will play Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgård will play Bill Turner, Tom Hollander will play the villain, Cutler Beckett, and Naomie Harris will give life to Tia Dalma. But the most interesting is the evolution of the central characters, inherited from the previous film. Will reveals himself increasingly a true pirate, as his bride that, in this film, will take part in the action scenes, leaving skirts behind. Jack, on the other hand, is increasingly ambiguous and unpredictable: sometimes a hero, sometimes a villain, liar and deceiver, we never know what he is doing or thinking. The plot is fun and very interesting: each character has its own interests and reasons to find that heart, reasons that may be conflicting. The rivalry comes to the point that it's every man for himself and every fighting and deceiving each other. In technical matters, characterization and computerization deserves a word of congratulations. If they make a great job in the previous movie with the undead, now they surpassed it with the powerful and intimidating visual effect of the ""Flying Dutchman"" and its eternal crew.This film is, in my opinion, one of the best sequels I've seen so far, not only managing to maintain the continuity of the story, as becoming it more interesting, thanks to the evolution of characters, making clear the imminence of a third film also.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

oh how boring!,"I loved the first pirates of the Caribbean. So I was excited to see this one. This movie is not worth anyone's time. My friend and I went last night and well, I could have edited that beast much better than the editors. And I'm a computer geek. Even if a movie isn't great I can usually find something good.What happened to Johnny Depp? He seemed out of sorts and his character was really not very interesting. And certainly not very pirate like.Kera - beautiful but seemed unnecessary to this movie. Sure she's beautiful, but I didn't see the need for her.The octopus scenes were just stupid being repeated so many times. I hope the director and editors learn from some of the comments from the people here at IMDb.I fell asleep for a bit, which I never do in a movie. Geez too bad. The scenery was nice on the islands, and of course the leads are easy on the eyes... but man.

Did anyone else find this movie creepy?,"I absolutely loved the first POTC. Who didn't? But, this one disappointed me, a lot. I was looking forward to it for over a year. I went into the theater, expectations high, a full house. I came out, sick to my stomach. The storyline was great, but the darkness of this film left me with a sick stomach. Davy Jones looked good, but his evil character was too over the top. The scenes on Davy Jones' boat were gross, with all the sea creature humans doing hard labor and getting whipped. The opening scene with Jack Sparrow was also quite troubling, at the Pirate Prison. Seeing men being tortured, eaten by crows, and dragged off screaming is not my cup of tea when I'm expecting a fun-filled Pirates Of The Caribbean adventure. Jack Sparrow leaves you feeling unsatisfied with his wit, when you compare it to the first movie. The good thing, however, is that the ending leaves you with a hope of the next movie being much, much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a wonderful film,I loved this movie. The humor and action in it was great..not to mention some scenes that were completely unexpected. I'm not a sequel fan but in this instance I think that the second was quite possibly better than the first. I am looking forward to the third installment of this film and am hoping it is as entertaining as the first two.Pirate movies as far as they go usually don't do so well but this one actually has been fun to watch. The characters are amusing...go Jack go.. as well as believable.I don't recommend it for younger children as some of the scenes can be a bit scary for them. I feel it's a refreshing switch from what normally comes out in the theater these days.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Glad to see Sparrow back in action,"Didn't bother seeing this when it was out at the cinema as I knew I would buy it on DVD anyway. Was fun to see the characters back in action against a new enemy ( a big sea creature amongst many other horrors from the deep). Was saddened that Barbosa wasn't in this one. I enjoyed it but I did not rate this as high as the first. All the way through the film (and I hope I was the only one), I got the sense of seen it before. I actually could easily go to make dinner and come back to find I hadn't missed much. Two of the characters are actually starting to annoy me. Miss Swan and William Turner. Try hard was all I could think of. The film did have some nice touches but the sense of adventure was pretty much lost when you could predict what was going to happen. Nice touches being the excellent CGI (the sea captain, I could even tell who was acting it). Some excellent stunts and huge ship fights didn't fail to disappoint. Still I'm looking forward to the next film, and who wouldn't. It's like Harry Potter. You might begin to hate but you cannot stop once you've started!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great sequel!,"The movie keeps the good quality of the first movie and introduces us to a new story, very well linked to what we saw in the first movie. The development of the characters continue, the new challenges are intriguing, introducing new, complex characters such as the villain. Again the story surprises in many moments, in my opinion, it's not a predictable movie. The interactions between the characters, the environment, the soundtrack and the story are very good. This movie mixes elements of comedy, adventure and romance greatly. An awesome title for an awesome franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Underrated Gem,"The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, built upon premises set in the first film, is not a a continuation of the old story, but it sets out to tell a new one. Oftentimes, in the lore of adventure fantasy films, such a trait is met with disappointment. But not so with this one; Dead Man's Chest is a captivating, alluring and, coming out of the slightly fairly-tale air of its predecessor, pleasantly dark. The darkness issues from failed love, a man's inner torments which he wants to inflict upon others, and the visual gloom of the great ghost ship. Captain Jack Sparrow is as full of his paradoxical wits as ever. He is in his primes. We come to meet some of the aspects of his ""truer"" self which were too elaborate for the first film. Overall a tour de force of computer graphics and its manipulation to tell a human tale. Director Gore Verbinsky is masterful in telling his magical dark story. And without saying something about the soundtrack, all of this would be vain: the wrathful organ playing of Davy Jones is, in my opinion at least, one of the greatest pieces ever composed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolute Brilliant Film Making,"My only complaint for this and all the Pirates of the Caribbean films is that Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is not on screen as often as one desires. As soon as he is not seen the narrative drops and is comprised of linking narrative so how this franchise expects to make a sequel without him is beyond me, he lights up the screen.However back to this film, it is full of CGI that actually stands the test of time. For instance many of the actors performed in grey training type pyjama suits with only their voices and motions used in the final film, even their eyes are CGI. You would never guess this even in 4K, so the film stands the test of time, and then some.Whilst firmly based in the authentic history of the time in terms of the weapons, clothing, choice of drink etc it is full of imagination so whilst the mythology rings true it is more from the Disney writers playbook than history. And who cares, take it for what is: a great romp of a story, wonderful acting, humour, slapstick and some fantastic old swashbuckling pirates. And who says we need a new female captain the we have always had Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly).Compared to more recent films, this film is simply brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disney...Dream World!,"I was talking to a friend today, about Disney's Theme Parks. About how beautiful they are and about how everything feels like a dream when you visit them. I think it's almost the same with Disney's films: the sensation that everything is a long colorful dream or, and I don't say it to underestimate the films' quality; a long and entertaining Disney ride.In ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", as in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", you realize that every scene is done in an arranged set, where, sooner or later, every element present, will become something useful for the scene's development; because it is all carefully thought before. Whether the element will work as something that will explode or fall down it doesn't matter; the point is that everything is alive.With this lively environment, ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow and his crew into the sea again. This time there is now Geoffrey Rush, but a new villain called Davy Jones, played wonderfully by Bill Nighy. The storyline follows the events of the first movie but what's slightly negative is that you will not understand everything correctly if you haven't seen ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".The 'Pirate's' writers give too much credit to their audience (and I wonder why they shouldn't, 'Pirates' being such a high-grossing film), expecting them to keep up immediately. This, for the general public is problematic, because usually sequels find a way for the viewer to understand what has happened before, in case they weren't able to watch the first installment. It doesn't occur that way in ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.Personally, I find the writer's decision risky and I like it so I don't mind; mainly, because the script is so well written and the connections with the first picture are intelligently placed in it. This trilogy has been blessed with incredible writers, capable of generating humor, adventure and drama not only for the children, also for the adults.This is worth analyzing: Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the writers, are responsible for ""Shrek"", the best Dreamworks' computer animated film and one that finds the balance between kids and grown ups, with something for each. They're responsible for ""The Road to El Dorado"", one of my favorite animated films and Dreamwork's best film in 2-D animation. Finally, they crafted the script of ""The Treasure Planet"", one of the few good Disney animated films after the change of working team; where they also found the balance I mentioned above.The trilogy has also been blessed with incredible actors. Johnny Depp reprising the one and only Captain Sparrow, disappearing in the role and owning the film as is his custom. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth comes back and, although not as important as in the first movie, she makes the character look more real, with fewer make up and more dirt in her face; showing that she's not a 'princess' and that she is a woman with determination; I'm looking forward to the final growth of Knightley's character. And Orlando Bloom, maybe not as incredible at the rest, but accompanied by an incredible cast.Lastly, the trilogy is been blessed with a gifted director: Gore Verbinsky; who was chosen for the franchise after having made only a couple of films. Completely different in genre, the comedy ""Mousehunt"" and the horror remake ""The Ring"" were both equally complex to direct. Verbinsky took the risk and didn't fail Bruckheimer with 'Pirates'. He's also widened his versatility by directing the arty ""The Weather Man"".Going back to my main point, you can take ""Dead Man's Chest"" as a long colorful dream or a long and entertaining Disney ride. Whatever the case, one thing is certain; it is entertainment for all the family. Oh, I almost forgot: Hans Zimmer is a genius.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Avoid this one like scurvy,"I simply can't see how this movie is averaging a 7.7. OK, it's probably better than a 1, since gems like Manos Hands of Fate are getting around 2, but I had to drop the average score a little bit. There is no way this movie is above a 5 on any scale. I was a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, and I love Disneyland - this one just failed to capture the swashbuckling and fun that the first one did. It just kind of dragged on for me to the point where I was ready to leave.First off, the pacing and storytelling are just plain awful. There are entire 30-40 minute scenes of the movie that could have been deleted and there would be no effect on the coherency of the movie. Maybe they were there just to show how cool Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were - but I didn't buy it. There are at least 5 different story lines, not one of which is really explained in any detail. There are also so many unexplained parts to the movie that you just wind up giving up and getting frustrated with it.Maybe I'm just jaded, but I couldn't find any suspense in this thing either. The focus is haphazard and you wind up not getting a feel for any of the characters. Johnny Depp, while a cool actor and character, I thought his character had no redeeming qualities about him.The other characters are pretty forgettable, and the performances are mediocre. The relationships between the characters were rushed and superficial.I didn't find myself connecting with anyone at all, and I didn't feel the characters connected with each other on screen either.This movie is total flash with about zero substance. If you love special effects and can overlook good character development, plot lines, and emotional development, this is the movie for you. For me, that's fine for an hour or hour and a half, but 2 and 1/2 hours is asking too much if you're above the age of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A step in the right direction,"I had high hopes for the first one, but those hopes were drastically lowered of what was only a mediocre film. I had quite high hopes for this one as well, but tried my best to not expect to much. And thus I got almost exactly what I expected. This is a entertaining piece, fast, loud (not to loud, just right) and with some outstanding special effects (they are really, really great actually).I would seem this film had big potential for a higher score from my part, but unfortunately it plays it safe (as custom is in formula-A-feature film these days). What raises the grade from an average (5-6) is the marvelous performance of Johnny Depp and the improved (not yet perfected thought) performance of the other lead actors. Also the very nice, and progressively enhanced CGI helps the grade. This film contains more humor, which in my book never is a bad ingredient if done in a proper way, as here is.What lowers the grade is the safe-play, as mentioned. And I just can't give to much credit to a producer with dollar-signs in each eye (he himself a modern pirate, but less entertaining and more self-denying).So all in all, a mediocre film, with some shining details and fewer flaws then it's previous installment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as good as the first, BUT...","When I first saw this in the theater I was horribly disappointed. And while I still can't understand how anyone would prefer this to the original film, repeated viewings have caused this entry to grow on me considerably.My biggest problem is still that they spent so much time repeating jokes and situations from the first film instead of delivering something new. In fact, it's all the ties to COTBP that really hurt this one. They had an opportunity to tell any number of amazing stories in this world. The way that the Indiana Jones series took the same character and supporting cast and dropped them in the middle of a brand new adventure each time out. Same people. Different story. I really thought that's what this franchise would end up being like. And even on the writer's commentary they acknowledge that this was an option but instead decided to try and unify the movies and turn it into a trilogy where each one was strongly connected to the others. I think this was a mistake. Soooo much time is spent finding excuses to get the characters back together and keep them tied into each others stories. And perhaps if it had seemed more effortless this would have been okay. But it feels like they're grabbing at straws and relying on your love for the first one. But nothing in this film is as clever, funny, or awe inspiring as COTBP.But it's certainly not a total failure either. The cannibal island sequence, while having nothing to do with the overall plot, is an amazing piece of film-making. The stunt work there is just phenomenal. And it's the perfect balance of humor and breathtaking action. I believe it's the strongest chunk of the film. Which is odd considering it does little to move the plot along. I also love the three way sword fight near the climax. I've heard complaints that it goes on too long but I was too enthralled to notice. I thought it was expertly devised and executed. These two moments made it feel as if I were watching something I'd never seen in a movie before.But the exposition scenes seems endless and it hinders character development because so much time is spent talking about what's happening. And then talking about it some more. And some more. And then some more. And then when the characters are given new places to go it just feels off. The biggest offense being Elizabeth's sudden attraction to Jack. Their dynamic in the first film was perfect: him thinking she was hopelessly in love with him and her being completely repulsed by him. It seemed like a lame attempt at a love triangle. And while the commentary did clear up their intentions a little bit, I still feel this was a mistake. I just never bought into it.I was secretly hoping they'd shy away from the supernatural stuff this time out. In the original, aside from the curse itself, it felt as if this was all taking place in a some kind of real world. In this one that's impossible. This is like a whole other universe. While I dig Bill Nighy as Davy Jones (and WOW is that CGI incredible) I don't think he holds a candle to Barbossa. And with Barbossa's crew we had unique characters with their own personalities and not just cardboard cut out villains who are pretty much indistinguishable from one another like Jones' crew. And the whole thing with the Kraken just felt like it belonged in some other movie. That was really pushing the supernatural elements. At least for my taste.There's still A LOT to like about the movie, but like I said... I don't think it comes close to the original. It's too bloated, overly-complicated, and shamelessly steals most of its humor from COTBP. I hope At World's End fares better. But I still wish they'd concentrated on making stand alone films instead of relentlessly winking at the audience with in jokes to the original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"As usual, very good film, but not as good as the first one!""","I've seen this film, on the first day it runs in the cinemas. Obviously it is one of these films, which is a worthy sequel of the first PoC! Although it doesn't have the charm of the first film, it is a superb film. The film is exciting and the jokes are felicitous. Although the film is very long (150 minutes), you are never bored of it. The only thing, which is a little thing bothering is the ending. This review is NO SPOILER. I don't tell you the end, but it is open. And the open and is so open, like the ending of a season you see in series. So you MUST see the third PoC, and I think if you want to see the third part of PoC, you MUST see the second part. But no worry, when the third part plays in the cinemas you have definitely the chance to see a triple feature in the cinemas like the matrix or lord of the rings features. :-) What are the odds! But all in all the (half) film is a very good film, i think you don't regret it, if you go in the cinema to watch it. And Johnny Depp and the rest of the crew is excellent. Also the special effects are superb. And if you haven't seen the first PoC, shame on you. Now go to your video store, rent a the first PoC and in the evening go in the cinema to look the second part. And then wait one year and pray that the third part is as good as the others and much more important pray it has an end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Adventurous and fun!,"I really liked the 3 way duel at the end and the special effects of Davy Jones and his crew/ship.

Refreshing adventure,"Recently I have been lamenting the lack of quality adventure films in the vein of Back to the Future and Indiana Jones; I feel the Pirates series satiates my cravings. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is known for over-the-top movies that defy belief so much it's distracting to the story, but perhaps director Gore Verbinski has toned him down a bit. Pirates is still over-the-top excitement, but it really doesn't distract from the storytelling the team of writers maintain.This installment of the Pirates trilogy pits the Keith Richards inspired Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed skillfully by Johnny Depp, against the under-worldly Captain Davy Jones. I'm not sure what went on in developing the final two chapters, but Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, end up in the adventure somewhat as an aside - Dead Man's Chest is really Jack Sparrow's movie. I could go into the story, but it seems pointless, the story is linear and the characters seem to develop almost forcefully. There are detours in the film that seem to only exist for spectacular adventure and could easily have been cut from the movie, especially when it ends at over 2 and a half hours in length. The cannibal island act didn't do anything for the story except to bring together four characters from the previous film. It seems like they couldn't figure out how to get these people in the story any other way. Honestly, the characters all come from different places and all end up on the same island together just to be chased about by cannibal tribes-people (some of which looked like Irishmen). Some of the characters were introduced in this film seemingly for no reason, but our main characters seem to be quiet fond of them.Besides some weak elements, as mentioned, everything was amazing. The story drew you into it with compelling drama, suspense and adventure. The action was exciting and big (true to Bruckheimer's pedigree). The vistas were amazing; filmed on location in the Bahamas. The most impressive part of it all was the innovative, cutting-edge CGI effects. It is amazing to see how far computer generated images have come over the years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If nothing else, a movie worth the $7.50 ticket price.","Before I post my mild criticism, know that I am not a huge Pirates of the Caribbean fan. I saw the first movie, enjoyed it and then saw this. If you are an avid fan of Pirates, this is probably a sequel that will satisfy your craving. From someone who is just a regular viewer it was at least a fun movie to see once in the theater if never again. The only thing that really sort of wore me out was the constant unrealistic action that rivaled that of the Die Hard movies. For me at least it seemed like they tossed in sword fight here and there whenever they felt filling up time was necessary. That, and the 2 hours and 40 minutes of that particular content made me a bit restless in my seat. However if you are an advocate of Pirates of the Caribbean or you are a family looking to have a night out or movie viewing, this movie may be perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great Movie... Crappy Ending,"I loved the movie until about 2 minutes before the end. Over all pretty funny, and I did scream like a little girl once! I think it was special effect wise better than the first one. And much funnier than the first one. But I thought it left a lot of questions unanswered and forgot to fully explain new characters. So, you're watching scenes between these 2 or 3 people who are supposed to have some kind of meaningful past, but you don't know what type of relationship they had. So, you spend time trying to figure out what type or relationship it was instead of listening to the dialog they're having.

a lovely transitional story,"It is an enjoyable movie to be sure, but cannot compare to the first. Dead Man's Chest is a typical sequel; clichéd. It alternates between being funny and irritating. The plot lacked substance and draaaagged like you wouldn't believe. The characters sometimes overdid their roles, but this is expected of a sequel. The movie was one action sequence after another and never reached a climax. Furthermore, everything about the movie was just so.. convenient. For example, a character would conveniently show up at the most opportune moment, even when said arrival defies logic and possibility. The film is incapable of standing up on its own. Fortunately, it doesn't have to. This film is buildup to the third, and in that respect Dead Man's Chest was highly successful, leaving the viewer anxious for a third installment which by the looks of it is GOING TO BE AWESOME.All in all, I did enjoy the movie. It was nice seeing ALL the characters back at it and the ending, predictable though it may be, is wicked. Or at least it made me VERY happy, and I was about to be disappointed in the flick. So despite all the film's VAST shortcomings, it's a decided 'must-see'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not as great as first film but still enjoyable,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006, Dir. Gore Verbinski)After preventing the capture of a certain Jack Sparrow, both Elizabeth Swan and her fiancée Will Turner are arrested and sentenced to death. But Cutler Beckett has other plans, and sends Turner out to retrieve Jack's compass. This isn't easy for Turner, as he must now help Sparrow track down the Dead Man's Chest, which contains the beating heart of Davy Jones. Stabbing the heart, would not just destroy Jones but also set free Turner's father, Bootstrap Bill. The mission becomes even more difficult for everyone when Elizabeth escapes and tracks down Sparrow.The first Pirates movie was an enjoyable film. The sequel is not as successful in terms of storytelling, but it is still both amazing and fun to watch. All the characters are back with the wonderful characteristics which made them legendary in the first movie. One of the additions to the trilogy is Davy Jones, played by Bill Nighy. This is once character which really needs to be looked at, when looking at how visual effects have improved. The character is just amazing in every way and looks so realistic. It could easily look like prophetic make up. The rest of the action and special effects are impressive with some cool looking sword fights happening.

"Interesting, exciting and funny..",The plot is very interesting. Depp and Knightley put in the right amount of humour besides their flawless contribution as two of the main characters in the story.

The brief on-screen presence of Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma is brilliant and refreshing.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent sequel,"(more of a 7.5 but they don't have that on the rater) The gang is back and faces adventure with loads of characters, story lines, action, and pound of fun. The special effects are stunning (I wish I could've seen it in theaters), and Johnny Depp is as fun to watch as ever. A couple of plot holes don't take from the excitement each scene has to deliver. It is also very funny at times and has a couple dramatic moments as well. It may get a tad overwhelming at times with everything it has got going on, but fortunatley that also makes its two and a half hour running time flow by. It doesn't exactly captivate you as much as the first one did, but it adds the cherry to the sundae with an excellent, semi-cliffhanger ending that gets you twitching for the third enstallment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Twenty Minutes of Movie in Two and a Half Hours,"The first movie was great, a good balance of comedy and gags with a great and suspenseful story line. This one not so much. THe plot for the entire movie could have been adequately told in a twenty minute movie, complete with fun action scenes and effects. Instead they extended every action scene far, far, beyond what it should've been, resulting in the gags getting old and boring, and spread the story out over far too much movie. After a while of this I found myself constantly wondering when the current scene was about to end, and eventually just wanting the whole damn movie to be over.The one thing about this movie I found anything approaching good was the effects. The effects teams did wonderful jobs and deserve their due.In the end though, none of this matters. The fan-boys and girls of Depp and the Pirates franchise will ogle over it and things it's great, the rest of us who enjoy more than mindless action scenes will find it dull and forgettable.Here's to hoping the third is better.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Super fun, not quite as tight as the first","I think this is closely as good as the first one, but maybe not quite as tight a complete story as the first, although surpassing the first in many aspects such as the fun level, especially the escapade when everyone is fighting over the chest on the island with the giant wheel.It's certainly a lot better than the third movie in the trilogy imo, though the cracks were starting to show slightly in Dead Man's Chest in some scenes which felt overly contrived and bloated.I give Black Pearl a 10/10, and give this second film of the trilogy a 9.5/10, with the caveat that these two movies are my kind of movie, the swashbuckling adventure with comedy and superb acting chemistry with characters that we genuinely feel invested in and care about.With all that said, I have watched Black Pearl way more times than I've watched Dead Man's Chest.Anyway, superb movie, sad that Hollywood has forgotten how to make these kind of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very good summer entertainment - but left me somehow unsatisfied.,"This is very good summer entertainment. I laughed, I cringed and I was so very glad to see Cap't Jack and crew back on the big screen. I disagree with those that found the plot had too many twists and was confusing. Neither I nor my 8, 11, and 13 year-old sons had any problem following the story. We all loved the action sequences and enjoyed the jokes that allude back to the first movie. I can honestly say that we were all entertained throughout.It's just that the first movie was very character driven - yes, I know it had tons of good special effects - but, it was the characters, their development and relationships, that formed the connection between the audience and the movie. This movie, with its action and special effects, is a little like having a really sweet, chocolate desert for dinner. While you enjoy it and relish every bite, when you are finished there's just a vague sense of being left unsatisfied.... of wishing your meal had had a little more substance, a little less fluff. Still this movie was great fun and I'm looking forward to seeing the third movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disney does Empire Strikes Back,"After coming out of this film, I felt a little somewhat disappointed at first, feeling that maybe some of the magic that made the first such a sleeper hit, was gone as everyone involved knew that this one would be an instant smash this time around. By the end credits I thought my fears of the next two pirate films doing a matrix 2&3 and being lesser than the first one, but after thinking about it more and more, the better it became. All the humour of the first was there, as were the characters (not overplayed at all) it was just more of the same. The film is certainly a lot darker and more serious in this one(not sure if we need to see an eye being pecked out...bit much for a 12a),with the villains being a lot more threatening in their behaviour. It was beautifully shot (opening shots in the rain, amazing) and the wheel chase was great, some cgi was iffy in places (davy Jones, could swear is real, kraken...haha, where's the blue screen) but as a whole it's wonderful stuff. As with the first, Depp steals the show while Bloom and Knightly look pretty. it was my girlfriend who made the comparison to Empire, so the credit's all hers, (you'll know what I mean once you've seen it and have seen the original star wars trilogy) the film is dark, and you definitely want to know what happens next.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"The second film in a series is in a tough spot seeing how the plot must progress but not close unless the series is episodic (i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street, Star Trek). However, POC's intention is to make three films the last two of which had to be connected to complete the adventure and resolve the characters. So, they're big challenge is to provide enough story and interest to not only entertain people with the second film, but carry their interest over into a third film.A point of potential story hazard is that POC 2 opens with some time passed between the first film and this gap has to be filled. Unless it is a film such as LOTR: Two Towers, which picks up exactly where the Fellowship left off. So, re-establish the characters and progress the story without being clumsy or losing people's attention within that period of lost time that exists outside the frame of the film. POC 2 does this effectively. The opening of the film not only establishes all the major characters and new ones, but it introduces a sustaining conflict that connects the sequel to the first film. Sure, the connection is a bit sparse and maybe not as strong as one could hope, but is nonetheless strong enough to push into the adventure. It's the consistency of this initial conflict that provides insight into the new character's motivations later. Although, the character in question becomes slightly too movie villain-ish and doesn't show any higher purpose other than greed. I often find this to be a constant in sequel villains, with the exception of Empire Strikes Back and Spider-Man 2. Villains are often given fewer dimensions than their predecessors which only hurt the viewer's involvement with the major struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. A good villain not only has reason, but also possesses moral and ethical attributes that lend sympathy to the character and make the actions of a villain not justified, but understood. POC 2 lacks this character. The opposition in the film is constantly doing wrong without an indication as to the reasons why from any human perspective. For example, the villain in Serenity does wrong to build a better world and has a strong sense of purpose in what he is doing and why it all has to be done. In Titus Andronicus, Queen Tamora swears to avenge the death of her son by General Titus's hand in the opening of the play. It is in that moment the audience is shown a relentless and pious Titus perform a cruel ritual to appease his Gods; in contrast to a rational and compassionate Tamora pleading for logic and apathy to prevail and her sons life to be spared. Throughout the play the characters trade place before arriving at neutral place, where both do not see humanity, but vengeance alone. Now, with that said I am not comparing Titus to Pirates of the Caribbean, but am suggesting that if we have something to learn from Shakespeare it is the dire need for a layered antagonist that views themselves as just in spite of everything around them. This is what POC 2 lacks, a villain with a true arch that shows the audience a duality they can diffuse in themselves. This shortcoming doesn't make the movie less enjoyable from a shallow entertaining, novelty aspect. It simply displaces the depth of the story in combination with the adventure. The villains are still grandiose, larger than life and nasty. They just lack the sympathy of even Captain Barbossa from the first film.The next pitfall in sequels is characters and their arch. Is a character starting from one point and shifting enough for the audience to see the difference. POC 2 indeed does this successfully and even embellishes a few hero moments for the core characters. All with the exception of the Elizabeth character which has grown from the pretty trollop of the first film that was merely a place marker for male lust to be projected; into a peer and fighting colleague of the boys, but at points, is still the trollop. The objection I have with the Elizabeth character is that she doesn't evolve consistently from the start of the movie. She actually regresses to the spoiled Governor's daughter that was introduced in the first film, just in a different gaze. Aside from some inevitable character embellishment Johnny Depp is poignant and engaging as Captain Jack Sparrow. Bloom is predictable and sympathetic, hits the few comedic moments he has quite well. Stellan Skarsgård is watch able under any amount of makeup. Jack Davenport (Norrington) is just as good, but his character isn't fully fleshed out, especially since the character was left on a sympathetic note at the end of the first film. I am not sure I understood the logic of his arch, but was watchable and earned more screen time in this film.All in all the film was really quite entertaining and fun despite its few embellished character and cliché moments. The climax of this film actually left me quite curious about the next film. If not for just the movie, then for some more of Depp's brilliant characterizations of his rock star Pirate. Plus the action scenes were really engaging and well thought out and only added more to the story rather than hindering it. This is even rarer these days. In a storm of trilogies and movie serials POC might hold to be one of the better ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A disappointing sequel,"After being sentenced to death together with his fiancé, right on their wedding day, Will is left with only one option. He must seek the Captain Jack Sparrow whose compass points the way to a notorious dead man's chest. Not long after, they find themselves running from a bunch of undead pirates and a mythical creature known as the Kraken.We follow the adventures of the protagonists of the first installment as they must face once again a couple of supernatural creatures in order to achieve their goal. Once again, old tales will come to life and our heroes will have to do what it takes to make things right, at least for them.To start with the beginning, we have the same main characters as in the previous movie, but less developed and apparently, less involved in the outcome. Thus, you don't get to care so much about their fate, making the actions somewhat pointless. To make matters worse, the part which made the whole adventure a real treat, which is the comedy, somehow faded into the fog. It wasn't as present, as funny or as intelligent as it was before. They somehow expected it to be funny out of the box, through stupidity, irony or basic gags.Fortunately, the visual part is very good, doing its job well in animating the story. Speaking of which, following the trend of the other features, it lacks substance, depth or some sort of spark that might make it a bit less linear than it is. If its predecessor required a bit of polish in terms of storytelling, this one definitely required plenty more attention which it didn't quite receive.Overall, what you get is a big downgrade in terms of amusement, thrill or suspense. It's kind of predictable and it seems to not put much effort in maintaining the quality of its predecessor.

Some Treasures Shouldn't Be Buried,"This is one of those treasures.I went into this movie with lots of expectation thanks to the the first installment of the trilogy being so amazing. The problem with expectation is that it is easily disappointed. That's why it's that much more amazing that this movie surpassed my high expectation.Once again, the story is fantastically written. I was held captive in my seat throughout the entirety of the movie. And the ending was so compelling that I wish the third movie came out tomorrow.The creatures were kind of weird bringing this trilogy even more into the fantastical realm, but due to the quality of the storyline and how well they fit with the plot, I couldn't imagine the movie without them. This was the one thing I was unsure about in the previews.The acting was excellent also. This cast was so well chosen.Some people have complained about the lack of ending in this movie. However, like any other good trilogy (i.e. Lord of the Rings) the second movie shouldn't have an ending. A trilogy is best done when one story is spread out over multiple movies. This is what makes it a trilogy and not just three separate movies which share a similar name. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is best when seen in conjunction with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. That's what makes it good. The first Pirates can stand alone as there was an ending of sorts. In the second one, they've done a good job of connecting it with the first one. Still, once the third one comes out, everyone will be happy that they did the second one as they did. It's tough to rate a trilogy when you haven't seen all 3 parts. People tried to do that with X-Men. It had a good first movie and amazing second movie. The problem is that the second movie was so good, the third one seemed bad in comparison. They made the mistake of climaxing in the second installment. The third movie should always be the best in a trilogy and the second the ""worst"" or else it just won't work. If At World's End is amazing, everyone will speak of how amazing the trilogy is and no one will complain about Dead Man's Chest.Then only question which remains is will the third live up to the hype due to the amazing quality of the first two.

"A letdown from the first, but still pretty fun.","It's very rare that we see a sequel surpass it's original, and Dead Man's Chest is no exception. The original is fresh, inventive, utterly hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of all time. This go around is stale, tedious and blends between overly cheesy and simply odd. However for all of it's flaws, it remains a massively entertaining piece of Grade A blockbuster action. Johnny Depp provides another wildly outrageous and charismatically riveting performance, but the rest of the cast ranges from dry and repetitive, yet still insanely beautiful (Knightley) to some of the worst I've ever seen (Bloom, of course). The story is completely insignificant and wildly convoluted. Jack owes a debt to Davey Jones. Something about a beastie. Sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth. Just ridiculous reasons to keep letting Johnny be eccentric and hilarious, to provide some perfectly amazing action that is among the most entertaining I've ever seen and, ultimately, to bring in more money. Despite all of the flaws and repetitiveness of the film, the beauty of watching Johnny Gone Wild and the massive quality of entertainment that the film contains makes it completely worthwhile in my eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Little Too Long; Plot Needs Tightening,"If The Curse of the Black Pearl is a good guidebook for how to turn a Disney ride into a fantastic film, Dead Man's Chest is a half-assed guidebook on how to follow it up.The second film in the franchise lives exclusively in the shadow of its predecessor, but that doesn't necessarily make it a ""bad"" film, as my overall rating makes very clear.Pirates 2 has a much stronger focus on dialogue and character development than the original which, in many cases, is done quite well. With a long-running franchise, character and plot development are key components, however this film remains so focused on the characters themselves that it greatly impacts the pacing of the film. There are moments that cause this film to be a bit of a slog, feeling far too long than absolutely necessary. Again, however, that doesn't make it a ""bad"" film, because in this particular case, the positives do far outweigh the negatives.The action sequences are fantastic, as expected. The CGI holds up relatively well with the age of the film. Johnny Depp once again shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, in a role that felt criminally reduced in this film - that is to say, there are many moments in the film that could benefit from more Jack Sparrow action, wit and sarcasm. This film focuses more on Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann. Granted, they were a central part of the original film as well, but it feels like this film focuses a little bit too heavily on their story and neglects some of the elements that made the first film so fantastic. Another great performance was Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, a menacing (if rather one-dimensional) villain. His scenes provided fantastic acting, but ultimately lacked a lot of the depth that I, as a viewer, enjoy.This film would easily be a 10/10 for me if it were about 30 minutes shorter. All too often, action and adventure films neglect to follow the quality-over-quantity formula when it comes to runtimes.Ultimately, the film was still an enjoyable enough experience, neglecting the dragging moments that, one can only hope, will rise to relevance in the subsequent sequels. It was far from the highlight of the franchise, already falling behind The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the film offered enough of substance to warrant continuing rather than skipping entirely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not quite up to par with the first, however a great film!","Alright, the first movie was awesome! It brought back to life what Disney can do for family viewing. Growing up in the days of ol' time movies being rerun on the Disney Channel, I grew to love Disney very much. With classics like Old Yeller, Summer Magic, Swiss Family Robbinson and the like, I loved family type movies with no gross nudity, a story line that is not only enchanting, but also engrossing and will keep you on your toes.Now, with the second ""Pirate's"" movie of the trilogy having just come out on DVD today, I just had to go out and rent it. (My husband though had the ending ruined for him when his manager accidentally told him what happens just a mere three days before it's release.) So, I got to the store to ensure that we got a copy (no problem there, still over 60 copies when I left--with 200 for Miami Vice gathering dust, ha!) I rushed home, the excitement on his face! We put it on as soon as our PS2 stopped being a punk and started playing, and with many ""shhhs!"" to our 4 year old, we were able to watch the movie.We loved the first movie. We thought it was funny, greatly casted and even to this day we spout many of our favorite lines from the movie. ""Why's the rum gone?"" The sequel however falls short slightly. Don't get me wrong, we both really really liked it. Some of the fight scenes were just awesome; choreographed perfectly, the visual effects up to par with other great films as Titanic (think of the switchover of the ship from Rose's retelling and then the shots of it underwater) and the Matrix trilogy.However, even though the film is supposed to leave you knowing there's a third coming, it seemed short. Yes, it's 150 minutes long, but the story dragged at times so when you got to the ending, you were hopping it would continue. I guess they wanted that so you can't wait for the 3rd and rush out and see it.

A Very Different Pirate,"This can be compared to The Empire Strikes back, it is a lot darker, sinister and scary than the first one, and where this worked with Star Wars, I believe it is Dead Man's Chest's downfall. This is more like Matrix Reloaded than Empire Strikes Back.Now I cannot stress enough that Dead Man's Chest is NOT a bad movie. It is just a very different film to the original, however, there are quite a few problems. The first being the characters. Far too many pointless characters returned from the original, and although it is nice to see them, there are no where near enough new characters for us to get to know. All of Jack's crew are those from the original, no new pirates, apart from the enemies.Davey Jones is no where near as good an enemy as Barbossa, there does not seem to be much point in him, not many explanations as to why he is the way he is, he just happens to be there, and wants Captain's Jack's soul. At least Barbossa had a purpose and a goal. There are also very few scenes between Sparrow and Jones, making the whole chase seem a lot less personal.There are also far too many jokes related to the original. No new material, such as a joke referring to Jack always being slapped by women, the dog with the keys and strapping sea turtles to their legs. Some new jokes would have been nice, although it is nice to be reminded of The Curse of the Black Pearl.Those are the bad points, but it is still a good film. There are some amazing sequences, such as an amazing watermill based sword-fight and a hilarious chase between Captain Jack and a group of cannibals. It is a good action film, but not quite the fun fest of the original.But...with an amazing ending scene, and plenty set up for the third movie, perhaps all these problems will be nearly ironed out by the end of the trilogy. Let's hope. A good film, but if this was the first film, it would not have been well received.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Far from a treasure but it's not quite dead.,"From the very first sequel, the pirates franchise lost its freshness and became formulaic crowd pleaser.It's all there: rich set pieces, actioneer humour, fun character exchanges, some CGI creepiness and generally badassdom but it doesn't take the story or characters anywhere it needed (or even wanted) to go.It's just another blockbuster, which isn't a bad thing at all if you want that but the thing I remember most from going to see this as a kid was some pretty numb buttocks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Almost as good as the first film,"Like the first film, this second film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was both funny and entertaining.In this second film, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Bloom and Knightley) have been sentenced to death for their part in assisting with the escape of a felon - namely Jack Sparrow. As a sort of 'plea bargain' Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander)informs Will that he will give Elizabeth and Will a pardon if he is able to recover Jack Sparrow's compass. When Will tells Jack that he wants his compass to give to Lord Beckett in order to get a pardon for him and Elizabeth, Jack agrees but only if Will gets him the key for Davy Jones's locker. Jack wants to get to this locker as he believes that it will bestow untold benefits for the person who unlocks this locker. However, Jack isn't the only one who is interested in what's in Davy Jones's locker. There are several parties who are desperate to get their hands on the key for the locker and each person/party has their own reasons for desperately wanting to 'unlock' the locker - but who will get there first? There is no doubt that this is a more than satisfactory entry into the franchise. All the elements from the first film are very much present -there is humour, great effects, the story was good once again and the cinematography was also fantastic. Johnny Depp once again stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow - he had me in stitches at times (sometimes without evening saying anything). His mannerisms alone made me laugh.There are a couple of minor negatives to this entry in the POTC franchises; Firstly, there were a couple of times when the film seemed to drag and there was the odd occasion when it got a tad boring (something that definitely couldn't be said about the first film). Secondly, Davy Jones just wasn't a particularly good villain (Captain Barbossa was fantastic in the first film and seemed to have a bit of character). I just didn't feel the same way about Davy Jones, for me he was a pretty forgettable villain). There were a couple of scenes that were completely ridiculous (sword fighting on a rolling wheel & Sparrow pole vaulting head first between two cliffs) but to be honest those scenes were so funny that I really didn't care about how silly they were as I was too busy laughing to care.Overall then this film is still entertaining and the acting was good by all involved - but the lack of a good villain and a couple of boring moments in the middle of the film let it down slightly. If you're a fan of the first film, then you'll enjoy this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"fun, adventure, and these kind of things","Now, the Captain Jack Sparrow seems to have a problem with John Davey, the lord of the Oceans, captain of the legendary Flying Dutchman. In order to avoid it, he spills Will and Elizabeth wedding and takes him to another adventure. Meanwhile, they will have to fight the forces of Beckett, the general of the English army that tries to erradicate the pirates of the sea. More empty of depth than the first, but funnier and with more adventures and spectacular scenes. If you like the movies where you don't have to think and just sit and relax, this one is good. Anyway, the movie has nothing more than fireworks. Spectacular and enjoyable, the movie can result very entertaining (the 2 long hours it last become short while watching to it). It is just adventures in the old style, without pretending being more, and well, it is well done. It has lots of signaling that are important for the third part (they were filmed together) which can pass unseen unless you watch it as a whole. But well, just relax and take a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
everyone progresses... except for knightley,"i enjoyed this movie more than the first, mostly because the best thing in the first movie (johnny depp) is given more screen time. he continues to play with his character here with some very funny scenes indeed. i really hope they manage to get keith richards involved in the third one, as the pair on screen at the same time would be a hootwill is also far better in this movie, mostly because his relationship with his father gives him some emotional depththe worst thing about the first movie (knightley), luckily is in this movie the least. she gives us precisely the same pouting facial expressions as normal, and offers nothing new here at all. she is certainly given the opportunity to act... she has to pretend to be a boy for a good portion of the movie. but other than being flat chested she is not convincingi'm a little worried about how the 3rd movie is set up, as it looks like depp won't appear in it for some considerable time. so i would have preferred a different ending to this movie.as usual these days the movie is slightly too long, with some scenes that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. but overall i liked it a lot. some brilliantly choreographed action scenes... and i also loved the gnarled looking sea dwelling band of pirates (especially the hammer head one, great). go see it",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overly busy sequel with some high points,"Some people actually prefer this sequel to the original, although it is difficult to imagine why. The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is disrupted when a bloodthirsty corporate pipsqueak demands that they locate a compass in Captain Jack Sparrow's possession which he imagines will give him domain over the seas, while Jack finds himself forced to repay a debt to the ghastly Davy Jones - captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman - lest he become the latest ghoul addition to Jones' crew. One certainly cannot accuse the plot of sitting on its laurels...and that is the problem. The plot is overly busy and laden with unnecessary exposition which slows down the pace and allows the charm and fun from the original to wane. There are definitely comic highlights - such as a couple of madcap chases. The cast members are still in top form even when the screenplay fails to support them. Depp is chronically watchable in this role and nothing can change that fact. Jack Davenport gets more notes to play this time around as down-on-his-luck Norrington and Naomie Harris is a delightful addition as the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. Keira Knightley gets much more to do this time around and is fortunate enough to be thrown together with Depp. Orlando Bloom - who functioned as the heart of the original film - is saddled with a tiresome subplot, which finds him stuck for much of the film on the Flying Dutchman trying to ""rescue"" his father, played by a shell-shocked Stellan Skarsgard. It is a subplot that we cannot get behind and fails to have much impact. Similarly, the screenplay has characters that we should support betray each other repeatedly on a dime - including a late act development which is really hard to buy. Bill Nighy is visually impressive as the squid-like Davy Jones, but neither he nor sniveling Tom Hollander as the corporate stooge resonate with the viewer as strongly as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. The final moments set up the next installment and offer a glimmer that it may surpass this effort.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was okay,"It was all right, but I was a little disappointed. I think the first one was much better. But overall, the second one was pretty good. It had a killer of an ending though! I thought Johnny Depp was fabulous in both movies, but I thought he was a little funnier in this one. I love how he's always acting like he's drunk.....he's top notch! Orlando Bloom was actually very good in this movie! I like his acting a lot, and he actually has some facial expression! Yippee! I didn't really like Kiera Knightley's performance in this one. I don't know why, but she just seemed like a spoiled brat to me. I love Ragetti and Pintel! (played by Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenburg) They are so funny! I can't wait for the third! It will be great!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Less personality and more focused adventuring makes for a tighter popcorn swashbuckler,"When version number two of the expected Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy came out it was near universally met by critics with dumbed-down groans, the usual lamenting done for a sequel that sells itself short on the personality and originality that thrived in the first place, and puts instead in it's place the over-bloated, inauthentic substitute for personality through mindless action sequencing, peppered with the franchise mentality of sameness, repetition, and reiteration. Not surprisingly, these critical warnings issued by our film protectors were amply ignored by the film-going public, making Dead Man's Chest the surprise top grossing movie of last season. For once I must admit the general public seemed to have gotten it right. Pirates II may not be as authentic, personal, or charming as it's predecessor, but in my experience it was a more fluid, well plotted, entertaining excursion out to sea. Whereas part one seemed to lack direction in it's script, gleefully bouncing around from one local to the next without doing much to justify the transition, Dead Man's Chest seems way more the traditional adventure these pirates were meant to have. I also have heard complaints in Johnny Depp's declining authenticity in the lead role of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, and must also scratch my head. While the lines that were written for him may have been layered on a little too thick, Depp almost seems to be more subdued in the role now, which helped take the focus off of his every drunken stumble and peculiar facial expression that the first concentrated on heavily, to a fault of the plot. Here, Sparrow and company seem to have a more clear cut purpose which helps viewers engage in the adventure all the more. While we are still dealing with essentially the same misadventures at sea (continuing right where the original ended), the arc here feels more like the big budget, high seas extravaganza the franchise wants to be. Of course the over-utilized Orlando Bloom does not help make things any easier on us, especially when asked to accept Mr. Bloom as the heroic savior certain scenes wish to implement, of which the boyish actor simply does not have the gravity to convey. Despite less focus being on the actual characters, helping to fill out the script are the budding moral conflicts arising in these main protagonists , giving the fun affair an extra shade of dimension not present in the original's straight-forward presentations. All in all, if you liked the original you should most likely enjoy the sequel. Where many have disappointingly pointed out the lack of personality and indulgence of set action pieces that Dead Man's Chest sinks to in place of authentic and rousing pirate personalities prominently portrayed in Curse of the Black Pearl, I would argue that POTC:DMC knew what it was even more then it's predecessor, and for that created a more cohesive, engaging adventure that does well to set up anticipation for it's forthcoming last round.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Terrific sequel,"In my eyes the third best Disney movie ever created only to Miracle and its predecessor The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's hard to make a sequel worthy of such an extraordinary work of art as the original ""Pirates"" was. However this movie more than does it. Everything about this movie is incredibly done. And I believe that if it were not in fact, a sequel, it would be considered even better. But don't look at this movie as a sequel, it's not really much of a follow up on the first movie except for some famous lines taken from it and a couple of cameos and familiar names that show up but I won't ruin any of the surprises. As always in this movie you never know where allegiance lies, that is why both movie will be a success.If there were any mistakes in this movie it was trying to make Orlando Bloom funny. It's not the writers' fault, he's just not funny. He does a good acting job other than that, he becomes a bit more like a pirate as well which is good to see. Kiera Knightly is stunning and delivers the goods as usual. Her character develops more into someone who takes charge as you will see in this movie if you haven't already seen it. You'll be surprised at the incredible effect she has on this movie. And as always Mr. Depp delivers and this time he delivers coming back as the witty, drunken, ladies man, pirate, yet courageous good man Jack Sparrow. The character is a gem of a character that has never been matched before in any other movie ever created. The other thing about this movie that may anger some is you'll wish there was more of a resolved plot, it's a bit sketchy but pay attention, and it'll all make sense. The reason the plot is unresolved is because the movie is a complete set-up for the third movie.All in all, this movie is terrific, go see it. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, long, not as fresh as the first...","I give this movie a B. I thought it was good, but seemed a bit too long. Too much reliance on CGI, and seemed down right slow at times. I think this was due to so much action that you get numb to it after a bit. Depp's performance was a bit over the top, but the rest of the cast, especially the two pirates that seemed to follow everyone around, made up for it.It's a fun movie, and worth watching, but I'd have been happy waiting for it to come out on DVD.. My movie going experience may have been colored by the crowded theater, crying children, and endless commercials. Also the people who show up as the movie is starting, wandering the aisles looking for seats for their 12 person entourage.I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available and watch this again, right after the Black Pearl.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Review on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"Hello, Beastie!The film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the sequel of the Curse of the Black Pearl, directed by Gore Verbinski. After the first film, high expectations were raised among many people. In this adventurous action movie, Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow. Also the other characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) return to the screen. So the film has got a well-known cast, which makes it a success beforehand, which can turn out either positive or negative for the film. It's set on the Caribbean around the 1750s. The film contains elements from a lot of different genres, for example: action, comedy, fantasy, romance, etc.When Will and Elizabeth are ready to get married, Elizabeth is thrown in prison for helping Jack Sparrow escape. Will Turner has to go to Jack Sparrow and get his compass. If he gives this to Lord Beckett Elizabeth is set free. In the meantime, Jack Sparrow owes a blood debt to Davy Jones, the half-octopus sea captain of the Flying Dutchman. The only way to escape from his duty is to get help from the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. She is able to give him the information Jack Sparrow needs to find the key of the magical dead man's chest. Even though the plot isn't very well-written and quite lengthy, the humorous actions of Captain Jack Sparrow, as well as of some of the other characters, make the film worthwhile and funny.The plot of the film is almost the worst written plot you can imagine. It goes from one subject to another, leaving the viewers completely puzzled. One moment everybody is looking for the magical compass of Jack Sparrow, and the next they are suddenly looking for the key of Davy Jones's chest. When Elizabeth enters the room of Lord Beckett, the audience is likely to get confused how she got there. And if this isn't enough, Elizabeth starts a love triangle with Will and Jack, all out of the blue. It also seems like the characters themselves don't even know what they want and what they are doing. An example of this is that Captain Jack Sparrow has the compass, but he doesn't know what to do with it and how to read it. Neither is there any sense of direction established, just until you watched forty minutes into the film. But the worst thing about this film is that it takes the director two and a half hours to complete nothing. There is a lot happening in the film but in the end everybody ends up with having the same as they had in the beginning: nothing.Except from bad aspects it also contains various good aspects. For example, the good old humor from the first film returns in the sequel. And of course, Jack Sparrow draws a lot of attention to him again with direct, sarcastic and funny comments. This makes the audience want to keep on watching the film and it makes boring scenes amusing. Another positive aspect of the film is the great amount of spectacular stunts and special effects. This keeps the viewer awake and entertained. For example the numerous sword fights and battles keep you on the edge of your seat. Also the use of CGI is magnificent. The character of Davy Jones is beautifully made, just like the other crew members on the Flying Dutchman. The giant-tentacled Kraken, which appears halfway through the film, is also made by CGI. The appearance of this enormous beast adds some action and amazement to the film. Another good aspect is the use of mattes, during the film it is hard to see what is real and what isn't, this makes you think and try to figure out how they did it. It also makes you get absorbed into the film more, because you accept it as a reality. For example the part when the Kraken appears behind Captain Jack Sparrow, and they also used this technique when the crew members of The Black Pearl swing, captured in the bone cage. The lighting was used effectively in the film: every scene on The Flying Dutchman was quite dark, this created a gloomy mood, also at the wedding the light was quite dim, which created a sad mood and in both cases you could expect some action or drama was about to happen. The sound however is very characteristic for the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, so when you hear it again you will immediately recognize it and link it with this film. The acting is very good in this film, because although the plot is horrible, they are able to make it a film worth watching.Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a lengthy film with a dreadful plot, but the humor and spectacular events keep you entertained throughout the entire two and a half hours of the film. Because the first film was such a success, Gore Verbinski is likely to get away with the bad plot, but he probably won't get away with it once more. The use of special effects in this film was amazing and it really got you absorbed in the film. Although it didn't fully meet our expectation that we got after watching the first film, we would still recommend it to our friends and family. Because of the humor, the fights and the stunts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not so good as the first, but Keira was robbed of an Oscar nom - again!","Pirates 2 is kinda cool, but Depp and Bloom suck as usual. Keira Knightley, on the other hand, shines as always and should've been nominated for an Oscar (she wasn't nominated for the first back in 2003, what's a dirty shame). Keira gave the 4th best supporting performance of 2006, after Adriana Barraza in Babel, Cate Blanchett in Notes on a Scandal and Frances McDormand in Friends with Money.The most talented actress of our generation is always a joy to watch and makes this okay adventure flick a must-see!The are a few classic scenes, and Keira is so gorgeous and sexy and lovely that you can't take your eyes off of her!!!

Depp presses hard to ignite the film as Sparrow.,"This review is from the perspective of weekend number two. Here's the bag of chips : PotC : DMC took in a record $130-something million dollars for its 3-day opening, billed as the ultimate 'summer' film, and nothing but good, action entertainment. Yet, in the haze, not all opinions are of perfection. So to say, more than thought possible are actually con-Caribbean. I went into the theater with an open mind, especially since I can enjoy a good film that isn't aimed at a guy named Oscar.When the Disney fireworks hit, and the DEAD MAN'S CHEST text fades over dark, murky waters, my mind becomes at ease. When Bloom and Knightley make their first appearance, it is just as expected. The straight men, for the eccentricity to follow. As so it did, at the expense of a woodpecker. The film waves hello. Hi film.Here is where things get complicated. It has all the elements of an entertaining film. It pushes off the massive success of its original. It also carries its attributes, as well. Long dialogue sequences may prove pointless. The actors do a good enough job, that if the film were silent, we could pick up on their motives. Early on, that appears to be the case. What is the payoff for it in the first third? It doesn't have to do with anything. Just your admission ticket at work, to see Jack in action again. Thoughts rise from this. Could the film possibly be a little full of itself?Now, no complaints about the special effects, for dang sure. Two major sequences with a 'large' conflict, and the villain himself, Davy Jones, showoff just what the future holds for film. All stops were pulled to make 'Pirates 2' looks as gorgeous as possible.Besides that, even with it being a Disney film, and Johnny Depp matching his 'Curse' performance equally, the film somehow lacks personality. Ending at the 2 hour and 45 minute mark, with long dialogue sequences, even lengthier action scenes, and a plot that seems like one big set up, things tend to get dull. By the time money scenes arrive, some people may have traveled off into Neverland. Or sleepy land.But everything is there, in full form. A good prefix to describe Dead Man's Chest, would be 'Over'. Over-hyped. Overdone. Overzealous. But the series is sure not over. Which was, if anything, the point of this second film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just saw it!,"Just saw the sequel tonight at a private screening in Toronto. It was rather interesting going to the movie since they scanned us all for video equipment and did not permit anyone with a camera cell phone to enter the theater.

They taped and scanned the audience the entire movie which I found really annoying.It was great to see the movie before the general public gets to see it, but the night vision video taping of the audience made me feel like I was under surveillance.Overall the movie was well done with some great fight scenes and comic relief.I will not say much more since I cannot do so without ruining the plot for others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

As a sequel to the original, it does a good job of continuing the story but also stands on its own so people who have not seen or do not remember the first one will be able to enjoy this film.

Depressing,"If you take the first Pirates of the Caribbean and do a complete flip flop, you have the second movie. In other words whatever was happy is sad and depressing in this movie. Jack seemed to be a different person in this movie, except that they used a lot of the same humor as the first movie. There is no happy ending in this movie and actually there is no ending, which I disliked most of all. There were a lot of cheesy parts to this movie and even more unrealistic. I loved the first movie you can almost say yeah that is some what realistic, but this is just plain unrealistic. I wasted my money and wish that I would have known. If anything, I would suggest waiting till the third movie comes out, listen to the reviews and if the third movie is good then rent the second movie and watch the third.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good but not great,"I really did enjoy this movie. I actually boycotted CotBP for a long time because absolutely EVERYONE was talking about it, and I have this rebellious thing, I guess. Anyway, I finally saw it and loved it, and I went to see DMC the second day it came out. When we were walking out of the theater, my friend asked me which one I'd liked more, and we both agreed that we needed some time to absorb the second movie before we decided.And of course this movie has good parts--I bought it, I will watch it again and again, and when we had a Chinese-food-and-DMC-watching party tonight, I packed up and was out the door in two seconds, and not just for the food.But this movie has gotten SO MUCH HYPE, and I really don't believe it deserves it all. In typical sequel form, I don't see that it has lived up to its predecessor, mostly in that it tries too hard to live up to it. Every time you turn around there is a recycled joke, most notably the rum joke (probably because of its original success). One subtle reference might have gotten a laugh, but they totally beat you over the head with it. ""Why is the rum always gone?--If it were, there'd be rum.--Hide the rum.--Then use the rum."" The dog-and-keys joke, the ""hello, poppet"" (although that didn't seem so annoying to me as just odd when they said it), even the ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" line...I like it to a point, but after we know it, it's tiring to continually be reminded of it. I suppose they were trying to make a point about Elizabeth's character with her interjection at the beginning, but that was definitely an instance of overusing lines.I don't think that Jack's line of ""You will always remember this as the day..."" gets old, maybe ever, since he always says it with such bravado, and because of the context of the line itself. They only use that line once, anyway, and it's a line that's been known for its changeability; Ted and Terry keep coming up with new ways to present it, so even though it's brought up again and again, it's never the same twice.This is a great movie as far as action goes. I won't, can't, dispute that. The action starts at the beginning and goes right on through to the end--maybe without enough pauses for the more tender audiences, I guess, but it's not boring. It also mixes humor with its action, which makes it more enjoyable to watch. The big three-way-duel comes very specifically to mind here.I won't bother too much with the cast...if you saw and liked the main cast from the first film, then you will probably like them again here. Knightley returns as a much more tomboyish figure; I'm still not entirely sold on the plausibility of this drastic change. Norrington's return really gives Jack Davenport a chance to show off his acting abilities. And Tom Hollander, a new addition but one I'm growing to like, appears as the smug Lord Beckett, an interesting change from his last film with Knightley, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.I have heard some complaints about the overall feeling of this movie, though, its sort of fantastical world. It's true, in CotBP we start out in a very reality-based setting and move into the fantasy world; here we're in the fantasy from start to finish, and the best ""reality"" times are in Port Royal, with Beckett--until, of course, we get to Davy Jones's heart at the end, when the two worlds meet.In another way these action sequences do detract from the film. Without ever slowing down for a break, it's hard to step back and think about what's happened, and it's a great deal more difficult to really characterize anyone, I think. The main-main characters (Jack, Will, Elizabeth, even Norrington and the Governor, to an extent) have been fleshed out nicely, between this movie and the last, and I see that Beckett is on his way, but our villain--what happened to our villain? We got a story, albeit an interesting one which implies there will be more, but he still seems rather remote to me. There was so much to-do made over the heart, the key, and Jack's part in it all, that the motive behind it all (supposedly a woman) kind of got left out except in the convenient backstory. So if we're supposed to believe he's all bitter over a woman, it doesn't come across very well. Just a few more introspective scenes could easily solve these questions of character, but we're so busy watching ships blow up and people swashbuckling that we kind of forget about everything else. The Kraken, I do admit, is impressive to watch. Someone give Special Effects a hand for that one, especially at the last scene.It's a fun ride (ha, didn't mean that as a joke...), so I believe you will enjoy it. I highly recommend seeing it at least once, if only to say you've seen it. Don't be like me and miss out on a good film because you feel like you're jumping on a bandwagon--even if it doesn't deserve all its hype, it does deserve a great deal of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Speechless....kinda,"I just got done watching a midnight showing of POTC:DMC, and all that I can say is...wow. From the bleak and dark beginning to the stunning yet satisfying end, I loved every minute of it. While at times, it did seem to be a little over the top and cheesy, it was still one of the best films of the year in my opinion. The breathtaking scenery would have carried this movie alone, from the dark and bleak setting of the Flying Dutchman to the lush and green tropics of the cannibal island. This movie had a great mix of action and comedy. Also, having some of the most memorable characters of the last few years helps to boost your score too. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Comments on the new Pirates of the Caribbean Movie,"I thought it was wonderful. Very funny, and full of drama. A lot of nice surprises that you weren't expecting, and just an all around great film. I can't wait to see it again, and really can't wait to see the 3rd movie in May now. The beginning is a little confusing, I think it is one of those movie's that you will need to watch a 2nd time to catch everything. As always Johnny Depp was fantastic! He plays Captain Jack Sparrow like no one else could have! The remaining characters were very good as well including Orlando Bloom. I think they work well together. All in all I think everyone should go see this movie. There are a couple parts that you might want to be careful about as far as young children go, but it really is worth it!! Congratulations Disney on another hit!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Go See It!,"Excellent fast paced plot! Definitely put a more cut throat feel on the movie than the original without seeming over the top. There does come a point where the movie becomes less comical than the original but the transition doesn't ruin the movie but instead allows it to expand. I was really hoping that this Pirate saga wouldn't turn out to be all laughs like I figured Disney would probably do. I was afraid that before I went to see the sequel I was going to see Goofy threatening someone to walk the plank. One other thing, it was great to see a Pirate movie where much of the action takes place on the high seas. It's always good to see the parts where there's a dark and scary cave or a dingy bar or a tropical paradise but I always wonder what's going on over at the boat and this one stuck with it. It would take a hardcore landlubber not to like this film. Anyone else with any kind of interest in tall sea tales needs to get to the theater today!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worse Sequel I've ever seen,"No actions scenes that could even compare to the first movie. The first ""Pirates"" was face-paced and action packed and laced with fantastic one-liners. This movie had to rely on your knowledge of the first movie to pull of its one liners ""why is the rum always gone"" It wasn't that witty and lacked action. They developed way too much of a story line for this movie and it went no where. It appeared the sole purpose of this movie was to make money and set up for the third movie.Reminded me of Star Trek III the search for Spock. Just a set up for the 4th movie in the Star Trek series.I watched this movie two weeks after the premier and there were only 6 of us in the audience. I wonder why? This movie is so bad that nobody wanted to see it twice!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Captain Jack Sparrow is back and he has a debt to pay...,"This rather good movie as sequel to the sleeper hit Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl is not as good as its predecessor. Of course, this time it isn't a surprise as was the first one, it also has a very choppy flow to it that doesn't help. The plot goes here and there, to many characters introduced when all we came to see (well most of us anyway)is Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly return too and there is to much focus on them for my tastes, don't get me wrong they need to be in it, but more Jack please. Still you get action in the form of a rather cool sword fight in a water wheel, an aquatic sea monster attack, and other scenes like this and you get your comedy, the best bit coming near the start of the movie where Jack and his crew are in the clutches of a group of cannibals. So while this movie is not as good as the first for the most part, it is still a rather fun film that would have benefited with a shorter running time. It could easily be edited down a good fifteen minutes or so. Still there was a nice surprise at the end, at least for me, however IMDb kind of ruins it. Thankfully I didn't see that till tonight. So if you liked the first Pirates go see this one because while not the first one your still in for a treat, but be warned it ends in a cliffhanger.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good Ride,The first movie was so fresh (for this century anyway) that there was no chance that any sequel was going to measure up. Dean Man's Chest came as close as I could expect. Johnny Depp's performance was astonishing in the first movie because all of the other characters lived in the real world. Jack Sparrow is less effective when everyone takes for granted that there are ghost ships sailed by Octopus looking half dead sea creatures. Bill Nighy was wasted under an avalanche of special effects. I didn't buy that Elizabeth would ever have any real connection to Jack. Her undying love for our hero is what makes the story old fashioned Hollywood fun. Jack would have to stop swaying for me to believe that Elizabeth would be conflicted about her feelings for him. What would be the fun of that? I love watching Orlando Bloom play a sword fighting hero though the action was too cartoon like. The swords might as well have been made of rubber. I never felt anyone was going to get hurt. Nothing hurt these people. This movie is a nice ride and worth the price of admission. However the first movie was such an unexpected pleasure that part of me wishes that they had just left it alone.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining but long as hell,"The movie continues the story of the first chapter or rather it spirales down from the first film. In Dead Man's Chest Jack Sparrow and his pirate companions fight against the captain of the ship Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones an undead human squid.The movie is not as good as the first one thats for sure. It is very entertaining but also seems very long and at times boring. Except for the entertainment part it doesen't really send any kind of message or provoke you to think abput anything its just a cool ass movie about pirates fighting at sea.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent Depp again!!!!,"Any Depp fan will be happy with this movie. Once again we are treated to the man of all our female fantasies(and mens I don't doubt).The acting was excellent and with all the old cast returning made it a real treat.I have just returned from a screening and wanted to sit and watch it all over again.Disney got it right again with good baddies great special effects and a right on dialogue. Its what films should be, entertaining, enthralling, thrilling and leaving the audience wanting more.The only thing I could find wrong with this movie was that it was too short. I wish I didn't have to wait so long for part three but I do also hope there's a part 4,5,6,.....etc. I don't think Depp can top this acting performance. There could be no other man play 'Jack Sparrow'.Orlando Bloom Fans will not be disappointed either. Plenty of action for him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Summer movies still worth seeing,"While many people, critics and movie-goers alike, have written off Pirates of the Caribbean 2 as a pointless sequel without the charm of the first movie, I say, ""So what?"" Yes, I admit that some of the more intense actions scenes were a little corny, and maybe the plot was overly complicated, but remember: this is an ACTION movie. People come to movies like these not only to see something entertaining, but also something exciting. Pirates 2 is an excellent example of this. Instead of the too-common problem of not enough plot and too much hitting, Pirates 2 has the perfect mixture. Enough plot to keep you focused, and enough action, special effects, and fancy swordplay to leave you feeling satisfied. People can be critical and say ""That couldn't happen."" and ""In real life they wouldn't have survived that."" but this isn't a reality show. Consider the plot of the first movie: cursed pirates that roam the seas forever looking for Aztec gold. How is that more realistic than this movie? All in all, if you are looking for a great movie to see this summer, and don't mind an open ending, go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a swindle,"-rant on-In school my English teacher explained that a story has a beginning, a middle and an end. This film has a beginning and lots of stunts. They completely forgot the middle and the end.I loved the first PoTC film, and Jonny Depp is entertaining again in this one, but I left the cinema fuming. They could have at least called it ""Dead Mans Chest: Part 1"". Don't go and see it or at least wait until part 2 comes out (the bit where the story actually goes somewhere and, we hope, there is some sort of an ending).Alternatively, watch 24. Then you know that very little will happen, but in an exciting way and that there will be a huge cliffhanger at the end which forces you to watch the next part. Personally, I am so mad, I won't be watching the next part and I will seriously think twice about watching any other Disney film if they are going down this route to squeezing another chunk of cash out of me.Argh! What a waste of 2 and a half hours.-rant off-",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
How long 'til Pirates 3 -- At the End of the World?,"The handsome Douglas Fairbanks and roguish Errol Flynn live again in Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom! Bravo! It took four writers to create this sequel that so goes beyond the normal shoddy standard of sequels. This Pirate is worthy of ""Two Jolly Roger's Up,"" maintaining a high level of comedy and tension so intense I was actually tense through most of the film, holding my breath during the many expertly choreographed and carried out duels and fights on land and sea. Lots of tributes to other great adventure-thrillers, from Indiana Jones to Peter Pan to Star Wars to Saturday afternoon swashbucklers.The make-up, costumes, and sets were absolutely tops. I don't care if it was special effects or animatronics or all-things man-made... those actors earned their keep! Stellan Starsgard as Bootstrap Bill (Will Turner's father) has said he spent 4.5 hours in make-up every day. He's probably doing that now, as the third installment is currently filming.Depp and Bloom are ably matched with an international cast -- Brits Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy, and the Swedish Skarsgard were a treat to watch. Lee Arenberg and Tim Hollander as the equivalent of Shakespeare's Rosencrantz and Guildensterne were highly entertaining... especially Hollander's delivery of pithy dialog.This is a gorgeous period piece of eye-candy that never, never, never takes itself too seriously. Gads, I miss Saturday afternoons watching entertainments. This one is among the strongest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The ride's just as fun the second time around!,"Several years ago, the notion of a successful pirate movie was about as realistic as the success of some unknown character named ""Mickey Mouse"" must've been way back in the 1920's. Scripters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio must've gotten some real dumb looks from some higher-ups when they initially pitched their script. A movie based on a well-loved ""amusement park"" ride - a couple dozen years after it opened - and just as long since any pirate movie was even received all that well?Well, shiver me timbers, me buckos! $600 million later, a genre was given new life! ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" showed the movie-going masses the kind of innocent, rip-roaring, swashbuckling fun that isn't easy to glean from many of the films getting passed 'round. And to boot, if one didn't know any better, he wouldn't be privy that the movie was even based on a ride at Disneyland.Comes the second installation in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" saga: ""Dead Man's Chest"". So, what now that Cap'n Jack Sparrow has regained his long-lost prize, the Black Pearl? Well, we know he can't just up and get away with making a mockery of the Royal Army, and especially not the East India Trading Company. But who else is out for a piece of Jack? And...just how many pieces of him are there to go around?""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely no failure to the established summer movie formulas. Fencing, fighting, torture, monsters, chases and escapes via special effects abound. Like its predecessor in 2003, it's all put to good use with extremely witty and inventive storytelling. And it's all out on display on such lush, extravagant backgrounds and movie sets. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, effort was obviously poured into making the story so compellingly gripping, you'd almost forget that in the heat of the action, you're really still sitting in a movie theatre.The most stunning success of ""Dead Man's Chest"" has to be the realization of a magnificently fantastic soundtrack, worthy of any mega epic. Great though the soundtrack of the original was, Hans Zimmer has come aboard and created a masterpiece symphony - Hornpipes to accompany us on a journey into the seedy underworld of Tortuga - a massive pipe organ played by none other than Davy Jones himself...and even a little dinner music to muse our appetites.Alas though, the Chest isn't completely chock full of gold and treasure. Likely, ""Dead Man's Chest""'s most obvious pitfall is one present in many movie trilogies: The dreaded Volume II syndrome. It has no real beginning nor does it have much of an end. This tends to make the story drag just a bit since there's so much room to continue the saga's progression to the third volume. It could even be argued that the movie's 143 minute running time is at least 15 minutes too long, but once the slower pace picks right back up to full-bore, that sentiment fades.And know ye this...there is a quite darker undertone in this Chest. It's not quite the glorified, happy-go-lucky nature that the little kiddies ate up in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". Better squeeze the little ones a little tighter, 'cause dead man REALLY tell no tales...It's well-known by now that Johnny Depp is quite keen to keep donning the costume and make-up of the Cap'n. And with the awe-inspiring inventiveness and the vivid imaginations of the POTC crew on display, I'd be willing to bet there are many meager souls willing to pay a few more gold coins to hop aboard the Black Pearl another time or two and set out to the open seas of the Caribbean.""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" gets 8 of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A most entertaining adventure...,"Given how much I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I was almost certain that I would love Dead Man's Chest. But NOTHING could have prepared me for the wild adventure Dead Man's Chest turned out to be. It was, for me, clearly the best movie I have ever seen and has officially pushed The Curse of the Black Pearl into second place on my list of favourite movies. The movie still has the same, warm ""Pirates"" feel about it but is packed with lots more adventure, hilarious laughs, and an all-round great movie which is DEFINITELY worth seeing. Don't be fooled by what other critics have said about it being a flop and a disappointment; I was nowhere near disappointed, if anything, it was BETTER than what I had expected. Towards the end of the movie are three major shocks, some of you will see some of them coming, but mark my words: Nobody will leave the cinema and say ""I saw all that coming"" because nobody could possibly foresee the great work that the POTC cast and crew have done - yet again. I give this movie 10/10, without the slightest doubt in my mind. Go see it. It is truly enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fantastic,"I have to admit when i walked into the cinema to watch this i had doubts,i never thought any sequel could match up to this film....I was thankfully proved wrong. The direction was beautiful the picture fantastic. and the acting brilliant. Once again Johnny Depp ruled the show with his great portrayal of Jack Sparrow. I hope that the third film will be as good if not better then this cos my hopes are high an all i can say is well done Gore Verbinski you nailed it All in all the best thing about this film,Though it has its spooky moments it still stays on the comedy side of things as i must say i laughed out loud many a time especially with the whole sword fight on the big wheel. Brilliant and a lot of fun to watch Jack Sparrow running to keep along with it etc. The only one thing i can moan about is the acting from Orlando Bloom and keira Knightley can be very wooden at some points but not to bad so its OK i suppose. But well done Gore Verbinski i can honestly say you are on the way to becoming a fantastic director, Even though in my opinion you were a long time ago So yes i would vote this film as film of the year so don't have any doubts to go and see it because it is well worth your money.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Alternate title: Dead Man's Entertainment,"There are no spoilers in this, but then how can you spoil sewage? I should have known better. It's happened so many times. Sequel after sequel after sequel. And yet, I let myself believe that if Johnny Depp could carry the first movie so well, he could carry this one well too. Unfortunately, this turkey had so much dead weight that the entire cast drowned under it's excessive bulk.Dreary, dull, complicated, confusing, muddled, predictable, ponderous, interminable, formulaic, suffocating, irrelevant, self-indulgent,... where's my dictionary? This one almost takes the honors of the worst sequel of all time, right up there with The Whole Ten Yards.And the worst thing is, they didn't even let Johnny be himself; so the movie had nothing to offer. Except for a chance to practice some virtues, like patience, forbearance, long-suffering, etc.However, what does all that matter? It made a fortune!!! All of those returning fans of the original probably managed to convince themselves it was just as good as the first. So the third one, no matter how bad it is, will also make a fortune!!!

One very Impressive Spectacle,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was a very big film. It was huge. So, the usual is done with Hollywood sequels here, more of the same, but bigger. And I felt it, it was quite a heavy first part of the film, lots of information and detail before the ball really gets rolling and the whole thing starts to flow. The plot changes all the time so would be frivolous to try to explain a plot that encompasses the whole film. Needless to say, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan all get dragged into another adventure and meet friends and enemies, old and new along the way. The film is big, it's long, it's crammed with characters, some of which suffer due to the amount of screen time they get due to there being so many. But the film's appeal is in it's sheer spectacle, the sets and costumes and special effects are all of an absolutely incredible standard. This surely is the reason the big screen was made, and too see in there enhances the film to a great jaw dropping sight at times. Perhaps the only thing that the film didn't have going was a feeling for the characters, with so many of the new ones given screen time it was hard to feel when the main three got into perilous situations, or maybe that was just me. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 was an enjoyable, likable film, that demands a big screen viewing, but the main stars are the art and effects departments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dead man's chest - a proper sequel to black pearl,"I had seen the curse of the black pearl at least 25 times before, so the expectations from this movie was really high. So when i watched the Dead Man's Chest i can say that the action in this movie is far less than the first one. So sometimes the movie's pace slackens a little bit but the comedy in this movie keeps you glued to the screen. The laughs in this movie is more than its predecessor.If the comparison is done to 'black pearl' then it can be said that black pearl was better than the dead man's chest in terms of the action sequences but dead man's chest provides you more laughs than the black pearl. But where this movie is far ahead of the 'black pearl'is its climax. The way this movie has ended is simply superb. The climax would keep one waiting anxiously for the third part in the series.All in all this movie lags behind in some aspects and is far ahead in some aspects of its predecessor. But still because of the climax it is a proper sequel to black pearl and now lets hope in the third part also the good work is continued.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than expected,"My first screening of Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest came on a very long day. I went into the movie very tired and not in the right mood. Knowing that I couldn't review a movie correctly after a tired day I went and saw Pirates again on a better day. I was glad I did. This movie was actually fun to watch, and though it is not quite as good as the first film, it is still very watchable.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp in one of the roles that will soon be one of his best) owes a blood debt to Davey Jones after Davey Jones helped him become Captain of the Black Pearl. Sparrow of course is not ready to fall into Davey Jones servitude as one of the ghastly sea creatures of the Flying Dutchmen, so he finds a way to avoid it, and this means trouble for poor Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley).Of course both Elizabeth and Will already have their own troubles for when they allowed Jack Sparrow to escape in the first film, and their wedding is interrupted and Elizabeth put in prison. Now Will must find Sparrow and make a bargain to get his compass, which leads the way to the heart of the same Davey Jones mentioned above. If not, poor Elizabeth will face the gallows for the rest of her life. Of course Elizabeth herself has other plans, and so the story continues in the second part of what is to be a three part series.The story in the second film is more confusing then the first because there are so many plot threads. That was probably why I had such a hard time seeing it the first time, however upon seeing a second screening it was much clearer. I was able to relax back and watch the entire movie without being distracted and found it to be quite an experience.Just about all the actors and actresses return in the second film, and then their are some surprise appearances that nobody, well those who haven't seen it, will suspect. All the performances were pretty good once again, and Johnny Depp is as great as ever as the pirate with the very bad hygiene. He really is enjoying this character he created, and by the profits that this movie has already made, so is everybody else.The special effects are top notch, and the scenery was quite enjoyable as well, but it is still not quite as good as the first film. I think it was because the first film had a feeling of mystery about it, whereas this film doesn't. The tale of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman just isn't as spooky as the undead crew from the Black Pearl, even though Bill Nighty gives a bravo performance as the villain just as Geoffrey Rush did in the first film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very well done sequel!,"I simply must say that this film very much lived up to the hype from all the trailers. The lovable bumbling pirate fools were back, Barbosa had a great one-line entrance into the film that sets up the final one next summer, and the special affects for the crew of THE FLYING DUTCHMAN were superb.The cast was once again top notch, with the addition of Bill Nighy and Skaarsgard as Davy Jones and Bootstrap Bill very well chosen.The only slight trouble any viewer may have is that the film jumps from scene to scene rather quickly. Don't worry though, you'll be entertained the whole way through!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
yawn,"OK, so the effects were amazing and the costumes were fantastic. But it seems like that is all they're depending on? Just because a lot is spent on the visual side of things doesn't mean there shouldn't be a PLOT. Where was that by the way? I seem to have missed it.After the first half an hour I found myself staring into space, that really isn't a good sign. Orlando Bloom was tedious in the first one but now he's just pathetic. Is anyone else bored of this soppy love story with him and knightly? It's boring. If it wasn't for Johnny Depp being so funny and gorgeous this film would have felt like it dragged on even longer (if that is possible).I love the first one, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have gone to see the second. I found myself leaning over to my friend a lot saying 'what the hell is going on now?!'

"Depp is great, CG is *almost* flawless, but it could be shorter","Yes, I'm a late boomer in the pirates legacy. It's been open since Aug 3 and I only got to see it tonight.

I mean, yes, he's funny and witty and enchanting and has that charisma not all actors have but... what did I say about not liking him again? Wait, SCRAP that. I love him as Capt. Jack Sparrow! Aye aye, Captain!The movie, at 153 mins, could've been shorter though. I was sitting through the action packed sequences, and midway through I had to shift butt cheeks (ooh.. i'm getting better at this review thing~!).Love it when Jack Sparrow got into the satay form, meat between exotic fruits, trying to ""roll"" away from the cannibalistic tribe. Love it when William Tucker (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley) kiss Jack Sparrow. Oh!!! The heartbreak! Love to see Jack Sparrow running funnily across the beach. Sounds cliché, huh, but Depp just has this weird chemistry (and body language) to make the scene plain funny.OH and the CG!! OMG!!! Those are the best tentacles I've ever seen stuck on a man's face!!! Sheesh! How the heck did they do it?!?!!

Same old fun with greater depth. Fantastic sequel!!!,"The first film made me believe that there is a pirate in all of us. A lust for freedom, adventure and a treasure, be that of gold or not. With its dark, comical and 'blockbusterish'fun it proved that you can combine these types of films with enough depth to give purpose of character and enhance the storyline.The second film has proved each again. this time they've gone deeper showing a darker and more sinister view on the pirate front. The acting is what you would expect, bloom being wooden yet seems to suit the role perfectly attuned to the style of the film. Keira also what you would expect but towards the end brings a lot more feel and versatility to her role. Depp. well come on, what do you expect? He has a lot of great moments in the film. Most of the best. Of course this franchise would be cut in half without his performance yet this film doesn't squeeze every last bit out of him by giving him the most screen time. Each character gets enough needed to give a decent pace to the storyline. Davy Jones makes and excellent bad guy showing no mercy. The plot is fairly easy to follow, on par with last film but is a great setup for the 3rd.The special effects/stunts are exceptional. With these sorts of films the special effects wont stand the test of time but with the comical scenes and and general characterisation they don't have a great effect. Look at star wars. It still is great fun to watch. Where as something like The latest King Kong is all about the special effects. Don't get me wrong it is a fantastic film with a lot of depth. But it will be hard to feel for the same ape in 30 years when the visuals are outdated.There are lots of memorable scenes in this film, more than the first. Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry. Some may make you scared ( if you don't like slimy things ).All in all this has the same wide audience attracting variety of goodness as the first. Greater sequences, greater characters, greater depth. Everything is consistent or an improvement. There are some scenes in the first film that are well crafted and cannot be compared with but as a sequel this does seem fresh, re -introducing the same old guys we love and what i consider a great ending. I cannot wait for the third. I'm hoping for even more memorable fun that lets us see other sides of certain characters.

I was a little worried at first, after seeing previews of Davy Jones (cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman, not the ""Monkee"") and his motley crew of mutants. I thought perhaps Disney had sailed off course and decided to make a monster movie rather than a pirate movie. But, shiver me timbers, Pirates skillfully ties in sea faring legend and myth to create a mysterious back story for Jack that leads to an exciting supernatural adventure.There's a treasure-trove of amazing swordplay action--- incredible three way sword fight scene, plot twists, special effects --- one word, Kraken, a bit of romance, humor and surprises. The movie is rated PG-13, and there's definitely some intense scenes that may be too scary for younger audiences.The ending ***no spoiler *** made me want to shout.

Now he must save himself from them with a help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, as they look for Jack for his compass.This movie isn't better than the first pirates film, although it's funner and bigger. It's actually very different than the first film. One problem about the film is that it's just too long. Although it's long, I still enjoyed it by many funny and action scenes. Johnny Depp is the perfect role for Jack Sparrow. The acting is great. The visual effects are great, at first rate.Now another problem of the film is that the film drags along. Some of the action scenes are too long. Although many didn't like the ending, because there is no ending, I liked it. We know they'll continue on for the third film so just get use to cliffhangers. There are good and funny jokes in the movie, many of them involving Johnny Depp. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) make up is amazing.Kracken, the infamous cool-looking sea monster, also drags the film. The scenes with it just takes too long. This is a huge step from the first film. It's darker than the first film.This is just a great popcorn flick filled with humor, romance, and great action scenes. Although it's not better than the first film, definitely go and see it. You'll have some fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What a waste of an evening!,"Okay, I know loads of people love this film, and I went to see it with the full intention of enjoying it. But I couldn't. As far as I could tell it was rambling, incoherent and it was hard to understand what everyone except Bloom and Knightley were saying. And the film can't make it's mind up as to whether it's comedy or gross-out horror. In the UK it has one of those farcical '12A' certificates, and I have to say that there is no way I'd consider letting my two children (8 and 6) see it - they'd be really disturbed by so much of what goes on. Which doesn't make it bad film-making (it's the bad film-making that does that!), but does make the whole issue of certification very questionable.Depp is back as the ambivalent Sparrow, mincing and wearing make-up for all he's worth. Bloom and Knightley are there as well as the star-crossed, rather dull, lovers. And all the others are there too, including Jack Davenport to add an 'interesting' third way to the film. Their performances are all OK, but then again this isn't 'Come And See', one shouldn't expect ground-breaking thespianism.I know it's only a film, only a story, but I was bemused by the whole Flying Dutchman thing. I thought it was fairly well known that the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman was a Dutch sailor called Van Der Decken. Maybe Davy Jones sounded easier for the mushed-out brains of Hollywood's perceived target audience to understand. But I was disappointed - Van Der Decken sounds far more mysterious. And how come that someone with a name like 'Davy Jones' sounds so darned Scottish? I think you can tell I didn't like it. I thought the film was aimless, chaotic, rambling and totally annoyed me by leaving us with a cliffhanger ending that I really didn't care about. I was very angry about that actually. I had no idea and was fed up that I'd wasted an evening watching a film I didn't really like that didn't even have a satisfactory ending.But I guess that any film based on a Disney theme park ride is never going to be high art. I did quite like the first film (although the sword fights went on for far too long), but I really do believe this film is a mess, confusing and non-sensical. But, I suspect many of those who loved the first one will enjoy this and the prospect of more to come. But, the cynic in me can't help feeling that much of the popularity of this film (borne out by the presence in the cinema of so many teenage girls) is due at least in part to the presence of Messrs. Bloom and Depp.Shiver me timbers!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
this movie was a  set up!,"it was a great film don't get me wrong not very slow at all in the entire film from what I felt, though I had to use the bathroom three times during it I felt that this was something that was more graphic than the other film and probably something that A little kid might be a little scared of, but the basic reason this movie was set up to me from my opinion was to set the stage for the third and final chapter of the entire event, opening up more questions as the film drew to an end, and to give more depth to the main characters in the film that allowed the audience to see both sides of keira, and depp, as well as tie in more of the less used characters. the film though was something that I really enjoyed watching but would only watch it again in the theaters if I wanted to catch up on some of the dialog which is about it because like I said its kind of depressing the fact that we have to wait another year to watch the next one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
wow!!!!,"I have seen this amazing movie twice. The only reason that I have not seen it more is because none of my friends want to sit in a two-and-a-half hour movie and listen to me rave on and on about Johnny Depp. The first time I saw this movie was the second day that it opened. If I had it my way, I would have seen it at the midnight showing that Thursday night. I knew there were going to be tons of people there so I just decided to stay away until the second day. As soon as it started, I could not stop watching it!!! This movie is by far the best movie in the entire world!!! I absolutely Loved Jack's entrance in this one! As soon as I saw what the bird was doing I screamed out loud... ""Oh My God..... it's Jack!!!!"" I wouldn't have been surprised if they kicked me out of the theater but I am so glad that they didn't! I was absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in this one!!!! And the whole thing about curiosity between Elizabeth and Jack was like one of those Whoa! hit you in the face kind of moments! I am so anxious and overly excited about the third and final installment of Pirates that comes out next summer.Of course the main question to be answered here is...... Does DMC live up to the original? My answer: Oh My God yes!!! Furthermore, I think that Johnny Depp is amazingly remarkable!!! I think he should win a bazillion awards for the Pirates movies. He really does do an amazing job!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is the first half of one great movie.,"First order of business, YES you should stay through the credits. There is a short tidbit scene at the end.In the film's last minutes, I felt very cheated, but right up until then I was cheering my head off. This is every bit as sharp and funny as the first, with amazing dialogue and creature effects that had me shaking with delight.This movie actively rewards the fans who memorized every last line and plot twist of the first. In fact, I highly recommend watching Black Pearl a day or two before seeing this flick. Pay attention to the rum and the sword! Dead Man's Chest has one gaping flaw: It doesn't stand on its own. This isn't one movie, really, but rather the first half of a movie. A sequel, even the inside second of a trilogy, should have its own beginning, middle and end and this one really doesn't. I only hope that all the marvelous questions raised will be answered in the third film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Movie of the Month,"I just got back from going to see this movie. It was a great action filled movie but with a filled show with kids under 13 it got very bad because it was to scary for them. Hey it even scared me a little bit. But anyway this is a very great movie but one problem. The plot, will there is like no plot. It is a great action movie but no plot. I can't wait for the next movie since this one left us all hanging wondering what is going to happen. But is i had this idea of why it ended like it did. I think it was that they could not come up with three movie all with different plots so the mad the second movie into two different movies. It is kind of like X-Men three at the end it leads into the next movie. So everyone go see this. I will see you at the Movies!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dead Man's Chest,"I went to this movie expecting less than nothing. The reviews I read were really bad but I have 4 nephews who would not be deterred so off we went. I was expecting to be bored to tears, instead I was blown away! The special effects on Davey Jones and the sea phantoms was out of this world. It was worth twice what I paid. I kept muttering under my breath, ""that is so cool"" every time they were on the screen and I noticed something new. Just really excellent work all around.The cinematography was also really quite wonderful and I loved the visual references to the Disney ride which was lacking in the first film.Oscar worthy at the very least!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
absolutely dreadful,"Terrible. No dialogue, no plot to speak of, too many calisthenics, too much effort to win prizes for costumes/makeup, most of which would please a seven year-old boy, and make the rest of us nauseated.Bo-ring. All action and no talk. It was not funny at all, unless one gets one's jollies from seeing a person's head turn into a hermit crab. Again, juvenile in the extreme.Very obvious location shots - I was in Grand Bahama when this was being shot (obviously a very small bit), while the rest of it seems to be shot in Jamaica or the Hawaiian islands (viz. volcanic black beaches.) Total waste of time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
an entertaining mess,"This movie, while being fun, had no real plot. It runs about half an hour too long, and my impression at the end was that I was owed not just one cliffhanger ending, but five. Gore Verbinski, Disney, and Jerry Bruckheimer all owe me five endings. Not like 'things are done, but this is what happened next,' actual endings. The movie simply stops at what is apparently the middle of the story. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun film to see. Johnny Depp is amazing, as always, as he saunters around half-drunk, half-homosexual. Kiera Knightly also puts in an impressive performance, having much more to do in this film than in the first, where she mostly just looked scared or pouty. In the end however, it's just not as smart and fresh as the original was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Award Winning Movie!!,"Swashbuckling Pirate sword fights, cursed Pirate ships, what could be more exciting? Not much! This movie is an excellent source of excitement, mystery, and ""on the end-of-your-seat"" thrill.They did such a good job of connecting the mysteries and events of the first movie to the second. Pirates- Dead Man's Chest is such an excellent squeal to the first movie that I could not imagine how great the 3rd will be.This movie would not turn out the way it did and will turn out without this excellent set of cast members. Their performances were outstanding. Johnny Depp along with Orlando Bloom could not have portrayed their characters any better.It would be really hard for someone to be disappointed with this movie. The cliff-hangers and the incredible line of cast members is what makes this movie unforgettable and you anxious to see the next. The plot could not have been better, the witty lines said by characters,the cast themselves, and the incredible graphics should surely win this amazing movie an Oscar. I advise everyone to try this movie out , I guarantee you a fun time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
what happened,"don't get me wrong this was a good movie but i expected much more than what i saw. it was funny i laughed out of my seat the whole film, but it got very boring at a lot of parts. in fact the only good things about this film were the comedy, the special effect and johnny depp. thank god for johnny depp because he was the one with all the comedy. it wasn't in your face comedy either. it wasn't like they told jokes. it was more like his painfulness and the reaction he gave to certain things were funny. also davy jones. horrible acting by bill nighly. the character was a good bad guy but the acting for that character was stupid. also orlando bloom was in it more than johnny depp. how dare they. but this movie was good and i have to give credit for that. i recommend it. but do not expect much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Johnny Depp does it again,"He did it back in 2003, and he has done it so again. Johnny Depp comes up with another scintillating performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, as he tries to overcome his greatest fear, to undo himself of the bind of Davey Jones of the Flying Dutchman. And we are left to wonder what will happen at The World's End next year, will Jack Sparrow return with the help of the treacherous Barbossa ?? Or shall the East India Company reign supreme now that they have Davey Jones at their side.Gore Verbinsky leave the movie with full of riddles and thoughts, but indeed like the previous movie, this one is also all about Jack Sparrow. Although the plot is based on Will Turner, by all necessities Jack Sparrow is the one who controls the entire speed of the movie. Johnny Depp is again mind blowing as the wily pirate. Orlando Bloom is a huge disappointment, although the script didn't actually give him much scope too. Bill Nighy is good, but I felt, he could have been better if the needs be. Keira Knightley also gives a heart warming performance as the luscious Elizabeth Swann.The entire movie is full of action. Whether its a chase of two ships, or some great sword fighting, or some hilarious escapes. Gore Verbinsky sets the pace of the movie early, and gives us a great movie. But the only drawback of Dead Man's Chest is that it didn't give me the complete movie experience. Because the story remains incomplete. Unlike Black Pearl where the story became complete, Dead Man' Chest clearly gives way to a sequel. Although unlike other trilogies (Matrix, LOTR), here the second part is equally good. The camera work is good, original score by Hans Zimmer, isn't flashy but still well appropriate. Visual Effects will also score a point.Overall, its a good movie, but its all Johnny Depp through and through.A very well deserved 8/10 !!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Pirates and Elizabeth have come back!,"All the actors put in fine displays. Yet I thought the script was a bit cheesy, even for this film, and some of the sequences were far too over the top. And Orlando Bloom put in another wooden performance, though I believe his acting was better than other times I have seen him on the big screen.Jon Depp was great as usual as was Keira Knightly who just gets better and better. The confusing thing for me is who does Elizabeth Swann like? Jack or Will? Because all through the film I couldn't decide.The action sequences were on the whole very well done, and the humour all the way through the film made it easily watchable.As pace and action go the film was well directed and when it finishes you'll already be counting down the clock for the third film! And if you wait long enough... right through the closing credits, there's a very short scene at the end just like there was in the first film.Well done Mr Verbinski because after I had seen 'The Weather Man' I was slightly worried. But you don't need to be. Fans will love it. Just don't go into the film expecting realism. It is fun fantasy adventure! Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Set your sails,"A word from the wise, do not listen to the critics. It is impossible for them to sit back and enjoy this swashbuckler, they seem to thrive on dramas and romantic flicks. Are they even human? It is a Disney film, not a Ron Howard or Ridley Scott flick. Disney equals FUN. F-U-N. Please see this with your friends in family. It is, if not better than the first. I saw the first showing this morning, and it was packed. And I simply have to see it again. I hope this film makes twice as much as curse of the black pearl (over 650 million) and those who have spoke negatively of this film will have no choice but walk the plank. In short, Johnny has once again proved that only he, and he alone can play Capt. Jack. I ask the American people to please climb aboard the black pearl once more and hold on tight!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Favorite Parts?  One's you re-wind to watch again,"There are a lot of funny parts in P.O.T.C. 2 of them MY personal favorites are this:1.) When Davey Jones and Capt Jack are talking about the worth of a soul and Davey Jones makes that little ""pop"" sound. B.T.W. Davey Jones is a nasty looking feller.2.) When Jack Sparrow (CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) makes his way on back on board the Pearl, and says ""...now where's that monkey? I want to shoot something!""3.)Next, when The jar of dirt gets dropped and smashes on deck and he runs down and asks, ""Where is it? Where is the Thump-Thump?"" There are a lot of funny parts, if I listed them all, I'd be here all night. I hope other's find the small, embedded bits of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Disappointment,"After the first ""Pirates,"" I was very excited to see the second. What a letdown. First, it is entirely too long. 2 1/2 hours is too long for most movies, and in this case, the movie feels as if it is 4 hours long. It has been a long time since I wanted so badly for a movie to end.Second, it is a very dark movie. Disturbingly dark. The lighthearted banter and adventurous feel of the first movie is nowhere to be found. Spiritually, it has very dark themes, and it left me with a creepy sort of dark, depressive feeling - not what I desired or expected, after the humor of the first movie. The dialog is much too gloomy, and unlike the first movie, there are no great lines to be found. All the good ones are in the previews. There was nothing to add.Finally, parts of the movie are entirely too disgusting. I was disgusted and put off by several scenes. Any fun there might be in the movie is overshadowed by grotesque and gratuitous parts that were extremely distasteful.Overall, the movie was a terrible disappointment. I liken in to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" another disappointing second movie in a trilogy. I can only hope the third movie, like in the Indiana Jones trilogy, comes to the rescue of this series.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Totally entertaining!,"Totally entertaining, great special effects, and, a movie you will want to see over and over again! I hope they put out a special edition with deleted scenes, I wanted this movie to go on and on. The blend of characters and the way they work with each other is exceptional, and, having the first movie to set up with, creates a familiarity with the personalities of each returning character which adds to the enjoyment of watching this film. Loved the way the ending was setup and the final scene was so great! I cant wait for the next movie, it should be incredible to watch! The computer generated stuff is getting better all the time seamlessly mixing and melding into the scenes. I cant imagine what will be the next level, I can only dream!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A not so good sequel, but still fun","Pirates of the Carrabean: Dead man's chest still has the action, adventure and comedy, but isn't as good as the first or third. Most people would either say the second or third films in the POTC franchise are the worst, and for me, it's the second. It takes the main problem with the first film and multiplies it by five, it's hard to follow.Jack has a debt to pay to Davy Jones, so he has to give Jones a hundred souls or something. Then Will and Elizabeth are arrested, and instead of just killing them, they send Will to get Jack so he can get a real Job. But Jack need to pay off his debt, so he tells Will to help him get 100 souls, causing Will to be captured by Davy jones.Elizabeth escapes, and goes on a ship to find will and Jack. They find out that they need to find Davy Jones heart. They find it, but soon Jack, Will, and former Captain James Worrington all fight over the keys.Yeah, it's a weird movie, but as long as you don't think too deep into it, like I did, you should have a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Huh...?,"I don't get it... All of these rave reviews and I thought this was a long, boring STUPID movie! The writers clearly had no clue as to where they were going .. the movie is all over the place and just ridiculous over the top ..okay we ar going to Tortuga 2-3 times ..uh why?? and then to some remote island where Jack is some god , and then a food fight . dumb dumb dumb and i bought the DVD - what a waste of 20 bucks. Depp is brilliant as always, but the gay pirate saunter moves got old, Bloom is stiff and the chick is hot but god the story line bounces all over and is just DUMB. and the Indian Trading company? sheesh how much more crap and distractions can we throw into the movie..I hated this movie and REALLY REALLY hated the ending - couldn't believe that it would end this way and the Jamaican voodoo chick was just nauseating don't believe the Hype... rent it before you buy it. The first movie was in my opinion way way better - it was fresh and had character. This was in my mind some hack attempt to follow up... not looking forward to the next one .. well maybe a little.. I sure as hell will rent it first now.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Kinda Ok. Not better than first one.,Good visuals. Practical effects and better cgi for the year 2006. Wonderful. But lacks a lot from the previous films. Good orchestrated sword fights and circular barrel. Islands of pristine beauty and the dull ports. Love to see the kraken in action. Every character is interesting. Kinda funny to have the original live while tons of people die. Fate. Or the storyline. Jack is weaker in this but maybe he turns his todes around. Could have been a lot better. And the die game should have been kept full. The deleted version of the game is better. But it is what it is. The story ends with an opening.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An incredible film!!!,"I have got to say that this movie was just amazing, truly wonderful! It met my expectations and even surprised me a few times! Even though the ending was a cliff-hanger, it was most likely the best one of all-time! What a way to end a great movie!I highly recommend seeing this film! The CGI graphics were just breath-taking. The new characters in this film are some to admire, no doubt! There are also a few scenes that may shock a few who have come to love the first film...Anyways, I give this movie a 10 through and through! I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I have!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent film - just not as good as the first one!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was great to see some good old fashioned adventure and pirate story! The plot was good, although a little confusing and I think I would have to watch it again to fully appreciate it! The idea was similar to the 1st film - a curse that had to be broken and double crossings, bluffing and general confusion!! However, in this case, there was no happy ending and the story was left far from complete obviously laying the way for the next film.Johnny Depp was superb in maintaining his 'Keith Richards-style' and taking centre stage! He was hilarious to watch and by far the best actor in the film.Orlando Bloom's character remained a little under developed and lacked backbone while Keira Knightly went slightly 'over the top' in places - particularly with the unnecessary part she played when Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and the Commodore were in a three man duel.The three man duel itself was spectacular (only spoiled slightly by Elizabeth's excessive shouting which was not at all natural and obviously done so she could have her back turned for a key part). As usual the special effects were brilliant and the fighting scenes clever and entertaining although they did go on for a bit long! Particularly when the sea monster attacked for the 4th or 5th time! Overall, the film was brilliant! Although not as good as the first one, it was still better than many other films and definitely worth seeing! I don't really like films when the ending it TOO incomplete, as you feel the whole film has led to nowhere and therefore I am much looking forward to the third instalment. I think Disney have lived up to their reputation and I would recommend everyone to see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
