Excellent movie with a disappointing touch...,"I was torn while watching Bourne Supremacy. I'll just go ahead and say this before I mislead. I loved this movie! Unfortunately one key aspect just about dragged this film under the water. The camera was far too unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but it was excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you were only trying to see what the heck was going on. This made these scenes a little hard to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving, and eventually was giving me a headache. Just to serve as a warning, it's pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epileptic proportions.-- However -- The acting was close to brilliant in my opinion. I don't think the casting for Jason Bourne gets any better than Matt Damon because he fits the part perfectly. The rest of the cast all pretty much played their parts well, so I am pleased to announce that there aren't any exceptionally bad actors or actresses. In addition of the immersive storyline, it created a much enjoyable film. For a sequel, this actually surprised me because I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the first. If you're into action flicks, this definitely will not bore you. If you liked the first movie, then you'll most likely be very pleased with the conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Greengrass's style for these kinds of movies is just perfect,"Bourne is an intelligent guy He's not Bond who relies on potential gadgetHe has that cleverness to think on his feet, improvise, make up a plan, and execute it with unbelievable talent, using nothing but what's in front of himMatt Damon has got all the Bourne elementsgreat actions, really cool ability, a great sense of immaculate timing and a little bit of understanding thrown in too Demon's instincts are profound where the given character is actually very gloomyJason Bournean ex-CIA agent infused with violence, is a man who's killed people in cold bloodAnd yet you feel he's at war with himself Jason, is above all, emotionally truthfulThat's what director Paul Greengrass have done hereIt's that feeling of realism, of truthfulnessThe car chase is magnificent It is about desperation Jason has got to get to his young woman's apartment to say sorry That was his only aim in that momentJoan Allen brings that cool, cerebral intelligence to the part of Pamela Landy She's a worthy opponent for Bourne""The Bourne Supremacy"" takes us to real places in Europe like Berlin where the East-West conflict was focused; to Moscow, a place of uncertainty and peril and good fortune and to Goa, India's most charming of state capitals",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"More of the same, but it's welcome","The Bourne Identity was one of those films that some people will love for being different to the average action film, but others will hate for it daring to be 'too' different. Unlike the majority of action movies before it, the first Bourne film, despite having stunts and explosions never put it's emphasis on them, as the focus was always on the central characters and their use of brains, rather than brawn to accomplish their goals. The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a bad point as it can, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it difficult viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist-fights, explosions and a great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.Overall, I would say that this is a slightly lesser film than the original, but there is still much to like about it and fans of Bourne will no doubt enjoy themselves. It's also recommended if you're sure that every action movie since 1988 is a Die Hard clone...",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sequel that holds up.,"In The Bourne Supremacy, Jason Bourne is living a secret life with his girlfriend Marie, still trying to discover who he is. When he is framed for a crime involving the CIA, a hit-man is sent to kill him. This causes Jason Bourne to respond to a previous threat he made...Anybody from his past life that confronted him, he'd get revenge. He sets out to find out what happened and why he's being blamed.A lot of the principal players return for this sequel, and it's good to see how their characters evolved since the first film. Some new characters are present as well, and they are good additions to the series. Matt Damon is even better as Bourne this time around, seeing as he's comfortable in the role now. I really enjoyed Joan Allen in her role as well.The movie never gets too boring, and there is a nice blend between the action and the drama. This movie also features one of the best car chases since Bullitt. The only big flaw is the cinematography. The camera whips around so fast in some scenes that you can barely see what's going on. The movie ends with promise of a third installment, and I personally can't wait.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Get Ready For More Bourne!,"The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel to the successful Bourne Identity spy thriller. This movie, directed by a new director, is given a different yet extremely exciting feel to it. The casting is still great, with Matt Damon bringing a deadpan portrayal to the Bourne character. Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. Supporting players Brian Cox and Julia Styles, along with newcomer Joan Allen, all provide stellar support for Bourne. The action is intense and really well done, and the plot is thrilling and will surprise you quite a bit. The camera-work is extremely fast paced, and overall it has a gritty, captivating style. With all of these elements together, you got one great action thriller that in many cases even surpasses Identity! Movies like this are hard to come by, in todays times with many action pictures that just don't work and become tedious. Ill give this near perfect- *** and 1/2 outs 4 Star's- definitely see The Bourne Identity before this- don't fret: you will be very entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I wish I could see the action,"Decent film, even if it is weakest entry of the original Bourne trilogy. I'm sure the action scenes were well choreographed too, but it's too bad the cameraman was having constant seizures everytime they happened.I have never seen a film with so much shakey cam before aside from maybe The Blair Witch. It's so bad I actually felt nauseous at times.

Good Thriller Ruined By Bad Camera,"When Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive.Paul Greengrass is a mystery to me. He has a nice script, a solid cast, and can make these great spy thrillers. We are now (as of 2015) up to the fifth Bourne movie. But he has this weird obsession with making his camera shake. I could blame the cinematographer, but I think Greengrass likes this. And it makes no sense to me. Even when characters are standing still, talking, the camera wiggles. Why? One thing that makes this a better film than its predecessor is the decreased role for Julia Stiles. No disrespect to Stiles. I loved her in the 1990s with ""10 Things"" and ""Wicked"", but she is not a great actress.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A much more interesting, camp-free James Bond","The Bourne series are, without a doubt, the Bond films of the 21st century. What is even better is that they are the Bond we've been waiting for: one without the cheese, sleaze, camp predictable villains and cheap puns. This second installment in the series is a well-made, engaging adrenaline-booster and surprisingly every bit as good as The Bourne Identity.Once again, we get to follow Matt Damon as Jason Bourne on the search for his lost identity. He had initially planned on putting his past behind him, but it sneaks up on him in the form of an assassination attempt in Thailand - while he is enjoying his life with Marie (Franka Potente). What I love about Franka Potente is that she is such a natural beauty and not in-your-face gorgeous like Bond girls and the like. It all fits with the low-key style of the film.This film has mostly moved away from the flashy technology and violent showdowns of its fellow action-thrillers. Bourne Supremacy instead moves back to more traditional kinds of action, just like The Bourne Identity did. Its focus is the chase, not the confrontation or the gadgets. It is extraordinarily refreshing to see an action film like this, even more when it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and has so much brains.The only minus to The Bourne Supremacy is its shaky, dizzying camera-work. I know a lot of people have complained about this, and usually I would disagree because this kind of cinematography can be a good thing, but it goes slightly overboard in the film at several points.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A tiny bit better but a lot worse,"If you haven't seen ""The Bourne Identity"" then you absolutely should and you should do it before reading this review.""The Bourne Supremacy"" tries very hard to be Bourne again but it doesn't quite succeed for a number of reasons. The soul of the first film was in the relationship between Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente) and the strong action sequences. The sequel has no such relationship and the action scenes though bigger are horrendously filmed with constant shaky cam that often makes it hard to know exactly what is happening. The bad guys are slightly more nuanced but have very poor motivations for their actions.In the end it is only our sympathies for Jason Bourne that saves it from being a disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good sequel, but the camerawork is nauseating","Jason Bourne once again finding himself on the run and having to rely on his training and skills to survive after he is framed for murder.Given that the first film was about Bourne trying to piece his life back together and find out his true identity, the first film was always going to have more of a sense of intrigue about (it was a chase picture as well so it also had the suspense and fast-pace). Supremacy is still successful, but is slightly in the shadow of Identity.To be fair to Supremacy, it does still have enough pace, incident and narrative content to make it enjoyable, but it doesn't offer much that wasn't seen in the first film and without the other strand of Bourne trying to figure out who was it lacks the fun of putting the jigsaw together that was offered in the first film.The cast are good though with a lot of good performances from a solid and reliable cast. The direction is slick and pacey, but once again the film trips itself up with the awful camera work (It wasn't great in the first film, but it seemed to be even worse second time around). This becomes a bigger problem in the fight scenes as half the time you can't problem see what is going on, who has the upper hand etc which takes away some of the enjoyment value within the film.Supremacy is a solid 7 out of 10 all day long, but loses a star for the unbearable camera work.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you are susceptible to motion sickness, beware!Throw in a muddled plot line and this is a stinker of a movie. The ending was very anti-climactic. All in all, very disappointing.Too bad they're bringing the same director back for Ultimatum. I'll pass.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Perhaps the Best Film of the Franchise,"I'm making my way back through the ""Bourne"" movies so I can go see ""Jason Bourne"" which is in theaters now. Last night I watched ""The Bourne Supremacy"". While it's been a while since I've seen ""Ultimatum"", I think ""Supremacy"" may be the best film in the franchise series.There's quite a bit to like about this movie. In it we find that Jason Bourne is still struggling with amnesia in the wake of the events of ""The Bourne Identity"". As the film opens we find that he's making a life for himself far away from the eyes of the CIA, only to be framed by a foreign body such that he winds up on the run from the US government once more. The plot revolves around his attempt to clear his name and bring those responsible for the setup to justice.Unlike the first movie, this film is more re-watchable in that whereas once you've seen the original film you pretty much know where it's going, the ""Supremacy"" is a new chapter that stays fresh even on multiple views. In other words, it's hard to forget the gist of the first movie's plot and its eventual outcome--but the ""Supremacy"" takes the basic concept of the franchise and crafts a tale that could have been told as any chapter in the series. If you've not seen it in a few years, you'll likely find yourself just as engrossed in it upon a second viewing as you were the first go around.I also find that this film just simply has the best plot of the series, and has a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. New characters are introduced that make the film fun and exciting, and by the end of the show you feel like you've got your money's worth.That said, I've given this movie 9/10 stars. I stop short of the perfect 10/10 simply because this is a sequel that a person might be a bit lost on without having seen the first movie. That, and while it's fantastic, it's fantastic in a way that just seems to fall a teensy bit short of iconic in the way that a perfect 10 might. Still a superb movie, though. Extremely well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lots To Like -  A Great Sequel!,"An outstanding sequel to ""The Bourne Identity,"" this movie has a lot of what I like: interesting European scenery, an involving storyline of a man being pursued throughout the film; fun action scenes and very little profanity. Plus, some great actors. Man, there's a lot to like in this film!At first, I was a bit lost. It helps to know the first movie in which the ""hero"" is an ex-CIA agent who, having lost his memory, doesn't recall who he is and why he is being hunted down by friend and foe alike. There are a few great car chases scenes in here but some of the other action stretches credibility as there is no way ""Bourne"" could elude his captors as he did several times here...but it's fun to watch anyway.The herky-jerky camera style may put some viewers off but after I adjusted to it, I didn't mind. It kind of added to the hectic pace of the story. Matt Damon is very good in the lead and Brian Cox is an effective ""bad guy,"" easy to dislike. Karl Urban, a new face, also is interesting as the Russian hit man, even though he has only a few lines.The is one of the few films ever to have Moscow as one of the location sites. In fact, this Bourne two-part series so far is a like at travelogue. Here in the sequel, we see India, Italy ,Germany and Russia.Wonderful entertainment, especially if you are paranoid!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very much a worthy sequel, every bit as good as 'The Bourne Identity'","'The Bourne Identity' was a very pleasant surprise, giving a fairly well-worn genre a much needed freshness. It had its imperfections, but was a very solid and even very good film with much to recommend and introduced a cast-against-type Matt Damon in one of his best roles.It is up for debate as to whether 'The Bourne Identity's' first sequel 'The Bourne Supremacy' is better or weaker. To me, both films are about equal with a couple of improvements at the same time being achieved in 'The Bourne Supremacy'. 'The Bourne Supremacy' may lack the freshness that most of 'The Bourne Identity' had, in terms of basic structure it's a little samey if not exactly routine. The editing, using the shaky camera technique that tends to not sit well with me, does have instances where it does get a bit dizzying and too much. Really didn't like how underused Franka Potente, who brought such a great gutsiness in 'The Bourne Identity' and her and Damon's chemistry doesn't have the chance to register.As aforementioned, along the way there are improvements. The supporting cast have more rounded and better developed characters, with the actors having more to do. The final act in 'The Bourne Supremacy' is more cohesive, more consistent and less cliché-ridden than 'The Bourne Identity' got towards its end. There is also even more substance and emotion thanks to more emphasis on that and the plotting characterisation than the more action-packed (but still intelligent and exciting) 'The Bourne Identity'.Visually, like 'The Bourne Identity', 'The Bourne Supremacy' looks slick and stylish with even more breath-taking locations. The editing and camera-work are not perfect, but mostly the technique did intensify the intensity and atmosphere and didn't make anything incomprehensible, some of it is used more artfully than most times shaky cam is used (too often abused to excessive lengths). When it was a problem it wasn't constant and more than not there wasn't a problem. And this, and in no way is this intended to sound superior or conceited, is coming from an epileptic.Music score is even more dynamic, atmosphere enhancing and more layered this time round, while Paul Greengrass' drama-documentary style and background to his directing is used to full advantage. The script has more prominence here, and is sharp and intelligent without being too talky in a more script and plot heavy instalment. The story is exciting and thrilling with relentless pacing, poignant and dark emotion and with nothing too hard to follow.Despite less of an emphasis the action is very diverting and choreographed and performed beautifully. The final action sequence and the subway scene have a real adrenaline-rush quality, and in no way does the action strain credibility or get too bombastic while still delivering splendidly on the fun and thrills to edge-of-your-seat effect.All the characters engage and are interesting, with Bourne well-established in development and the supporting cast have more to do and in general are better utilised. Matt Damon continues to impress in a departure role that proves to be one of his best. In support, Joan Allen steals every scene she's in and Brian Cox is given room for more menace and dimension this time. Karl Urban is chillingly cold-blooded. Only the underusing of Potente disappoints in this particular element.All in all, a worthy sequel that is just as good (on the same level pretty much) as its very good predecessor. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Born to be Bourne, but no supreme direction","Greetings again from the darkness. I am a huge fan of the first Bourne movie and am now throughly convinced that Matt Damon was truly born to be Bourne. He has always appeared uncomfortable with being an actor (and definitely with being a movie star), so playing Jason Bourne is the perfect match. Bourne is uncomfortable, though, exceptional in most situations whether kicking the crap out of airport security or driving a cool little jeep through the streets of India. Bourne #2 delivers this exciting character into a world where both sides are against him - even his own side.What this one lacks is a great script and professional direction. Director Paul Greengrass seems clueless on shooting action scenes and we rarely know if we are looking at a kneecap, hubcap or ballcap. He seems intent on being stylish rather than capturing the essence of the action. This story was ""based"" on Ludlum's character and the story lacks any real spice. We know where it is headed the first time we see the meeting room with Joan Allen (at her usual ice queen level) and Brian Cox (delivering the best line in the movie - ""puddle""). Franka Potente returns as Bourne's babe, though her screen time and lines are far too limited. On the other hand, Julia Stiles gets just enough with her 6 minutes. Karl Urban is an uber-cool bad guy, but of course, this is Matt Damon's film all the way. Some great scenery shots of the world's great cities, but alas, the direction and screenplay prevent this from being all it can be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Spy Movies Haven't Been This Cool Since The '60s,"THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (3+ outta 5 stars) Nifty follow-up to ""The Bourne Identity"", one of the best action-thrillers to come out in recent years. Even though these movies don't skimp on excitement they also provide plenty of story and character development so that you don't feel you're being bombarded with one idiotic action sequence after another. The storyline isn't quite as gripping as the first... at times it seems to be just repeating itself... but ultimately the movie proves itself to be a worthy successor, thanks to the performances (Matt Damon as Bourne, Brian Cox as the head of a super-secret US spy agency... and the addition of Joan Allen as a determined investigator determined to track down and neutralize Bourne). Franka Potente doesn't have as much to do this time around... but Julia Stiles gets one especially intense scene that shows off her acting skills to the max. Yes, when you get right down to it the movie has a sense of ""been there, done that"" about it... but not very often are movies of this type done with this kind of skill and dedication... spy movies haven't been this cool since the '60s.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding follow-up and with a similar premise to original movie,"Bourne (Matt Damon) on holidays with his girlfriend (Franca Potente) in Goa are interrupted by a nasty killer (Karl Urban). Jason Bourne will have to return Berlin to solve two murders that he's framed . Jason will confront Cia chiefs (Joan Allen and Brian Cox) and he's only helped by a beautiful agent (Julia Stiles).In the film there are shootouts , emotion , suspense ,thrills , driving car pursuits and from start to finish the noisy action is unstoppable. The movie is longtime , two hours and some , though is neither tiring, nor boring , but entertaining ; it's fast-moving and packs a lot of bemusement.
Matt Damon interpretation is excellent as a hard and strong spy without identity . The ¨contender¨ Joan Allen is perfect as a cold Cia principal , as well as Brian Cox , and Franca Potente has a little role and she scarcely plays.The picture bears remarkable resemblance to first installment , as action as storyline . Adequate cinematography by Oliver Wood in semi-documentary style and steadicam and there are several locations : Naples , London ,Moscow ,New York . Unlike The Bourne Identity: Bourne case (2002), screenwriter Tony Gilroy read the book this time and claimed that he did a re-imagination, not an adaptation, of the novel. Gilroy wrote an original script using key elements and roles from the novel as a framework, though he replaced the traditional Carlos The Jackal-type villainous with Kirill. 
The motion picture was well directed by Paul Greengrass ,though it has likeness to the first entry . Producer Frank Marshall selected Paul Greengrass as director after he'd seen Paul's Bloody Sunday (2002). Marshall was after a filmaker who wasn't intrinsically associated with the action genre, feeling that Greengrass would impart an original spin of his own to the screenplay . Greengrass became a great director of action and thriller movies, such as United 93 , Green Zone , Captain Phillips , 22 july . Followed by Bourne Ultimatum , 2006 , with Julia Stiles , David Strathairn Scott Glenn , Paddy Considine , and Jason Bourne 2016 with Matt Damon , Alicia Vikander ,Tommy Lee Jones , Vincent Cassel .The movie will appeal to thriller fans and suspense lovers .

One of my all-time favourite thrillers,"THE BOURNE SUPREMACY takes up where the first film left off, offering a much more rounded movie which easily surpasses the first. Whereas the first film's strength lay in the many action set-pieces which proved that modern Hollywood films could still offer originality and excitement, the sequel focuses on the emotions of the dwindling cast, investing each character with believable motives and a real humanity. The result is a film which offers both top-notch action and drama at the same time, making it THE film of 2004.Matt Damon is far better than in the first film, his Bourne a grieving, violent ex-assassin with a heart this time. The supporting cast members, both old and new, are great as well; Joan Allen as the government chief of operations is good value whilst Brian Cox has material to work with this time. Best of all is relative newcomer Karl Urban, who is quite excellent as the Russian assassin on Bourne's trail, as good a killer as Bourne himself. The film really excels in the camera-work and direction, offering surprise after surprise to make you jolt in your seat and the biggest surprise is how adept director Paul Greengrass is at delivering excellent action and thrills.The opening chase is breathlessly exciting whilst the closing cat-and-mouse game, both on foot and by car, is quite simply the best I've watched. Realism is spot-on and the lack of computer effects – all stunts were performed by Damon, and 'really happened' – make it feel all the more true-to-life. The script offers one or two neat twists and overall the film has a feeling of originality and edginess that so many others lack. A real winner of a movie and one I've watched time and again, enjoying it 100% in each instance.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty great.,"Another solid film in the series. This time Bourne is out for revenge and able to employ the full range of his deadly skills. After tragedy strikes he find himself yet again drawn back to Europe and being sought after by another shady villain who's keen to tie up loose ends. Bourne though just won't lie down and die thankfully. Another key character in the film is herself slowly starting to piece things together. The film moves through the paces quite well but really this top gear towards the end before an a surprising kind of ending, not the one we might expect. The action in this is filmed very well, the soundtrack if anything is better than the first time round, the film is just charged with energy and many of the stunts are very impressive. Where the film doesn't quite work for me is in the audiences is so far ahead of the characters in it, it can be frustrating waiting for them to catch up.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Good As The First One,"Matt Damon returns for the second of the ""Bourne"" movies in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Living in India with his girlfriend (played by Franka Potente), Damon's worst fears comes true when he is pursued by a secret agent (Karl Urban). Believing it is the CIA out to kill him, Damon takes the fight to them, unaware that Urban works for a rich, Russian businessman who wants Damon dead to tie up loose ends that began in the first movie. Complicating matters is that Urban has framed Damon for the deaths of a few CIA agents. With two groups out to kill him, Damon not only has to fight to stay alive, he has to figure out why he is being targeted for termination and by who. Although ""Supremacy"" has a new director, the feel of the first movie carries over to this one — in other words, if you liked ""Identity,"" you will like ""Supremacy."" Fast pacing, frenetic action, a likable hero, and a new revelation of Damon's past all lead to a very entertaining movie.

In this film Marie is not kidnapped, there is no false Jason Bourne, there is no Conklin to work with Jason since he was killed in the first movie instead of being retired, and it begins in Africa instead of northeast America.

Greengrass takes the series to a whole new level,"When we left Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) at the end of the previous film, The Bourne Identity (2002), he had managed to out-think and out- fight the CIA operatives gunning for his head, and had seemingly found a happy ending for himself in Goa, India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). But the laws of franchise film-making mean that the shady types hunting him down the last time still want him dead to tie off any loose ends, and Bourne must again use his CIA- trained super-soldier skills to escape anything coming his way. Dumping director Doug Liman turned out to be the wisest choice the producers made. No disrespect to Liman - Identity was a well-made film - but the hiring of Brit Paul Greengrass took the series to a whole new level.Jason Bourne is still trying to piece together his memories - which appear to him in dreams Manchurian Candidate style - keeping a scrapbook in the hope of unravelling the mystery. One day he notices a man who looks oddly out of place, and Bourne's suspicions turn out to be justified as the man, played by Karl Urban, quickly tries to kill him, accidentally shooting Marie in the crossfire and leaving Bourne once again on the run and trying to figure out the plot against him. As we learn in the opening scene of the film, Bourne has been framed by some Russians for killing CIA agents during an operation overlooked by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to obtain some important documents on one of Bourne's previous kills.The film takes Bourne to Naples, Munich and Moscow, but what makes this series superior to the continent-hopping of James Bond and his quest to bed every woman he comes across is Bourne's skill-set, as well as the gravitas Matt Damon brings to the role. Whether or not he will survive the encounter was never in question (especially with the knowledge that this is part of a book series by Robert Ludlum focusing on the character), but what makes it so thrilling is the way he dodges every bullet fired at him and dispatches every brooding assassin sent to get him. By keeping the action once again grounded, the fight scenes are brutal and messy (Bourne even convincingly beats someone up with a rolled-up magazine). Greengrass brings his famous shaky-cam to the proceedings, and although it occasionally induces sea-sickness, it transports you right in the middle of the fight.Away from the action, a group of suits similar the ones in the previous film employ every spy trick in their power to track and take down their target, while trying to decipher Bourne's actions and motivations. It's incredibly similar to the plot of Identity, and in many ways to the next film, The Bourne Ultimatum, but you'll find it difficult to care that you're essentially watching the same film again when the action is this good. Greengrass also brings a dramatic edge that Liman failed to infuse into his film, with Bourne seeking out the daughter of a married couple he executed while still working for Treadstone in the hope of seeking forgiveness for his actions. That's not to say that Bourne spends the majority of the film pouting and brooding - the film is too fast-paced to stop and catch its breath for too long - but Damon does some great understated work here, and this is the main attraction, at least to me, of the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
About as good as the first,"The first movie left the plot of the book about half way through the movie. I only read about 1/4 of the second book, but it looks like they didn't follow much of it all. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The story picks up 2 years later and Jason and Marie are hiding out in India. Jason has been framed (like the book only it's a different murder) and also targeted for kill by the guy who framed him (I'm not sure why they decided to frame him and then kill him..). Anyway the movie takes off when he goes into Bourne mode and kicks but doing his super spy stuff (which is the best parts of the movie). The must have been problems shooting the chase scenes because the dam camera jumping all over the place was driving me nuts. Hey may say it's for dramatic effect, I say it's because if you don't shoot the scene well you can't be edit it into a dramatic one. I don't know. Anyway the plot was good and the character Pamela Landy reminds me of Harvey Keitel in Thelma and Louise. I suppose they will complete make a new plot for the next movie and call it the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" and not follow any of the third book. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 8/10 (would have been 9/10 if the chase scenes were not so camera jumpy).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I prefer the original,"Matt Damon is a great actor and I love all his movies. That's why I sincerely thought I was going to enjoy the sequel as much as I enjoyed the original. I really love The Bourne Identity and have watched it numerous times. Just a few minutes ago I finished to watch The Bourne Supremacy and wasn't too happy about it. The movie was too fast paced for me. I agree with a previous comment that a great director doesn't need to shake the camera to create scenes of chaos, as they can be done with stationary cameras without leaving the audience dizzy. Well, in my opinion this movie can be watched but it's a lesser film than the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
what a car chase!,"After seeing 'The Bourne Identity' two things were clear to me.First, the screenplay is only slightly based on the novel and/but second it's a great movie. 'The Bourne Supremacy' made the same impression to me.Normally I don't comment on movies but now I want to share my enthusiasm about the car chase in Moscow! I have seen some car chases but this one is really great.The (movie)shots from the inside of the car are fantastic. The plot is thin if you know the book, but it is spectacular.

Bourne To Be Riled,"This was an excellent sequel to the Identity, just as smart and swift and only slightly spoilt by the shaky camera technique so approved of by the gamer generations.Trained assassin in hiding in Asia with partner has to re-engage to find out why his previous employers are apparently gunning for him again. This involves a tortuous and complicated trail of hide and seek and destroy across Europe, from Naples to Berlin to Moscow. And imho it is complex – I was hoping to do something else as well as watch this, some hope! It looked bloody chilly in Moscow, how artists suffer. With concentration turned up there's plenty to savour: the marvellous brevity, endless bone-crunching fight scenes, non-cartoon car chases and explosions, the overall sense of realism. It was the realism and the way everything that happened seemed fresh and immediate that helped me through a convoluted plot unflinching to the sharp and well-judged ending. Nearly two hours went West so fast! I still prefer films to be unshaken and stirring, but it's worth putting up with this pretentious angle of the otherwise excellent camera-work for some decent entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Pure Escapist Entertainment, Worth a Look","I didn't see ""The Bourne Identity"", so this film had to 'stand alone' for me, and it did.The comments by others about the camera work making them nauseous did not apply to me, though some of the quick edits were rather annoying (particularly the film's opening).That aside, I enjoyed this film very much - I give it my Supreme rating of ""0 Wristwatches"" - I was not tempted to look at my watch once while in the theatre!It had suspense, action, and even a few minutes of love.OK, a couple of things went on for too long - the fight with the ex agent (from which Bourne walked away remarkably intact, given the beating he took), and the obligatory car chase. That car took a lickin', but kept on tickin'!In some instances, you'll have to suspend disbelief to get the most enjoyment from this film, but it's not hard to do, once it sucks you in.Matt Damon and supporting cast were well-cast in their roles, and performed admirably.Get some popcorn and see this one.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"The best sequel in my opinion, my number 1 favorite Bourne flick ever!","This is the best sequel in The Bourne Trilogy in my honest opinion. I love the sequel much more than the original movie. The Bourne Supremacy is my number 1 favorite Jason Bourne film, while the second one is The Bourne Identity. It was always movie that I wanted to see the first time I heard about it. It is the second Bourne movie based on the second novel by Robert Ludlum. I love this movie to death it is a brilliant, absolutely brilliant spy action flick! I love this movie because it is fast paced, it is short mostly it is a logical movie that I quickly learn to get the plot about the movie. Trough entire movie Jason Bourne is framed on a run he is alone, tired, with a dead girlfriend and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody down here. That an action hero suppose to be alone single shot down the bad guys that's what Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) did in this movie. I love the lead charterer in this movie, the action, the espionage, Matt shows feelings in this movie. Joan Allen was fantastic as Pamela Landy she was incredible awesome! I love the actress in this movie I love her to death!!Matt Damon once again does a powerful job performing his character and he is brilliant with excellent skills. He has a talent playing Jason Bourne. He's acting ability are very unique and incredible at the screen.Plot: When Jason Bourne is framed for a CIA operation gone awry, he is forced to resume his former life as a trained assassin to survive. Matt Damon returns as the covert operative known as Jason Bourne, who comes out of hiding to expose who is responsible for a series of assassinations that were done in his name.The plot is simple: Kirill (Karl Urban) a Russian Secret Service assassin who works for Russians, kills in Berlin two CIA agents and frames Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) by planting his fingerprints. In India he try's to kill Bourne but he misses and he kills Marie (Franka Potente) Bourne's Love, but misses him. Now Bourne does what he does best, avenge his girlfriend and clearing his name. First he thinks it is Treadstone all over again and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy is the leader of that program but when he find's out that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and the Russians set him up and they are responsible for killing his girlfriend, he goes after them in Russia and he eludes the cops and the CIA operatives. He remembers flashbacks when he killed a young Couple Neski when he was an agent.What I love about this movie: Jason Bourne blows all wide open the Russians, he foils their plans, he foils Abbot's plans with the Russians. He kills in self defense the last member of the Treadstone program, he kills Kirill (Karl Urban) the murderer who killed Marie and he avenges his girlfriend. He confesses he's crimes to Irena Neski(Oksana Akinshina) what he did and he didn't except forgiveness. He is a bad-ass in this movie!I love the actor Karl Urban the actor always appears in a movies that I like: Dredd, Doom and Red. I love the actor I really love him he did a good job. I like the actress Oksana Akinshina as Irena Neski and I love the actress Julia Styles as Nicky Parsons she helps hunting Bourne again but, this time she helps Pamela Landy, I know she has a small role in here, but she is still decent.I love Brian Cox as Ward Abbott he was a good villain in this movie gosh I love this flick to death.Paul Greengrass did a good job directing the sequel that I love to death. This is the movie I have always loved since the first time I saw. I love it.Jason Bourne is the best action hero to come out of the movie/book world and he is a decent likable character. Supremacy is the second in the series, and it definitely meets/tops the first. Jason is still kick-butt awesome, even after two years undercover. Unfortunately, the CIA is on his case again, even after he sort of asked nicely for them to leave him alone (oh, who am I kidding? He beat up the guy and threatened the entire agency).Without giving too much away, let's just say that, in typical Bourne fashion, a can of kick-butt is opened on the bad guys. My favorite bits are the sequence where a consulate guy tries to get answers out of Bourne, the part at the Alexanderplatz with Nicky and Bourne that they faces each other in person for the first time, and the car chase ('cause it's not a Bourne movie without him wrecking as many cars as possible!).Watch this one a few times, and you'll likely be quite moved each time. I'll be surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 10/10 outstanding score and an awesome movie that I love to death.The Bourne Supremacy is a 2004 American-German thriller film starring Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne character. Though it takes the name of the second Bourne novel, its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy.

another good movie ruined by the camera work,"Is it just lazy film making or do they really think the awful camera work is arty?This was a good movie with great acting, well written but unwatchable.During the first 15 minutes I kept moving back in the theater hoping that would help. The camera work made me feel like I was in the front row, blurry and out of focus with the close ups way to close.The action scenes were so choppy it just makes me think the film maker is to lazy to film a cohesive scene, this method has got to make the editing process easy work.During the pointless to long car chase scene it wasn't enough to close my eyes but I had to put my hands over my eyes to keep the headache inducing flicking away.When will they get over their selves???",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This is the Bourne movie I expected.,"'THE BOURNE SUPREMACY' was directed by Paul Greengrass and stars Matt Damon, Joan Allen and Brian Cox. ​Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is living in India when he is framed by Russian agent Kirill (Karl Urban) for the theft of millions from the CIA. Kirill begins to pursue Bourne, intending to assassinate him -- but while Bourne and his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), are on the run, a shot meant for him kills her instead. Vowing revenge, Bourne sets out to prove his innocence and bring the culprits to justice, but he has to evade CIA head Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), who is convinced he is guilty.I actively dislike 'The Bourne Identity'. I was very disappointed by it and don't understand the love for it. Thus, I put off seeing this movie for quite some time. I regret doing so. 'The Bourne Supremacy' trumps its predecessor in pretty much every conceivable way. Franka Potente's character, Marie Kreutz, from the first was probably my least favourite part of the movie and she's gone! I imagine this upset many people but I personally was delirious with it and love the arc change it gives to Bourne. Enough comparisons, let's get into what makes this movie great.The story. I really like the story for this movie but I don't know why. It shouldn't work for me but there is some mystery and government conspiracy that entices me to like it. I know that this is basically a good way to describe the plot of Identity but it felt so much more refined in this one than it did with Identity. I do have issues with the way the film ends, however. It feels kinda anti-climactic and the final scene is very weak, without context from Ultimatum. I wont spoil the ending but I just wasn't very satisfied by it.Damon was good in Identity and I will say he was probably the best part of the film. We see his transformation into Bourne at the end and that is fully explored in this movie, and that benefits Damon immensely. It enables him to give a brilliant performance that delves deep into Bourne's mind and portrays a unique blend of pure, unfiltered emotion and pure, unfiltered awesomeness. Opposing Bourne is my least favourite aspect of this film. The villain is very weak overall and I was not impressed or entertained by them in the slightest. Karl Urban's Kiril was pretty cool and provided a physical opposition to Bourne but had too little backstory and motivation to make me really feel invested in his character or care. I get he is a contract killer and that is fine but I would have liked more explanation to his character and background.Joan Allen was very good as Pamela Landy and was a very welcome addition to the cast. Brian Cox was great as Ward Abbot but I would have liked a little more from him in the long run character wise. The other, more minor supporting cast, all did fine jobs and none of them actively irked me, performance wise.Aside from ONE poorly done action scene in this movie, the movie was well shot, directed and edited together. Greengrass remains the only living director capable of using hand-held cam effectively and, while he perfects the craft later on, utilises the unpopular technique effectively here. There are next to no special effects in this movie which is both phenomenal and admirable for an action film in this day and age and I cannot thank the crew enough for that.This is more minor but I love the score for these movies. It's awesome and amazing and badass and has earned my love. I rarely comment on a film's score unless I like it a lot so good job to the composers.In conclusion, I really liked The Bourne Supremacy. If, like me, you didn't like Identity, I still urge you to give this one a shot. It's got great acting, good action, an interesting story, and while the villain does drag it down a peg or two, it is still a thrilling ride from beginning to end. I'll rate this movie a solid 7 Stalking Bournes out of 10 and definitely recommend you see this great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Yeah!,"this is a great follow-up, though not my favourite in the trilogy.the 'shaky camera' effect might have been a little overused, but still not disturbing to me. Follows pretty well the previous entry. Must say that from here on I also prefer Matt Damon's acting.We have here too plenty of action sequences that are quite exciting, and the same music as in the previous episode, but maybe not that disturbing.Also we must say that there is relatively a small amount of blood and gore, which is good for people sensitive to that.Overall, go, watch it, possibly after seeing The Bourne Identity. it's worth.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Bourne, the human super-human","I walked out of the Bourne Identity about 2 years ago waiting to see the next one, because I knew that the obvious sequel would have to be made.So, two years (or there abouts) later, and all my dreams have come true. The Bourne Supremacy is out, and the man with reflexes like a cat on a cocktail of various uppers is back on the screen. So what can I say about the Bourne Supremacy? Well, I'll tell you why I love Identity.Identity was such a breath of fresh air. A spy film where the hero has flaws. He is super-human, he will win at the end, but you knew, this was going to be painful. The player is fractured and flawed. He suffers, and he doesn't even know why. Haunted by flashes of his past, he tries to piece together what has happened to him.So how has this film managed to stack up? Well, we are again with the human super-human. I have to point to one of my favourite little details of the film to illustrate this. Bourne jumps from a bridge and hurts his leg, this is about half way through the movie, and this sore knee has to be endured for the remainder. Also, you know this is special in the opening few minutes. Bourne wakes up after a nightmare and complains to his girlfriend of a headache, she is concerned about his temperature. Could anyone imagine Bond, James Bond having to endure a headache? Or Vin xXx Diesel having to nurse a sore knee? I doubt it. So through out the film we are reminded that this super hero is still human, and he can and may still fail, leading to a heightened sense of danger and a far better thrill then the other afore mentioned heroes.I also have to salute the car chases. For my money, they were on a par, well, perhaps one under, films such as Ronin. Bournes supremacy with roadmaps still brings a smile to my face, and hurtling through ancient cities at 80 MPH is fantastic.The direction is at times Hitchcockian, letting you imagine the death of all characters, and in fact, no deaths are shown. Indeed, I felt far more emotional involvement with Bourne as he reluctantly has to dispatch a ""Baddie"" then I have with other screen heroes. Daemon is mesmerising here, his face contorted with effort and venom is still able to show regret and sorrow for what had to happen.As a fan of twenty four, I love this work. It had all the classic 24 elements, Shaky hand held, massive and bureaucratic government agencies, various twists and turns. I did find the story slightly linear, but this is no problem, there are slight detours that are of interest. I did not, as some have said, find this an unintelligent movie. It is not a movie which feels it has to pamper the most unintelligent wit.All that said, the film does have some flaws. Hand held does go over board at times, esp. during the fight sequences (in one of the fight sequences, Bourne grabs a magazine and rolls it up, this took me a few seconds to figure out). Also, it is not a movie for the action junkie. There are some fantastic moments of cheek on the part of Bourne, but it is more of a super sleuth movie the xXx or Bond. More of an investigation then a lit match in a petrol can affair.Still, a fantastic movie, worthy of the book and the previous film.My rating, 9/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
with a Brit director we get a much more traditional American thriller,"How ironic, the first Bourne film had an unmistakable European feel to it, with its Paris streets and 'real' people relating to each other and struggling to survive and here with a Brit director we get a much more traditional American thriller. It's still a fairly exciting ride but the camera-work is too self consciously 'arty' and the dialogue is crap. I agree with others that some of the fight scenes are so badly shot, with the priority to make them look 'cool' that it's often hard to tell what is happening to who. It's not down and out bad but it seems such a shame after the surprise pleasure of the first that this should seem to slip back to being mundane instead of building on the good features of the original. For me it was a much better idea to have Damon relating to others as the film progressed rather than just a mean and puzzled loner who goes all soppy at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Witty and Thrilling,"Not just thrilling and action packed, but in this time when Hollywood movies like to go too much over the top, The Bourne Supremacy was able to deliver some hot- blooded thrill while being decently realistic(or at least convincing).With Marie dying early on in the movie, it was able to capture the viewers emotion to go on this journey with Jason Bourne. Add in some nice twist and witty dialog, this is one of the best action movies I've ever watched.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Review Of ""The Bourne Supremacy""","In 2004 film ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is the Paul Greengrass-directed sequel to the acclaimed Doug Liman film ""The Bourne Identity"". The story follows the amnesiac titular character (Damon) as he attempts to find out more about his past as a black ops agent for the CIA. One of the things I noticed first about this film was the film's shift in aesthetics. Though Director Paul Greengrass' use of hand-held cameras has often come under considerable disagreement from some critics and fans, I feel that this aspect of the film really sort of adds to the intensity of a lot of the action and dialogue sequences. While the camera-work may have changed, there are certain things about the film that stayed close to what made the first movie so successful. For one, Matt Damon's performance is once again terrific, and with his portrayal, the audience really gets to see some sides of Jason Bourne that they might not gotten to see in ""Identity"". John Powell's score is really well done, as it uses all of the themes from ""Identity"", but develops upon those themes so that we feel as though we are watching a different chapter in Bourne's life. Tony Gilroy's screenplay contains really compelling and entertaining dialogue and a very interesting adaption of Robert Ludlum's story. The action sequences are spectacular as well, for they once again showcase Jason Bourne's incredible ability to overcome immense odds with the skills he learned in the CIA. All in all, I felt that ""The Bourne Supremacy"" was a worthy installment in the ""Bourne"" franchise that upped the emotion and action to an impressive degree.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Really good action flick, but....","I loved the first movie, The Bourne Identity. But at the end of that movie, you kind of got the idea that Bourne settled down with the lady of his dreams and lived happily ever after.This sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, had to untie the nice ending of the first flick to make a bunch of loose ends, which it then proceeded to tie together again by the end of this movie.That's ok, though. It made for a really cool action flick, complete with car chases, crashes, foot chases, fights, and lots of shooting. That on top of the mystery and intrigue.There were two things I didn't care for, however. One was that Julia Stiles' part was too small - again. Most importantly, however, is that the cinematography was absolutely horrid. It looked like a home video, especially during the fight scenes and car chases. It made my head spin, and there was no way to visually keep up with the action. Even during the office sequences, the images were blurred and shaky. I guess they figured they wouldn't need to hire a choreographer for the fight sequences if only the camera were shaky enough to disguise all the mistakes of the actors.That said, I still highly recommend the movie if you like action and mystery. Those of you who are prone to motion sickness, however, should take some Dramamine first.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fans of Identity won't be Disappointed,","The Bourne Supremacy is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.Matt Damon is back and as great as ever in his second outing as Jason Bourne,and his acting is very inspired and you don't feel like he did this sequel for the paycheck any bit.Fans of the first movie,Bourne Identity,certainly won't be disappointed,it's just as good,if not better.Idenity had a lot of scenes that were very calm and consisted of pretty lengthy dialogue,this didn't bother me but I liked that this movie was pretty much action and suspense all the way through,it kept me excited and at the edge of my seat.My only problem with Supremacy in comparison to Identity is that Bourne is not as likable,there are several scenes,particularly towards the end,where he comes across as a simply bad person,which at times was difficult since we are suppose to support this character,but it wasn't a huge issue.Action packed and intense,the Bourne Supremacy is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or thriller.Jason Bourne is once again forced to take up his former life as a trained assassin when a CIA operation goes wrong.Best Performance: Matt Damon",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Finally, when the movie finished I had an empty feeling that meaning that it ended to abruptly. The Russian element was very vague. However, Hollywood needs to make a lot more movies like the Bourne series which are set in Europe. Action/ Thriller movies set in Europe are so much better than those set in the States.

But the longer the story goes those gaps are filled and it's just done in a really spectacular way. If you're new to the Bourne series, you'd better start with the first one, because they are of course all linked together. The endings in both movies and books leaves you without a clue of what will happen next, which is also common between the scenes. I also like how it stands out from the usual type of productions.

Worthy sequel with more humanity.,"Verdict? How does it compare to the Bourne Identity? BS is a darker film, but certainly has more humanity. One of the most pivotal moments in the film involves a touching scene in which Jason faces up to the ghosts in his past by confronting the daughter of one of his previous 'kills.' He recognises the need to know and understand-that the truth however unpleasant is the only thing that can truly define who we are. The assassinated man's daughter needs to know the truth and Jason needs to tell her. As Jason's fragments of memories continue to filter down through flashback and revealed information, you can see the healing process at work even clearer as he staggers through the necessary sequence of denial, acceptance, and finally responsibility, from which he can only emerge a stronger person.Immediate impressions as I left the cinema? Plenty of car crashes. Julia Stiles looks beautiful. Russian police cars frankly are RUBBISH! And does Mr Jason Bourne ever get any sleep??I enjoyed it. 8/10",,Anonymous,Mystery

"A shaky cam of goons, boring meetings, and saying ""Bourne!"" a lot","Matt Damon returns as the near mute superspy Jason Bourne in the Bourne Supremacy *Ha!* The only thing this movie is supreme at is making lanky actors look like assassins by shaking the camera so much you can only guess someone is being punched by the sound fx. Every hand to hand melee is filmed like the camera was taped to a motorboat engine and put on full throttle. It's annoying and I'm surprised Greengrass dialed it even higher in the sequel. Seriously the camera even shivers during simple questioning scenes. I can only assume to leave some editing room for the director to put in some punching sounds in case he wanted to turn Bourne's very words into invisible boxing gloves that can take out those over-the-hill interrogators.Remember those James Bond knockoffs from the 70's that had the main actor go through a series of generic action challenges just to prove to the audience that the character was as good as James Bond? Well, Bourne goes through the same dance steps like a kid doing his dad's dance routine. Except this kid doesn't realize he looks like a dweeb. Supremacy carries the false identity of all those older knockoff films, and expects us to overlook this badly disguised spy movie. Matt Damon barely has to spout out any lines because the movie is on rails. This movie plain old uses the time tested spy checklist for the story. Nameless hit-man with no dramatic arc? Check. Car chase? Check. (With junky Euro go cars nonetheless.) Overly-romantic subplot with cranky girlfriend? Check. Experienced government officials terrified of the ultimate spy who can walk out of any detainment, even police stations? Check. Said spy having amnesia over his mysterious past which he receives in ever-revealing and eye popping flashbacks triggered by infiltrating a network of creeps? Check.Been there. Done that. Even the ol' snap the gas line in the apartment as the bad guys rush in is used here. You would think that by now movie goons would be careful not to enter into section apartments using natural gas lines. Must be horrible for normal folks who, say, have a gas leak, have lost their sense of smell and burn their toast or something cause the house is bound to explode. The only thing surprising is the new girl brought into the story by way of Julia Stiles, who is a government psych assistant who does nothing but cry because she's still an intern, basically. I think she looks up one file in the whole movie and between the regulatory mumbo jumbo you realize that's her purpose. To kitten talk Bourne and to read a file everyone probably has read in this agency. But even more irritating is the fact that she looks like she could be the sister of Bourne's last girlfriend!Anyway the cast of government agents chasing Bourne do little more than setup an HQ, kiss Bourne's butt, then move the HQ somewhere else when Bourne evades their grasp. While they're at HQ they spend their time talking about technical procedures and saying the name Bourne every three sentences. The dialogue would go something like this: Joan Allen: ""We need to put out a communique to the French consulate for a wire tap. For Bourne."" Brian Cox ""Bourne is not just another target. Bourne is like a wildcat with claws of fire."" The script does disservice to heavy hitters like Brian Cox and Joan Allen when all it gives their characters to do is stand around weaving myths of Jason Bourne like he's freakin' Gilgamesh. I like Joan Allen as an actress. It's sad to see her in a role that basically treats her like a secretary trying to avoid retirement. A little irony in that I'm writing this on Joan Allen's birthday. Oh well, I'm pretty sure I've forgotten major turning points in the plot. I don't really mind though. Between all the editing spasms I barely remember that Matt Damon's in it at all.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne takes a magazine to a knife fight and wins,"I didn't like this quite as much as the first movie but it's still super good and an excellent follow up in terms of story and well, everything else too.Bourne still can't remember who he is and is still on the run, hiding out in Goa India and having flashbacks when the agency frames him and... does some other nasty stuff. He heads back to Europe (Berlin & Russia this time) and then goes gunning for agency higher ups, re-entering the life he had wanted to leave behind.The final car chase sequence with Karl Urban (as the bad guy) is probably one of the best I have ever seen, it kinda blew my mind, absolutely amazing. And my favourite fight scene would have to be when Bourne takes a magazine to a knife fight and wins, just awesome! 11.13",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Just as good as the original movie, Matt Damon makes a welcome return as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy.","The Bourne Supremacy is a welcome follow up to the 2002 box office hit The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon makes a welcome return as former CIA assassin Jason Bourne who continues to be haunted by his past. Paul Greengrass takes over the director's chair from Doug Liman and he ensures that The Bourne Supremacy is just as good, if not better, as the original Bourne movie.The Bourne Supremacy picks up 2 years later from the original movie where Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, Saving Private Ryan) and Marie Kreutz (Franke Potente, Run Lola Run) have begun a new life in Goa, India. Jason Bourne is still being haunted by flashbacks from his past including the murder of a Russian Politician and his wife in a hotel room. Jason Bourne is brought to the attention of no-nonsense Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, Face/Off) after Bourne's fingerprint was planted at an interrupted meeting in Berlin which resulted in the deaths of two CIA agents at the hands of Russian assassin Krill (Karl Urban, Dredd). Krill pursues Bourne and Marie in Goa which results in a fateful encounter which sees Bourne seeking out why his past has not left him alone. With Pamela Landy and shadowy Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox, Manhunter) investigating why Bourne has seemingly come out of hiding, Bourne must yet again revisit his old life to find out who is after him, why has he been framed, and will his past ever go away.Matt Damon returns to his best role as Jason Bourne and wasn't it awesome to see him return. It was also fantastic to see several cast members return for the sequel include Franke Potente, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Gabriel Mann, and in flashbacks Chris Cooper. Joining the cast for the ride include Karl Urban (excellent as the main villain Krill), Joan Allen, and in small roles Martin Csokas and Michelle Monaghan.Director Paul Greengrass ensured that The Bourne Supremacy was just as good as the first by keeping the story flowing, the suspenseful action engaging, and audiences glued to their seats from start to finish. When I first saw The Bourne Supremacy, I thought it has lost a bit of impact with the irritating shaky camera. Numerous viewings later, I have reevaluated my opinion and I've thoroughly enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy each and every time I've watched it. The Bourne Supremacy was a welcome addition to the Bourne series and it comes as no surprise that it was very popular amongst audiences and critics making it a very successful hit at the box office in 2004.The Bourne Supremacy can be added to the list of sequels that has been just as good as the original movie. Sequels such as Mad Max 2 (1981), Aliens (1986), Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), The Dark Knight (2008) are some perfect examples and The Bourne Supremacy earns a well deserved spot on the coveted list.The Bourne Supremacy is still an excellent movie from start to finish by continuing to stick to its theme of staying true to its role a thinking man's action movie with spectacular stunts, fight scenes, action sequences and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride, rightfully putting many no brainer action movies to shame. The Bourne Supremacy showed no signs of going stale or repeating itself by continuing to expand on the original movie and aiming to go one better. Fans of The Bourne Identity will not be disappointed.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A thoroughly enjoyable and intense movie,"I might not be a movie guru or experienced critic, but I don't think many movies are worth 6-8.00 dollars in theaters and I was completely satisfied with paying for ""Supremacy"" on the big screen. I watched the Bourne Identity on DVD and thought it was pretty good. I had some doubts about seeing the Supremacy in the theater because of the danger of crappy sequels. I was pleasantly surprised that this sequel was just as enjoyable and entertaining if not more then the first one. After I was done watching it I was even a little sad because they might not continue the story.Matt Damon doesn't play Jason Bourne, he IS Jason Bourne. Damon makes the character seem so real you feel like you know him and with both Bourne Identity and Supremacy when it's over you feel like you have to continue going through the story of Bourne's life.This film is definitely worth seeing!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not nearly as good as the first one.,"It's hard to evaluate a sequel without referring to the original film. In most cases, it seems the original is the better film. Maybe that's because of unfair expectations, or maybe it's difficult for the actors to get back into character, or maybe it's the storyline and script. Who knows. In the case of the Bourne films, it's probably all of the above, and maybe more, but the first one is by far the better of the two films.I thought there was a lot to like about the Bourne Identity. The acting was solid, the storyline was very interesting, and it was a very enjoyable film, and the sequel just doesn't match it. In fact, I'd be willing to say that there isn't much difference between the Bourne Supremacy and any other random summertime action flick. It was flat, and it had far too much emphasis on the chase and action scenes. The script wasn't as good, and the characters were not nearly as interesting. At times, the storyline was too predictable and cliché.In summary, the Bourne Supremacy is fine as an action film, but as a follow-up to the Bourne Identity, it was not very good. I'm glad I saved myself the money and didn't see it in the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This new episode advances in the construction of the character Bourne with more adrenaline, reason and intelligence, taking the direction of this first trilogy to a safe path","Continuing the new franchise produced by Universal, the sequel to the surprising first film based on the character Jason Bourne arrives in theaters. Again based on the book of the same name by Robert Ludlum, this time, Doug Liman (now only producer) leaves and Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) enters. Contrary to the positive outcome of The Bourne Identity, a previous film in the franchise, the first episode directed by Paul Greengrass begins a very different narrative from Doug Liman, both in the most pessimistic mood and in the way of driving the camera, with close-ups and recordings at angles closed, moved by a trembling hand emulating the pseudo-reality seen in documentaries.2 years ago Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) thought he had left his past behind as a cold and calculating killer created by Treadstone. Since then he has maintained an anonymous existence, giving up the stability of having a home and moving in with Marie (Franka Potente) whenever the threat of being discovered arises. When an agent appears in the village where Jason and Marie live, they have no alternative but to flee. However, a new international chase game requires Jason to confront old enemies.Bourne Supremacy has a structure very similar to its predecessor, but here, the action gains much more prominence, walking in parallel with the plot of conspiracy, betrayals and mystery behind the events. This second part already begins in the middle of the crossfire, two years after the events of the first film, with a CIA mission led by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) being sabotaged by Kirill, a Russian agent played by Karl Urban. The clues planted by Kirill, however, lead Landy to believe that Bourne was responsible. Cut to Goa, India, and we see Bourne waking up from a nightmare made up of fragments of memories that refuse to surface completely. Tormented, he gets up to be immediately comforted by Marie (Franka Potente), still at his side. His apparent rest from the eternal escape initiated in the first film is about to end, however, as Kirill arrives to eliminate Bourne. Their reasons are unclear, but the result of the clash is the murder of Marie, in a touching scene that echoes Bourne's early demeanor, floating in the water. With his mind running at full speed, the super-spy leaves without hesitation to take revenge on his former commanders, whom he considers responsible.Damon is even more at ease like Bourne. He has an air of credibility that few action heroes have. He is no longer the complete member of the previous film, but remains haunted by a past that, if on one side he does not completely remember, on the other he does not want to remember. The conflict is visible on the actor's face, even when he turns entirely into an efficient killing machine. Despite a short time on screen with Marie (Franka Potente) in this sequence, we managed to care for the couple. Even with little screen time, Potente manages to show that his character is with Jason by choice, participating in this dangerous mess that is her boyfriend's life precisely because she loves him. This is an extremely powerful notion passed through the film. Jason, despite his condition, sees Marie as the only good thing in his life and the chemistry between Damon and Potente reinforces this. Brian Cox also repeats his role as Ward Abbott, gaining more relevance in the plot. Despite being ""a patriot"", he knows that he made mistakes, but, unlike Jason, he does not seek redemption, but throws the dirt under the biggest rug he can find. Joan Allen's character serves as the exact counterpoint to Cox's character, aiming to expose all the agency's corruption, which creates great moments between her character and Abbott. She manages to be an excellent counterpart to Damon because his Pamela Landy shows professionalism and calm in the same measure as Jason Bourne. And although the two never share screen time, the rapport between them is sensational.
The first episode, although interesting, kept in its formula many similarities with other productions of the genre. It is the type of work that improves over time, as the characters and their conflicts develop with the viewer. Everything works well, with logic, humor and depth. But one truth is unquestionable: Bourne Supremacy is even better than the previous one, and a lot due to the direction of Paul Greengrass. Although the story is a little less contagious, the director compensates with his excellent handling of the camera and efficient cuts that, even in the fight scenes, manages to enhance the choreography and performances. The chase sequences in India, which culminate in the death of an important character, are literally breathtaking. The scenes in Berlin masterfully show the more cerebral side of the plot in a game of hunting and hunter of rare intelligence. Finally, we still have a climax in Moscow, in tense and action-packed scenes. The scene of the chase aboard a taxi through the streets that culminate in a city tunnel is among the best of its kind that year.This continuation follows the proposal of its predecessor to maintain its action scenes in the 'real world': here, no fight was fought with the aid of wire wires or' turbinated' through computers. When Bourne leaves for the fight, the blows sound real and painful - and the stupendous car chase that occurs in the third act of the plot succeeds in the paradox of being perfectly credible at the same time that it makes us think: 'Incredible! '. The film is just not interesting anymore because director Paul Greengrass tried to create an atmosphere of super-realism for him, showing the camera always shaky, especially in the action scenes and in the main car chase scene (the film could not fail to have one, as in the original). The intention was good, but it is a fact that he exaggerated reasonably, since in some moments it is practically impossible to understand what is happening on the screen.The script, signed by Tony Gilroy, is accurate and does not waste time on unnecessary explanations, even when new characters are introduced. The viewer, for the first half hour, and very much in line with what the characters are experiencing, does not know exactly what is happening until Bourne on one side and Landy on the other start, independently, to assemble the complex puzzle. If in the other adventure, Bourne wanted to find out who he really was while trying to avoid being murdered by the old bosses, now the scene is different - hunting, he became a hunter! Intentionally framed as the perpetrator of an attack in Berlin, Bourne must return to action when his refuge in India is no longer safe. Only the prologue makes it clear that this is not a conventional script and that preconceived structures have been thrown overboard to give rise to a creative and innovative plot. Without further restraints, the protagonist turns into a lion and goes to fight to find out why he is still being chased and who is behind his head this time. Simultaneously chased by the CIA and Russian thugs, Jason Bourne never finds a second of peace, wherever he is - and when I say 'wherever he is', you can believe it: following the best tradition of productions starring 007.Bourne Supremacy includes scenes shot in no less than five countries: India, Holland, Italy, Germany and Russia, adding an additional attraction to the spy's adventures. The best part is that the filmmakers avoided tourist landmarks and urban clichés and show little-known details of these cities. This is most evident in the last two, thanks to the incredible scenes that take place on the Berlin subway and, above all, the magnificent car chase on the streets of Moscow, involving an injured Jason Bourne, Kirill and the local police. We feel, thanks to Paul Greengrass' superb camera work, in the action and not as mere spectators. And that owes much to the editing work of Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse, Oliver Wood's photography and John Powell's score. As they were present in the first film in the franchise, both knew how to continue what they did previously, allowing the viewer to start the film by seeing and listening to a universe they were already familiar with.This sequence is a rare example of a blockbuster with a brain. Its political plot is relevant and connected with the current international political scenario, the interpretations are intense. This new episode advances in the construction of the character Bourne, adding details in his personality and giving greater verisimilitude to his figure with more adrenaline, reason and intelligence, taking the direction of this first trilogy to a safe path and which has everything to reach its peak in the third Jason Bourne's adventure in theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have been better,"I like the movie's story, plot twists, and everything else about the movie, EXCEPT the camera shots. The director used hand-held camera for lots of the shots to give it a sort of gritty documentary appearance, and what happens? You feel like your watching some 8 year-old swinging a camera around trying to get all the action in as little amounts of shots as possible. The first movie Bourne Identity was much better than this for that reason. However, if the camera work doesn't bother then you will like this one as much, if not possibly better, than the original. Jason has lots of new tricks in this movie and several plot twists insure to keep the viewer attention on him.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It shakes so bad that you have to strain to see what's on the screen. You have to crane your neck left and right to focus on what's happening. It felt like watching a ballgame during a key moment only to have the dummy in front of you stand up and obstruct your view. Please, if a third installment is in store, please scrap this camera technique. I'm sure many will thank you for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Use a tripod!,"For the most part, the plot and action sequences are good, although it's one of those movies where the director wants to make the audience feel as if it's part of the action, rather than observing. So, much of the time, you can only tell that it's a (insert fight, car chase, shootout here) but since the camera moves so much, you can't tell much more than that. Again, I understand the director is trying to make the audience feel uncomfortable, quickening the pace, etc etc... my only question is why? Didn't that trick fade out of style about 1998?Walking out of the movie, I felt borderline queasy, the kind of feeling you get getting off the Zipper at the fair.At first, I thought the shaky, hand-held camera-work was a part of the initial sequence, thinking it would go away. But no! It's there the entire length of the film.Joan Allen is smart and sexy, a far cry from the housewife in Face/Off. Matt Damon is also good, and proves himself a much better actor than his buddy Affleck (again). And Julia Stiles makes a nice turn, expanding on her role from the first film.Of course there are some plot holes and some coincidences that make you roll your eyes slightly, but it's a summer blockbuster, what do you expect?Overall a quality sequel, but if you get motion sick, wait for video so you can hit pause.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Renamed Bourne of the Shakey Cam....,"The story was great but unfortunately the way this movie was shot was like that of a film student who had just spent a weekend watching pretentious Independent films. Don't get me wrong the Director from the first Bourne movie had a very Indy background and I like Indy but this movie will suffer because of the shakey shooting style. The fight scene in the apartment looked like they let Mat shoot the scene while he was fighting, the shot was so tight most of the time it was distracting.In my opinion the camera is supposed to be transparent to the film not apparent to it.

"A slightly lesser, but nevertheless eminently watchable sequel","In this sequel to the well-received BOURNE IDENTITY, two years have passed and Jason Bourne is still trying to piece together events from his past. However, his relatively peaceful, off-the-grid existence is disturbed when he is framed for murder and drawn out of hiding. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY takes what worked about the first film and builds upon it here. There's more of the great action sequences and intelligence agency intrigue, which actually forms the basis for this movie's plot. The curtain is also pulled back further on Bourne's past and a few more questions are answered. In general, this film stacks up with the previous one, at least on a narrative level. Still, the change in director from Doug Liman to Paul Greengrass is noticeable. Paul Greengrass has a distinct visual style that makes extensive use of hand-held/shaky camera-work, which has mixed results here. One instance of where it does work is early on in a tense, score-less hand-to-hand fight in an apartment. The camera-work there gives a sense of chaos and a feeling of disorientation that adds to the drama of the scene. One example where it doesn't quite work is a climactic car chase through the streets of Moscow. Here, there is a noticeable drop in comprehensibility, and the editing is rather hit-or-miss. As far as the cast is concerned, everyone gives a good performance as usual. In the last entry, I complained slightly about Julia Stiles' character, but here her performance is improved although her character isn't given too much screen time here either. Since the plot revolves around intelligence agency intrigue and eastern European geopolitics (to an extent), those roles are somewhat expanded. There is also a new character played by Joan Allen who serves as Deputy Director. Her presence adds another layer to the proceedings, and adds some additional complexity to story elements already established in the first film. At times it felt like her character was being mistreated simply because she was a woman, but those types of organizations do tend to be ""good ole boys clubs"" (or whatever the proper term is). The score this time around is mostly just as good, although there were some techno aspects to it that I didn't like as much. However, they did use the same Moby song during the closing credits that they used in the first one. Overall, I thought this was an excellent, if slightly lesser, sequel. Even though the directing reins changed hands, it felt like the overall continuity was kept. I definitely recommend seeing this, especially if you're a fan of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fast-moving fun ride,"I really enjoyed this chapter and am hoping for more. The action was fast-paced, and the violence was not gratuitous. The plot was legitimate (within the context of the story) and Damon's persona was once again impressive.My only criticism is the big car chase through the tunnel. My guess is that the Lada taxi would probably have fallen apart after the first whack, and that the scene went on too long. The great thing about the first movie's car chase was that it was wild, but somehow realistic. They didn't need to get big and splashy - i.e. Hollywood - this time around.The locations were terrific and the editing was good. The build up of tension was such that I got nervous even when Bourne went into the bathroom just to wash up!All in all, I really enjoyed the ride and am hoping for at least one more.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Also Matt Damon does a good job playing Jason Bourne, and Joan Allen is good as his pseudo-nemesis CIA-deputy director Pam Landy.The story is that Jason Bourne is framed for a hit and the man who does the hit also tries to kill Jason.

All of which drives the highly trained assassin to the conclusion that the CIA have screwed up his life for the last time - and he sets out for answers, and revenge! It hasn't quite the style of the first film, but as sequels go it's a strong, gripping effort with Brian Cox reprising his role as ""Ward Abbott"" and Joan Allen entering the fray as the CIA Deputy Director ""Landy"" who sees ""Bourne"" as a lethal threat who must be apprehended and/or eliminated at all costs.

Awful Awful Awful,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The camera was hand held and shot close throughout the entire movie. The resulting image was shaky and quite nauseating. Using all hand held shots works most of the time. When the shots are from one continuous viewpoint, and involve very few cuts, it can make you feel like you are part of the action. Not so in this movie.Since the camera was always so close to the subject, you could never quite tell what was happening. A gun fired! But who was holding it? As well as the notorious floorboards shot in the car chase scenes. I don't know why the director thought throwing in a shot of Matt Damon's feet on the floorboards multiple times was a good idea, but they are there. Jason pushed the accelerator! The editing was terrible. In the action scenes, no shot was longer than 3 frames. In the calm scenes, no shot was longer than 15 frames. Why? Maybe cutting that often would have been okay if the camera hadn't been so shaky, the frame wasn't always so tight, or maybe if the director wasn't constantly violating the 180 degree rule in order to add more confusion to an already confusing mess.The lighting was the worst I've seen in a long time. Simply because they didn't use any lights. I was praying for the nighttime scenes to end so I could see what was going on again. Of course, when I could see, I didn't want to because it made me want to puke from the camera shake.The story was okay. Standard action fare. The story followed too many characters around for me to really care about any of them. All I really wanted was to see (or at least hear) Jason Bourne to knock everybody unconscious.My advice is to see something else. Not some garbage that was obviously made by a high school amateur. How about James Bond?",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Exceptional - the best we'll get unless somebody picks up Adam Hall's ""Quiller"" novels","Most spy/action movies suck hard - this is probably the best one since ""Marathon Man."" Super sharp, super smart with absolutely breathless action, THE best car chase of all time and a pitch-perfect supporting cast; are there any working actors better than Joan Allen and Brian Cox?I haven't seen ""The Bourne Identity"" but I feel as if I have, due to the extremely skillful use of flashbacks in this film. Greengrass' ""put you right in the center of the explosion"" approach is perfect for this material. Fabulous score, too. This is absolutely how the spy/action genre film should be done; what are the DePalma apologists who still think ""Mission: Impossible"" was a good movie going to do after seeing this?I'm surprised the movie did good business, considering the general collapse of moviegoer intelligence over the past 30 years; you must pay attention or you will be left behind. It's worth expending a few brain cells on something this accomplished.Extracting a movie this good from the labored, uninspired writing of Robert Ludlum is quite a feat. The same team of filmmakers could create a series of superthrillers, each one more intense than the last, by grabbing the ""Quiller"" series by the late Adam Hall (who also wrote ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" under another name). The Quiller books may be the most heart-pounding espionage novels ever written.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Action Packed.,Well I think this movie was exellent on an action packed scale. I think that this should be number 1 at the box office for a long time.

I rented the first one and it was great. I think this movie was great stuff and being that Matt Damon was a great role for this I think this should be a grammy.

Another lacklustre sequel...,"I'll keep this short and to the point: THE BOURNE SUPREMACY was a total letdown. None of the good elements from the original were maintained (except the acting; Matt Damon is still good, and Joan Allen and Julia Stiles do well). The screenplay is weak, the action sequences are either boring or so poorly edited they feel incoherent and nauseating, the character development/interaction is stale, the music is uninteresting, and the plot is paper-thin. It just doesn't live up to the intelligence seen in THE BOURNE IDENTITY.Yet another tasteless sequel. I was expecting more, since THE BOURNE IDENTITY was so good, but the change of director was unwarranted. Paul Greengrass (of UNITED 93 fame) feels the need to infuse this movie with needless and hackneyed action just because it falls in the genre action thriller. The lessons learnt from THE BOURNE IDENTITY's success were sadly lost. On a positive note, the final car chase sequence is worth watching because it is more engaging than the other action sequences, and because it comes at the end of the film, leading up to some closure. At the very least it's a bit of a reward for having to sit through the film...6/10 is a bit generous. If it were a stand-alone picture, I would have given THE BOURNE SUPREMACY a 5, but I still have fond memories of the original. 2.5 stars (out of 4). See it, or not. If you plan on watching out the trilogy I guess you need to see this as well, and not just the two superior ones. But be warned...monotony and tedium await...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Identifiably Supreme.,"I had moderate hopes for this film. The first was stylish as hell but i thought dealt with the whole past issue superficially. This film is incredible - perfect structure (that sounds cynical but it has perfect climax on a climax - never too short or too long), superb acting from all round, and great direction, music, dialogue. While I'm a sceptic of constant hand-held etc Greengrass chooses it and sticks to it throughout - the film has its own style. The film shows Bond up for what is has become - kids stuff. It not only works because of the zeitgeist thing - anti-authority, etc. - but mainly because of the sheer intelligence of it, not just the plot but the little things, the idiosyncrasies, that Bond has lost - the hair on the door. Everything that Bourne does is done with measure and skill and it is highly plausible that he is the best of the best - better than Sam Fisher, and not simply the way I've been playing with him (im terrible at Splinter Cell, no ability whatsoever).To confirm: i cannot play Splinter Cell. But i reiterate this only to emphasise how spectacularly good this film is. 10/10. film of the year? very likely. ends with a decent line and a moby tune- what more could you possibly ask for not so simply from film, but from life.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Delightfully escapist,"The second movie in this installment confirms everything that made the first one good, especially its courage to be original. Many action movies exceed in their efforts to make their protagonist look cool; Jason Bourne, on the other hand, is more intelligent than ""cool"" and this is a joy to witness. Bourne does not spend time with one-liners before the kill, like many action heroes do.The movie respects the audience enough to let them draw their own conclusions and to leave enough mystery to be intrigued, but not too much so as to avoid confusion. There are at least a few instances where Bourne does something and we do not know exactly why, but we see the aftermath in a couple of minutes. These are very small details and certainly they do not make this film ""intellectual"", but they provide enough intellectual stimulation, as if to tell us not to turn off our brains. As a consequence, ""Supremacy"", similarly to ""Identity"", manages to appeal to a wide audience, by being creative and exciting at the same time.To top it all off, Damon delivers a very good performance, which manages to provide the right amount of character in a mostly plot-driven flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The first was better,"I am a fan of espionage thrillers from series like these ones or James Bond and so on. The first Bourne I liked better because there was much more substance in the story than in this one. I mean there were not as many intriguing elements as in the last and it was about all a predictable cat-and-mouse-thriller. Then the camera work was not so bad as written here but I hope the responsibilities will make it better next time. The picture could have been better and sometimes it was too fast paced with many images cut and mixed but without losing the point. The soundtrack and audio effects were brilliant made and well adapted to each scene; just cool. Matt Damon did as usual a very great job here. The car chases are a real adrenalin push and they are rare in this genre. What I liked too were the many setting places as Naples, India, Moscow, Berlin, Munich, Amsterdam or New York. If you like action thrillers this is for you. For all these reasons I give 6.75/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The first movie I have ever walked out on.,"I can't tell you about the quality of the plot or acting in this movie because I walked out on it half way through. However, I can warn you about the camera work. The camera is shaking constantly in every scene of this movie! At first I though they were having projector problems at the theater but apparently the director thinks people enjoy watching movies that appear to have been filmed by a drunk cameraman. Instead of enjoying the movie I was just trying to focus my eyes on the screen and wondering if someone had slipped something in my drink. I will never watch another movie done by this director again. Anyone who thinks jiggling the camera improves a movie should not be put in charge of a multi-million dollar project. I got my money back, and I'll be spending it on a movie directed by someone who has been introduced to the tripod.Shaky camera = bad movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unexpected!!!,"I knew that a Bourne sequel would deserve its predecessor, and here it is! I knew how well the preceding Bourne movie had worked well, and this oneis indeed a pretty decent movieit is way more decent, it's spectacularly far better than the preceding one. This is so much unexpected indeed for most sequel-prone movies, where the crew behind usually lose their talent to infuse more creative layer for sequels, but this one is totally different! I never expect how well they manage to elevate the quality and standing of the movie. Bourne Supremacy continues with Jason Bourne, after quite sorting out things in his past in the first movie he come to live in peace with her girlfriend (whom he met throughout his retracing journey in Bourne Identity) Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) in India. However some of those use to poison CIA by letting an ambushed operation of them, manage to let Jason Bourne's identity held responsible thus endangering his life (and his girlfriend as well) once again. The first few minutes of the movie was indeed a mix of thrill, resentment and lament, but when it continues so are our surprises continues as well. Paul Greengrass has indeed a lot of aptitude to heave this movie into an exceptionally brilliant movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sequel may be better than the original,"The search for Jason Bourne continues in this sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" as CIA operatives and a Russian assassin track Bourne across four countries to eliminate him once and for all. Matt Damon reprises his role as the agent with amnesia on the run, trying to elude the killers he knows are out there looking for him. This film parallels the earlier Bourne film as the agent who flees from one trap or detention only to escape again in the manner of cliffhangers of years gone by. Karl Urban is the relentless Russian hit man who gets Damon in his sights a time or two, only to see him slip away. Joan Allen joins the chase as a steely CIA task force chief determined to bring Damon in by hook or crook. Much of the film was shot in Berlin and Moscow which gives the Bourne films an international flavor. John Powell chips in with a nice music score.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A worthy sequel!,I really enjoyed The Bourne Identity so I was really looking forward to seeing what the next chapter in the Bourne series had in store with Supremacy the movie is a direct sequel to the first movie and it features a lot of the same characters from the first movie with all the original actors returning to reprise their roles aswell so as sequels go this movie definitely matched the unique style of the original movie from it's interesting and thought provoking storyline to the fast paced action scene's this a worthy sequel to an amazing first movie.The Bourne Supremacy takes place two years after the events of the first movie with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his partner Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) who are now living in India under false identitys but when one day Jason notices someone looking for them their cover is blown and now Jason must find out why after all this time he's become a target again and who sent the assassin after him and why?.I really enjoyed the continuation of the story and this movie more than added to the storyline giving Bournes character more backstory giving us a glimpse into his past and the person he was before he lost his memory.The action scenes are top quality and we do get a lot more of them than in the first movie there's also a lot of scenes of Bourne playing cat and mouse with his pursuers which is always fun to see Bourne outwit them with him always being one step ahead of them at all times even when it looks like he's made a mistake it's all a clever ploy.A must watch movie for fans of the first movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Incredible!!! 10/10,"I absolutely loved this film!  The Bourne Supremacy is simply incredible! Every bit as good as The Bourne Identity.  As someone mentioned, the ""shoddy"" camera work is noticeable at times...but in no way does this detract from the story or the connection you begin to feel to Bourne.  In fact, I can really only remember one moment when I thought the camera work was ""bad"".  Someone else called it a ""vengeance"" flick, but I think this is a terrible interpretation of the events that transpired.  In fact, throughout the movie you get the feeling that Bourne cares much more about Treadstone than he does about Marie.This is easily one of the best action/spy flicks I have ever seen.  I pray that they will make The Bourne Ultimatum.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good but...,"I ended up giving this movie an 8. The acting and the script are very well done. My chief complaint is the camera work and editing. I never get motion sickness but I thought I might get it while watching this film. The fight scenes are filmed up close and with ""shakey cam"" as are all the action scenes. I can understand trying to add a sense of urgency or tension to a film but only once or 2x in a movie should ""shakey cam"" be used. Your brain can't process what is going on and the editing jumps every 5 seconds. The camera work is very distracting in an otherwise excellent movie. I'm not familiar with the director but i would venture to guess that he's a novice at directing/filming action sequences. Either that or he had an idea that backfired.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Couldn't afford a Steadicam?,"Loved the plot, loved the acting - just what you'd want from a spy/thriller/action movie, Mission Impossible meets James Bond. Great.But, by heck, they needed a steadicam on this one.Almost every shot is done hand-held, whether it's needed or not. Sure, do it in the fast-cut action bits for a sense of confusion meets speed, but hold the damn thing still if it's a simple bit of dialog between two characters in a meeting, out for a coffee or a stroll in the park.
Documentary style is fine in the right circumstances, but not combined with fast cuts even in slow scenes. Bad timing throughout. Film school teacher says ""1/10... see me after class.""
Even in the action sequences it's a bit much. You don't need to cut an action movie like a pop video (even if this one wasn't even cut on a beat I could discern, it was all a bit random in the edit timings).

Michael Bay is well-known for his 'wth is going on' editing, but even he can slow the camera down when needed. Greengrass just doesn't seem to understand camera pacing at all.

Action Supremacy,"Sequels that are better than the original are few and far between. This is one of them.""The Bourne Identity"" was a competent action movie which plot mirrors ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". ""Bourne Supremacy"", is a league on its own. As in all great sequels, ""Supremacy"" gives more depth to the already-known character.The movie is tight: It gives you a wonderful action sequence after the next across the globe. A plot with intrigue and twists. Wonderful characters from the good guys to the villains. The movie is so intense the only breather you get is just minutes before it ends.

"Because sooner or later, you remember something good.","The Bourne Supremacy picks up where the first film, The Bourne Identity, left off, with Bourne living a quiet life with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in India. However, their peaceful existence is shattered when Bourne is framed for a murder in Berlin, which sets off a chain of events that forces him out of hiding and back into the dangerous world of international espionage.One of the standout elements of The Bourne Supremacy is its relentless and fast-paced action sequences. Director Paul Greengrass is known for his gritty and intense filmmaking style, and it's on full display in this film. The action scenes are tightly choreographed, with Bourne using his highly-trained skills in hand-to-hand combat, evasion, and improvisation to outsmart and outfight his adversaries. The car chases, fight scenes, and shootouts are all executed with precision and intensity, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats.Matt Damon delivers a stellar performance as Jason Bourne. He brings a sense of vulnerability, determination, and physicality to the character, making Bourne a relatable and sympathetic protagonist despite his lethal abilities. Damon's portrayal of Bourne as a conflicted and haunted figure searching for answers about his past adds depth and emotional weight to the film.The supporting cast is also commendable, with Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, a CIA agent tasked with tracking down Bourne, and Brian Cox as Ward Abbott, a high-ranking CIA official. Their performances add layers of complexity to the story as the plot unfolds and the true motives of various characters are revealed.The Bourne Supremacy also has a strong screenplay that keeps audiences engaged from start to finish. The film's plot is intricately woven, with numerous twists and turns that keep viewers guessing. The theme of identity and the consequences of one's past actions are explored in depth, adding depth to the story beyond the action-packed sequences.However, one criticism of the film is that some of the action scenes can be overly shaky and frenetic, which can make it difficult to follow the action at times. Some viewers may find the handheld camera style and rapid editing choices distracting or disorienting.In conclusion, The Bourne Supremacy is a thrilling and action-packed film that delivers on its promise of high-stakes espionage and intense action. With a strong performance from Matt Damon, well-executed action sequences, and a compelling plot, it's a worthy addition to the Bourne film series. Despite some minor drawbacks, it remains a standout entry in the action-thriller genre and is a must-watch for fans of the franchise or anyone who enjoys heart-pounding, adrenaline-fueled films.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best of the trilogy,"You know you were sort of a bad guy, who now just wants to be a regular guy. But can you make the transition and put the pieces together - and will ""they"" let you?This is the best of the three movies for drama. It's intense and gritty. The hand held cameras add so much to the visual effect. Jason Bourne is a flawed hero, which is much easier to empathize with. But the action is overdone. He has undergone severe behavior modification, but he's NOT superman!

riveting action movie describing a human drama,"A gritty revenge story starring one of the best actors on earth, Matt Damon. The expert assassin Bourne is still plagued by his shadowy past he remembers almost nothing about; I believe this sequel is even better than the first 'cause it maintains the non traditional style and perspective that made ""The Bourne identity"" a blockbuster movie. Besides, it shows great locations and sees Jason suiting his role to perfection. Maybe he's not that likely as a kung-fu star but perfect in the part of a guy who'd like to live his past behind but cannot after seeing his love dying. They should have left him alone, that's the message; as in the prequel, martial arts expertise and elaborate and intense action scenes make it very authentic. Gorgeous movie!",,Anonymous,Mystery

So much better than Bond,"The Bourne Supremacy tells the continuing saga of amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). A highly-trained assassin, Bourne snapped several years ago (as told in the film The Bourne Identity). Since then, he has lived a peaceful life with his girlfriend (the beautiful Franka Potente), away from the CIA and the world of espionage. Until, that is, someone comes after him...The Bourne Supremacy is a fast-paced, action-packed yet (almost) believable espionage thriller. Damon excels as Bourne, the character not has stoic determination but an emotional core filled with the terrors of his past. This character is so much better than the one-dimensional James Bond ever was: he's human, grim, deep, sad yet dangerous.This film is so much better than any of the Bond films in terms of human drama. Sure, there are no fabulous weapons, there is no endless stream of shaggadelic babes, there are no cars that turn into para-sailers. But there are the worldly locales, the incredible car chases, the sudden twists, the dangerous assassins (Karl Urban), the double-crossing inside operatives (the omnipresent Brian Cox), and the smart Deputy Director who has to figure it all out (the incredible Joan Allen). And all of it told in under two hours, the perfect length for a film of this type.I have only two beefs about this film. The director overuses herky-jerky, highly edited photography that is distracting (especially during a fight scene between Damon and a fellow CIA assassin, so hard to watch it may be seizure-inducing) and so over-used in today's cinema it's become a parody. Then there is this highly unbelievable, indestructible Russian-made taxicab tougher than the Humvees used by the Marines Corps. The only comic moments in this film involved this cab careening off SUVs and barriers yet still outrunning cop cars.These are minor quibbles compared to the rest of the film. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Movie but Nauseating Camera Work,"The hand-held camera was overused and far too distracting. A major part of the beauty of the first movie (Bourne Identity) is that the viewer was able to actually see Bourne's fighting skills. The camera work used by director Greengrass made it extremely hard to appreciate the main character's training as an assassin. The camera always seemed to be jostling around, as if the cameraman was having a seizure. The closeup work during the internet café scene was especially annoying. Were we supposed to be snooping as we looked at the screen over Bourne's shoulder? The character never would have tolerated someone that close. Online research can be pretty dull, so was this simply an attempt by Greengrass to liven up this scene? Hopefully Greengrass won't duplicate this sloppy, nauseating camera work in the next movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" Let the action carry the scene and stop trying to dial it up a notch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Supremely nauseating,"Brace yourself for motion sickness: there isn't one single static shot in this film, which would be all right if the nervous ""style"" served a purpose. Unfortunately, all is manages to accomplish is to make the viewer nauseous, a feeling compounded by the total lack of interest generated by both plot and characters. I love suspense and see nothing wrong with films whose sole ambition is to keep you on the edge of your seat, even if they wind up sacrificing realism in the process. But halfway through this one, I was rooting for the bad guys to kill Bourne and end this nightmarish experience.Perhaps it's the newest trend to shoot every insignificant scene of a film from five different angles and edit it as if you suffered from Parkinson's disease. Reducing each shot to a nanosecond of screen-time is an effective way to hide any mistake or continuity break, as well as script deficiencies: the viewer simply does not have the time to spot the mistake or try and make sense of what's actually happening in a scene, and just doesn't care because nothing makes sense anyway. Even the car chases are so chopped up that they are devoid of thrill or interest. I couldn't wait to get home and watch Ronin.The ""trendy"" director (and I use the term generously) of this supremely nauseating film really ought to revisit Hitchcock, whose approach was to figure out the ideal way to shoot a scene before getting on the set and to justify every camera movement. I doubt anyone will revisit the 2004 Bourne Supremacy unless they're masochistic.Last time I felt as physically ill while watching a movie was during Woody Allen's ""experimental"" movie Husbands and Wives, where the camera's movement was designed to make you experience the characters' discomfort. It effectively induced nausea in a primary way: the sort you shake off when you leave the theater, vowing never to see that film again. Not a brilliant strategy in this day and age of ""must own"" movies. But then on a TV monitor, I expect the Bourne Supremacy won't be as annoying. Size does matter. And you'll even be able to freeze every frame to see all that is missing.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than Identity,"In my efforts to prepare myself to ""Jason Bourne"" I've started binge-watching all the films in the series. Although I liked ""The Bourne Identity"" very much, I think ""Supremacy"" is above it. It expands and builds upon the first one's foundations and, since, there was a director change, the film feels very fresh and unique. I know some movie-goers don't appreciate Greengrass's camera work, I don't think we can label it as ""shaky-cam"" because that would be an injustice. I've seen flicks which use this kind of technique very abusively, specially in fight scenes, mostly to hide the fact that, in fact, stunt-men are doing it. But, in Bourne, I don't get that feeling. In this particular case its just the director's choice, not a constraint. It helps to give the film a unique look and cinematography.In this one they've upped the ante, specially on action scenes. Karl Urban's ""Kirill"" is a welcoming addition to the already established set of characters, working as a match to Bourne. The nods to the first entry are also very interesting and serve to expand on Bourne's backstory and the quest for his identity. Matt Damon once again is perfect as the tichilor character, bringing toughness and intelligence to this mysterious man. The returning cast does its job, specially Brian Cox's ""Ward Abbot"" who plays a more pivotal role compared to ""Identity"". Joan Allen's ""Pamela Landy"" is also an interesting addition to the film, giving it even more women power.The edginess and realism brought to this whole affair is distinctive and helps setting the whole series apart from other stories within the spy genre. Although, I'm a James Bond fanboy, since I've started to watch Bourne I've grown quite fond of the series specially for its authenticity and outside the box plot, acting and action.Recommended.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
my first comment...,"Greengrass shows himself a very dexterous action movies director. He grabs the audience at the throat after few moments of prelude and doesn't let go till the very end... Jason Bourne takes us for a furious ride all over the Europe, proving that James Bond is a piece of cake... Damon feels the character he plays perfectly and pushes the plot to the limits of reality. Smashing soundtrack only sharpens the dynamic picture and makes the viewers a part of the game. Scenes of combat are maybe not as rousing as they are in ""the Bourne identity"", but the car chase is just masterpiece. I hope the next ""Bourne"" movie will be at lest as good as previous ones. I also hope to live to the Bourne Movies Collection much like the Bond one....",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The whole Russian trip just felt tacked on because they realized that they needed more filler for this film. You can almost hear the script writers say, ""Hey, how about we add a car chase here...just like the first film."" Why use Julia for only one scene? Why leave this character is worse shape then the first film? This could've and should've been so much better. HUGE disappointment here.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid Action Sequel with a Message Under the Surface,"This is last movie of the original trilogy that I saw. I don't fully remember, but I believe I saw part of the first one. Friends went to see the third and I'm always down to go to the theater. From there, I believe that I went back to fully watch the series. Jaime was intrigued as she enjoyed the first one and wanted to see where they'd go here.Coming in, I knew that this was based on a series of books. I believe that my sister read them all. I have not. What is interesting is that we had a good way to end the first one that made it feel complete. This one picks up with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) living with Marie (Franka Potente) in India. He can't turn it off to be suspicious of everything around him. Marie on the other hand has settled in. Things take a turn when Kirill (Karl Urban) shows up to kill Bourne. In the process, Marie is hit. Bourne is back on the rampage to end everything that made him who he is and put an end to it all.What is interesting here is that we're dealing with sleeper agents. It is terrifying to think that the government trained these people in secret and then released them into society. When certain words or phrases were used, they would turn it back on to be a trained assassin. Bourne is great at what he does. He is always two steps ahead. It makes it a bit unbelievable, but only because it is crazy to be on all the time. I can see why he would break down like he does. Damon does a great job there with the character.We are getting more of the same here. There is a mystery as Bourne tries to find out more about Treadstone. He is made the target of the CIA as they believe he interfered with a mission and killed their agents. Ward Abbot (Brian Cox) oversees this secret group. He butts heads with Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) who believes that Bourne is who she is after. She learns and realizes things as information is discovered.What helps here is the good cast. I've already said that Damon is good. We also get a brief cameo by Potente. Allen, Cox, Julia Stiles, Urban, Gabriel Mann and Marton Csokas are all good as well. There isn't a bad performance so that helps. It feels like we're seeing real government agents and spies. I also think how this is shot is good. We get some surreal and distorted images to represent Bourne piecing things together. I like seeing through his eyes to get a feel of what it would be to be him. I can appreciate that. Most everything here is done practical which is good. I can appreciate that as well.This is a solid movie. I don't know if it is as good as the original, but it is still an enjoyable popcorn, action film with a bit more. It is crazy that there are things here based in fact which can be scary to be honest.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent movie.,"Felt like I went on a trip after seeing this movie. This movie was well worth it. Featuring exotic locations and car chases that are really captivating.

Loved it but a few minor things bothered me...,"Loved the movie,think Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne but the one thing that really bothered me is the nervourness of the camera in the Action (fights) scene.  C'mon! I wanted to see what was happening and it was really hard to keep track.  I know it's stylish and it suppose to make the scene more intense but frankly I could have done without.  The fact that it was also blury at times did not help.  There was a great fight scene(I think) in the appartment in Berlin which I would have love to see, the coreography seemed amazing, but with the camera always moving and the out of focus, it was jut impossible to determine who was the bad guy and who was Jason.End quote:  It's the first time I find Matt Damon sexy in a role, usually I find he is a good actor but he was never my kind of guy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Terrific action thriller,"Jason Bourne has escaped his past and moved far away from the events a couple years ago. His has nightmares where he recalls certain broken fragments of his violent past and he tries to piece it together at times, but it is all a blur. Then his past catches up to him as a mysterious assassin leaves Jason Bourne's calling card at the sight of a botched CIA operation, which resulted in agent deaths. Jason finds himself again marked for death and on the run out to find the truth.This sequel has everything the first one had - good performances, tight direction, great action scenes - and it also manages to capture Ludlum's intricately described intensity with its frenetic visual style. This is a great visual move that does a terrific job at evoking that rough and gritty mood of the novel. Action scenes are rather simplistic overall - fights and chases - but the visuals make them very intense. This especially goes for the pulse pounding adrenaline rush of a car chase at the end of the movie - if you think about it is just fast driving, swerving, and crashing. No big stunts, no insane pile-up, but the visuals take you right into the middle of the action and as a result you are treated to a convincing spy thriller and that is exactly what Ludlum initially wrote.Screenwriter Tony Gilroy has, once again, taken huge liberties with the novel, but the novel's story is obsolete in today's world as it was about a conspiracy in Hong Kong before the handover to China. The film's story has similar pivot points - mainly the use of Bourne's identity by a mysterious assassin to cover up a hit, which also opens the book - but the territory visited after that is much different. And that is actually pretty good since even if you have read the book you can still enjoy and equally intense (though still less intricate plot-wise) experience on screen. 9/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bourne Again: My favorite of the Bourne trilogy,"""The Bourne Identity"" introduced the character of Jason Bourne and here we delve deeper into his world as he is framed for a botched CIA operation just as he begins seeking his girlfriend's killer.Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne and here he delivers another solid performance. Also back is Brian Cox, whose role is thankfully more prominent this time around. New to the group of CIA pursuers is Joan Allen who turns in an assured performance.The story in this middle film of the trilogy is my favorite mainly because it jettisons any romantic interest early on with the death of Franka Potente's character. Thus, the film is more of a 'pure' action movie than its predecessor. Also, the storyline gives us further insight into the puzzle of Bourne's past, which is essentially completed in the third film.The direction by Paul Greengrass is good but I find that the rapid fire cutting is overdone. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the film moves at a breathless pace, as if the action could scarcely be captured on film. As previously, the music complements the action nicely though it doesn't draw attention to itself.This is my favorite of the trilogy because it is simply the most action-packed.

The Bourne Disappointment,"In 2002, up-and-coming director Doug Liman offered up a thrilling adaptation of Robert Ludlum's espionage novel The Bourne Identity, and in doing so, he presented the perfect espionage thriller - great acting, a strong script, perfect direction, fitting music, and just the right touch of realistic action. After Identity proved successful at the box office, the studios decided they wanted a sequel, of course, so the next logical step was Ludlum's second novel in the series, The Bourne Supremacy. Liman had moved on to other things (Mr. and Mrs. Smith), so who was put at the helm of Supremacy? Television director Paul Greengrass. This was not a good decision.In Identity, Jason Bourne (Damon) was pulled from the ocean with two bullets in his back and was stricken with amnesia. He was chased by many killers, and eventually discovered that he was a finely-tuned CIA assassin. He managed to fall off the grid into obscurity. Supremacy picks up right where Identity left off, with Bourne in India. Now, he has been framed for a double-murder and robbery, and must come out of hiding to tie up loose ends once and for all.The film had infinite potential. Finally, someone was making a sequel to a movie worth making a sequel to. However, this project just fell into the wrong hands. Greengrass can't direct his way out of a paper bag. Nearly every single shot throughout the entire film is hand-held. It's tolerable for a while, but it eventually just becomes grating. Hasn't this guy ever heard of a tripod? But the film's failure certainly does not lie in the hands of Greengrass alone. The script is, to put it bluntly, not very good. The dialogue is often laughable, and unlike the first film, the characters occasionally just come off as stupid as they throw themselves into pointless fight/chase sequences for no apparent reason. Not at all like Identity, where every fight scene had a purpose. Also, in Identity, when there was action, it was brutal and believable. Nothing felt fantastic - it all felt very real (especially the car chase, which was just about the best since Bullitt). In Supremacy, however, everything loses the edgy feeling of a realistic spy thriller and takes on the persona of a Hollywood action flick. Every fight scene and car chase (yes, there is more than one car chase) is loaded with Michael Bay-esqe hand-held hyper-cuts. It's hard to tell what's even going on sometimes - it all just turns into a headache-inducing blur.The film is certainly not a complete failure, though. The acting from Matt Damon and Brian Cox is excellent, as usual, though the rest of the cast is sorely lacking (Joan Allen gives a forced and insipid performance). The film is also quite entertaining. And I must admit, it's still nice to have any kind of continuation to the stellar Identity, even if it's quite lackluster.I'm still holding out hope for the trilogy's closing, The Bourne Ultimatum. Let's just hope it falls into capable hands.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Too shaky!!,"What's with this hand-held camera technique? I saw this movie Saturday, and I got a headache trying to focus on what was happening. My advice: Don't eat before seeing this movie. You'll get sick. I have been noticing this shaky-camera thing lately in movies during the fight scenes. Is this because the fight-scene choreography is below par? There were what could have been some great fight scenes in this movie, if you could see them!! There were also come good foot chases, and car chases, but without being able to see anything besides camera shake, it really wasn't very good. Ten thumbs down to the director (Greengrass) for ruining what could have been a great movie. Lastly, the death scene with the main bad guy was thoroughly disappointing. No feeling of revenge!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Thrilling, satisfying...logical","I had a great time watching Supremacy. I wasn't planning to write a comment for it but all these other whiners made me afraid people were going to get the wrong idea.This is one of the most well-paced action movies I have ever seen, and the best part is that it all made sense at the end.  Usually with this type of suspense/spy movie I'm all ""...WAIT A MINUTE!.."" when I'm walking out, but with this one, although there were a lot of surprises, all the pieces seemed to fit cleverly together.Acting by all the principals was excellent, especially the CIA (or whatever clandestine agency it was) operatives. It's interesting to see Matt Damon carry a movie without a specific love interest.All in all, a very satisfying two hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excitement Par Excellence,"""Bourne Supremacy"" is an excellent sequel to the original movie which is likewise a winner.  The energy and excitement of Matt Damon's performance is unsurpassed.  One becomes exhausted by the time the film reaches a climax. There is no secret that this movie is a great success.  The numbers alone attest to that.  The acting is solid.  The photography is fluid.  The musical score is compatible with the pace.  After the ""Bourne Identity"" was released, one could not wait for the sequel to arrive.  It is now here and it is a smashing success.  I would recommend anyone with a desire to see a thriller, that this is the one for this summer season.  Put it on your must see list.  And one should be prepared to catch your breath for a mind boggling climax.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent sequel to a great espionage film.,"The Jason Bourne films with Matt Damon in them succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that. This is an excellent action espionage series of films.",,Anonymous,Mystery
That's Much Better,Now this is more like it. This movie is definitely superior to the first (I don't know if you can say that about the books) but I really enjoyed this movie. I was hyped up when I saw the previews even though I remembered Identity and how I didn't like it too much. I still went and saw it and it was great. Matt Damon does an even better job as Bourne going into another serious role and stepping away from comedy (Stuck on You) I felt this movie delivered more in terms of uncovering Bourne's past and giving Bourne a little more depth and a little more edge. This guy is evenly matched with Bond IMO. The supporting cast was great because we got to see some old faces that make this movie connect with the first one. The action sequences are a step up here too. I also enjoy John Powell's dramatic music to really add to the movie. I don't know if Ultimatum will be as good because of a certain thing that happens. I still cant wait and am currently reading the book for part three.9/10,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A role model for government officials of all genders, it would be nice if our presidential candidates would look to this role for a real definition of character. The rest of cast works perfectly . The action is breathtaking though there are some cinematic choices (a lot of blurred footage) that are unusual and sometimes distracting. The shots of Russia are both beautiful and fascinating. The story here is tight and impressive. If I ever saw anything coming, I quickly forgot about with all the action and was never surprised when it resurfaced.

Wonderful,"This movie had all of the ingredients of a great flick: Good story, good action, good actors, and good movie-making. Each actor matched his or her character: Mat Damon turned out to be perfect for the role of Jason Bourne. While the part was very small, Oksana Akinshina conveyed her pain most believably. The action was non-stop and exciting, even though not all was completely believable. Lighting was perfect, dialog was exactly what was necessary for me to understand what was going on, and the direction was such that I couldn't wait for the next scene. And I cannot imagine a better ending. This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that I saw in the theater, then purchased the DVD so I could watch it again. I really hope that the third movie, The Bourne Ultimatum, won't be too long in appearing in theaters.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hand-held cameras and zero head-held ideas,"What really dismembers the movie is the direction and the editing. If you can imagine Oliver Stone on meth, you'll get the general picture. This is simply, supremely nauseating. Brace yourself for motion sickness: there isn't one single static shot in this film, which would be all right if the nervous ""style"" served a purpose. Unfortunately, all is manages to accomplish is to make the viewer nauseous, a feeling compounded by the total lack of interest generated by both plot and characters. It's a lousy trend to shoot every insignificant scene of a film from five different angles and edit it as if you suffered from Parkinson's disease. Reducing each shot to a nanosecond of screen-time is an effective way to hide any mistake or continuity break, as well as script deficiencies: the viewer simply does not have the time to spot the mistake or try and make sense of what's actually happening in a scene, and just doesn't care because nothing makes sense anyway. Even the car chases are so chopped up that they are devoid of thrill or interest. The ""trendy"" director really ought to effectively not induce nausea in such a primary way. I am always sensitive to hand-held camera shots à la Glauber Rocha, and this was awful. EVERY frame is jumpy. As to content, the title ""The Bourne Identity"" actually had meaning: just who IS this amnesic guy? Even the name ""Bourne"" adds symbolic weight. This one is called Supremacy. Why not Superiority? Hy not Equality? No one can praise the performers, although Matt Damon was good as Ripley and as the guilt-ridden junkie in ""Courage Under Fire."" The plot is dismissible. It has something to do with Russian oil, but boils down to one long chase. The camera is ataxic. I can't remember a single scene in which it held still. It wobbles pointlessly all over the place or it focuses on some unimportant object like a venetian blind while the action takes place elsewhere... Come on...",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
'the moment you entered her life she was dead',"Certainly different from its predecessor, Supremacy puts its emphasis on political intrigue and espionage rather than personal matters... most of the time. The agency here is not entirely bad anymore. Treadstone is dismantled but its shadows still hanging heavily. This installment is not as even as the first one. There are a couple of really emotional scenes, showing loss, anger, and redemption and they rival anything from the first movie. Then there are suspiciously long stretches devoid of emotion. The action too gets a tad lower mark. The beginnings of mad cameraman are already evident, fast cuts, crazy angles, dark and noisy action... the style, which was further 'perfected' in the third film. JB has no clear-cut friends here, acting alone, and more methodically than ever. The tale here is a bit grimmer, too. The score now has a central theme. Firstly introduced in Goa scenes, its slower version comes back from time to time. I liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you read the novel, DON""T expect to see the same in the movie","the ONLY Thing this movie has in common with the novel THE BOURNE SUPRMACY is that there is a character named Jason Bourne in it. This movie is not in ONE DETAIL the same as the novel. Now as a movie on its own merits, it is a good SPY/THRILLER movie. But to mislead the loyal reading public by calling this movie by that title is disingenuous at the least. The Actual novel is mostly set in the Far East (China & Hong Kong) and the bad guys are mostly Chinese Nationals. This movie doesn't have one mention of the Chinese in it. The whole premise of Bourne having to re-don his Far Eastern Killer Persona was dumped. If I had paid to see this movie at the theatres, I would have been very unhappy, because this movie is NOT the Bourne Supremacy. NOT EVEN CLOSE",,Anonymous,Mystery
Magnificent,"I've re-watched this film on DVD after seeing at the cinema a few months ago, and I think it's even better after repeated viewing. The plot is fairly straightforward and coherent, and refreshingly free of the grandiose pretensions of the recent Bond films and the like, it's just one guy trying to figure out why his old bosses are after him (turns out the explanation is quite simple). Granted that the one guy has Jason Bourne's training, intelligence and resourcefulness, everything in the film is believable within the parameters it sets up.The acting is way better than the usual action/ spy fare, especially from Matt Damon himself, who is compelling throughout, even with limited dialogue. The pacing is perfect, and the action scenes bone-crunchingly vivid; the hand-held camera-work contributes to the sense of being in the middle of these scenes. The ""jerkiness"" and fast edits have come in for plenty of criticism, but the camera-work just requires a little more concentration from the viewer than most films,where all the action takes place within a steady frame for the viewer, making you feel like an observer rather than a participant. Once you get used to it, the fight scenes and car chases are not confusing at all- you can in fact make out exactly what's going on, and the final car chase in particular is more thrilling than anything I've seen in a while. The score by John Powell also adds a great deal to the film. It's just the best film in this genre for years, and it has a beautifully poised ending to take us into the next instalment.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cleaner Execution,"I went into The Bourne Identity expecting something groundbreaking and I left disappointed. I went into The Bourne Supremacy with lowered expectations and I left pleasantly reinvigorated for the franchise.This film is head and shoulders better than the first film. The concept is still interesting, but the execution is cleaner. The character motives are strong, the character focus is clear and they eliminated some of the more grating elements of the first film.With a good amount of tension and strong action sequences, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I'm curious where the franchise goes from here.Best Character: Jason Bourne

Solid thriller with elements of cold-war spy movies,"I liked Bourne Supremacy better than Bourne Identity. Reason being that I loved the book (identity) and hated the way the mellowed the plot by making it a pure hollywood CIA movie. But Supremacy, was much more loosely coupled to its book. And I didnt much like the book anyways.Its a very fast paced action movie with lots of ""new"" spy techniques and tactics, and  a solid performance by Matt Damon and Brian Cox.The thing I liked about this movie the most was the return of some of the elements that marked the cold war spy movies. It had a agent gone ""rogue"",CIA and criminals  hunting him down with equal ruthlesness, and after a long time, a Russian Assasin hot on his train, with trademark(of hollywood) stubble and a scowl.  It has car chases, fist fights, gadgets everything you need a spy film.A remarkable thing is the amount darkness in the lead character. He is an assasin and he acts like one. bourne character has been converted to quite a complex character instead of the wronged nice assasin of ludlum books. He kills with cold blood, and cries when he thinks of some times of his life. Same goes for other characters.All in all, The movie is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Close but not quite as good as 'Identity'.,"I think it goes without saying that you have to watch 'Identity' before watching 'Supremacy' so I will write this assuming you've seen the first one already.After the compete awesomeness of 'Identity', it was going to be very hard for a new director to step in and create the sequel but Paul Greengrass did a pretty good job of sticking to the concept and feel put forth by Doug Liman. I've never been a fan of movies in which the camera bounces around to create the feeling of greater action and heightened intensity, but despite the use of that tactic, 'Supremacy' worked for me in every way. Matt Damon came back to the role he was born to play and killed again (so to speak), his motivation was different but just as believable, and his choices and actions were just as entertaining and awe-inspiring as in 'Identity' and, also as in 'Identity', the story hooks you in right from the start and doesn't let go. You can't help but root for the good guy in his quest to learn about his past and secure peace in his future.In a movie that takes what should be unbelievable and makes you believe it possible extremely well, my only complaint with the story is that no one, even Jason Bourne, would walk away from a head on collision with a cement wall at full speed in a little cardboard box of a car without a seat belt on with only a slight limp.As for my rating, it comes in about a little less than half a point below 'Identity' (which I gave 8.6) but still a solid 8+. Final tally: 8.2But that's just my two scents. ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fast, jittery, energetic, and a bit of a formula falling short of the first","The Bourne Supremacy (2004)Compared to the first Bourne movie (""The Bourne Identity""), this is a more straight up espionage tale. It has many of the same elements—the rogue CIA operative who is a highly trained machine out to kill, and a suspicious and uncaring CIA—and it is packed with at least as much action, mainly car chases and fights. And it is well made, combining great photography (right from the opening shots), fast (sometimes too fast) editing, and heart pounding music to rev it up.It's dynamic stuff.But it's also fairly ""routine"" in its own genre. In fact, the plot here is no longer an existential problem that matters very much to Jason Bourne (and his sidekick Marie), but rather a convoluted series of CIA plots that merely frames our here for a crime he didn't commit. It drives his actions, but with less urgency. And with unneeded confusion (confusion, by the way, not to be substituted for complexity, which can be a good thing).I also found the romance, or the almost necessary relationship connection (if you don't like the idea of romance) in the first movie really compelling—and again it is missing here. I remember when I saw this movie the first time at its release I was shocked and surprised by the limited role Franka Potente had. I like her as an actress partly because she cuts a different kind of leading female (a strong woman in a mode a bit different than Jennifer Lawrence, though both responding to the violence around them). But this will be about Damon as Jason Bourne against the world alone this time.The rest of the cast is a familiar brood of types, all welcome in their roles if not very original—the wise old spy chief ready to retire (and with some evil on the wing), a tough woman spy chief a little over her head, a sweet spy assistant who is smart but victimized, and of course the Bourne parallel characters—men/machines who are highly trained and dangerous.If you really liked the first movie (which I did) you'll probably have trouble resisting seeing this one. But crank down your expectations. If you find meaningless car chases annoying be prepared for two doozies—technically terrific as they are. And there is the basic plot, too, which may not quite be enough, the idea of fighting the unknown terrors from your old boss who now hates you enough to want you dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

As noted by other reviewers, the plot doesn't really come together until the end, but it does come together.Like the first, there is one big hand-to-hand fight scene, an explosion or two, big car chase (this time through Moscow, not Paris), etc. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I really liked the jittery camera -- it made things seem edgier and tense, which was appropriate. I believe much (most?) of the movie was shot with hand-held cameras.Anyhow, I definitely recommend it -- it won't win any Oscars for screenplay, acting, etc., but is solid entertainment, which is what most are looking for from a summer movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A classy thriller,"I have only recently got around to watching the first movie. Having seen a few good reviews of 'Bourne Supremacy' I thought I'd need to catch up on the first movie. If anyone is in the same position I'd recommend that they watch the first film before the second.The nice thing about the first film is that it stood as a single film. As you walked out of the theatre you had a complete story. The same thing can be said of Supremacy which is a rare thing in movie franchises , especially with the middle installment of a trilogy.The pace is frenetic throughout the movie and the handheld cameras make it feel very edgy. Matt Damon gives a fine performance as Jason Bourne who seems to be at the top of everybodys hitlist even though he's just trying to lead an anonymous life.

Very Good,"I loved The Bourne Identity. But The Bourne Supremacy was awesome! The acting was very good and(unlike some people) I loved the cinematography was unique and really added to the scenes. I thought it was a great idea and it worked really well. The new director Greengrass did a fantastic job and looking forward to his next film he directs. Now the performances were superb. Matt Damon made me remember what a great actor he is( each film always reminds me how good of an actor he is, with the exceptions of Stuck on You and The Legend of Bagger Vance). Joan Allen was perfect for Pamela Landy, she is always good and this was a fantastic role for her. The surprise performance(for me) was Julia Stiles. Her work, in my opinion, has never been consistent, Her performances range from good(Ten Things I Hate About You) to misguided(Mona Lisa Smile). But, in one of her scenes with Matt Damon she just blew me away with just how good she truly can be. Brian Cox played the a-typical villain, but he played him well as he always does.

No way near as supreme as the first.,"I never really expected much from ""The Bourne Identity"" when it came out in 2002 but when I watched it I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a good movie in the sense of the word but the style was awesome and the action amazing. When I watched ""The Bourne Supremacy"" I didn't recognized any of the things I liked in ""The Bourne Identity"" back into this movie.Most disappointing thing was that the camera-work and editing didn't worked this time. The shaky camera-work and very fast editing throughout THE ENTIRE movie, only became irritating and tiring. I didn't expected to say this but it seems like Paul Greengrass was the wrong choice to direct this movie. Surprising because he seemed like the perfect choice after making ""Bloody Sunday"". It seems that he also already is attached to the third Bourne movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", needless to say that I'm not too keen on this. My suggestion would be to let Michael Mann direct but that is unlikely to happen though...But of course it is not just the camera-work and editing that makes this movie 'worse' than the first. Also mainly it is the story that just is a bit too complicated and uninteresting plus it could have really used a love story again. The movie also lacks some true bad guys and the Russian Kirill is not nearly as cool as the treadstone assassins from the first movie. Karl Urban plays a too boring and stereotyped Russian assassin. The movie also had way less action sequences (especially compared to ""The Bourne Identity"") than I was expecting and hoping for.Sure the movie has some good moments such as the car chase (even though the car chase from the first movie still is superior) and the movie has an overall 'cool' feeling. And it has Joan Allen playing a surprising and good role like you normally wouldn't expect from her in the first place.I still have faith and look forward to the third movie, even when Greengrass is directing again. I just hope the spend some more time working on the story and change the camera-work and editing more back into the style from the first movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I liked it.,"The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.Because it's plot heavy, The Bourne Supremacy requires the viewer to watch, and the large amount of talking goes some way to distancing this from most other action movies. However, this could also be seen as a bad point as it can, at times, hinder the movie in the excitement stakes and make it difficult viewing for those that do like their action. The movie spans across Europe to a number of different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Russia and this keeps it exciting as it allows the landscape of the movie to change constantly and the film doesn't dwell in the same area. In fact, the film is very efficient on the whole and it never overindulges in anything, which compensates for the amount of talking and allows it to be exciting. Despite it being more stealthy than most, time is still found for a number of high-octane sequences including fist-fights, explosions and a great car chase that looks as if it could have been lifted straight out of Grand Theft Auto.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quit jerking the camera around!!!,"For the love of G-d, keep that camera still!  Jeez-louise, I had such high hopes for this film.  I knew the story would be good; it had an excellent cast, and another chance for some great stunts and special effects.  I'm sure the acting was good.  But between the poor editing, and the abominable direction, it was hard to tell.  I do not know who gave the green light to director Paul Greengrass, but as soon as the first dailies starting coming in, a gargantuan red light should have popped up.  I have not seen anything else directed by Greengrass, but I will be sure to avoid anything else he does.The type of direction applied to this film was totally immature.  There is a lot to be said for keeping the camera still, and letting your audience actually see what is happening.  After viewing this film, I could kind of tell you what was going on with the story, but as far as the action sequences go, I've got nothing.  Every action sequence was so fast and so jerky, that after a while, I stopped trying to follow what was going on.  I figure wait until the end and then see where the story goes from there.I was really, Really, REALLY excited to see this sequel, and oh so terribly disappointed.  Doug Liman did such a superior (no pun intended) job with the first film, I was pretty sure that The Bourne Supremacy would be its equal. Instead it is its jerky younger brother who doesn't know how to take direction.Save yourself the money.  Stick with The Bourne Identity, and avoid The Bourne Supremacy.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

They made it with more action which was great but not the action that was advertised. In the trailer Bourne states that if they followed him tat he would bring the fight to their doorstep. But in the movie all he does is threaten them. I thought that it made him look like he was all talk and no walk. I was disappointed in that because i expected it to b a lot more personal (and for the right reasons, especially with his girlfriend). I thought the story could have been more developed and thought out but overall i give it an 8 out of 10. i give the Bourne Identity a 9 out of 10 though.Erattic_assassin.",,Anonymous,Mystery
When you bring a magazine to a knife fight!,"Ever so slightly better than the first Bourne film, but I think I'm still looking for more? Perhaps I will find it in ""Ultimatum""?I have definitely added Matt Damon to my list, he is so good at what he does and I really like his character in this series.
I love the fantastic action sequences and the conspiracies and twists, but the basic premise bears similarities to ""Rambo"" with its super soldier sent out to pasture type thing. The Bourne series is obviously far better, although I'm only on number two.I'm quite glad that Marie doesn't feature in it as much as the first as she irked me a bit in the first and I really like Dr McCoy as the Russian guy. Brian Cox is always brilliant, to the point where I'm not sure if I'd like him in real life, because he plays this character too well. I also like Pamela Landy, she's a good part and the role is implemented with skill here.I'm very interested to see what happens next, but it would be nice if Matt got at least a little bit naked.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even better than the first one,"I gave 2002's Bourne Identity a pleasant but not glowing review, but I have to admit after several viewings on DVD that the first film grew on me. I've already seen the second one twice, but I had to see it a second time to review it as my first viewing was spent amongst rowdy and ill-behaved teenaged louts more interested in their potential rutting than the taut story unfolding before them on the screen.Matt Damon returns as the eponymous spy, now retired and trying to live his life in seclusion with his love Marie (Franka Potente). Unfortunately, a Russian hit man (Karl Urban) shows up from nowhere and disrupts that life, and the game, as in the first one, is afoot.I can't say much about the plot because there are a few wonderful twists in it that you absolutely wouldn't expect, and I don't want to give anything away. This movie fooled me incredibly on one plot twist, probably more completely than I have been fooled or misled in quite some time. But Supremacy is like that  just when you think you have it figured out, it turns around on you.I think this is actually a better film than the first one  tighter, leaner, and more suspenseful. Though Bourne is still plagued by amnesia, he's slightly more together and his newfound confidence and drive make him even more formidable. What also helps to elevate this movie is not just a better performance by Damon, but by sharp, strong turns across the board. Joan Allen is excellent as his semi-nemesis Pamela Landy; Allen gives us just the right combination of steel and level-headed planning, and she's a worthy foil for Bourne. Though her part is small, Julia Stiles is once again superb as Nikki, and Brian Cox  whom I'm really starting to like  is much more convincing and intriguing as Ward Abbott. Franka Potente, while not one of my favorites, nonetheless is able to once again imbue Marie with a warmth and humanity that makes it obvious why Bourne is drawn to her. And an actor whom I've liked for quite a while, Karl Urban, gives a great and creepy performance as the Russian Hit Man. Another actor I've long liked, Marton Csokas, has a small role as another Treadstone assassin, but he's wonderful.The action is blindingly fast and tight; fight scenes are like explosions of conflict. Bourne the character is crafty and subtle, and you can easily believe that he's giving the agency a run for its money. The chase scenes are all spectacularly well thought out, very clever and suspenseful. There are very few films, especially in the suspense genre, where the action takes a supporting role to character, but as well done as the action is here, that's exactly what it does.Director Paul Greengrass imbues the film with a great deal of well-used atmosphere. Landy's team's anxiety when Bourne kidnaps Nikki is palpable, leaping off the screen at you; Bourne's meeting with a fellow Treadstone agent is almost soothing, like the man himself, until things go south, and quickly; and the whole movie, set in winter, gives us a cold backdrop against the heat of the plot. The snow on the ground and the dead trees are subtle but effective reminders of Bourne's isolation, and the movie's mood helps propel the story as well.Damon here is a cut above. Not only does he perfectly portray Bourne's confusion, but he always manages to convey a sense of humanity through his almost super-human assassin. One scene toward the end, where Bourne makes a confession to a young woman, is simply excellent. But everyone is good here, sharp, quick, focused; the whole film is simply tight and well-balanced, well-played, and it moves so quickly it almost feels like it's over too soon despite being nearly two hours long.Bourne Supremacy is a very strong film, one of the best of the summer and the year. It fooled me more then once, which VERY few movies do, and it held my attention completely throughout twice  again, which very few movies do. There's an old saying about going to the well once too often, but I would not be unhappy to see another Bourne film. Though Jason develops in this movie, there are many places you could take this character, and I feel like we've really just started to scratch the surface. Don't wait until this is out for rental; see it in the theaters now, while you still can. It's certainly the most suspenseful movie of the summer, and one of the best crafted. They really don't get too much better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Spy Flick Gets a Solid Encore in Supremacy,"Better direction highlights THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, an all too rare case of a sequel actually outdoing a fine original. Jason Bourne is on the run again--and, just as in the original, the pursuers are assassins, the CIA, and his own past. It seems that settling down for the quiet life just isn't in the cards for our put-upon hero; indeed, as so much of the last movie built towards him finding peace with his new girlfriend, it's more than a little jarring to watch her get wasted mere minutes after the opening credits. Oh, well. It's the LETHAL WEAPON 2 syndrome all over again--you can't have a pesky relationship get in the way of all the intrigue, betrayals, butt-whuppin', and car chasin' that has to be squeezed into a two hour action flick. It could have been different. Bourne could have quietly disappeared, you see, if it weren't for those downright inconvenient CIA bigwigs framing him for knocking off government field agents. And, of course, it's not even that simple. Things get very complicated and clever in this second installment of the Bourne trilogy, and the disciplined hand of Paul Greengrass is an upgrade in the direction of the tale. I could tell you more, but then I'd have to ... oh, you get the idea ...

Still-Bourne,"Matt Damon reprises his role as former-agent-now-with-amnesia Jason Bourne, who finds himself being shot at while in India with his lovely wife, Maria (Franka Potente). Who's trying to kill Jason? Another former agent? The mob? The U.S. government? Bourne wants answers, and the improbable path seems to lead to the CIA and a now-dormant super-duper-secret organization.The CIA wants to kill Bourne, because they believe he killed two of their agents. Bourne, as in the first film, still needs to know who he is, who's trying to kill him, and the relevance of the name Treadstone.Fans of the first movie will likely enjoy this second film, but fans of the second book (by Robert Ludlum, don't ya know) will be mystified, since the movie takes only a few basic elements from the book. Which is a shame, in my estimation, because the second book was pretty well packed with action and intrigue. The movie makes up for this by including a quite lengthy car chase during the final third of the film.Perhaps a different director (Paul Greengrass instead of Doug Liman, who executive produced) explains the change in pacing and tone; Bourne seems the same, which is good, but less seems explained, which is bad. Also, the action scenes are so fast cutting that it's sometimes impossible to tell what's going on.Damon still looks the part, and he does a very good job in the role. We don't see enough of Franka Potente, unfortunately, but we do get to see the great Joan Allen as the CIA official out to get Bourne. The ending's a bit too pat, rendering a lot of the plot meaningless. All in all, it's a good time waster, just not as engrossing as the original",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was good!,"The Bourne Supremacy was well done, and well acted, with special note to Matt Damon. For a film of this genre, I think it was VERY well put together. The camera seems to be jumpy, almost as if it was done hand held. Usually this would bother me, but in this instance I actually enjoyed it, and thought it fitting to the story. The ending car chase scene in Russia must be one of the best in it's class, with heart thumping action and speed. It was my favorite part of the movie. Damon proves that he is capable of great emotion, even in a rather stony faced character, and the ending scene in which he is talking to Neski's daughter almost had me in tears. A worthy companion to it's predecessor, The Bourne Supremacy gets full marks for me!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What was expected of this awesome saga,"Matt Damon reprises his role as the enigmatic Jason Bourne, and let me tell you, he's back with a vengeance! In ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" Bourne is thrust into another heart-pounding adventure, and this time, it's personal. When he's framed for a brutal assassination, he's not gonna take it lying down.The movie takes you on a wild ride across different countries, with Bourne unraveling a web of conspiracies, double-crosses, and shocking revelations. It's like a giant puzzle, and you're right there alongside him, trying to piece it all together.The action sequences are mind-blowing, as expected from a Bourne film. From high-speed car chases to intense hand-to-hand combat, it's a roller-coaster of adrenaline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.One thing I absolutely love about ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is that it delves deeper into Bourne's past and the emotional toll of his actions. You can't help but empathize with this haunted character as he grapples with the consequences of his forgotten past.The supporting cast also shines, with Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, a determined CIA agent trying to uncover the truth, and Julia Stiles as Nicky Parsons, Bourne's former ally. Their performances add an extra layer of intrigue to the story.In my humble opinion, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" lives up to its name - it's supreme in delivering heart-stopping action, captivating storytelling, and a riveting performance from Matt Damon. It's a seamless continuation of the Bourne saga that leaves you hungry for more.If you loved the first movie, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this one too. And if you're a fan of spy thrillers with a perfect blend of action and depth, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a must-watch. So, grab your popcorn, dim the lights, and get ready to be immersed in the intense world of Jason Bourne! Enjoy the ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The first fild that actually made me sick..,I watched the Bourne Identity on DVD the night before going to the cinema to see this. I looked forward to it but...Twenty minutes after the start I had to leave the cinema. I felt very ill and it wasn't the curry we ate earlier. I am sometimes a bit sensitive to hand-held camera shots but this was aweful. EVERY frame was jumpy - and it wasn't the guy in the projection room dancing.My teenage son went with his mates to another cinema the same evening and had similar problems - though he stuck it out to the end with his eyes closed several times.By the way: my son and I watched Matrix Revolutions from the fourth row ona big screen.

"Good - Yes, Excellent - Yes, Better than the original - No","I saw the original quite a while back and seeing that the Bourne Ultimatum just came out I had to see this before.This sequel sure lives up to the name of its predecessor and takes place 2 years later in Goa, India. Jason Bourne is still on the run from the CIA. Its executed really well nearing perfection.As sort of a secret agent movie it has all the action you need, good car chases (though not as good as the first) and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also has a gripping plot which twists here and there. Many of the questions that arised after the first installment are answered though some are left unanswered.What makes me give this a 10 is not all of this but how they develop Bourne's character over its course. Apart from his ingenuity and clever tactics (which we saw a lot in the first) there is a lot of personal development (Unlike other similar movies)The only bad points are the shaky camera (at times you're confused whats happening, specially during the action scenes) and its rewatchability (I like to see movies like this again and again)Definitely worth watching at least once. 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Story-wise the best,"Of the three movies. Obviously I'm writing this, after I've seen the complete Bourne trilogy, but I won't spoil anything of the story here, so don't be afraid to read. One thing should be clear here: You should watch Bourne Identity, before you watch the other two (and those in the right order of course).If you do so, you'll get the whole Bourne experience and it's worth it (even if I rated the first one lower than this one). Matt Damon does/acts like Bourne, by now (the second movie) he's completely Bourne so to speak (pun intended)! There's a car chase/scene here, that will leave you yearning for more!

Non-stop action,"For those of you who really liked The Bourne Identity, you will REALLY like The Bourne Supremacy. It is non-stop action for the entire hour and 48 minutes you're there. I don't know about anybody else but I have been pleasantly surprised by Matt Damon's abilities in the action genre of films. I always thought of him as goofy but he has made a believer out of me that he CAN and HAS pulled it off not once, but twice! There are many twists and turns and a few surprises as well. There were several big names in this one as well Julia Stiles, Brian Cox, Joan Allen and, an added bonus (for me that is), Karl Urban. I enjoyed him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and was glad to see him in something completely different (all though I have seen him a few low budget films). Anyway, it's a great movie and you should really see it in the theater to get the full effect.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Superb Film,"I have to say that over the past year or so most films I have been to the cinema to see disappointed me in some way or another.The Bourne Supremacy was a film which actually made me leave the cinema having felt I hadn't wasted two hours of my life: I actually enjoyed it.As a few other people have picked up on, the only slightly 'off' part of the film was the 'wobbly' action camera. It was a fantastic approach but I think that somewhere in between the standard camera view and the wobbly, out-of-control camera would have been much better - and I only thought this after the car chase which basically had me standing on my head trying to follow what was happening. However it did add a certain something to the action, even if at times it was slightly over the top.Still, it certainly deserves full marks.Role on The Bourne Ultimatum!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Over the top and down the other side.....,"It was hard to follow the story with the (I suppose) new technique of one second scenes throughout the entire movie. Did no one ever think to use a tripod? It would appear that in an effort to make the movie more exciting they shook the camera, made fast pans, out of focused shots with an abundance of scenes so dark the action was lost. The only long scenes were of inanimate objects or buildings with no connecting dialog. I am surprised that more people did not pan the director and editor.Action movies have improved over the years with the shorter shots to keep you glued to the screen. This movie however is a good example of too much of a good thing and becomes un-watchable, if not disturbing.I just hope this kind of garbage does not catch on. A movie should be entertaining, without making you nauseous.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Go and see 'The Bourne Supremacy' and you will find out everything (or almost everything) about this former secret-service agent, formed to kill.'The Bourne Supremacy' is an action movie in every sense of this word. The music is full of rhythm and makes your adrenalin mount and rises the pleasure of watching the scenes of life and death chase in India, with fights and suspense in Berlin, and with car rushing along the streets of Moscow. Although the movie is long, it's very well thought of and as such keeps your attention during the whole time.Our hero (if we can call a professional murderer a hero) wants a normal life, but his past is too dark and he is too dangerous for some people, that they hunt him in his dreams and in the reality. So he is forced to discover the past and put all bits of pieces together. Doing so he is not making a mistake, ""they never make a mistake"".And as I loved the scene in the previous movie in which he is knocking down the two Swiss police officers that don't let him sleep on the bench, I loved the similar scene in this movie, only with an Italian carabinieri and an American consulate employee.

The Eye-Strain Supremacy,"THE BOURNE IDENTITY really took me by surprise in the summer of 2002. I thought it was an engaging and entertaining, if not hollow, action-spy thriller filled with great stunts and an even better cast. You can imagine how much I was anticipating the release THE BOURNE SUPREMACY in the summer of 2004. Well, imagine my surprise when I walked out of the theater last night thinking the movie was inferior in every way possible.There's no plot: Bourne is framed for killing some people. WOW! That must have taken weeks to come up with. The screenplay is devoid of much wit or engaging dialogue. The movie looks like they strapped a camera on the backs of a couple of monkeys and chased the monkeys around Europe with big sticks.The camera never stopped moving. It was a lot of shaky, hand-held, out-of- focus-half-the-time closeups with terrible blocking, and the fight scenes and car chases were completely incoherent. Talk about making my eyes hurt. I literally had to close my eyes about half-way through the film just so I didn't go blind from the eye-strain. And Ebert & Roeper toted this film as one of the best action films in years? Puh-lease.Let's hope that when the next BOURNE movie gets greenlit that the filmmakers learn how to use a steadicam and a dolly!!!*1/2 out of ****",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Near flawless,"Action movies are supposed to make your heart race and your adrenaline glands roar into action. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" does exactly that, with its centerpiece being an insane car chase, certainly the best one I've ever seen.I say it's near flawless only because the camera work was nausea-inducing. Of course for scenes of intense action it is customary to have a shaky, hand-held camera, but not for every scene in the movie, for God's sake. It wasn't so much nausea-inducing as headache-inducing, as my eyes got tired of flicking around to follow the action.Otherwise, apart from a few believability problems, I couldn't find anything wrong. My problems include: how can you get shot in the shoulder and not have a hole in your coat? How can you get broadsided in a car by another one at high speed and not even get sidelined with whiplash? How can a cruddy old taxi outpace brand-new, souped-up Mercedes-Benzes? But that's all OK - I should know by now, the hero of an action movie is invincible.""The Bourne Supremacy"" keeps the adrenaline flowing and the knuckles white almost constantly. The cast is flawless - nobody dragged the rest down. If you want your movie to be successful, you need a really good lead actor, and that's exactly what Matt Damon is. He balances the troubled human and the trained superhuman with amazing ease and naturalness. He is equally at home being frightened and confused as being ruthless and efficient.""The Bourne Supremacy"", as a spy action-thriller, is a refreshing change from the Bond franchise. The main difference here is that the hero is not a suave, handsome, martini- drinking, womanizing, suit-wearing, British assassin, but a CIA deserter who has changed his ways and only wants to settle down for a quiet life with the woman he loves, and who is haunted by the nightmares and visions induced by his past. In short, he's human, and that makes us pay more attention to him and care about him. Of course neither Bond nor Bourne makes mistakes, and they both like to drive and run really fast, but hey - sometimes breaking too far from the mold is bad.My rating is 8/10. I really hate coming out of a great movie with a headache just because some camera-person has a shaky hand.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a great movie!!!,"Hi All, I first started reading Robert Ludlum books way back in 1987....I've read them all, and many of them 2, 3 even 4 times!!!!! I am a BIG fan of his books. (One of the best adaptions from book to movie is 'The Osterman Weekend' starring John Hurt.....if you like Jason Bourne, you'll love the Osterman Weekend..)I really looked forward to the Bourne Identity....I figured with so much money they would make a good one.....I must say I was one of those that felt the first movie just didn't work for me. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, just too nice a face, too nice a guy, to be Jason Bourne......and the movie was so different from the book. Hard for folks like me to make the transition...But the Bourne Supremacy. WOW!!This put the character of Jason Bourne of the book right up there on the screen.....not spoiling it at all....but the motivating factor for Bourne to 'come back' brings out the ruthlessly efficient soldier that he is....(A shame the movie does not have enough time to explore the character of Jason Bourne as he is described in the books. Knowing his past helps a lot more in understanding why he is the way he is...)The action is MUCH more like the Jason Bourne of the book and this time, Matt Damon, a few years older, a few years harder, looking more focused and stern, really pulled off what is a really tough role.I was really, really impressed and as a fan of the books for so long I was really, really happy to see the character I had made up in my head from the book up there on the screen.......If you are like me, love the books, and didn't think the Bourne Identity really cut it compared to the book, do yourself a favour and go see the Bourne Supremacy.

Rockin' all over Europe!,"The Bourne Supremacy is a sequel to the remake of a TV-movie and based on a successful novel. On paper perhaps the worst possible idea imaginable, but on the screen a lot of old-fashioned action-entertainment. In the 2002's the Bourne Identity, we were introduced to Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an ex CIA-agent suffering from amnesia. Many mean people tried to kill him but he managed to escape with a little help from Franka Potenta (Lola!) and her mini-Cooper. Jason is still on the run and evil Russians use his coordinates to sabotage a CIA mission in Berlin, Germany. Jason is p****d off (who wouldn't be?) and decides to dig up his past once and for all. Paul Greengrass managed to make a highly amusing film, using almost the entire European continent as his playground. It has tension, speed and oppressed humor while some of the technological gimmicks make you gasp! Matt Damon shines as Bourne again and he's the closest thing to an action-hero we've seen in a long time. He's everything a dull and routine hero is not! Confused, emotional, incognito and  most of all  unfunny! No lame one-liners here and that's a relief. Bourne's portrayal might as well be called the best aspect of the entire film.

Good Entertainment With Competent Performances but a Slightly Disappointing Storyline and Frenetic (Sometimes Lunatic) Camera Work,"When I visit a movie store, my eyes fall first on Oscar-winning drama films, then under-appreciated World movies, funny flicks, Meryl Streep films. and lastly on action and espionage movies, political and courtroom dramas. This generally happens because (i) generic action films have nothing but macho men blowing stuff up and cops chasing them and (ii) I find it tiresome to focus on plots that have external factual details such as following some case proceedings or listening to characters talking about covert mission plans. My hands would pick Singin in The Rain instead of And Justice for All, or Revolutionary Road instead of Die Hard, though I love a great narrative loaded with action and imaginative sequences such as Kill Bill. I've also watched Angelina Jolie's Salt quite a few times, even though it's plot was paper thin; the reason for that may be the sexy butt-kicking Jolie and pure fist-pumping action.So it wasn't me who bought the Bourne trilogy but my father, though he hasn't watched a single part. I liked Bourne One because it had a good balance between plot and action plus a romantic angle that's oh-so-common in such films. I unwrapped Bourne Supremacy almost five years since I purchased the CDs (Bourne Ultimatum is still packed in plastic) knowing I'll get a decent product because of talented Matt Damon's presence. Plus I wanted to see the previous movies before watching Bourne Legacy that's just arrived in theaters. And the second installment did provide me good entertainment with competent performances but I was slightly disappointing by the storyline and the frenetic fast cuts that robbed the 'edge of the seat' moments.Matt Damon reprised the role of Jason Bourne in 2004 in Bourne Supremacy along with Franka Potente who played Marie, his love interest from Bourne Identity. Bourne and Marie settle in Goa, India, miles away from his troubles, spending their days in Goan markets and beaches. Bourne has unanswered questions that he keeps recording in his diary. Troubles do find a way to him when an operation led by CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy to buy evidence exposing a mole within the agency goes awry and Bourne's fingerprints are planted by Russian agent Kirill, thus implicating Bourne of murders and theft of $20 million. Kirill is then sent by Russian oil oligarch Gretkov to Goa to kill Bourne, thus ending the case there and then. Bourne escapes but loses his fiancé, and vows to find out what's going on and get his vengeance.The writing is similar to any conventional thriller, where the traitor is an unexpected figure (although we do figure it out way before the person comes out), the situations are predictable and the dialogs are typical of most spy films. The characters seem to be doing everything right but they don't do enough. Bourne is a brand so we'll keep talking about him but who's going to speak about how Machiavellian the traitor was (not mentioning the name) or how bad-ass Kirill was. Gretkov receives shoddy treatment as he doesn't have much role in towards the end. And there could have been more telephonic interactions/negotiations between Bourne and Pamela Landy (remember Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling's spine-chilling interactions in Silence of the Lambs). It seems Bourne Supremacy was written keeping in mind the success and straightforward approach of Bourne Identity, and so the writers didn't attempt at making the dialogs richer and juicier to avoid any risks. But it is taking these risks that lead to better results.The cinematographer took some risks by fast cutting his action sequences and they did work but only at times, and that's because he went for overkill. The car chase sequence in Russia could've been so much impactful had the camera not jumped like every quarter a second. The result was that I had no idea who was ramming or shooting whom. Also in the starting sequence at the Berlin office where the camera moves constantly between so many characters it's difficult to get what's happening but more importantly you give up and just wait for the next segment to start normally. Even the car chase with Bourne and Marie was ruined by the jumpy camera. The scenes with Bourne and Irena Neski, daughter of late politician Neski, where the camera does not cut between frames that much, although the shaky camera is still present, and Bourne and Landy, where their faces are seen in profile on the left and right of the frame, are more memorable because we as the audience pay attention.Bourne Supremacy ultimately works because it has all the basic formal elements to keep the viewers engaged. I don't know whether this was intended as a metaphor, but I found two places where Bourne notices blood on his hands, and he tries to wash it off in one scene. But, against his wish, blood shall always remain on his hands and he'll never get the peace that he wants. Hence come Bourne Ultimatum and Bourne Legacy (and more). I'm glad they forwent the idea of restricting much of the film to an Indian jail (they had planned this in an alternate script) since that would've been duller. But the scope of the film (the four locales – Russia, Germany, India and Italy) called for a stronger script with more well-rounded characters (in those terms, Mission Impossible 4 succeeded to a better extent).MY Rating: 6.8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simply stunning,"I cant believe some people voted 1 for this movie It was the best movie I've seen so far if sucky movies like chicago and titanic can win 9 to ten Oscars this shud win that much and more to me the taste of those who vote for the Oscars os too girly and sucks bigtime!! for those who haven't watched this one, don't miss it, just don't miss it the story was so fast paced and absorbing and the acting of matt damon was great to say the least the story was awesome with ludlum bringing out his usual brilliance and some of the action scenes were edge of the seat breathtaking stuff it wasn't one of those movies with machine guns firing away, meaningless violence which suck horrible and irritate the user not to mention the deafening noise, the dialogues were typical spy stuff and bond movies don't come near this one great movie thanks ludlum and those involved in production for such a cool movie",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Huge Disappointment,"Another example of how a big studio prostitutes a story to make it likable to a wide audience, miserably failing in the attempt. It aspires to be much more than what it actually is, almost to the point of being pretentious. I haven't looked forward to a film with this much anticipation since Phantom Menace. And I haven't been this disappointed with a film since Phantom Menace. Half way through, it takes a left turn and just goes right down the toilet. I spent the rest of the movie either annoyed or disgusted by the sloppy and irritating cuts and pans. If you're looking to induce at least 100 seizures by way of its ungodly excess of edits and cuts and shakey hand held camera work then this movie is for you.",,Anonymous,Mystery
The second film in the series and Bourne is still up to his eyeballs in espionage.,"REVIEWBOT - The Bourne Supremacy had a lot to live up to after the action packed first instalment in the series, but I can confirm that it does;nd without the usual ""upping the ante."" Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is happily living off the grid with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) until an assassination attempt on him fails and Marie is killed. He soon discovers he is being framed for killing two CIA agents, and goes looking for answers. The detective investigating the murders Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) wants to bring Bourne in, with the help of Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who worked with him on the mysterious Treadstone operation. Bourne is having flashbacks, and is once again forced to play assassin as he uncovers the truth about his past.I enjoyed the movie, and found my hard-drive could barely process it fast enough with all of the action going on! Even with the arrival of new director Paul Greengrass, the transition from The Bourne Identity was smooth, with the same tone and fast pace and gritty camera work. However, some shots were a little haphazard; especially during the car chase scenes – I found it difficult to see everything that was happening.It seems odd to me that Marie was deleted so early, after her struggle for survival in the first film. She gave the chance for viewers to see a softer, more human side to Bourne. The cynical bot in me thinks it was a plot device, as she ""slowed him down."" Aside from this the film was good, with yet another strong performance from Matt Damon, he is a mighty human.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Better than the first, and the first was Excellent!","Part 2 of the Bourne series is even more fast-paced, and does not lose any of the down-to-earth grit of ""Identity"". Exceptional casting in this film, just like the first installment with a few characters carrying over. There is simply not any bad acting in this movie from anyone involved. They are all very believable in their roles.The storyline is as it is supposed to be, a continuance of ""Identity"" and therefore is on par with the first movie.The only complaint I had with the movie was the action sequences were a bit nauseating because of the camera-work being so shaky. I hope that they can find a way in the third installment to reduce that effect a bit or it might be better not to eat before the movie! Fortunately, the majority of the action sequences are over before I could get really sick.That being said, the car chase in this movie is one of the best ever filmed. Depite the shaky camera style, it is truly spectacular.There has been some debate among myself and fellow Bourne-O-Philes as to what happened to some Bourne's assassin counterparts in the interim between the first movie and the second, but it really does not affect the storyline. Instead it just makes guys like me lose sleep at night wondering where this character and that character ran off to.The cinematography (save for the shaky action scenes) is once again exceptional and sets the perfect mood for the story, using darkness and light to represent confusion and, toward the end, illumination.And this time the soundtrack is not only good, but exceptional. I even purchased the soundtrack separately which is something I rarely do.Too bad the star meter only goes to 10. I don't think that is high enough to record the level of enjoyment I gained from this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shaky cam ruins a good film,"A very solid entry into the espionage thriller category that could have been a lot more if the audience were actually able to watch the movie. Instead, anytime the action picks up we are subjected to the sort of camera-work one expects from a high school kid at a kegger. The fight choreography may be brilliant and the car chases stunning but you'll never know because all that makes it to the screen is a series of lightning fast jerky shots of blurry motion.This camera style is not ""hip"" or ""cool"" or whatever the director thought it was. It does not pull us into the action, or make us feel like we are there. Instead it brings an enormous sense of frustration and anger as we endure another fight scene and another chase scene so blurred and poorly shot that we can't even tell who the combatants are.Another installment in this series is inevitable. Here's to hoping they find a different director.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very enjoyable - 8/10,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an action film, which is the sequel to 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"". It is directed by Paul Greengrass, and follows the story of Jason Bourne, an ex-CIA agent, who was part of a hit squad called tretstone. At the start of the film we see Bourne trying to get away from his old life in India, but is dragged back in after being framed for the murder of two other CIA agents in Berlin.Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne in a gritty largely silent manner, and convinces as the cold blooded killer, especially in the way he goes about his business, with ruthless close quarters combat. Overall i would say it is an excellent turn from Matt Damon, and very different to many of his other performances. This is almost the opposite to a James Bond film, and it is a lot more serious. There are no cheesy one-liners or distracting love interests for Bourne, and this demonstrates how focused the character is. Instead of glossy sunny locations as in most action films, Greengrass chooses to represent the many cities involved as gritty bustling metropolises, especially Berlin where much of the film takes place. This film is on a large scale and other countries featured are England, Italy, the US and Holland. This shows the story is on a global level. There are also good action sequences, on a smaller level than in other action films like ""Mission impossible 2"", but in someways more exciting, as demonstrated in a thrilling car chase towards the climax of the movie.In conclusion - the plot is interesting, and has many twists and turns which keep the viewers attention. There are conspiracies, double crossings, and a web of murders builds up. It is one of the best action movies of recent times.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie - but too much Blair Witch camera effects,"This was an overall good film - well worth the price of admission in the ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" action department. The plot was, well, mildly predictable, but that's not why you're there.However, a major drawback of the film was the, decidedly amateur-style camera work. I realize that a little shaking about adds chaos to the film and makes it ""edgy"" but, come on - I needed a Dramamine half-way through the film. They couldn't even keep the camera steady while he was reviewing the newspapers for heaven's sake. The director of this film should be forced to sit, eyes propped open ""Clockwork-Orange"" style, and watch this film over and over again until he pukes, so he knows to never again hire the film crew from the Blair Witch project.In short, an enjoyable film that you won't notice the negatives about provided you have palsy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Delivers what was expected,"The 2nd edition of what is going to be an action trilogy. The Bourne Suprmacy follows up on its prequel The Bourne Identity in perfect fashion. What makes this movie excellent is that it kept the same ingredients as first movie. Much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you liked the first one, you'll want the next one. The Bourne Identity captured Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) trying to figure out who he was. He accomplished that. In this movie, he tries to put the pieces of his slight memories together to figure out just what he did. Incredible action sequences and a very interesting story gives me the impression that when this whole trilogy is finished, it will be among Die Hard, Matrix, and Indiana Jones as one of the greatest action trilogies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It makes me dizzy nd makes me sad/disappointed!,"This movie is totally out of control. the film editing, and the cameraman knows how to give the crowd a headache!

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! IT was not a terrible film though. It is a descent action film, has a few surprising twists, better acton scenes, and better new characters, like Pam. nothing is what it seems in this film. i did like the very ending and that Damon has once again improved his usage as Bourne.

Far worse than Identity,"This movie is nothing special. In fact it is rather bad, and I have little enthusiasm in writing much, except to say that I agree with others comments about the camera work being too shaky. Many scenes are ruined by this camera technique.An epileptic camera isn't original by any means. NYPD Blue anyone? In other words, yesterday's cheap TV effect... not cool. The same cinematographer worked on Identity under a better Director and did a fine job. He was obviously told by the Director of Supremacy to use this awful shaky camera effect.That scene where the house blows up and the men get thrown back - they cut 3 times during the explosion and the result was they lost the energy of a perfectly good explosion. Dreadful. The close up shot of this explosion on the DVD extra features was better than the one used in the final cut! Back to film school Mr. editor. There are many other poor editing/camera moments.The film falls down in other ways though. The acting is stale, the story is weaker than the first. Even the car chase scene through Moscow - heralded as some kind of great car chase feat - is not only ruined by the overly-confusing camera work (you can't see what's going on), but ends with a disappointing anti-climax.The ""crash-cam"" effect from within Bourne's car is very cool.... but this is an isolated moment of coolness.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent - As good, if not better than the original","I watched this back to back and enjoyed every minute of it. The hand-held cameras were annoying and distracting and took away the feeling of being caught up in the action. They were intended to give that feeling, but the overuse has the opposite effect. When the action is that fast a hand-held doesn't give us more of the chaotic action of a fight, it only brings chaos, and is something Hollywood should consider. I was surprised to see Marie killed at the beginning, but it reminds us of the stark brutality of Bourne's job. In the first movie we saw a Bourne that was uneasy around women. He worked as a loner and probably would have been uneasy with anyone who could compromise his situation. In the second, with Marie dead we get a chance to see the real Bourne, alone, the way he really was. With the Tredstone project dead I liked the interaction with the Neski daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed both movies and this is a rare treat when the sequel ids as good if not better than the original",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the few sequels that truly surpasses it's original.,"The Bourne Supremacy is something of a little gem, in a typical stagnant season of blockbuster scum. The Bourne Identity was a relatively average film. Interesting premise, with some good acting, and exciting action sequences. Yet it felt slightly still, and to be honest a sequel was not exactly expected. However the Bourne Supremacy is an astounding, and exciting continuation of the Jason Bourne saga. Matt Damon is solid as Jason Bourne again, along with a great supporting cast (particularly Brian Cox). Yet the true star of this film is the director. The selection of a documentary film maker was genius, considering the renaissance and popularity documentary film is receiving at the moment. Paul Greengrass does something few Hollywood traditionalists even try to achieve - realism. The Bourne Supremacy really does have some truly groundbreaking and astounding moments. The car chase through Russia in particular feature some amazingly surprising and innovative shots. I can't believe the complaints I am seeing about shaky handwork - yes it has a lot of hand-held shots, but the accusations of them causing nausea are not only melodramatic, but wholly immature - fast editing isn't something new so these seem somewhat irrelevant and misguided. The Bourne Supremacy may not be without it's faults, but it really is a fantastic ride that takes a relatively average film, and turns it into a potentially brilliant franchise. Hopefully number three will be greenlighted with Greengrass at the helm again. Although number three will have a hell of a lot to live up to.",,Anonymous,Mystery

The Bourne Supremacy,"With the first film, The Bourne Identity (2002), Matt Damon showed the world that he was a believable action film star. The Bourne Supremacy is certainly a match for the first film, yet it also feels so different (more on this in a mo). However, it still shows that this is a franchise that can easily stand up to any other spy film, even the long running Bond series.But this is a different kind of film than Bond's various outings. There's no quick one-liners, no endless array of women to pick up, and no high-tech gadgetry. Instead, director Paul Greengrass focuses on the character of Bourne as a person, someone who can feel both physical and emotional pain. He may seem cold at times, but is certainly far from being emotionless. And unlike many spies in films, he can be hurt; he falls on his leg at one point, and has to limp through the rest of the film. This all adds up to a character who feels so human, like it could be anyone you pass on the street. It makes you care about what is happening to him, and also makes you wonder whether all will end up fine in the end, like the Bond films always do; you know Bond will triumph and there will be no consequences, whereas with Bourne you're not quite sure if all will go quite so smoothly.As with the last film, the action scenes are mostly short and brutal; Bourne has a very physical approach to dealing with the people on his trail. These climax in an extremely well shot car chase through Moscow. Whilst it is an awesome scene, with realism highest on the agenda (none of this fake laws-of-physics-stretching stuff that seems so popular in Hollywood), it does seem a tad too long, and you end up wanting it to finish soon so your brain has some time to catch up. But this is a small point to make, as the rest of the film is so well paced, without feeling the need to bung in an action scene just because there hasn't been one for almost ten whole minutes, like so many films (stand up Van Helsing, we're talking about you).If there is one complaint to be made about The Bourne Supremacy it is that it doesn't feel as fresh as the first film. In Identity, the audience are as baffled as Bourne about his true identity, and that was one of the attractions of that film  we really didn't know what would happen next. With the majority of his memories returned, we now know what skills Bourne has, and what he would do in certain situations. What made the first film so good was the fact that we didn't know what skills he had; the scene where he uses martial arts on the police for the first time, and his own reaction to what just happened was typical of what made the first film so appealing.However, the cast are all of high standard, especially Joan Allen and Brian Cox as two CIA bosses vying for control of the situation. Franka Potente makes a brief return as Bourne's love interest and is the source for his emotional trauma, but it is Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne which is definitely the stand out here. Ironically, even though he is the lead character, he has the least to say in the film, instead relying on shots of him quietly brooding and contemplating his next move to make us feel sympathy for him. This, and the original, is certainly the most intelligent and well-crafted spy film for ages.Rated: 7.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:The score for The Bourne Supremacy was always a bit of a tough one. I felt that although it should be an 8, the fact that it was not as fresh as the first film brought it down. However, having viewed it again I think that it does thoroughly deserve a score of 8. If anything, it is even more intense than The Bourne Identity, and director Paul Greengrass' use of the shaky camera gives the film a gritty, real-life feel that complements what the film is about. Although I still can't decide which film I prefer, I think they are equally as good as each other, and both deserve the same score. With The Bourne Ultimatum due in 2007 - again with Greengrass directing - my hopes are high for a stellar spy trilogy.Re-rated: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Before Watching: The Bourne Supremacy (2004),"""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) is the second, action-filled movie within the Bourne-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Generally speaking, The Bourne Supremacy is more intense, more violent and more intellectually demanding than its prequel, but also less charming. A few events in the beginning rob the movie of a part of its soul, which it later tries to compensate for with more spectacular scenes then what we were treated with in The Bourne Identity. The more you prefer action over character dynamics, the less of an issue this creates. However, the opposite is also true.As said above, this movie is more demanding than the first installment. Attention needs to be put into understanding events and reasoning, otherwise the movie might come across as all too random and complicated.Finally, The Bourne Supremacy begins the trend of which the Bourne-franchise is infamous for: the shaky cam. Although it can be a bit distracting sometimes, Greengrass handles it well and it is not too confusing nor disorientating. Do not let it put you off beforehand. It only gets in your way if you constantly think about it.My personal grade: a fast-paced 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Follow-Up,"The Bourne Supremacy (2004)Review: After the exciting first installment, we get Bourne again!(I know, that was silly) This is an even better movie than the first by far. I am beginning to care about spy movies again.The Bourne Supremacy starts with our hero one again trying to figure out who he is. The memories keep coming, but still the pieces don't fit. He is secluded to a small town out somewhere in Asia. Suddenly a new person arrives in town and Bourne suspects somethings wrong. He warned them if they come looking for him, it will be hell.The story here is far better than the first. We gain some more character development and more depth. Bourne will once again travel back to find out who ordered to find him and maybe try to get some answers about his past.What really works here is the action. It's just as fast as the first and more real. One fight in particular is awesome, tight, and feels real. The acting here is even better than the first. Damon shows a more darker side of Bourne. This is a more darker movie than the first.I must mention the car chase scene here is far better than the first-and that's saying something! This one here is not only awesome, but more real. Bourne gets hit at least four times during this chase! This chase scene is so awesome that-when it's over, the broken glass and spilled gasoline will be all over you! Intense is the word.Give kudos this time to Joan Allen. She is really great here.The Last Word: Fantastic! This is just awesome. If you liked the first, than get ready for a high-octane monster!

The story was good, though predictable, and the acting was good, but there was a lot of really bad camera work.

I have heard that they intend to continue the Bourne series with at least one more film.

Stillbirth.,"Few sequels are as good as the original, but this one is really pretty bad, distilling out of the first version everything that was good and simply throwing it away, then adding some stuff that makes it almost impossible to watch..Take the title. ""The Bourne Identity"" actually had meaning. There was a question driving the movie -- just who IS this amnesic guy? Even the name ""Bourne"" added a bit of symbolic weight. This one is called ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Supremacy in what endeavor? And why supremacy? Why not just superiority? Or even equality? ""The Bourne Equality?"" I guess not.No one could fault the performers, who in other environments have been more than adequate. Matt Damon was good as Mister Ripley, and superb as the guilt-ridden junkie in ""Courage Under Fire."" Joan Allen, as always, projects a curious but appealing mixture of fortitude and femininity. Nobody else in the movie counts for much.The plot is more or less dismissible. Bourne is set up and then pursued by some corrupt inner circle of CIA officials and Russians. It has something to do with the privatization of Russian oil, but it all boils down to one long chase.What really dismembers the movie is the direction and the editing. If you can imagine Oliver Stone on meth, you'll get the general picture.There is, first, a terrible imposition of directorial self display during some scenes. A blurry step-motion murder. A zapped up memory flashback in negative. But that in itself wouldn't be so awful. The problem is that it never stops.The camera seems to be ataxic. I can't remember a single scene in which it held still. It wobbles pointlessly all over the place or it focuses on some unimportant object like a venetian blind while the action takes place elsewhere, as if the director had been weaned on MTV or one of those TV commercials for a brokerage firm or a toothpaste whitener. (""I was afraid to smile in public until I discovered Dentabrite with Endorphin."") Let me give an example. Jason Bourne is doing some library research. He's reading microfiche of newspaper items in Russian and English and turns up some important information. The camera shows us the articles and the associated photographs -- but it WOBBLES so we can't read anything. There are dozens of ways of giving a viewer the gist of a story without asking him or her to read the details of the article. Erroll Morris showed us one effective way -- just hold the camera on the header. But this aimless wavering is positively irritating.The editing is equally poor. Every change of scene seems to be a cut, not a dissolve. And the cuts come fast and thick -- say every few seconds. Objects zoom aimlessly in and out of focus. And the director is given to lightning-quick pans, often past unidentifiable dark objects.If the direction and editing are a major problem during most of the movie, they turn into insurmountable obstacles during action scenes. A furious mano a mano shows us one-second glimpses of a fist here, a foot there, a knife skittering along the floor, a window breaking. The obligatory car chase comes towards the end, with the possible novelty of having been actually filmed in the gray streets and tunnels of Moscow, but the promise is unfulfilled. Each shot lasts a second or so and gives us mostly details -- Bourne's grimace at the wheel of his speeding taxi, a pistol being fired by somebody whose identity we must guess, cars chasing cars chasing cars chasing a car -- the movie should have been called ""Chasing Sanbourne."" (That was a wretched play on words. Can I take it back?)You know why the original ""Bourne Identity"" was above average, at least in my humble opinion? It had a better plot, for one thing. We were as interested as Bourne himself in finding his identity. For another thing, it had a developing relationship between Bourne and the girl (Famke Potente) whose car he hires. For another, there was violence, but it was not done to the viewer. The fights were unexpected, brutal, and staged in such a way that we could follow the events. And finally, the original gave us a chance to breathe between the zaps, an opportunity to learn something about the characters and their situations, about the kinds of music they listen to on a car radio.All of that -- and more -- is missing from this meretricious attempt to make a few bucks by tapping into the inelastic demand of an audience of viewers whose heads are as empty as their intolerance of boredom is great. I don't mean to cast aspersions on people who may have enjoyed this movie more than I did, just on the people who assembled it with that audience in mind.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Awesome plot, storytelling and some standout logical stuff but not as good as the other two","The Bourne Supremacy is the least favorite Bourne film of mine so far (you know there's gonna be a forth one). But it still stands higher than most action thrillers out there today.One of the improvements that I really appreciate from it is the bigger amount of scenes that show us Jason Bourne's incredibly high IQ. Scenes such as the trick where Bourne gets to know Pamela Landy's room number secretly and the Berlin foot chase where Jason escapes the police in a very intelligent way are definitely highlights. And they're generally the things we, ordinary people, are able to do, despite the fact that most of us can't bring ourselves to such intelligent solutions. The final car chase in Moscow is also one of the best in movie history in my opinion, which is better than the overrated one in The Dark Knight as I believe.As for the story, it's highly logical and intellectual, aside from only one minor plot hole where we've no idea how that happens (how Jason finds the only alive Treadstone operative besides himself hasn't been explained). Some people found the plot hard to follow, while for me, it's very well written. And depending on your taste, you might prefer it to the story of the first one or not.However, there are certain things that keep it from being an excellent film like The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum. First, it lacks the adequate amount of action sequences that keep viewers' eyes glued to the big screen. Also, though I'm by no means an opponent of shaky camera work, it's obviously been overused in this film. In general they don't bother me, but that supposed-to-be-gorgeous martial-arts combat was terribly ruined by this method of shooting. Apart from this one, there're also some weak moments like the car chase in India and the tram scene. The ending of the movie, though not cliffhanger, kind of has an unfinished sense; thus by watching that you'd hunger for a sequel. Above are the factors making this a lesser movie than the other two in the series IMO.The character development on the other hand is well arranged. Bad guys in this film are shown as being corrupted and the motivation for the way they act is believable. While it's less emotional than its predecessor, that however adds to the film-noir style it delivers, which definitely works for its own good.8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ignore the critics - the shaky camera-work is great!!,"Hollywood is finally beginning to discover the knack of making great sequels to great original films, invariably making them even better. This summer we've had ""Shrek 2"" and ""Spiderman 2"" to prove this rule and now we have ""The Bourne Supremacy"".I went into this hoping that it would be at least as good as ""The Bourne Identity"" (for my money one of the best films of 2002). I was a bit dubious about the choice of Paul Greengrass for this type of film. I've seen ""Theory of Flight"", ""The Murder of Stephen Lawrence"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" and enjoyed them all, with ""The Murder of Stephen Lawrence"" being particularly impressive in its use of grainy hand-held camera-work to help suggest that what you were watching was in fact a documentary rather than a drama. But these were serious films with serious themes and Greengrass would have been my last choice for an expensive Hollywood sequel to a blockbusting action film.Well I'm glad to say I was wrong. Greengrass has managed to improve on Doug Liman's excellent original in almost every way. The fight scenes are well shot and edited in a way I haven't seen since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". The choice of hand-held camera is very effective here and ably puts across how a fight would seem in real life rather than a static camera watching two people throw punches at each other. If you're caught up in such a fight, it is chaotic and you can't always tell what is happening. The same can be said for the car chases (although I think the car chase has the slight edge in the first film, it is still effectively presented here and is still miles better than most car chases portrayed in films in recent years). Needless to say, I didn't suffer from any motion sickness. Quite the reverse, the camera-work and the editing really pull you into this film.The acting is good with a great quality cast even in the minor roles (all of which help Matt Damon look even better than than he is - and he is good here). And whilst it may seem to some who have commented here already that Julia Stiles is particularly wasted in such a tiny role and whilst I would have liked to see more of her, at least the character wasn't there solely as a new romantic interest for Matt Damon (which I feared she was shaping up to be). And the scene in which Damon terrorises her with a gun is terrific with Stiles seemingly in genuine terror of what Damon might do to her (a risky scene as Bourne does come across as unsympathetic here). As she usually plays such strong characters, it was a change to see her do something different and do it so well. A great piece of acting from a great actress. She makes every one of her few scenes count and I hope they find a way to bring her back for the inevitable third film (""The Bourne Franchise"" perhaps?)The story itself is a bit convoluted and I'm not sure I fully understood the back story (this is from someone who managed to understand what was going on in the Tom Cruise/Brian De Palma version of ""Mission Impossible""). But in truth it doesn't really matter. If you saw the first film then you know that Damon's Jason Bourne is a contract killer working for the CIA who has suffered from amnesia and can't remember most of his past life (even his real name). The actual plot about the Russian mafia is merely what Hitchcock called a ""McGuffin"", just an excuse to see Bourne framed for something he didn't do and for the CIA to pursue him all over again while Bourne has his own agenda as he struggles to regain his memory.In a film chock full of great moments, Tony Gilroy's intelligent script leaves the very best scene to the end when Bourne confronts the daughter of a man he has killed to tell her the truth and ask for her forgiveness. This is a scene of great humanity and elevates the film into another dimension entirely, proving that not all Hollywood blockbusters have to be completely brain dead to be successful. It also proves that Matt Damon can be a good actor when given the opportunity, especially since the scene features little dialogue, requiring Damon to act with his face. He is matched in an equally excellent performance from Russian actress Oksana Akinshina in her English debut performance (she was in Lilya 4-ever). In just a few minutes screen time, she manages to make her mark to such an extent that I will never forget the look on her face as she discovers the truth about the death of her parents. Although there is not a single weak link in the acting stakes in this film, her performance is the one I will remember and she deserves to go onto bigger things in the future.The last great touch to this great film is the welcome reprise of Moby's ""Extreme Ways"" over the closing credits. Brilliant!!Bring on the next instalment. Now!!",,Anonymous,Mystery
More Frantic Surviving from Matt Damon,"Camera work is a little nausea inducing. More of the same running and hiding. Not a bad movie, but like the first I found it to be a bit too much action and thin on content. We get he has amnesia. We get he is hard as nails. We get the company are corrupt and he just wants to be left alone. After a while of the same stuff I get a little bored. Everyone kill Bourne so we can hide our indiscretions is pretty much the premise and even though the fight scenes and car chases are impressive, I would like less of the action, running,hiding, spying etc and a lot more depth in the back story. Hopefully the third movie will provide more of this which will make the whole saga worthwhile. So far Identity and Supremacy have left me a little disappointed and 6.5 is the most I can offer.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great flick,"This movie was a worthy sequel to the first entry to what will probably become a trilogy. While the films are vastly different from the books they are based on, they have so far done an excellent job of recreating the main character and the events surrounding him. As far as political suspense films go, this is tops, at least in my book. If you haven't seen the first, definitely do so before seeing this film. Mat Damom does a great job playing a former amnesiac who has come to terms with his abilities as a top assassin. All surviving characters return to create an engrossing storyline that makes a film that not only builds on, but also seems to extend the events seen in the Bourne Identity.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
the best action flick of the year,"This was a fantastic movie even if you haven't seen the first. Jason Bourne is framed of a double murder in Berlin. Bourne at the time is in India when the Russian secret service comes and tries to kill him. He gets out of India and rest of the movie is a fast paced chase through Europe.The movie is a fast paced movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It should go down as one of the best spy/espionage movies ever. Its all the fun of any Bond flick but much classier.This movie is great for all ages, its better than Bond and even kids will be able to appreciate it",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you like action movies but wish they were more realistic, you really should watch this movie.","A fantastic movie. It does for James Bond what Unbreakable does for Superman. Where the Bond movies focus on spectacular yet entirely unrealistic action sequences, the Bourne movies focus on Bourne, as they should. And Bourne is a super agent either, he's a normal human being who gets hurt and even cries. The action sequences aren't blown out of proportion, they're realistic and no bigger that they would be in real life.You might think that this would take away the thrill that can be had from action movie but it really doesn't. If anything, it enhances it. Once we know that Bourne is just a man, we really really feel like it's something when he does the things he does. He uses his brain and his abilities to solve problems, and when cornered he lashes out like a trapped animal. These are not the actions of a cool, calm action hero, but a man desperate to get out of the bad situation he has ended up in. The action sequences are close, intense and real. In other action films a car swerves to avoid another and you might be mildly intrigued, but in The Bourne Supremacy you feel like you're in the car, and if Bourne dies, you die.So there are definitely a lot of good things I could say about this movie, which is intelligent, exciting and engaging, and very few bad things (seriously, nothing comes to mind). Simply, this is one of the best films I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shaky camera almost ruins strong follow up to 'Bourne Identity',"What really kept this film from becoming what it really could have, was the tiresome over-use of the, 'shaky camera' syndrome.I mean come on, it was like Katherine Hepburn shooting from atop a circus ball in a mudslide on a stormy day. (No disrespect for our beloved Hepburn) It has it's place however too much of a good thing can be bad and that's what happened here. It took away from many moments including, the fight scenes.As in the first Bourne, the action was quick yet settled enough to let you absorb what was happening while keeping the effect. Here, two monkeys could have been flailing around and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Why the need for so much cover up instead of taking the effort to choreograph some smart and believable sparring? It was truly effective in the first Bourne and should have been kept along the original spirit. Yes we understand different Directors have their own niche so, I'm saying Greengrass and his niche wasn't as Bourne as Director Liman.It was an interesting story and I believe writer Tony Gilroy did a good job, even humorous at times which played very well. Yet I would like to have seen a bit more that unpretentious and natural physical combat and clever side winding as in the first. Still, it was an interesting film, though it was done pretty well yet still fell short of my hopes.Damon was made for this and like roles and again an excellent character portrayal. Being a stud without trying to be, is just what this part needed and Matt does a great job at it. As far as I'm concerned, it's about time Damon finds another part of his stride. I hope he continues a while along this path.All in all Damon and writer Gilroy were the best aspects of this film. Not quite enough to make it what it should have, but they did a good job in making up the best they could for Greengrass' minor mistake in vision, that made a very big impact.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne to be wild....,"I'm going to go see this movie again. This time, I'm going to actually count the number of cars that get wrecked in the process because the first time through, I really did lose count after the first 20 minutes. That's probably because, as thrillers go, this one is really pretty thrilling. And Matt Damon might just be the most darling boy to stare into a camera since Cary Grant. His little boy looks, his determined charm and the way he can wallop all adversaries is so much fun to watch that it's actually possible to forget that the plot of every ""Bourne"" movie tends to get lost in the action -- and in car body count. Leaving a trail of dead bodies, dead engines and broken windows behind, this Bourne-again movie is mesmerizing in its fast-forward style action. Barely has Jason eluded one enemy than another slinks in. The human body count rises as he races through every grim European city imaginable (except Helsinki I think) without the sun breaking through a single cloud and without a decent night's sleep. (In fact, in the course of the film, I became obsessed with the idea that this guy hadn't gotten a more than a catnap in 6 countries.) By willingly suspending disbelief for almost two hours, it's possible to thoroughly indulge in this often exhilarating, often exhausting film. At its conclusion, the ""Bourne Supremacy"" gives movie fans what they're all too often cheated of: Satisfaction. And a good, albeit, rocky ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie - despite the nauseating action sequences!,"First off, I really enjoyed the Bourne Identity, and if you didn't like that one, than you probably won't like this either. I found the movie excellent, with a good plot and Matt Damon is again excellent as the torn former assassin Jason Bourne. I won't go into the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything, but the one thing I will say in a negative light is that all of the action sequences, and a few other scenes, are shot with hand held (i.e unsteady) cameras, and this nauseates me, literally. Not only does it make the action hard to follow, but it makes me sick. Not quite as bad as the Blair Witch Project in this regard, but the same idea. Fortunately, most of the scenes are with traditional steady cameras. I realize the director has a taste for hand held cameras, but using them for action sequences is a waste of a well-choreographed action sequence, as you can't see anything. However, the movie was excellent, and I recommend it.3.5/4",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A proper espionage film,"I just read a guy's comments about the camera work distracting him from the sheer brilliance of this film. I was enraged. Don't slag off a film because you have a weak stomach and no concept of intelligent, skillful and engaging film-making.This is a truly great film that is genuinely better than the original. The 'handy-cam' style makes the fight scenes look spontaneous, raw and removes the choreographed element that are apparent in so many 'spy films'. The same applies for the car chase, whereby the jerky camera style shows the director has opted for rawness rather than glamorous backshots and 'stylish' scenes. I think the idea of having this handy-cam view heightens the audience's experience and places you in the moment, coming out feeling as if you have actually been with Bourne.Put alongside crap like Die Another Day, this film stands out as the 'thinking man's thriller'. It is the intelligent subtlety that makes it such a success. We are not treated like idiots, the film does not feel like it's going down pre-determined path. Matt Damon was born for this role. He is economical with his dialogue, making it such a fine performance. No cheesy lines, no bravado... a film about instincts and survival. His ruthless nemesis is awesome, with about 4 lines in the whole film; yet the rivalry and tension between them is more than apparent. A good supporting cast, clever plot, excellent direction and a unique intelligence make this a must see film.So, if you think you can take a few shaky camera scenes, this is definitely for you. If you all you want is explosions and cheesy chat-up line and think Die Another Day is one of the best films ever made, it isn't.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Catch him if you can...he's still on the run...,"Another chase thriller from Robert Ludlum's novel and directed by Jack Greengrass with customary skill at this sort of thing. By now MATT DAMON has the amnesia with the quick reflexes down pat, and he's still just as agile when responding to any known threat by the C.I.A. and the agents who think he masterminded a case of espionage that they're investigating. They're in full pursuit mode again and he's on the run and under cover.If not the most original story, it does give the viewer a chance to watch events unfold against interesting backdrops--Italian, German and Russian cities provide eye candy for tourists--but the fast-moving chase scenes are likely to distract from too much concentration on scenery. They're spectacular, especially a rather long, involved car chase that twists and turns its way through city streets.Enjoyable sequel is about on par with the original ""Bourne"" film.

Perfection amongst spy movies,"It's nearly impossible for me to pick a favourite from the original Bourne trilogy, but I suppose if you held a gun to my head I would have to go for the breathless, breakneck Bourne Supremacy. It's the first one I ever saw and one of the very first big summer movie experiences of my youth, so I have a burning nostalgia. I wouldn't base my decision solely on that, though. No, I've thought a lot about it, and Supremacy just has every element in pitch perfect place, every second of pacing hurtling by on full throttle and Matt Damon taking names like he never did before. I love the fact that Bourne has something driving him other than a need to know who and what he is this time around. He has revenge for the death of someone he loved, which is never something you want to provoke when you have someone like him gunning for you. Life is quiet for Jason and Marie (Franka Potente 😍) for about five seconds at the beginning of the film, until a highly skilled assassin (a capable, relentless Karl Urban) explodes into their lives, sends their jeep careening off a bridge, resulting in Marie's death. This pisses Jason off and then some, prompting a global excursion to find out who Urban works for and take them down. Also on his trail is CIA bigwig Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, excellent) and the severely morally misguided Ward Abbott (Brian Cox takes slimy to a whole new level in this outing). There's also scheming Russian oil magnate Gretkov (a relaxed Karel Roden) with his own reasons for wanting Bourne. As is always the case, Jason is the smartest guy in the room, more so even than those that trained him, and he out thinks, out shoots and outruns them all every step of the way that takes him nearer to his goal. He isn't simply running scared and confused with no outlet or idea how to use his talents anymore. He's a lethal asset with emotion and forethought on his side, and he takes no prisoners. Damon is just ridiculously badass, especially in the several furious hand to hand combat scenes he dances through, doling out the smackdown faster than anyone's reflexes can react. There's also a humanity to him, burgeoning regret when he learns what Treadstone made him do, and the yearning to set it right, or at least make himself known to the daughter (Oksana Akinshina) of a Russian couple he once murdered. People complain about all the shaky cam, but whatever man, it sure fires up an action sequence and places you right there amid the mayhem of a rattling jeep chase through a Berlin tunnel, a bone splintering man to man with an ex Treadstone operative (Marton Csokas) and more. Julia Stiles is terrifically intense as a girl who used to do the psych evaluations for agents, Chris Cooper briefly returns as Conklin, the devious founder of the program, and watch for Tomas Arana, Corey Johnson, Gabriel Mann and Michelle Monaghan too. Like I said it's a tricky task to pick a favourite, and on any given day I'd just say I love all three equally. This one just has a bit of an edge on the others in certain spots, and never feels like it bears the curse of the middle chapter. It's a tightly wound coil of a film that springs into kinetic motion with the force of a piston. I'm curious to see how the new Bourne flick does, but I doubt it'll come close to the first three, let alone this platinum classic.

"Great action flick, not quite on par for first installment","In the ""Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) must once again fend off constant attacks from assassins, police, agents and various other areas of law enforcement.  Of course, they are no match for Bourne's expertise in climbing, running, magazine-whipping, jumping,driving or ability to work a toaster.  The only problems I had with this movie was the herky-jerky camera style that Greengrass uses when it comes to fights.  This technique does do itself justice later in film with a spectacular car chase.  One of the things I like about these films are the amount of time Bourne goes along without dialogue.  He spends much of his time thinking quickly before he acts.  I love the scenes where he pulls out a map and scans over in a blink for an exit strategy.  These are scenes that separate Bourne from others. However, there is another assassin after him in this movie who seems as if he knows where everyone is going before they do.  Don't want to make it too easy for Bourne to dispense all comers in a few swift moves.  All the usual characters show up in ""B.S"", including a few bit players Nikki (Julia Stiles) and the tall skinny guy with short buzzed hair (don't know his name).  All of these actors give the show continuity.  Very good is Joan Allen as Agent Landy, an agent who is out of the loop before two of her agents are supposedly killed by Bourne.  Her sparring with the senior staff in the CIA is another subplot of the film.   Overall a good film, could have used better direction during the fights where I couldn't tell what was going on half the time.  Can't wait for the ""Bourne Ultimatum"".",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I also read some of the reviews before going to the movie and thought it would be hard to follow, I had no problem, and usually if there is more then one story to follow I get lost, I like to be entertained!All and All it was a great movie, worth the money and I'm glad we saw it in the theatre!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Someone Take Me Off This Roller Coaster,"The Bourne Supremacy is a decent movie that's really only tainted by the poor camera work and some missing additional action. I'm not going to get too involved with the story, since I'm sure someone else has already explained the plot. A short summary is that Jason Bourne is being framed for killing to agents in Berlin. The Secret Service is out to bring him in or terminate him. Jason has to travel all around the globe trying to track people down to prove his innocence. Even though there are some intense chase scenes throughout various international countries, what kills the beautiful action is the closeness of the camera. In every action scene, even the hand to hand combat, the camera is right on top of the actors. The fight between Jason and an old agent in his apartment is totally ruined because the camera is two feet away from them. At times it appears that the camera is in the fight as well, as he falls down and the camera bounces all over the place. Even the car chases, which usually show the action from close, medium and long distances, is constantly right next to the car. There are times when all you see is the front end and tire. Want to see good car chase camera work, watch ""Gone in 60secs."" Even check out the trailer for ""Taxi"" (starring Queen Latifah). That's how car chase scenes should be filmed.Besides this problem, the movie is pretty decent. Even though the plot is predictable, the end result isn't. All the actors do a great job in this film. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy and Matt Damon is perfect as the hard nosed take no prisoners Jason Bourne. I was looking forward to a bit more martial arts fighting, but it really didn't come.There is already talks of a third (and probably final) movie. Bourne Supremacy had a high opening of $51 million, which is nothing to sneeze at. Meanwhile Halley Barry's Catwoman only made $17 million. Is The Bourne Supremacy worth seeing.

Edited in a Veg-O-Matic?,"Previous poster mentioned that the choppy editing in this film works. Maybe so if you are wildly entertained by 30 second commercials. My husband swears there WAS a tracking shot in this film, but I sure didn't see one. The only thing I can figure out is that the film was shot and then the producer, editor, director, studio head, gaffer, gopher, janitor, or guy who read the focus group comments realized: ""We got no plot twists, no character development, and no interesting visuals. How we gonna save this franchise?"" The answer: ""Do not hold ANY shot for more than 2 seconds.If we incessantly cut, cut, cut; pan, pan ,pan; zoom, zoom, zoom; then the audience will be too confused, seasick, and migraine filled to notice that we got one big nothing. Yeah, that's the ticket."" I thought the first ""Bourne"" was just okay, but this one makes it look like a masterwork. Please send director Peter Greengrass back to Film 101!

Very well done,"While I shy away from fiction because it never stirs anything in me because I know it's fake, I give this flick high marks. The way it's filmed and the minute amount of improbable if not impossible stunts give the movie a very real feel. I think the director of this film created a new level of filming, raising a new bar that I have not yet seen met.While much of the story line in this series sounds preposterously improbable the novel it is named after is even more far-fetched and I did read the trilogy by Ludlum. Aside from the vivid description that can conjure some great imagination, I have to say the story did nothing for me other than read it with such incredulity wondering who could even come up with something so far-fetched and improbable. I am extremely glad that the movies have strayed entirely from the story line. A novel is only as good as the probability of the story actually happening, and this movies series tries somewhat painstakingly to give that appearance.Watching a movie twice is usually not something I do since it bores me the second time around and increases the boredom level with each repetition. Real stories are the exception since there are always details and nuances about facts in the story I like to see captured and the first go-around doesn't always give me a chance to capture those details. This movie is so far the only exception to this. I believe I have watched it a total of five times thus far without it wearing thin on me. In fact I will certainly watch it at least a few more times.Incidentally this is the only movie I actually ever purchased. I give it high marks and anticipate the release of the next Bourne movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne Redemption,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is perhaps the best spy thriller in the past few years. Matt Damon as ""dormant"" CIA assassin, Jason Bourne, is the tormented hero forced back into the spy game when the stakes become personal. Director Paul Greengrass provides expert pace, intrigue, and intelligence to the movie. Although his visual style of quick cuts, particularly in action sequences is bewildering. More on that later. Matt Damon is a movie star. As Jason Bourne he brings tremendous intensity balanced with the disturbing calm of master assassin. Along with Greengrass, acknowledge the Tony Gilroy screenplay based on the novel by Robert Ludlum. ""Supremacy"" also has an excellent cast including the very strong and smart Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, CIA operations director, the subdued evil of Brian Cox as Ward Abbott (Landy's predecessor), and the solid Julia Stiles returning as Nicky, the voice of conscience.""Supremacy"" has an edge-- it is uncompromising. Jason Bourne wants to find some measure of peace in self-imposed exile in a remote town in India with the love of his life, Marie (the beautiful Franka Potente). However, he is haunted by patch memories of past missions. He was a programmed killer, and some of his targets were not necessarily the ""bad guys"". Greengrass and Gilroy unravel the story where their hero takes responsibility for both his actions and the aftermath, and accepts that he will not be forgiven.The story is rather intricate, and my mind is rather simple. Consequently, this does not give anything away. Fortunately, the plotting is straight forward. So here goes. An assignment to recover CIA files under the watch of Landy (Allen) goes amok, and agents are murdered. This debacle is framed on Bourne, who is residing in the Indian town. To complete the conspiracy, a former KGB operative (the dark and charismatic Karl Urban) is sent to kill Bourne (Damon). He fails; however, it results in a personal tragedy for Bourne. Thus, Bourne is forced back into the game seeking retribution. This is a welcome twist from ""The Bourne Identity"": Jason Bourne is now choosing his targets. He tells Landy, ""I will bring this war to your doorstep..."" Much of the satisfaction in watching ""Supremacy"" is that his adversaries underestimate Bourne's prowess, and think they are ""badder"" than he is. They are educated accordingly. In this way Joan Allen is effective as Pam Landy, who grows to respect Jason Bourne as the best. Period. Acknowledge Matt Damon. His Bourne is a tortured, explosive, smart, and totally empathetic hero. Damon has a powerful and quiet presence. He got in great shape and conditioning to play the role. His martial arts fighting sequences are excellent... when you can see them. This is one of things that could have been better in the movie. Greengrass's quick cut, music video style editing does not do justice to the fight scenes. The choreography looks sharp, but one can't really tell. This is really a personal bias. As a martial artist, I was interested in seeing the details of the cool knife fight sequence. Regardless, one can tell that Damon trained very hard for the fight sequences. Greengrass's style did however, make the final car chase scene the most captivating in recent movie memory. It is amazing.""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an intense, uncompromising spy thriller with strong performances. Matt Damon is awesome as Jason Bourne.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Solid suspense film,"A sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"" and also based on the stories by Robert Ludlum , this film brings back Matt Damon as the former CIA assasin with only vague memories of his past. In this effort, he returns from seclusion after he is framed for the murder of some government agents. The film is not quite as good as the first, lacking the originality of the original as well as the mystery elements.. However Damon remains quite good in this role and gets some able supporting work from Brian Cox and Joan Allen as competing government agents.

"Even after the events of Bourne Identity, there are still people out to get Bourne and it is up o Bourne to find out who they are before it is too late.","What made this movie brilliant is its compelling storyline and ridiculously tense action sequences that I really come to love. I've never read the original books by Robert Ludlum, but I heard people complaining that the movie is nowhere close to the books as it should be, but I think this is what an adaptation should be. The movie doesn't necessary have to follow closely to the books. It's hard to compress a several hundreds page book into a 2 hour and half movie or a 120 page script. Also, people may notice that the shaky camera technique is introduced to the movie, while the first movie, The Bourne Identity has static camera shots, and many people I have talked to say they didn't like the transformation. I don't seriously mind the shaky camera, but I rather welcome it. It helps that sense of realism in the movie. The Bourne Supremacy has some of the best foot and car chase scenes, and the soundtrack, composed by John Powell, goes really well with them. Matt Damon and Julia Stiles were also great in their roles. Matt Damon plays his role perfectly throughout the movie and Stiles really shine in one particular scene in the movie.

"Almost, but not quite....","I found myself really wanting to like this film - the first in the series ""The Bourne Identity"" was a fantastic effort, an 'intellectual' spy thriller. I also enjoyed the series of books which I read quite some time ago, so I am an established Bourne fan in either format and did come in with quite high expectations.The second installment in the Bourne series retains all of the core actors from the original which is usually a promising sign. Mat Damon is once again extremely effective in his role as the amnesia suffering, guilt wracked, reluctant super spy. My favourite scene from the movie is one he shares with Julia Stiles with Damon emanating malevolence throughout. His characters coldness is highlighted by repeated close ups of cold, threatening, ice blue eyes. Stiles also puts in an exceptional performance and I am looking forward to seeing more of that caliber from her- if only she could learn to choose better roles - not evidenced in her previous release ""The Prince and Me"".The supporting cast are also good - Brian Cox has made a living out of playing the older, wise CIA chief for a while now and is always enjoyable. Joan Allen as the agent in charge is strong and almost believable as a tough agent with a heart of gold. Franka Potente seemed a little lost in this film although I do believe that her part was tragically small, she normally has immense presence on screen.The film did start to lose me a little quite early though, with some major flaws in the internal logic of the plot. These not so little errors continued through the film and helped to take the edge off the film. One of the engrossing things about ""The Bourne Identity"" was its realism, something long missing from this genre. The Behaviour of Bourne in the first car crash of the movie (and there are a lot) was the first time that I groaned out loud. Why did he give up like that? Isn't he a driven man who will stop at nothing, especially where Marie is involved?Once the plot had started to unravel a little, I found myself nitpicking. Like the three or four agents watching cameras in all exit points in Berlin.Seriously, how many people exit Berlin every day?. Then they spotted their target, because the cloak he was wearing was dark. Again, seriously?? Not to mention the fact that the screen was in black and white! I know that these are small points, but the plot was riddled with them and it denigrated the authenticity of the entire film.The other major issue of the film which is generating a lot of criticism (and rightly so) is the camera work. A friend described it as ""NYPD Blue Syndrome"" where the hand held camera work is shaky to invoke frenetic activity. Unfortunately it is out of control here, creating nothing but confusion and motion sickness. I understand what the Director Paul Greengrass was trying to portray - throughout the novels Bourne is affected by moving lights such as driving at night but is simply too much here. Some of the action scenes are ruined by the camera work and I found myself giving up on trying to follow and resorted to simply waiting till they finished to see what happened.All that being said, I did enjoy this film. The franchise is not completely ruined (Cough *Matrix* cough) and overall it wasn't a complete waste, I just felt a little let down by the whole experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I've seen a number of films with the green/grain/'ekta'-chrome push. This film takes it to extreme. Shadows around the eyes, many areas are just plain green. I have a huge HD screen, and expected the upverted video to match a well done DVD, but that quality just wasn't there. Watches like VHS on a broken SD TV.The action scenes are very good - what distracts from them are the parts that include 1/4 second scene cuts, intentional camera shake - the scenes are already exciting, not being able to focus on anything in particular is just distracting. Extending the scenes 2+ minutes longer than needed is also hurts the film. I feel like a viewer on 10 grams of caffeine after a wild night out at the bars. Nauseous, nervous and ready to spit up - and not from excitement.The storyline is actually very good, except for some minor line flubs, the acting is consistent and good. The knife vs. rolled up paper fight scene is very well done. The last car chase - just awful.The Green push.. what's up with that?Very good film, with a few serious production flaws. Coulda been a 9 1/2. I'd buy a re-release w/o the production issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Martial Arts and Bourne,"As a martial arts instructor I can rate this film 10/10. The reason is simple. It is not fighting with everybody and killing them hand to hand combat. The way that makes one as a warrior is seeing the future. Doing things considering future.The best war is the one that is won without it ever happens. Another good point is the character here cannot escape this destiny.The train scene and a lot of other scenes not only real from martial arts perspective as design but also considering the qualities of ""clever"" warrior. Unlike other films, the agent in this film is really capable of the format of ""thinking"".The only scene that made me think about is the ""girl"" scene that whether Bourne has to give the gun to girl or not.The great series. Great role play as well. Waiting for the ""Ultimatum"".",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Matt Damon in snow shoes,"The Bourne series has certainly surprised me in how good it can really be. Based upon a fictional book series, Bourne is pretty much your super-spy without the endless relationships with women like James Bond. And in a strange yet exceptional way, I like that.Bourne is the name he is given and his missions were fore a black government program. But when that all shuts down, they try to kill him and frame him for certain murders. And when a certain person in his life is killed because of it, Bourne takes exception to it all.There are some nice car chases and shootouts in the movie. Plus some of the kills were just nice. While it isn't ""Hitman"" or ""Shooter"" in that regard, it does a good enough job.Overall, nicely done. I actually want to see more now to see if they get better. ""B""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Notthing like the real ""The Bourne Supremacy""","If you liked the books, then I beg you not to waste any money to watch this film. The film's plot (both this and the previous) has almost nothing in common with the books. I would estimate perhaps the take one idea from the book - thats about it - the name of the central character.And yes the books are way better than the hashed up contrived plots used in the films. Basically, the producers made the usual boring car chase, shooting, etc plot and then used the ""Bourne..."" titles to sell the films. Without that no one would have bothered to watch them.I hate it when producers do this. I mean what gives them the right to mess around with the books. Of course films have to be different - different media and time constraints. But in this case... I mean what were they thinking.The films are crap. Don't waste money at the theater, at the DVD store, on cable. Wait till it gets to network - and even than my time is worth more than wasting it watching this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne supremacy,"the Bourne supremacy features a British director who portraits part II of the saga in a new compelling fresh light. as of now we are completely on a different storyline from the Robert Lodlum's novel, Conklin and Marie are dead and no longer the main characters of the trilogy after Bourne (as they are in the book), so readers should not expect to see their paperback on screen. as we cannot expect to visualise lodlum's precise and extensive description of characters, we instead see a junk of action expressed with majestic cutting and very tense, fast paced, almost disturbing camera work. if it's true that the cinematography is untidy and wobbly, then is also true that exactly that is what make the final car chase one of the most appealing in today's cinema history and Greengrass is master in making it work. Being a fan of the novel I can only be disappointed by the lack of human contact with the character of Jason Bourne as on paper we learn a lot about him and what he's going through, but this is an action movie and the car chase and the fight scenes alone are worth the miss. The music score her does a lot of work in adding drama in Jason's search of his own self. I believe the film has just won this year's Empire award for best film and deservedly so may I add.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Review - The Bourne Supremacy,"The film is a satisfying sequel to The Bourne Identity as far as storytelling goes. Unlike the James Bond and the Mission Impossible franchises, The Bourne films are connected by their intrigue, Tony Gilroy did a good job at connecting the dots.The Bourne Supremacy's biggest flaw comes from the switch of the director. Where Doug Liman was bad to film action Paul Greengrass is awful. As far as I'm concerned, the action scenes are awfully filmed. It is a pity considering that there are some talents in the choreography department.The last problem is Brian Cox. His character, Ward Abbot, doesn't have the same complexity that Conklin had with Bourne. Thus, as the main villain, he is extremely disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Who needs tripods, anyway?","""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a worthy follow up to ""The Bourne Identity"". But, unlike ""Identity"", this installment is not a classic.""Supremacy"" is by no means a bad film. Oh contraire. It is finely crafted, with excellent action scenes, juxtaposed with moments of tenderness.What keeps this film from attaining the magnificence of it's predecessor are a number of elements:-The middle child syndrome. This is typical of any second film in a trilogy, where it essentially ends in the same place it started.-But mostly, it's the overdone steadycam (or shakeycam) technique that the director, Paul Greengrass, seems to love so much. It's fine to convey a sense of realism and immediacy, but when the camera moves so much that the viewer can't even keep track of the action, that's a problem. I actually had to look away at several points to avoid a migraine. Sometimes, Paul, you need to whip out the good old tripod and slap the camera on there.-Lastly, this film just doesn't seem to have the same heart that ""Identity"" had. Perhaps that stems from Franke Potente's severely diminished role here.Despite these shortcomings, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a very good action film, and it does well to link the the first (""Identity"") and last (""The Bourne Ultimatum"") films of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Compelling story, decent performances in this deju vu thriller","Matt Damon does a credible job with this Ludlum tale. The story works, is compelling, and lives up to the novel to the extent that a movie should. The movie works, but could have been so much better if the director had not overdone the rapid-fire flashback fragments, which put an annoying staccato into the film. For some viewers, this staccato will become a major distraction and annoyance.The chase scene is thrilling, well done for the most part, but goes on far too long and loses some validity as a result.Stay tuned for yet another, for there is still a villain outstanding on the Russian side, which will provide a sedgway for yet another offering.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent,"The Bourne Supremacy was, in my opinion more or less better than the first. I liked the story line and the action. The acting was also pretty good, although if you talk to my brother I don't ever comment on movies that well, so you might not want to listen to this. Unfortunately the camera man wasn't that good. He couldn't keep the camera still enough to figure out what's going on. Also in the fight scene with the guy he handcuff, he was so close that you couldn't tell whose arm was whose and who was getting shanked and who wasn't. I would recommend it. It is a good movie to see if you have seen the first one. And since I have to fill this up with 10 lines and don't want to spoil it I am just going to put this: Blah.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Please sir, can I have some more?","Okay, so lets get the criticisms out of the way first; the acting's a little wooden and the director does an annoyingly successful job of trying to shake the camera around as much as possible when there's anything remotely acion based.There, that's it, I'm done!I came out of the cinema and my friend turned around to me and asked what I thought and, having just recovered from the slight nausea of the aforementioned shaky-cam, I laid out those two criticism. His reaction? ""Man, if they were the worst you could say about this film then you must have really liked it.""Then it dawned on me and slowly the smile spread across my face and as I hit the bottom step of the exit to the cinema I turned to my fiancée and beamed ""I REALLY like that film!!""The first film impressed me because for every scene there was a twist in my opinion, every scene ended differently to how you thought it might. Okay sure, the overall plot was a little predictable (not meant harshly) but every individual scene impressed until the sum of the scenes became more than the sum of the film - does that make any sense to anyone else?I think it's the same with the sequel, each scene is well crafted and impresses over and over again. We are thrown into the action from the start and the plot is thrown in as and when it's required. They have decided to reinvent the wheel with this one, they stuck to a winning formula and I for one cannot wait for part 3 which must inevitably happen.I just hope that the director doesn't attempt to film the action scenes by encouraging a troop of gibbons to throw a camera around as much as possible. It just made me think that the choreography isn't up to much and he was trying to hide it BUT I really don't think that that was the case. I would just part with: let us SEE what's going on next time!Overall, not bad at all!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Big production with no place to go,"I saw Bourne Identity and was impressed with its originality and well thought out story line that kept us interested in more than just its action scenes. Unlike the original, the sequel has no mystery to it and originality was lacking, covered up with too many chase scenes done by a what felt like a nervous cameraman. The film missed on many fronts. There was no character building in this movie, just bursts of too many borrowed and typical action scenes and several characters with very little to do.The plot was weak, riding on the momentum and success of the original film. It's about a corrupt CIA officer working with the Russian mob to control the Russian oil business. So, in order for the bad guys to get away with their scheme, they implicated Bourne (retired in India) for the robbery and killing of CIA agents and now they wanted to kill him to cover up their plot. How original! It's a major detour from the original story about a highly trained killer who, while in search of his own identity, encountered many interesting and character building events/exchanges. The sequel was filled with long, unnecessary, overdone and boring chase scenes with highly predictable twists and turns. It was like watching the Terminator, Robocop and James Bond put together in a marketing ploy to attract/con as many viewers as possible and charge them up with cheap thrills. The movie is nothing more than a long game of cat and mouse with very predictable results. Jason Bourne's character was filled with contradictions with no real mystery to it or interesting developments. He kept getting himself into tricky situations and, as expected, kept outmaneuvering everyone else in every country. The character never really evolved and never captured our interest. It just impressed us with its over done and old action skills. I never felt close to it, just expected it to perform. It was like watching a skilled athlete performing in a game, impressing us only with his athletic skills.The chase scenes were too many, too long and too unnecessary. The photography was shaky with too many close-ups, bumps and deadly collisions, perfect for headache buildup. It's like someone was trying to distract us from realizing that this movie's plot was weak. They figured if we walked out it with a good headache, we may not be able think about it artistically.The acting was weak and undisciplined with over-dramatization of the dialogs and exchanges. Some characters (like the therapist) were weak and didn't fit well in the plot. I've always liked Mat Damon's acting, but he should've passed on this one. Although he did a good job portraying Bourne's character, Bourne's character did a poor job living up to his skills. The ending was typical of a feel good movie where all is well that ends well. The bad guys die in a disgusting way and the good guys/gals prevail and go on to manipulate our emotions with a mooshy ending, setting up the stage for another sequel.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Mainstream Art House Film,"The visual style of this film is similar to 21 Grams.  It uses a lot of hand held camera and grainy film.

My impression of the new movie,"Agreeing with a reviewer of the new Bourne movie, I think Doug Liman should have discouraged the new director from using the hand-held camera so much during the filming of the first half of the movie. Instead of infusing ""energy"" into the scenes, it just looked choppy and confusing. I have a sensitivity to watching jerky motion; for example, I can't watch the beginning of Private Ryan because it makes me feel sick. (Luckily, for me, the jerky motion wasn't used beyond the beginning sequence in Private Ryan.)While I understand the theory behind using the hand-held camera, it almost ruined the movie for me. However, with that said...the camera work in the car chase was masterful. Although the reviewer thought that this would be the last movie, I don't agree. The character is very powerful and the ending makes me think there might be at least one more...",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Something's missing, but it's well plotted and is one of the few films that makes shaky cam art","I was not impressed with The Bourne Identity. It's an emotionless and unfun movie with action sequences that inexplicably stop trying half way through. Interestingly, the film is set 2 years afterwards, with Bourne pursuing the people who framed him for a CIA operation gone wrong and it was almost 2 years before I could be bothered to watch the second one, so it's close to real time for me. The second film is a huge improvement, although still weak compared to Die Hard, James Bond and various other action films. What sets it apart is Paul Greengrass who may be the only director who truly turns hand-held cameras into an art form, and the film actually uses shaky cam properly. The influence of the Bourne films is unfortunate, as most action films don't necessarily know how to handle shaky filming and a darker tone, and sadly James Bond has suffered from the Bourne effect as well. This knows how to handle its elements and was the Bourne film I enjoyed the most.The plot is more interesting than normal with its themes of conspiracy and memory loss, while the set pieces seem fairly varied although there are too many chase sequences. The script is decent and in general it is a compelling action thriller with a pleasing sense of intensity and there is some sort of emotional centre in there as well. What lets it down? What lets it down is officially the worst action hero ever committed to film, who barely changes his facial expression once and has absolutely no personality. Although there's some emotion, the film can go on and it does occasionally feel like a compilation of chase sequences. I did enjoy it though and it's quite entertaining, and it's got punch for sure. I feel action films need to have humour usually to balance their ludicrousness and implausibility. The Bourne Supremacy, while not a great or especially memorable film and nowhere close to Captain Phillips or United 93, is a superior sequel and a diverting explosion of gritty, hand-held, intense blockbuster fun.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Follow Up To Bourne Identity: Superb Act II,"The Bourne Supremacy keeps the pace going with the first film, The Bourne Identity. We learn just a little bit more about Bourne this time around it and leaves you wanting more. I look forward to the series' next offering, The Bourne Ultimatum which is due out in two weeks from this posting.In Supremacy, Bourne is framed as a patsy for money laundering crimes involving the ex-Treadstone boss played brilliantly by Brian Cox. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, who is also superb) heads a task force for the CIA to bring Bourne to justice, but ends up discovering the truth about Cox and his partners in crime through Bourne's help.Matt Damon is just as good in this film as Jason Bourne as he was in Identity. Supremacy does a great job keeping the same gripping story and mood without copying the first film. This and Identity are two of the best films in the spy genre. Give this series a look.

Bleek but somewhat interesting,"It's nice to see director Greengrass develop something interesting in this pretty cliché plot about the former agent with amnesia. When the first film was merely your standard action-flick this sequel reaches a little higher on the coolness-scale. Matt Damon has certainly grown into the role as Jason Bourne and we se him with a little more angst than in the first film. As ""Supremacy"" is put mostly in Berlin and Moscow it gives the film a touch of realism, acting out the action-scenes in a gloomy, dirty and other-than-the-streets-of-LA setting. However, once again the story is quite bleek and the film mostly concentrates on Bournes inner deamons and his struggle to remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jason must return to clear the mess.This is the return of a complicated plot. It's tough to follow watching the first time around. What the audience gets is director Paul Greengrass' expert grasp on action, and Jason Bourne's robotic efficiency. What's missing is the warmth of a love story with Marie.

Poor camera work,"While I found the plot and story line to be very well written, the camera work was terrible. Very rapid, jerky panning and over use of zoom lenses during the action scenes.

The scenes mentioned are so jerky that it made watching the movie almost nauseating.For the life of me, I cannot understand why the practice of showing non-supported video that appears to be taking by a 5 year old (which seemed to be initiated on NYPD Blue), has continued. If you want to watch a movie that may possibly make you nauseous or at the least, give you a headache due to the camera sequences mentioned above, then by all means, this is your movie.

Good movie hurt by camera use and editing,"The story is tight, the action almost non-stop and the acting adequate to the job.

First rate thriller,"I remember seeing the Bourne Identity at the movies, thrillingly shocked at the action scenes, for example an assassin swinging through a window, a car being driven down a flight of stairs. I was also impressed with Damon's moves--lightning fast chops and kicks that barely registered on the screen. I recommended this movie to many others as not your typical action movie.For some reason I put off watching the Bourne Supremacy until this weekend on video. I can't explain the reluctance to view it until now---perhaps I didn't believe a sequel could be just as good. Thank goodness I finally picked it up: the movie is not ""just as good,"" it is superior. I have watched it three times now.First of all, the score is really superior and acts excruciating tension to the movie, particularly the chase sequence when Jason Bourne is finally forced to run on foot to elude capture. That chase sequence is the centerpiece of the movie and it is perfectly rendered, beginning with the telephone ring that awakens Jason from his recovered memory and into flight. The score is accompanied by a cacophony of yelling by the German police, which one could liken to dogs barking as the fox is hunted down. Just perfect. His flight through the brilliantly photographed Berlin streets and rooftops, profiled in long shots wearing black reminds you of Jack the Ripper flying through gas lit London. Damon gives an astounding performance as someone who doesn't have to ponder escape plans--he was so well-trained that his body simply does what it needs to do when it needs to do it.We have fewer and fewer good films these days, so I'm delighted when I can experience a well-crafted adult movie. I'm actually sorry that I can't re-experience the film for the first time--the adrenalin jolt forced me to my feet! Obviously you can tell I liked this movie and I look forward to another episode. I've enjoyed the way Bourne's character has been built--his reliance on maps and schedules, for example--makes you chuckle when he pulls a map out and hastily scans it for directions.Brilliant movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"almost as good as the first one, but with a better development of the character of Jason Bourne","""The Bourne Supremacy"" is in a lot of regards, very much like the first film ""The Bourne Identity"". It is continuing where the first film left off, where Jason Bourne asked a lot of questions, had some of them answered, and most of them unanswered and he is still pursuing those answers, but all the time, just wishing that this whole thing would just stop so that he could live out his life in peace. Now that he's lost his memory of his days as an assassin, he just wants to be able to blend into the crowd and be left alone. But his enemies, who he still isn't sure why they are hunting him, don't agree and will not allow him to have what he wants. Now Bourne has new enemies, more tasks, and more questions that he wants answered.The film does start off on a bit of a flawed level and kind of rushes right through, but once that's over, then it becomes just like the first one, with thrilling and clever action sequences, good acting, and an overall compelling storyline that keeps you glued to the seat until the end. Matt Damon is still the ultimate actor when it comes to playing a spy like Jason Bourne. When he is walking around quickly, making quick and snap judgment decisions that ultimately prove to be to his advantage, it almost seems like we are in the scene with him. The same repetitive music score in the background enhances the scenes as he struggles to escape with his life and still find the answers he's looking for.The screenplay for ""Supremacy"" was slightly better than the one for ""Identity"". Here, Bourne has become more intelligent and thus, has more clever lines to say. The same goes for the other characters who still retain and intelligent style. These people, both Bourne and his enemies, are professionals who never make mistakes or bad calls. They are trained to think quickly and be right the first time. So it's not an impression that Bourne's being hunted by a group inferior to him, which I find works out extremely well. The assassins he must dodge this time, and the organizations he must interrogate with, are twice as great as the ones he encountered in the first film, and overall gives the impression that Bourne's getting smarter, and as he gets smarter, so do his enemies.Like ""The Bourne Identity"" and the third installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", the ""Bourne Supremacy"" is another one of the modern quintessential action movies that stands out above the others with its intelligence, cleverness, and lack of symbolism that just makes it a powerful and extremely fun action movie to keep us motivated and asking for more. The main reason for this is that it doesn't end with all questions asked during the running time being answered. It doesn't make it end on a confusing or incomplete level, but just enough to make us dying for the next installment, to see who and what Bourne will encounter next.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bourne Disappointment,"The Bourne Supremacy suffers from too much preoccupation with being ""stylish"" to be entertaining. Too many attempts to be ""cool"" kept pulling me away from the story and back to reality, where I had to face the sorry fact that I was watching a bad movie.You'd think by now Hollywood would figure out that the ""shaky camera"" bit is old, and that it was a dumb idea to begin with. Director Paul Greengrass explains in the features that the shaky camera was intended to evoke a ""visceral"" response from the viewer. But then again he'd have to say *something* to explain how such an expensive film could look so awful. I suppose the poor lighting had some artistic purpose also. Maybe I'm just not cool enough, but I would have preferred to be able to see what was going on instead. Most silent films had better lighting than this one.The technology gimmicks in the film were embarrassing to watch: computers that instantly call up every piece of information that exists in the world (at high resolution), two or three CIA voyeurs who can identify Jason Bourne on security cameras out of 200 million Europeans passing by, the rapid-fire typing of a court stenographer in the soundtrack every time someone is sitting at a computer. Hey Greengrass: if you want ""visceral"" reality, why don't you show the CIA sitting around watching the Windows hourglass on their monitors, or rebooting their computers every five minutes? The portrayal of high technology in this film wasn't interesting or entertaining at all. It was just plain silly.As near as I could tell there was a good car chase going on somewhere in the background while the camera was busy shaking and spinning around, not focusing on anything in particular. The only thing I recall about it was a motorcycle sliding rather gently beneath a car, but I'm not sure whether this had anything to do with Bourne, the story, or anything else. The editing was that bad (or was it ""visceral""?).The good news is Matt Damon and Julia Stiles' performances--especially when Stile's character fears for her life. Unfortunately, their efforts were wasted on this film due to the shaky-cam, bad lighting, and poor editing. Joan Allen's character was a Royal b*tch, so if you like that kind of thing, there you go. Otherwise, she'll probably just p*ss you off. And don't expect a whole lot of action in this film. There's a lot of *movement* due to the shaky camera, but very little action for an action film. And Damon himself has about as many action scenes as Walter Matthou did in Grumpy Old Men, unless you consider walking down the street quickly to be an action sequence.Finally, each DVD special feature ends with a brief advertisement for... the DVD you are already watching. Are the filmmaker's really that sloppy, or was this too meant to evoke some kind of ""visceral"" reaction? If so, they succeeded, because I feel sick after watching this film. It is nowhere near as good as the Bourne Identity.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Power of Observation keeps Jason Bourne ahead of his predators...,"The Bourne Identity & The Bourne Supremacy As a strategy consultant, & whenever I go to the movies (or watch movies at home), I often take the opportunity to seek out possibilities of using them to teach life (survival) skills to participants in my seminars & workshops.The two Bourne movies, namely Bourne Identity & Bourne Supremacy, are two great examples.Both movies are loosely based on Robert Ludlum's work, which included The Rheinmann Exchange, The Osterman Weekend & the Holcroft Covenant. They have also been made into great movies.In the first movie, with the opening scene: An unconscious young man is pulled out off the Mediterranean coast by a fishing boat one stormy night. Thinking that the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back & a microchip in his hip. The chip reveals a Swiss bank account. But our wet hero isn't dead but realises that he has amnesia. He then rushes to Zurich. In the bank vault, he discovers his name, Jason Bourne (played by Mark Damon). In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a large chunk of cash. In the US Embassy, he bumps into Marie (played by Franka Potente), along with the fact that someone wants to kill him. Armed with a bag of money and superb martial arts skills, & with Marie by his side, he scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life...& finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots (one assassin was played by Clive Owen, as 'The Professor') masterminded by rouge elements of the CIA.In the second movie, with the opening scene, continuing from the first movie: Jason Bourne is recovering in Goa, India with Marie. He spots a mysterious dark-glassed man with the wrong clothes while jogging. He escapes with Marie but she is shot in the ensuing chase. The next scene shows CIA operatives under deputy director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) conducting a sting operation to fish out a mole in CIA but something goes wrong. Her subsequent investigation leads to the highly-classified Treadstone project, which apparently involves Jason Bourne. She even finds evidence that Bourne is behind what happened to her botched operation. So Bourne sets out to clear his name. The remaining part of the movie shows Bourne outsmarting CIA operatives - & the assassin (played menacingly by Karl Urban as Kirill) - & tracking down the rogue elements in the CIA with shady connections to the Russian mob, who have jointly framed him in the first place.In the two movies, Jason Bourne demonstrates his uncanny ability to observe & pay attention to what's around him - note: notice the exceptions in the details of the environment - which allows him to constantly stay ahead of his predators & at the same time, stay agile (mentally & physically) to anticipate dangers & get out of precarious situations.For example...remember the scene in the second movie...after he had jogged at the beach, he observed a dark-glassed man whose clothing & behaviour somehow did not match the environment...His ability to stay calm, size up dangerous situations & come up with super-quick, innovative solutions to escape from capture is well demonstrated in both movies.For example...remember the scene in the first movie, where he jumped down several storeys with a dead body as cushion while blasting his gun at his assassins running up the staircase...the scene in the second movie, where he improvised a weapon out of rolled newspapers & an explosive escape using a magazine stuffed into a burning toaster in a quickly engineered gas-filled room...Wow! that was great! Naturally, I am also fascinated by the many unique fighting sequences (particularly the one within a tight environment in the second movie), car chases, cat & mouse games, etc. in both movies.Additionally, what I like about both movies is the total absence of super-duper gadgets commonly found in such spy-thriller movies. Jason Bourne used only his sheer human ingenuity & creativity to outsmart his enemies.To end my review, I must add that I have enjoyed watching both movies, experientially as well as educationally.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb action packed twist-n-turn realistic assassin movie,I really enjoyed this sequel as equal in enjoyment from the B.Identity The familiar chilling music of suspicion and paranoia is a welcome return to sustain the original film's format. The action scenes are packed with blurry rapid dramatic directing. The plot twists with shocks and at high pace - the interrogation moment is a class example of suspense and thrills - you know Bourne is gonna do something....but what? The mind tries to predict his movements - poor Bourne! He's so deadly fast and intelligent and more importantly believable (I'm glad he actually sustains injuries making the viewers promote the fact of his mortality - supremacy leads a false title sense of immortality).Overall: a truly great follow up from the Identity - hope they film the trilogy!,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Get Bourne Again!,"The Bourne Supremacy is that rare sequel that more than holds its own to the original, as well as a being a standout film in an already over-saturated summer season. Matt Damon once again turns in a stellar performance as Jason Bourne, who struggles daily with the memories of his time as an ex-CIA trained assassin. After living a free life for the last 2 years, he is set up to take the fall for 2 agents' deaths in Berlin. So once again it's up to he and Marie to stay one step ahead of them. This movie features 2 well put together car chase scenes and the action is breath-taking. I especially liked the expanded role of Brian Cox's character. He was convincing and chilling in his scenes and Joan Allen is a fresh face following in the footsteps of Chris Cooper in The Bourne Identity. The fact that it was raining tonight helped set the mood for me as I got in the theater. I'm not going to get into whether I think it was better or worse than the first one. I'm just going to say if you liked The Bourne Identity at all then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you don't then Bourne will bring this fight to your doorstep..lol",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an action packed interesting sequel,"Jason Bourne (Damon) is still on the run and when he is framed, he is once again looking for answers to his past.Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) reprises his role as the man suffering from amnesia in this action packed thriller which delivers more action than its predecessor, which sadly doesn't have the consistent silent sophistication the previous instalment delivered so well.Starting with a flashback, viewers are thrust right back into Bourne's life, giving the viewer a chance to work out for themselves what Bourne's previous life entailed.What follows is a passionate turn of events and a soft tear jerking unpredictable scene. This event, though only ten or twenty minutes in, turns the plot around and delivers a gritty and dark blow to the central character.From there we see Bourne trying to find out why the CIA is hunting him down. Bourne travels to Goa, Berlin, Moscow and America to find answers. Having the film set in different locations gives the narrative a delicious spin and an incentive to explore. The filming in these different locations is excellent, and there is a beautiful behind the scenes feature on the DVD which is definitely worth viewing.Paul Greengrass takes over to direct this crime thriller and delivers an action styled realistic impact on the narrative. The hand-held camera style can be off putting and the action sequences can feel too shaky for the scene's own good. However when following Bourne on foot and doing the slow tense scenes in the offices and cafes, Greengrass achieves a hard sentimental feeling.Filled with cars, boats and guns, this description may seem like a review for Bond. This second instalment to the series feels a lot like a 007 flick with its heavy use of action. Unlike Bond, the action sequences in these films are far more realistic and therefore easier for its viewers to digest and appreciate.Bourne is also a lot more open in this film but he still has that soft silence that was blissful viewing in the first film.Like Identity, Supremacy has a wonderful soundtrack, which plays softly in the background giving the film an intensely blissful vibe.This is the least accomplished of the series as the intensity doesn't live up to Identity or Ultimatum and the direction is frequently inconsistent. However it is still exciting with its complex and sombre narrative and wonderful central protagonist.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Six Flags over Bourne,"I loved the plot and script of this movie. But the direction was absolutely horrible. Paul Grengrass, the director, had a vision that did not fit with this movie.It feel like riding a wooden roller coaster. There were two many out of focus hand held shots. I think that this absolutely tainted the purity of this film.At times you would almost want to leave and go and watch something else, because the direction is so bad.  At key moments in the movie where the director could have chosen to use all of these fast cuts, jerky, out of focus shots. He didn't. Where like in more intimate moments he completely ruined them with his idea of direction.OKAY NOW THAT I HAVE FINISHED BAD MOUTHING THE DIRECTORThis movie is awesome. If you are familiar with the books or with the ""The Bourne Idenity"" you will enjoy this movie. The character of Bourne was played superbly by Matt Damon. This movie shows that even a ruthless killer has a heart.On the scale of 1-10. I have mixed reviews Acting 9 Writing 9 Direction 2 Which gives  the movie a 6 but you understand my logic now.Could have been a 9 all the way around minus about 100 hand held shaky shots.It was as if Muhammed Ali filmed this movie with a Handy Cam.

A high tension and fast-energy Bourne sequel!,"This is a high tension and fast-energy sequel to the action thriller, The Bourne Identity. Matt Damon returns as amnesia-plagued Jason Bourne, who finds himself running from assassins again after it was alleged he was involved in a CIA operation to purchase classified Russian documents that went awry. Bourne is forced to utilize his trained knowledge and actions skills to survive while attempting to regain his past memories.The film picks up steam almost immediately where Jason Bourne is still being haunted by his unknown past, followed by the introduction of CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy, who is leading the investigation into classified Russian documents and the whereabouts of Bourne. What follows is one suspenseful scene after the other, from Jason alluding assassins to him playing hide-and-seek with the CIA. Much intrigue is generated as the secrets of the CIA operation begin to unravel and Jason gaining more steam in unlocking his memory, creating a mind-numbing sense of mystery.The action scenes, from the fights to the intense car chases, are a finger-biting experience. The acting is well done; Matt Damon continues to be great as Jason Bourne - quick and dramatic, yet serious and witty. I also especially liked the acting performance of Joan Allen; she gave a commanding performance as Pamela Landy, committed to solving the investigation but sympathetic to Jason's dilemma. In addition, the visual and special effects were believable and the music score was riveting.Overall, this movie is just as great as its prequel; it has its unpredictable elements and edge-of-your-seat excitement.Grade A",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Supremacy... on identity,"Incredible how this second opus of the Borne trilogy is superior to the first one. Changing the director was the right choice. Paul Greengrass has done a very efficient movie, and his directing is sharped and well done.No more bad acceleration effect like in ""The Bourne Identity""; instead a nervous camera, an amazing editing with a lot of ""jump cuts"" and ellipses, a beautiful work on sound. Matt Damon seems much more in his character, and the character of Pamela Landy is very convincingly played by Joan Allen.The car scene, at the end, is one of the most impressive car chase I ever saw. Perfect car movements, perfect cut between shots, the scene in the tunnel... Woh, it's really impressive.If the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" has the quality of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" regarding ""The Bourne Identity""... I cannot imagine how great it will be.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film which perfectly updates Robert Ludlum's great trilogy,"This is a great film, and slightly reminiscent of the very early James Bond movies - taut and dark and not dependent on loads of special effects. The Bourne Identity was perhaps a more embracing film, but this second of the trilogy led us down a darker path that was both chilling and unexpected. Jason Bourne, the hero of the piece, has gone from being the good guy of the first film, to the good guy with a very bad past in the second film. This was unexpected as most great heroes of a first film tend to remain exactly that. But because of that it makes the whole series stay very much alive and interesting, and very in-keeping with the books. Some of the non-stop use of hand-held camera was at times oppressive, but did little to dampen a great film. Already looking forward to The Bourne Ultimatum - the final outing of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
horrible directory given a good story,"The first half hour of the Bourne Supremacy is universally annoying. The unsteady camcorder, bland soundtrack, and long unedited scenes are frustrating as hell. In particular the shaking camera makes me wonder what the heck the director was thinking. I wanted to slap the director for wasting my time and patience and a perfectly good paperback book.The movie picks up a little momentum in the middle, and by the end it's more fun including one of the best car chases ever.

Not nearly as well-done as The Bourne Identity,"The Bourne Identity was a great, entertaining movie. On the other hand, The Bourne Supremacy was terrible. It was difficult to watch because of the constantly shifting and jerky photography. In the Bourne Identity, I felt like I knew Jason Bourne, and I felt empathy for his plight. His character emanated warmth and honesty, and I had a genuine feel for his situation. He was real. In the follow-up, the constantly rapid shifting of scenes, along with the high percentage of scenes that were too dark to see, and the jerky photography, made getting to feel the characters' plight impossible. I couldn't feel close to the characters because they didn't seem real to me. They were there one second and the next second they were gone. In a word, the movie was terrible. The direction was terrible. Don't waste your money.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Of course, you could also argue that I expected this film to be great, since I loved the first so much. In any case, this film is truly amazing, sticking with things that made the original so great, and yet continuing with the plot in a great way. I can't say too much more without spoiling it, so go watch the film if you haven't already.

An Interesting Continuation,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor (""The Bourne Identity"") left off with former CIA agent ""Jason Bourne"" (Matt Damon) still suffering from amnesia but managing to hide out in India with his German girlfriend ""Marie"" (Franka Potente). It's at the same time, however, that a clandestine meeting in Berlin ends in two murders and the immediate suspect for these killings is none other than: Jason Bourne. Not long afterward an attempt is made on Jason Bourne's life which results in tragic consequences all around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting continuation which had plenty of action and mystery to keeps things enjoyable. Unfortunately, there really wasn't much of anything new or original that hadn't already been addressed in the first movie so apparently to fill in some time the viewer is treated to extended car chase scenes that seem to go on forever. Additionally, the change of location from Berlin to Moscow seemed a bit too abrupt and could have been better handled. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, there was still several good aspects of this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Smart, taut writing clashes with incoherent fighting","I went to see The Bourne Supremacy with high expectations. 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" was one of the best action-spy-intrigue movies in years, and the critics were touting ""The Bourne Supremacy"" as a worthy sequel - one notch up from the original. Like another highly praised sequel (Spiderman 2), I would put it a notch down. In both cases, that's not exactly harsh criticism.What separated the ""The Bourne Identity"" from its well-worn genre was a combination of a complex and engaging story, taut writing, and most importantly, solid directing, particularly with regard to the combat scenes between Jason Bourne and his various antagonists. We were spared elaborate martial arts choreography plunging rhythmically in and out of slow motion. Instead, the fights were brutal and short: if Bourne's opponents were unsuspecting policemen, they were quickly dispatched; if they were fellow Treadstone operatives, then blows were exchanged with lightning-quick staccato. These were men trying to kill each other, and they fought with mechanical determination. But at least the camera staid still long enough for us to SEE what was going on.In ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" the complex and engaging story as well as the taut writing are both still in place. It is the action that disappoints. The new director, Paul Greengrass, is clearly going for a similar effect, but his method leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, he changes camera takes so fast that what you see is almost a series of still images. You have no real sense of the fight, and the familiar sound that accompanies body blows is timed so that it coincides with the shifting of the camera. It is a cheap way out: it only creates the feel of a fight without the substance. If you try to reconstruct it after you see it, all you will remember is that Bourne and whoever were fighting, instead of the fight itself. There is something to be said for quick and disorienting camera work that mimics quick and disorienting violence. But this effect is lost to incoherence in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" The movie's climactic car chase (which the New York Times reviewer called one of the three or four best ever filmed) suffers from the same problems. You constantly see the moment of collision between cars, and split-second shots of Bourne's feet on the gas/brake/clutch pedals, but you don't actually see a coherent chase. Not only that, in a movie where the violence itself tends toward realism (Bourne hurts his leg jumping from a height of about 20 feet, etc), the damage sustained by Bourne's car in the final chase would have demolished it two or three times over. Sure, there is such as thing as suspension of disbelief. But one of the main strengths of both ""Bourne"" movies is that they veer away from the excesses of action flicks in the last several years (think: Mission Impossible 2). Had the rest of the film consistently portrayed a world where people and objects endure an inflated amount of damage, then the final chase would have been unremarkable. As it is, it stands out, and not as the crowning finale. I would still recommend this movie over pretty much every action movie that has been released since ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002. But sadly, it falls noticeably short of its potential. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The most entertaining blockbuster of the year, so far","Intelligent action-thrillers are so infrequent these days that when a film like ""The Bourne Supremacy"" comes along, I savor the moment.Honestly, I don't know what critics who were confused by the plot of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" were braying about. If you pay attention - and this is a film that requires us to actually do that, oh the horror! - the plot is anything but confusing. Is it possible audiences have become so numbed by mindless summer actioners that when a film actually requires them to fit together pieces of the plot, many are promptly confused?I also expected to be seasick given the numerous complaints on this site and by critics about director Paul Greengrass' decision to shoot plenty of handheld scenes. Granted, some of the action's jerky, but I didn't find it distracting in the least. In fact, it only added to chaotic nature of Jason Bourne's life.He skillfully uses the handheld method during an absolutely sensational car chase. It's not conventionally shot, that's for sure, and proves to be a refreshing - pardon the pun - change of pace. We don't get the customary shots of each driver behind the wheel, then the steering wheels, then the long-shot down the tunnel, then the points-of-view of each driver, then the spinning car wheels, then back to the close-up of the driver. There was nothing graceful about Greengrass' filming of the chase and that's exactly how it should have been. He brilliantly captures the mayhem of that moment and turned it into an adrenaline rush.This is a thinking-person's film. Screenwriter Tony Gilroy (who also penned the script for 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"") trusts his audience and doesn't dumb down the story.Instead of giving us standard wisecracking characters, outlandish visual effects and people we couldn't care less about, Gilroy wrote a terrifically efficient script, giving supporting players like Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox small, but juicy, moments. True, he plays within the conventions of the genre when it comes to villains, but that fact hardly diminishes our enjoyment.Gilroy's made Bourne cool, smart, quick-thinking. I loved how deftly Jason improvised to get out of jams, finding novel uses for a toaster and rolled-up magazine and a speedy way to tap a cell phone.Matt Damon proves to be an ideal Bourne. He's calm, emotionally restrained. There's nothing flashy about him. Damon humanizes Bourne and brings a level of depth to this character that's rare in contemporary spy/action films. With this film, Damon shows he might be a better actor than many believe.Having been pleasantly surprised by Doug Liman's film two years ago, I was hopeful the sequel would be equally as good. I wasn't disappointed.""The Bourne Supremacy"" is tense, action-filled and, above all, thoroughly entertaining. In a summer that gave us bombastic, bloated, boring blockbusters, such as ""Troy,"" ""Van Helsing,"" ""King Arthur"" and ""Catwoman,"" this film proves that a well-told story, bright writing, fascinating characters and electrifying storytelling always trump even the most eye-popping special-effects wizardry.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One step down: back to Hollywood standards.,"I've just watched it, and have some mixed feelings about it. First of all, the creators continued the good tradition started in the first flick, which is adapting a book by simply trashing its guts and leaving the cover: those who've read ""The Bourne Supremacy"" will find (once again) that the movie has nothing in common with the original book, aside of a rather arbitrary coincidence of names (not places).Secondly, I am not ready yet for this bright new and fancy editing style which looks as if the editor's pit bull had found the film the day before it was edited. The action scenes are (IMHO) impossible to watch. At least I couldn't make out what was happening from that short glimpses of blurry images filmed by a seemingly epileptic camera man, where the overwhelming sound of kicks and blows is the only reference to the scene's story line. Very big disadvantage next to the first movie, where the camera was also shaky, ""documentary-like"", but the key fight sequence was clear and therefore very impressive; Kali is an impressive martial art, but in order to understand how impressive it is you have to see the ""chain sequences"" and appreciate the beauty and efficiency of the movements. That was done pretty good in the ""The Hunted"" and the latest ""The Bourne Identity"". I was expecting a better fights from the second part, I got none.I also found some lack of intelligent script writing, as compared to the first part: a low blow to the film's credibility. Bourne's creativity suffered a heavy loss, the tricks look trivial, and the car chase is just what it could be in any standard Hollywood flick: a lineal runaway with lots of (very loudly) crashed metal, not much of a brain work. Or maybe it's just because I, once again, couldn't figure it out in the middle of this dog-beaten cut-n-paste editing. Anyway, I could find no logic in the chase scene's final, and it was yet another blow to the movie's credibility.As a Muscovite, though, I was really pleased to see my city once again in a Hollywood production :) And I even was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of my home! It definitely affects my objectiveness. Some Hollywood actors actually spoke a passable Russian (Karel Roden is really good, and when Matt Damon speaks in short phrases, it sounds really good), but Karl Urban sucks. Maybe because he says most of the long phrases...I've been waiting for this movie for quite a long, I was going to enjoy it and I actually have. In spite of the fact that at times the lack of action on the screen was in a clear contradiction with the all tense and thundering music score, and in spite of the Bourne's downgrade from a 50-million-worth precise weapon to a linear-thinking stuntmaster.So, to watch or not to watch? It's a good movie, but the only 2 reasons to watch it in a theater are (IMHO) - either you just can't wait for the DVD release (like it was in my case) or you want to hear the really good sound effects _that_ loud.I give it 6 out of 10, and remember that my judgment is affected by the sights of my homeland.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent sequel to The Bourne Identity,"Have you ever been to a movie where the audience spontaneously erupted in applause at the end? This movie certainly deserved it. It is a sequel that does its predecessor proud. I would be very surprised if Matt Damon didn't get an Oscar nomination. This was not just another action movie. It had just the right blend of suspense and action. There was a car chase that rivaled The French Connection. I found myself clutching the armrests in quite a few scenes. A guaranteed most enjoyable experience. The only thing I would suggest is that if you have not yet seen the first movie, The Bourne Identity, do see it first. That will set you up to have all the pieces tied together. I will definitely add both movies to my collection.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great, but for the shaky camera","Okay, I am a huge Ludlum fan.  I love the book.  I know going in that this movie has nothing in common with the book; and that's fine with me.

The story is decent; there are arguably holes here and there, scenes that feels very tagged-on (the entire moscow arc), but it's still more thoughtful than most of the movies I've seen this summer.My one complaint was the camera work.  I'm okay with the occasional shaky cam.  I'm actually not that annoyed with all the action being blurred, but isn't it a little excessive to shake when a character walks or soft focus blur during every close-up?  I ended up looking away from the screen whenever there's a 'walking scene' or a closeup to rest my eyes so I don't throw up.  It would have been so much better if I can just watch the whole movie through, without getting sick.  Other than that, I really like it. But then, I'm biased, since I'm a Karl Urban fan.

Ready to See the Third Film!!,"Much like the first film, the plot was complex enough to hold your attention. Paul Greengrass did an overall excellent job in capturing the sometimes gritty European feel that Doug Limon achieved in his direction of The Bourne Identity. Greengrass widely employed the technique of using a hand-held camera, which is often fantastic; however, it is absolutely distracting during the film's close-up fight sequences. In fact, it's often difficult to see what is actually happening. As such, the viewer may feel somewhat robbed of those lightning quick hand-to-hand combat moves, due to the super shakiness of the camera.Still, the movie left me wanting more, and I'm anxiously awaiting a third 'Bourne' movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I prefer to see the skill involved and be excited by that, rather than being taken along for a thrill ride. It's just not as effective for me.But, other than that, a very cool movie.

Greengrass ups the style of this remarkable franchise.,"One of the few instances of a sequel being superior to it's original. The Bourne Supremacy increases the action and deepens the story that the original mastered. The action is much grittier, crisp and natural. The performances are the same, notably Damon's who fine tunes his amnesia into a sense of dedicated revenge. Joan Allen was perfectly casted in a performance made to rival Brian Cox's commanding drive. Joan Allen really commands the screen every time she is on, much like she does in every role. She was prefect for the part. The car chase is the greatest I've ever seen. It's wonderfully authentic and realistic. Paul Greengrass was perfect for directing this film. His gritty, hand-held style makes it feel like you are there watching the action occur, most notably performed during the fight between Bourne and the last Treadstone assassin with the magazine. Julia Stiles' wonderful performance should also be mentioned. My only big complaint is that Karl Urban butchers Russian whenever he speaks it, getting most of his lines wrong. Still the epitome of the espionage thriller and one of the best films of the packed 2004.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, hard-boiled espionage flick","This film was well done. It told the story without pandering to the short attention spans of many of today's moviegoers. I liked it's gritty feel and serious tone. This is closer to how the early Bond films were than the world-saving, special-effects laden epics starring Pierce Brosnan.Damon is believable as a desperate, yet ruthless expert. A  killer who is rightly feared for his skills and seen as a threat. I also liked the upper level office politics within Langley. It's nice to show that these operatives are acting according to a policy sent down from above.The editing was good with lots of  quick cuts and hand-held/steadicam work was compelling. I always love a good fight scene and this film has one with an explosive conclusion. I liked it better than the first film simply because the character was established (at least in our minds) and we we could simply watch as he reacts and moves through the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought the movie was good enough to see a second time!,"I had no problem with this movie. My 12 year old son told me to go see it. I haven't seen the first one as yet, but will as soon as I can. Most of all I read about this movie is that the persons who saw it didn't care for it as much as the first one. Like I said, I rated it a nine without seeing the first one. I'm waiting now for my son to see it so he can let me know which he thinks is the best. Great job on making the movie and all the effects. I am 58 years old and I try to see at least one or two movies a month. I really love the action packed ones. I really hope there will be several more spin-offs of this movie in the future.

Don't waste your time....,"The Bourne Identity was an excellent movie. Unfortunately, the sequel does not follow suit.This movie has (somehow) gotten overwhelmingly good reviews that I just cannot agree with. There are two main problems that just GLARED at me throughout the whole movie. The first, and most obvious, was a camera that NEVER stopped shaking. Some of you that claim to have depth as reviewers praise it as adding to the tension and suspense of the movie. Example:""Just like Bourne doesn't know what is going on, the audience doesn't know what is going on!!!""I didn't pay money to watch a blur on the screen. Maybe other reviewers were taking hallucinogens that made the blurs REALLY interesting.What's worse is the action isn't the only part plagued by shaking-camera syndrome - IT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE!!! What in the hell were the people that made this movie thinking?? This must have been what the board meeting looked like:""Okay, well we are going to be making a sequel to The Bourne Identity. I think we should make it more intense and hardcore than the original."" ""Well, we received praise on our camera manipulating technique from the first movie. It's edgy, it's witty; it's shaky-cam."" ""Okay I have an idea - we will use shaky-cam in this one too, but a lot more this time!"" ""So like in the action scenes?"" ""No, think bigger, action scenes and conversation scenes too!!! MUHAHAHAHA""""Yeah those idiots will really eat it up and give it good reviews!"" (evil laughter of boardroom) ""Best of all, we save on having to hire a choreographer for fight scenes, since no one will know what is going on anyways."" ""We can also do a chase scene in one take!"" ""We have some good ideas so far, but how do we make the movie more 'hardcore'?"" ""I saw a camera technique i really liked in the first Austin Powers. It was when Dr. Evil said 'ONE MILLION DOLLARS!' and the camera did a quick jerky zoom in. Now that's hardcore!"" ""NOW WE'RE TALKING!""Yeah, I have to comment on those jerky zoom-ins during conversations. I know they were trying to make it seem as if there was tension - or something... It was seriously lame.Okay.... the next problem is the casting of Landy. She is just not credible as a character. Not once did I think that she was the type of lady that would hold a position of that sort. When she acted, I saw acting instead of a character. I know those zoom-ins were supposed to make her look hard and like someone that gets to the bottom of things, but I just wanted to cry.The plot was a C- and the overall movie pulled down to an F by the directing. I know it is tough to make a sequel, but these guys didn't even try.Save this one as a rental. Maybe the shaky-cam won't give you such a headache when the screen isn't so big.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sequel better than the first.,"Sequels are known for not being as good as the original film, but from time to time we get an exception like for X2, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (imo) and Spider-Man.I loved the original Bourne movie, loved practically everything about it except the fact plenty of things were changed from the book. After seeing that it finished #2 at the box office, behind Scooby Doo in 2001, I never thought there would be a sequel. When I first saw the trailer for Supremacy, I wasn't excepting anything, we don't get nice locations like in the first movie's trailer, no climax (the US embassy wall climbing was the first film's), so I really wasn't excepting anything.I bought the ""explosive extended edition"" and got a coupon for the movie, saw it the same night after rewatching the original film and LOVED IT. The Bourne Supremacy us everything the first movie is and better, it's got almost the whole cast back, except for Chris Cooper, however we get a little cameo from him. The story is good, a good and solid script apart for a few plot holes and big camera problems. Doug Liman had nice and clean fight/chase scenes in the first film, in this one we get horrible hand-held camera fight scenes and chases.Overall, this movie definitely fits in my top 5 of 2004 so far with Spartan and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and deserves a well earned 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Carries it On,"It doesn't have quite the mystery and intrigue of the first one, but still does a nice storytelling job. Most of the time I wonder who these guys are who are willing to become cannon fodder for a cause. Are they being paid really well. Have they been brainwashed. Are they out of the terrorist/suicide bomber school. They are there to do harm and for whom. This movie keeps a personal slant on this. Bourne deep down inside doesn't want to kill. But he's been put on this roller coast, given no choice, and is still bewildered by his situation. To quote another film from a long time ago, ""Who are these guys?"" Here Bourne just wants to live his life. He knows he's in the cross hairs but chooses to back off and try to live a normal life. They just won't let him.

Excellent,"Plot was interesting, even if not intriguing. Just enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat, although it didn't produce the white knuckled suspense of a Hitchcock movie. But what movie does these days? Brilliantly acted, directed and filmed. Major glitch: the jump from Berlin (where it appeared to be summer) to Moscow (where it was definitely winter) 24 hours later. Minor glitch: how he knew to go to Berlin, but it didn't detract from the plot very much. The scene in Goa where Marie gets knocked off was kind of weak--a cheap chase scene which didn't add a lot to the story. The vaporetto chase scene in Venice in ""The Italian Job"" was a lot more creative. However, it's my kind of movie--I'm buying the DVD.

not much like the book...,"Why did they even bother to call this movie The Bourne Supremacy? The only thing it has in common with the book is the main character. It's a nice movie, lots of action (though a little too much camera motion for my taste), but for someone who read the book (and it WAS a best seller, so that means a fair number of people should have read it) and liked it, the movie should be a great disappointment. The book had so many twists and turns, the movie has maybe one. The book was set in Asia, Marie is kidnapped not dead (thus changing Jason's motivation), and the movie's ending is unsatisfactory. In short, the movie trailer should say ""based on a character created by Robert Ludlum"", rather than ""based on the novel by Robert Ludlum"" - that would be more honest.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Major disappointment -- does not live up,"Shaky-Cam: For the love of God, Hollywood, stop it. Just stop. Matt Damon need not be in most of this movie, you couldn't see any of the action anyway.

As good as the first movie,"After Bourne Identity, I was expecting that sequel to be as good and I'm not deceived. It has achieved to make me definitely love the saga.Jason Bourne is back but against his wishes. When the woman he loves got killed by a CIA assassin, he decides to go after them just like he promised at the end of the first movie.As expected, Bourne Supremacy is a bit darker than the first opus. We are introduced to new characters like Pamela Landy, a CIA station chief who is in charge of an operation related to the first mission accomplished by Bourne. When this op fails with the death of two men and Jason's fingerprints are found on the scene, she is tasked with taking him down. That's the beginning of a long series of twists which uncovers a much larger conspiracy within the CIA.Thankfully what makes the first movie so great, the thrilling action, is still there and so masterfully filmed once again.

The shaky-cam made me nauseous. The plot was hopeless.,"What on earth are some modern photographers up to? - I was taking moving pictures better than this with my dad's Super 8 camera, when I was 6 years old. The ""scenes"" last about 1/4 second and that wouldn't be so bad if the viewer had even a fighting chance of focusing on anything. This, unfortunately, is not possible as the photographer seems to suffer from Parkinson's disease, hemiballismus  and St. Vitus' Dance - all at the same time. The shots were badly exposed, out of focus, jerking this way and that way and nearly always had some head or other object obscuring most of the subject matter. In short - literally, truly and genuinely an unwatchable movie. About 10% of the people in the cinema walked out. I envy them. I'm greedy and wanted my $9 worth. Like an idiot, I stayed to the end and I still have the effects of motion sickness.Apart from this appalling and pathetic demonstration of avant-garde cinematography gone seriously wrong, the plot was convoluted, improbable and generally a yawn from beginning to end.

It's a faster paced film than the prequel, so you really do need to pay attention to follow what is fully going on (just like the first film) and it still combines action and story really well.This is a pretty short review, but I think the film does all the talking needed.An enjoyable movie and very much recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very good but not as good as The Bourne Identity,"Overall very good but a few minor flaws.One in particular was the way that the hand to hand combat scenes are shot - much too close up. In The Bourne Identity, the audience can see Bourne's martial arts techniques and in this film you are given the sense of his limbs moving quickly and the opponents are responding (or not) but we have to take it on faith that Bourne's moves are convincing and effective. In the first Bourne film we can see it for ourselves and if you didn't see the first one you might not. Since we know that Matt Damon can do the moves then why not show them to us (with a wider shot).Conclusions: 1. This film is very entertaining but you must see The Bourne Identity before seeing this one to fully appreciate this one.2. Bring back Doug Liman as director (I liked his pacing better, you can better see Bourne's logistical mechanics and it is less simply bang-bang-chase-chase).3.

Almost very good,"Saving myself the summary...Fast-paced action flick, which I enjoyed very much, despite its flaws. The car chase in Moscow must rank among the most violent ever filmed. Are these Russian cars really built like tanks?Flaws, inter alia:1) The camera work: the director overdid the 'shaky' bits. First, it make you nauseous when you're exposed to it on a large screen (and I saw it on a LARGE screen). It's OK for TV and NYPD, but not here. The nausea plus the overuse of the effect diminishes its impact in those instances where it could have been useful. It was a lousy directorial decision.2) Why did they have to kill off Marie? To motivate Bourne? Cliché, and in your face - and that basically means crappy, lazy story-telling. I could think off-hand of at least five other, less stereotypical, ways of achieving the same aim; can't you? Or was it just because the screenwriters didn't know what to do with the romance angle? Does God exist? Who invented the doggy-bag? Some questions have no answers, I guess.Never mind.

I like it!,"The Bourne Identity introduced amnesia as a subtle but growing threat, while The Bourne Supremacy takes a more intense approach with its abstract storytelling and frenetic action sequences. What was once a traditional spy narrative has transformed into a paranoid whirlwind across two films, trading somber moments of a man evading capture for a mosaic of tense scenarios and grim realities. Director Paul Greengrass portrays memory as a literal absence, flashing glimpses of situations from everyday tasks to pervasive corruption. However, one criticism is that these movies, at least until Ultimatum, lack a central theme, relying instead on visceral movement and vivid imagery. Nonetheless, The Bourne Supremacy delivers a memorable conclusion, pulse-pounding action, and sharply biting dialogue that feels urgent and raw. It sets the standard for modern thrillers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Sad Step Down,"The first film in this series was awesome. Bourne was sympathetic, Franka Potente was wonderful and the baddies were really easy to hate. Full marks for all that, so what went wrong? the film starts out with a flashback, Bourne remembering a job he did in Berlin while he was with the clandestine hit squad, Treadstone. Bourne has gone off the grid, living in various third world countries with his girlfriend. the plot kicks off when a high level CIA purchase in Berlin is swindled, both the client and buyer killed, and Bourne's fingerprints are all over it. before long, Bourne comes under fire in Goa, India from the same man who did the killing in Berlin. following the loss of his girlfriend in the attack, Bourne swears vengeance, and heads off to Europe.One off the best things about Identity was its ability to make the audience care about Bourne, he's a nice guy, he's human. In this one, he might as well be the terminator. We see Bourne as his enemies must have seen him before his amnesia: cold, heartless, pitiless. He behaves more like a villain, keeping us at an emotional distance.If you've ever read a Tom Clancy novel, you'll work out the plot about 4 minutes after meeting the bad guys. and with Bourne acting like a kill-bot for the whole movie, the film has neither a complex plot nor an emotional core. We stop sympathizing with his rampage of revenge after he stops letting us.The climax, a wild, slick car chase through Moscow is objectively great. but by this point in the story, with the main nasty bloke sorted out, we don't even know what Bourne's doing in Russia. and so this extended action set piece is wasted on an audience who haven't been told what's going on. the quiet character scene that follows where Bourne reveals the truth about the death of a young girl's parents to her should have preceded the car chase.none the less, the whole movie is slick, but it lacks the emotional centre and clear objective of the first. while clear objectives don't always work (they can be detrimental in a lot of films) this is a thriller, and if we don't know where the hero is going, and he's a jerk, we don't care",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More please,"Why do smart spy thrillers only come along rarely?  Why can't more be written and produced?  There were no sly asides in this movie, no silly one-liners or the hero doing ridiculous things.  We have a great movie, well filmed, well written with talented actors that make you believe this is real.  There was a good balance of excitment and mystery.  And when it's exciting, the movie really puts you in the middle of whatever is happening be it a fight or chase.  Usually, car chases do nothing for me, they're over done and unexciting.  The car chase in Bourne Supremacy was masterful.  I was cringing in my seat flinching at each hit.  The movie completely worked for me.  This is definitely one that requires a second viewing just to get the pieces that I missed the first time around.  I'd say a 9/10 only because I thought one fight scene (a rolled up magazine?!  Great!) was too shaky and would have benefited from a steadier camera.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bourne Epilepsy,"This followup to the excellent 2002 flick starts off with Jason Bourne and girlfriend Marie hanging out in a small beach house in India. Jason is still trying to piece together his past as vague memories of a botched assassination come trickling back into his head while he and Marie apparently live off the fortune they made selling the moped rental shop from the last movie. However, he soon finds out that living in hiding has some drawbacks. Namely, that anyone with access to your fingerprints can use you as an ace-in-the-hole when they want to do something naughty. And that's exactly what happens when a break-in goes awry, thus needing a fall-guy to blame it on. On top of that, a Russian oil baron is after Bourne and sends a hit-man after him in India. So much for the laying low theory.This picture replicates the gritty feeling of the first movie and has a nice old-school feel to it. It's still a globe-trotting espionage flick - Like Bond, but without all the hoary trappings (the Bond girl, the martinis, the gadget shop) that have helped make that series a complete joke.Director Paul Greengrass has done some nice things with this installment. One is not over-relying on the action scenes to carry the movie. Indeed, if there had been any more of those, my skull would have exploded. More on that later. He gives the characters some depth, and despite a bit of convolution, lays out a credible story. He's also not afraid to pull punches. There's a moment early on in the film that will come as quite a shock, especially if you are already familiar with the first movie. Definitely not the sort of safe, cookie-cutter film-making Hollywood has engaged in recently. Nor does he fall into the sentimental tar pit that undermines most pictures of this caliber. There's a scene near the end that lands a nice solid emotional punch as it wraps up the remaining loose ends that never once veers into maudlin-ville. Nice job. He also manages to get some actual acting out of Matt Damon. Not an easy thing to do.As Jason uncovers the mystery surrounding his sudden predicament, he uncovers more about his troubled past, and we begin to learn some more about him. Such as the fact that he prefers to apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to unconscious people underwater. That seems like it would be pretty difficult. I must have missed that part in my CPR classes. He also seems to be in no short supply of firearms no matter where he goes. Over the course of the movie, he must hit about 5 continents, and somehow remains able to brandish the hardware at any time. I guess the rest of the world isn't as hung up about that 9/11 thing as we are. He's also a computer whiz and has figured out that movie-world secret of how to make them emit those cool electronic chirping noises whenever he hits the enter key or a digital images appears on screen. Man, I wish I could figure out how that's done. Would definitely add some zing to my review-writing.Now for the bad part. The dizzying camera-work. If you go see this, do yourself a favor and bring a paint shaker from your local hardware store. Clamp your head into it, turn it on during the action scenes, and if you sync it right, you should be able to follow everything just peachy. If you don't, prepare to leave the theatre with your eyeballs in a serious state of nystagmus. It's so bad, it almost feels like a parody of all the shaky-cam action movies that have come before it. Like something SNL would do if they ever got back to being funny.Too bad, as some of the action scenes are pretty good, including a car chase inside a tunnel crowded with traffic. Unlike most action films, the surrounding cars respond like real drivers would in that instance - by doing something stupid and pulling their car out into the path of the oncoming speedsters. This results in lots of cars getting decked and bounced off the walls. It's all good, crunchy fun. Unfortunately, you'll only see bits and pieces of it. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm of the mind that complicated action scenes should be long steady pull-back shots where you can see all the hard work that went into making them. Imagine the long uncut tracking shots of Hard Boiled's hospital shootout, or the Tartar raid in Andrei Rublev being cut every half-second and filmed as if the camera were inserted into a trash can and rolled like a stuffed freshman into the middle of the action.Anyway, The Bourne Supremacy is still a good film, a better one I think in the story, action, and character departments than the original.

I found a large portion of the action to be too closeup with fast camera movement. I lost my sense of disbelief and started thinking about how much I couldn't see. I guess the director was hoping to put me ""in the action"" but for me the effect was the opposite.A lot of the action was similar to the first film in the fact that he's always on the run, but that's why I liked the story. Bourne is still clever and does many unexpected things.Overall, I'd say the move was good but I'd watch the first over the second and day. Hopefully, Ultimatum will return to the winning style Identity.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I saw Bourne...yesterday,"Supremacy is an efficient sequel to ""The Bourne Identity"". The sophisticated talents of the cast supplement the stability of this action-packed series. I really love the way you vicariously live in Jason Bourne's shoes from the movie's beginning to end. The car chase scenes rival, if not exceed, other greats like in 'Bullitt' or ""The French Connection', and the hand-to-hand battles are first rate.It may not closely follow the Ludlum book, but director Paul Greengrass still manages to fit the pieces of this thriller together nicely. Overall, this movie is a pleasure for action movie lovers and I would definitely say it deserves it's nearly 8 point IMDb rating.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Irritating to watch but full of action.,"This was a roller-coaster ride from start to finish, with hand to hand fights, car chase, and almost incessant action. I really felt for poor Bourne, he couldn't escape surveillance. It was really scary to think that wherever one goes you could be monitored, Big Brother is watching! There was hardly any respite from wall to wall action, the technique of hand-held cameras and fast zooming in and out became irritating after a short time, it may have sustained the tenseness but was sore on the eyes. It was good thriller plot and had a dialogue that may have been a bit difficult to follow at times but better than some higher profile movies I could mention.

A Great Suspense Film,"What a surprisingly good sequel! I really enjoyed the first Bourne movie, and was happy that it became the number one rented movie of last year. I was worried that this one was a little rushed in production and perhaps the plot would suffer, but instead I was totally riveted and enthralled with the story and characters. The direction is very well done and I enjoyed the fast-paced, jerky feel of the camera work, which makes you feel as if you're right in the middle of the action. The older generation in our theater grumbled at the end of the movie from this, but I thought it was very appropriately used. The acting is so superb that I realize how bad the acting is in many of the recent films I have viewed. My only complaint is that it does run a little long, but I can't say specifically anything I would have been able to take out. Still, I highly recommend it!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The main bad guy in the film is a relentless Russian Secret Service agent, who reminds me of the Serbian sniper from the film Behind Enemy Lines.They say the adult thriller genre faded away after being peaking in the 70s.

overall good but wobbly camera was distracting,"My husband and I saw the movie last night and although we enjoyed it, we thought it was good, not as good as the first one. The first movie had more suspense. I am sorry I have to disagree about the comments about the shaky camera work not being distracting. It WAS very distracting and really not necessary to emphasize the action. In some of the scenes, such as the fight scene or the car chase, it was very hard to distinguish what was going on. Overall we enjoyed the movie and we look forward to the third and final (?) installment of the Bourne series. Maybe Jason (and the audience) will finally get some questions answered and 'they' will finally leave him alone.",,Anonymous,Mystery
overrated and disappointed but still good.,"this movie wasn't very good as the Bourne Identity. Of course some people say the first movie is always better! This story doesn't go that well. It doesn't really fit together. I see that Paul Greengrass is directing Bourne Supremacy and same with Bourne Ultimatinum. I haven't seen Bourne Ultimatinum yet but i have high hopes for it. This movie still has plentiful of action but it was pretty boring and they say things the watcher shouldn't know about. Pam did a good job in this movie. She was the perfect enemy to Jason. So anyways, if you guys watched the first movie you might want to see this.. But it was kind of bad for me. :( 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loved the movie; hated the camera work,"I think this movie might've been everything I hoped it would be. I think because I couldn't tell for sure when I watched it, thanks to the jarring, out-of-focus camera work. I got a headache about 10 minutes into the picture and had a migraine by the end.Most of what I loved about the Bourne Identity was clearly gone: the sweet, sweet romance; the intricate fights; the self discovery. What remained was Jason's worst nightmare, unfortunately so blurred and chopped that I can only guess what really happened.That said, I'd pop a Dramamine and watch this again to try to figure it out.Matt Damon excelled in his role as before. I truly believed his motivation and supported his quest for revenge. I loved the music, the scenery, and the plot, so I give this movie an 8. If the camera had been anywhere besides clutched in somebody's shaky hand or resting on the shoulder of a jogger, I'd have given it a 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average Action Movie,"This movie was okay, but I wasn't overly impressed with it. If not for the over use of the hand held camera, which had me feeling seasick, I may have enjoyed it more. While such technique can add a sense of urgency to a film, when it used throughout 99% of the movie, it just becomes totally annoying. It distracts from what is happening in the scene. The car chases were particularly hard to watch and follow what was happening. They did use some interesting, original angles in some of the action sequences, but, again, with that shaky camera it didn't have the impact it could have had. I hope if there is another movie in the series, they will make much use of that old movie making rule: Use a tripod most of the time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A tense and gripping start,"The Bourne Identity is a masterclass in spy thrillers, blending high-octane action with a compelling mystery. Matt Damon shines as Jason Bourne, bringing depth and vulnerability to a character struggling with amnesia while uncovering his deadly skills. The film is perfectly paced, balancing intense chase sequences and fight scenes with quieter, suspenseful moments that build tension.Director Doug Liman crafts a grounded and realistic tone, making every action scene feel visceral and believable. The chemistry between Bourne and Marie (Franka Potente) adds an emotional layer to the story, making the stakes feel personal as well as global. With its tight narrative and relentless energy, The Bourne Identity sets a high bar for the franchise and remains one of the best spy films of its time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie which changed the view,"Its just fantastic because its very realistic & logical.I don't even know how many times i have watched the entire series over and over, which never bored me. Movies are directed in so realistic manner, credits goes to director and crew. Especially initial 3 series are so good and linking stories.Though the entire story line is fictional just like the novels, not just this movie the entire series of Bourne goes in whole new platform unlike most of other movie. In short, changed my view of ""Nonsense"" to ""New sense"" and impacted my life as well. 
Newly released Jason Bourne (2016), didn't made much of impact because i felt that movie was more focused to bring back the same previous scenario rather than story line.My suggestion is don't be hasty to release a movie & please don't spoil the image of Bourne meaning take your time he's movie make more sense in story line than actions just like novels.

Good enough,"I didn't really think too much of the first movie, so I was rather surprised that they came up with a sequel. Somehow I think this movie is very similar to the first so much that perhaps they could have merged the two and form one movie. So much so that a lot of the unresolved elements of Identity took up most of this one. Of course this meant that there was only a little time for the newly introduced characters.There was that little tremor at the start of the movie which really surprised me. I thought that was a good touch that made me more interested in the movie. I just wish they had it a little more into the middle of the film rather than where it was.In terms of action I thought the action scenes were just as good as the first. It was sufficient but nothing much to crow about. I however still cannot get used to the fact that Matt Damon can do an effective enough job as an action star.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Justifications for shaky camera-work,"Some people liked the shaky camera-work. Fine. You're entitled toyour opinion. However, don't justify your preference with thefollowing reasons:1. The shaky camera was reflective of Bourne's state of mind.If the above is true, why was this technique used for EVERYsequence; even the scenes that he wasn't in and had nothing todo with?2. The technique is innovative and artistic.Sorry, but this shaky camera technique has been in commonusage for television and movies ever since those Levi'scommercials started the trend twenty years ago. The artful trick to itis to use it appropriately.3. This gives and exciting ""hand held"" effect.This is not a hand held technique. Hand held means that thecamera operator is not using a tripod, but is trying to shoot thesubject matter. This is like what you might see on an action newsreport, or in a documentary where there wasn't time or roomenough for a steady shot. What you have in Bourne Supremacy isa style called ""drunk-o-vision."" This means that the cameraoperator is intentionally trying NOT to shoot the subject matter, butrather to wave the camera around drunkenly, or as if someonestrapped the camera to a dog's head. Again, there are times whenthis can be used for good effect. In this case, it was used withoutany kind of discrimination or artistic talent, presumably to keeppeople with ADD from getting bored.4. It made the action sequences more exciting.About half the people in the audience when I saw it were talkingloudly about how they couldn't even tell what was going on in theaction sequences. How is this exciting?The very fact that so many people are talking about thecamera-work -- pro or con -- shows that it was noticeable, and adistraction from the story.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Disappointing,"Well I just got home from a Friday night session at the local movies. I was looking forward to seeing this sequel ALL day today. The Bourne Identity is such a high quality thriller that it only seemed natural that a good thing would naturally follow. How wrong could I be?One and only ONE major factor totally made this film a disaster. The camera work. I felt as though I was sitting on Matt Damon's lap throughout the whole movie while at the same time experiencing an epileptic fit !!The story line was intriguing and at times, quite gripping & suspenseful, but when one cannot fully focus on what is actually going on, one's attention is quite quickly taken away from the storyline altogether.Unlike other reviewers, I left the cinemas without nausea or a headache, just extreme disappointment. I cannot understand why a film - with such an obvious massive budget and talented (& no doubt highly paid) actors - would be filmed in such a way. Did the Director not sit back and watch the film before it was realized? Was a test audience not utilised to view the film before it was passed?Perhaps the whole movie captured on someone's uncle's Sony camcorder? The uncle with Parkinson's disease.... Such a shame, shame, shame... If only the Director had invested in more wider angles on scenes before focusing in and a LOT more steady STILL focusing over longer periods and less jerkiness, the movie may, just MAY have been a big success...",,Anonymous,Mystery

The best Spy thriller of all time,"I was truly impressed by Bourne Supremacy. Much better than the very good Bourne Identity from 2002. The reasons are mainly the following. There is so much great acting from everyone in this movie especially from Matt Damon and the direction, music, story keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end with amazing tight editing. It also features one of the best car chases ever filmed that actually begins with a long intense manhunt chase in the first place. There is also some great emotional philosophy in this film as well and all this in a summer action event movie. Wow! Lastly there are no pointless shallow special effects in this movie that I had to suffer all these years from Hollywood but everything is real. Much better than any James Bond or other spy movie ever made. All in all so far this year's best movie and that is saying a lot considering this is already July 24.

I remember good things all the time.,"I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails  bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the ""story""? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.Grade: ** out of *****",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthy sequel that stayed true to the original.....,"And that's basically all I was asking for with 'Bourne Supremacy'; seeing how much I enjoyed the original, 'Bourne Identity'.  After watching the trailer it was pretty obvious that they were going to stay true to what they started.  This is the reason why Bourne Supremacy works.  Matt Damon seems to have been 'born' for this role, he performs it very well.  Joan Allen was effective in her 'more subdued than normal' role.  The chase scene in the end was very entertaining....it probably ranks up there with other great chase scenes.  The hand-held camera technique gave the film a realistic feel, but I'll admit at times it was a little hard to see what was going on.The story here was as good as the first, and the pacing was right on....they don't waste any time getting in the thick of things, and that was good to see.  This 'Bourne' franchise really has something going here, and I feel as long as they stick to the formula they've mastered they could very well carry it even further.  It's smart espionage/political/spy/gov't material executed very well on film, regarding film technique as well as acting. It's safe to say that they're '2 for 2'; I'm anxious to see if they're going to continue this...if they are I'll be looking forward to those installments.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Just don't do it is my advice - I don't think anybody found that easy to watch.

Everybody knows (except for the cameraman) that when holding a camera and shooting scenes in this fashion, what you see is not the same as playing it back with the same effect. When looking through the lens you are not nauseated by your hectic camera actions.Greengrass - perhaps you should study more movies to see what works!I am thoroughly annoyed!!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Bring Dramamine,"Having the camera shake violently throughout every action scene truly spoils this otherwise decent thriller (much as loud surprising sounds used in lieu of actual drama in bad horror flicks). Curious, because there's plenty of excitement here, if only one could bring it into focus. I became increasingly annoyed by the unrelenting lurching, until I realized it looked like ""subspace turbulence"" from the 1960's Star Trek, then I found it somewhat amusing (perhaps not the effect they were going for). Just as in the first film, not much of the story is from Ludlum's novel, though maybe that's not such a bad thing - you can enjoy both the book and the movie, since they're not too closely related. Bring your Dramamine/Bonine, sit in the back, and you'll probably enjoy Matt Damon's hairbreadth escapes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best sequels in a summer of great sequels!,"First Shrek 2, then Spider-Man 2, and now the best sequel of them all this summer, The Bourne Supremacy. The best sequels always expand on the characters and themes of their predecessors and this one's no different. It's steeped in personal choice, consequence, and morality. I know that it's based on a Cold War book, but updated suitably to today's audience. I was impressed by the first movie (The Bourne Identity) with its realism, its European sensibility, and its two leads Matt Damon and Franka Potente. I was glad someone had the guts to use Potente after her awesome turn in Run Lola Run.Both return in the second one and they give everything they got. Karl Urban makes for an incredible parallel agent to Bourne, and the returning cast as well as the newcomers are great as well. While I liked the chase from the first movie more than the big scene in this one, I liked the ending of the chase more. I won't say much because to say anything more about this movie would be criminal. Just go see it. I've never seen a film that made me want to buy the first one just so I can have it when the second one comes out on video.I think The Bourne Supremacy is the best sequel so far this summer because it doesn't try to eclipse what came before it. It only supplements it, while at the same time, becomes its own film. Both Shrek 2 and Spider-Man 2 one-up their older versions; instead of being a continuation, it's an improvement of the same. While Supremacy has its work done on a literary basis, it still needs to be adapted to fit the style of the previous movie as well as operate as something completely different.I'll say this: if there's one thing wrong with this movie, it's the shaky hand-held cinematography. Should someone want to retitle this movie, it could be called The Bourne Epilepsy. All else, it's a solid movie.

Down-to-earth grey action,"After the first part I wanted to see more of Jason Bourne and just stuck my teeth in that juicy piece of story that lays behind this character. The halo of mystery is always with us and the screeching manner of amnesia recalls makes you squint same as you heard that nail-to-glass sound; may even cause an epileptic seizure if watched mindfully.Nevertheless, after a head-banging push our sledge begins to move and gain a substantial speed. The plot would have been interesting if it wasn't so dumb: government agencies are shown as a bunch of naïve children with some fancy gadgets. Putting aside lousy reasoning we are left with the rush of a chase on every possible corner that doesn't seem to overdose the viewer. Although from time to time it felt dizzy and I couldn't understand what's happening, the adrenaline was pumping, so the task was complete.Matt Damon continues to show that this character was created for him: showing no robotlike behavior but a set of skills that never really seems to run out (just look at this Russian here). Love the multiple change of settings in the movies: gives you an impression of a global scale operations that increase the value of Bourne in your eyes.Bumping into the end credits I had mixed feelings: on one hand, it got better that the first part in some ways, but I believe it can do better.

fun kicks & plot line/character flaws?,"Fun Fun Fun. 3 words to sum up this sequel. played hookie from work and payed matinée (a whopping $8! since when has this been considered bargain?!2 bucks off regular admission a bargain does not make...) and it was worth every clam.IT was highly entertaining, and with it skips around the world to exotic locales, it played a bit like a grade-A ""alias"" episode. and the car chase scene in Moscow was killer, it kept me on the edge of my seat. and the young Russian agent played a worthy nemesis for bourne. it was so jam-packed with action that there was nary a scene during which one could ponder about any potential flaws int eh story.but in post-movie discussion, a coworker brought up a good point. how is it possible that this AWOL CIA agent has lost all memory of identity but has retained all his training skills? his physical aptitude might be explained by his abilities being a reflexive trait. long shot, but plausible. but his proficiency in all those languages doesn't make sense. if one is young enough when learning a language, it does become almost second-nature and imprints itself almost permanently on the brain. languages learned later on post-childhood, actually require the use different areas of the brain. unless bourne was some amazing multicultured, multilingual prodigy, how it is possible for him to remember how to speak all those languages with such fluency?does anyone have any hypotheses? or how about other possible logical flaws in the plot line/characters?anyway, the movie has a simplistic but engaging storyline, good acting/actors, and beautiful location shots. i agree with other posters that the hand-held camera technique does tend to induce a headache about three-quarters into the film. overall though, highly entertaining blockbuster-type and worth a solid **matinee price showing**.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The rare sight of a sequel that actually just about lives up to the original,"I haven't read the novel behind this, or any other book by Ludlum, I'm sorry to say. You've probably already heard about the hand-held camera... yes, it's pretty much constant in this, even in quiet portions of it, and yes, it can be headache-inducing and straining. The worst is when it makes it downright difficult to make out what exactly is going on. I get that Paul was going for a documentary-feeling, and trying to make it seem true to life, but dialing it back a tad might have been better. The plot goes beyond what the first one did, and it requires a little more of the audience to follow. In general, this tends to race, without always slowing down to let the viewer catch up. The pace is fast, though not necessarily excessive. This supplements the story of Identity well. The new additions are all good. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. Dialog is sharp and well-delivered. The action is bigger, the sequences longer and they get messier and less ""controlled"", without abandoning the special training of Bourne. It's made clear early on that this will be unpredictable and relentless. This is darker than the 2002 film. The score is excellent, again. This takes us to several locations around the world, like Liman's effort. I do prefer his take on the titular icon to Greengrass', though they both have a lot going for their respective versions. This has some bloody violence and brief strong language. The DVD comes with deleted scenes sans explanation to them, nine concise featurettes, four trailers and a Director's Commentary track that is very worth listening through, highly informative and gets into a nice amount of subjects. I recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making it, realistic spy thrillers and/or the franchise. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst Movie of 2004,"A solid ""2"", and why?inconsistent story line, why the killing in Munich etc. poor plot, too many open why's, bad acting, stupid car chases, oh there's a Merc G right here!And this was without taking into account that the book was quite something else - very loosely based upon.I am really surprised about the good rating (7.3 at the moment.):-((((((((",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A great thriller, through and through","I have loved this movie since the very first time I saw it, which was on a plane back when not every seat had a screen. I watched it about eight rows back on the small television sized screen ahead, and I was enthralled for every minute despite the far from ideal viewing experience. Since, I've seen it about a dozen times and I'm completely engaged from beginning to end. I think this is one of the great thrillers.Where this movie goes right so quickly is in the set up. There's a certain ingeniousness to how the filmmakers, Tony Gilroy and Paul Greengrass, get Jason Bourne to leave his life on the run to return to the world of spycraft and the CIA. It's a plot to frame Bourne for a crime he did not commit half a world away to give the CIA an endless ghost trail they'll never be able to get to the end of. He's a pawn in someone else's game, and he turns everything on that. That they also get his love interest murdered early helps his motivation, but it also helps to focus the movie on its core essential points without worrying about a female tag-along character (which Marie kind of was in the first film to the point that Bourne jettisons her for the final act).So, Bourne has taken his German girlfriend Marie on the run, and they've ended up in Goa, India. He's consumed by nightmares, but there's one in particular, about a job he did in Berlin, that's occupying him now. That this is also related to the main plot is just good, economic storytelling. The plot of the film involves the killing of a CIA agent during an op in Berlin by a Russian assassin to hide evidence of an old wire transfer that got rerouted and lost years before. They frame the murder of the CIA agent on Bourne using his fingerprint with the understanding that the files the agent was buying were tied to Conklin, the man who ran Treadstone in the previous film for whom Jason Bourne worked. The idea being that the CIA would imagine Bourne was covering for his dead boss to protect himself, which, of course, he didn't do. Hence, the ghost trail to nowhere.I've read reviews where all of above paragraph feels out of reach of the reviewer, and I got it the first time on that airplane. It's all said, doled out over the movie to those who pay attention.So, the assassin goes to India to kill Bourne, kills Marie instead, and Bourne gets away with the Russian thinking he's dead and the CIA looking for the Bourne who killed the CIA agent in Berlin. Where in The Bourne Identity, Jason felt at first behind the audience and then kind of drifting a bit, Jason feels direct and purposeful and oftentimes ahead of the audience in The Bourne Supremacy. He uses his tools, all of which feel really grounded in a tangible reality that fits in well with the grittier visual aesthetic that Paul Greengrass brings to his camera, to very quickly move from India to Berlin and find the people who are chasing them. It's simply a satisfying look at his skills.However, Jason is not simply a collection of skills. What makes him really compelling in this second film is the fact that he's driven by guilt. He has these fractured memories of murders that the man who came out of that amnesia never did, and yet he did them. The fact that he's disassociated from them doesn't change the fact that his hands did it. The Russian politician and his wife whom Bourne sees himself murder every night in his dreams are dead because of him, and that haunts him. This all becomes really important later.The movie contains two parallel plots, one is Bourne looking for answers to his questions and fractured memories, and the other is Pamela Landy, CIA task force chief, following the clues around Bourne. Landy is tasked with finding Bourne, but in order to do that the CIA Director pairs her with Ward Abbott, the man who was above Conklin in Treadstone in the previous film. The two clash, and for good reason, because Abbott ends up behind everything that Landy is looking for.Let me take a second to talk about Joan Allen as Pam Landy. Joan Allen plays Pam as ice cold, and it's great. She really feels like the kind of woman who could rise into this kind of role in the CIA. She takes no guff from anyone, and she pushes harder than she gets pushed. She has a steely gaze that fits so perfectly with the role, and she's one of my favorite parts of the movie.One of the most interesting things about the main plot of the film, about the CIA files and Bourne and Conklin, is that it ends with almost thirty minutes left in the movie. Bourne finds out Abbot, gets him to confess, and hands the tape to Landy, and yet the movie keeps going. Why?I've read of some criticism that the final act when Bourne moves from Berlin to Moscow is pointless because, well, the plot is over by that point. And yet, there's the second story about Bourne dealing with his guilt. The entire reason Bourne was following the trail of breadcrumbs that happened to coincide with Pam Landy's trail of breadcrumbs was because he was haunted by these images from Berlin, and he needed to figure them out. He needed some closure. Well, he was never going to find his closure in Berlin. The people he killed weren't German, they were Russian. So, he goes to Russia to atone, and that's where the first plot, even though it's actually over, reaches out and makes things exciting with a car chase (possibly the best car chase on film). It's related to both, but ultimately about Bourne's guilt and decision to walk away from the life he had been leaving in a wonderfully visual moment where Bourne goes into the light out of a tunnel after the chase instead of the dark of the other way forward.Now, I've danced around with the story enough, what about the action elements? I love them. Here's the thing about Paul Greengrass and his shaky-cam visuals: He's really good at them. There's a perception that it's all about just sort of capturing small bits of action and stitching them together, but as I watched The Bourne Supremacy this time, I watched with an eye towards those scenes. I think I've figured out how I can be so comfortable with them.The key is that while the bulk of these sequences are built out of very small visual pieces, these pieces are intercut with establishing shots that last at least a second and a half every three to five seconds. So, what Greengrass is doing is giving you a view of what's going on from a medium or long shot, and then closing in for a feeling of frantic action before pulling out again for a second and then pushing in again. It's a cycle that he follows and it allows for a shocking amount of clarity considering the reputation. Some might say that a second and a half simply isn't enough to ground oneself, but I can do it just fine. For all the close ups, I never have any problem with the geography of the scene, never losing sight of where one subject in the frame is relative to the other. It's a style that many simply don't like, but I find it effective at replicating the frantic style of thinking mixed with a clear-eyed view of the overall action.And, going back to the film's actual ending, where Bourne finally gets a chance to atone for his sins to someone he actually hurt: It's such a great little scene. It's quiet and painful. It's also a marvelous way to end the film, but the film continues on for another couple of minutes with a kind of cutesy final conversation between Landy and Bourne that I like as a coda, but I still kind of wish that they had left it in Russia.The Bourne Supremacy is a great film. It's a great action film. It's a great thriller. It is Paul Greengrass elevating the material and Tony Gilroy finding a way to deepen it. I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Thrilling Sequel That Raises the Bar,"""The Bourne Supremacy,"" directed by Paul Greengrass, is a remarkable follow-up to the already stellar ""The Bourne Identity."" This sequel continues the story of Jason Bourne with an intensity and depth that not only matches but in many ways surpasses its predecessor. The film is a masterclass in modern espionage thrillers, delivering edge-of-your-seat excitement and a complex, engaging plot.Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne, bringing a nuanced performance that showcases both the character's deadly skills and his vulnerable, human side. Damon has truly made this role his own, and in ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" he adds layers to Bourne's character, making him even more compelling. Bourne is still struggling with his amnesia and the consequences of his past actions, which adds an emotional depth to the relentless action sequences.The supporting cast is excellent, with standout performances from Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, a determined CIA operative, and Brian Cox, who returns as the manipulative Ward Abbott. Julia Stiles also reprises her role as Nicky Parsons, adding continuity and further depth to the storyline. Karl Urban is menacing and effective as the Russian hitman, Kirill, adding a formidable antagonist for Bourne.One of the film's greatest strengths is its pacing and action choreography. Greengrass's direction, with his signature handheld camera work, brings a sense of immediacy and realism to the action scenes. The car chase through the streets of Moscow is particularly noteworthy, often cited as one of the best car chases in cinematic history. The film's action sequences are intense and visceral, yet they never overshadow the story, which remains engaging and coherent throughout.The plot of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is both intricate and well-crafted. It delves deeper into the conspiracy that haunts Bourne, providing twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. The film explores themes of betrayal, revenge, and the search for identity, making it more than just an action-packed thriller but also a compelling narrative.The film's international settings add to its allure, with scenes set in India, Germany, Italy, and Russia. The diverse locations not only provide a visually stunning backdrop but also enhance the global scope of the story. The cinematography captures these locales beautifully, contributing to the film's gritty and realistic atmosphere.Despite being a sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" stands on its own as a superb piece of filmmaking. It expands on the original's premise while introducing new characters and conflicts, ensuring that the story feels fresh and exciting. The film's ability to balance high-octane action with emotional and narrative depth is a testament to Greengrass's direction and the strong performances from the cast.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The book?,"Why does this movie have absolutely NOTHING to do with the book? I don't see any of the ancillary characters and the story is based in a completely different area of the world.I know the China thing may be a bit old news, but you could update it a little bit without completely deep-sixing the whole plot-line.I mean how can you continue to use th name?It's like I, Robot., for crying out loud. Why make a movie named after a book if the two have nothing to do with each other?",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Personally, I think it was better than its predecessor.","This movie is the expected sequel to ""Bourne Identity"". Despite having another director (the first was directed by Doug Liman and this was directed by Paul Greengrass), the script was secured by the same author, Tony Gilroy, which contributed decisively, I don't doubt, to the feeling of unity I got when watching both. In fact, the points of contact between the two stories are evident in the way they marry and harmonize, forming a homogeneous whole.In this film, Bourne is in Goa (an Indian city with a strong connection to Portugal), where he ends up being chased and sees his girlfriend die. From there, he understands that something is up, and that he has returned to being a target to shoot down for the CIA, for whatever reason he doesn't know. Of course, he's been the target of a very well-crafted plot at the highest levels of the organization, and he's going to have to flee and defend himself as they try to kill him. Most of the film consists of pure action, with mind-blowing chases, shooting and tension: in an effort not to displease those who liked its predecessor, the film offers more of the same. Despite that, I felt that there was an effort on the part of the script to put more emphasis on the story told, and to give us a good story, not just an excuse for endless action scenes. For me, that's enough to make this movie even more interesting than the first one.Matt Damon continues the good work he started on the franchise's initial film, even managing to develop his character further and work on it better. If I found what I saw in the first film uninteresting, I am pleased to see a general improvement in the actor's work, and also in the material he was given to work with. Joan Allen was excellent at bringing to life Pamela Landy, the director of the CIA who, despite leading the effort to hunt down Bourne, will also try to understand her motives and understand the reasons that drive him to act. She is charismatic and effortlessly grabs our attention. Julia Stiles, back in the role of Nicky, a hypothetical love interest from Bourne's past, is equally happy in her work. Brian Cox and Carl Urban are also very good. In this film, it is Franka Potente who loses out, with her character disappearing from the scene.Technically, it's a film equivalent to its predecessor, with high production values and a lot of money involved. The pace is intense and things are happening very fast, so you need to be attentive, or you will miss important details. The film is once again located almost entirely in Europe, cleverly taking advantage of European filming locations in Moscow, Berlin and Naples, with a brief visit to the so Portuguese Goa, in India. The cinematography is discreet but elegant, except for the shaky footage of a series of very concrete scenes. The editing also has moments when it doesn't seem to be at its best, with several scenes out of order and successive cuts. The film continues to have many intense action scenes, with frequent use of good special effects, visuals and sound, and stunts for the most dangerous scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"See it, even though it's not as good as the first one","The car chases are not as exciting, there is no romance after the first 15 minutes, the plot is transparent as well as thin, and the characters are cliches.

Fantastic fast-paced mystery thriller!!,"From the opening scene of a blurred, rain drenched night, seen through a car's windshield, Supremacy grasped my attention. As a huge fan of the first BI, I had no doubts of a superb follow-up. I felt the hand-held use of the camera captured the real emotion of Bourne's quick responses, despite being a bit queasy on the senses, (it helped to look off screen every now and then). This cinematography style served to create more mystery and gave the effect of 'less is more', especially when introducing the Russian assassin (Karl Urban!). This style is similar to some of the more scary X-Files. The plot is intriguing and the Damon's struggle against all odds creates a great protagonist. You are cheering for him and wondering how he is going to get out of his next predicament. The fate of Marie (Franka Potente) leaves doubts that may work well into a 3rd installment of the series. The pace, the action, the extreme car chase, the mystery and clues all weave together to create a spellbinding, entertaining movie. In fact, I couldn't believe when it ended as it had the feel of the LOTR's Two Towers, knowing that more great narrative is just around the corner. I can't wait to go see it again!! I highly recommend this film to action lovers!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the few franchises that gets it right!,"Fantastic tie in with all of the sub characters who survived the Borne Identity, this film puts you on the move fast with little time for rest. The cinematography done by Oliver Wood is astounding; keeping mostly to hand-held moving with the actor's holding the tempo of the film especially high. Matt Damon brings Jason Bourne back to life with a seamless transition from Identity to Supremacy. Unlike some films where the actors fail to hold their character, together Damon stays true. Stiles Cox and Allen put in fantastic performances, keeping their interactions tight with the same accuracy, proof of great direction from Paul Greengrass. The dialog delivered by the entire cast is very well timed with meticulous detail again staying true to Identity. Karl Urban is somewhat under used as a nemesis who could have given much more energy to his character if given the time to develop. Supremacy ran with a colder feel keeping the film a touch darker with a certain bitterness that underlies the entire film. Overall, this film is well done and for a sequel, this one matches very well to the first. Assuming they can stick to a working formula this franchise could run for quite some time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The glue of the trilogy, but it is a shaky-cam mess","Paul Greengrass takes over the series as director, and very much feels like he cut his teeth with this one.Despite being freely off the grid and with the head of the insidious Treadstone project killed, Bourne believes the worst is over. But when a Russian assassin takes away the only thing left in Bourne's life, he thinks Treadstone is after him once again. But the plot is even thicker than he can knowEven perhaps a decade later, my opinion of The Bourne Supremacy has not changed in the slightest. I love this trilogy, I even have the steelbook edition, but Supremacy really doesn't sit well with me and not just by comparison of its far superior (no pun intended) siblings.I love me some consistency, and the trilogy delivers that in spades. John Powell returns with an electrifying twist on his original score for Bourne Identity, and even Moby's Extreme Ways returns for the end credits, Matt Damon and Brian Cox reprise their roles very well. In fact I would say the latter steals the show, delivering a frail, cowardly yet sadly sympathetic antagonist, and his scenes with newcomer Joan Allen are probably the most effective for me. The film still has that edgy atmosphere whenever Bourne is stalking around Europe, America and Russia in this globe-trotting sequel, the tension is still real.Yet the editing is atrocious!I really mean it. 2004 must have been when shaky-cam became a thing because Supremacy's action sequences are really, really bad. Not even restricted to the action sequences, even regular tracking shots and panning shots are wobbling all over the place. I appreciate some of it, to invoke kinetic action and uncontrolled rage (representing Bourne's own survival instincts) but you have to dial it back. All I tend to take away from this film is 1. the film's main action set piece, a car chase around Moscow, is heavily shaky-cam, and 2. this is suffers from second installment syndrome.To watch Supremacy alone is pointless. At one hour thirty-seven minutes it flies by, none of the returning characters are given time to re-establish themselves, new characters are barely touched on. Without the first film's great pacing and establishing and the third films incredible payoff, Supremacy is just noise.There are moments of cleverness that I enjoy; the chase Bourne makes from Police that involves running across two train tracks, off a bridge, onto a boat only to double-back back onto the bridge again from underneath? That was impressive. That and how Bourne takes control of the situation from underneath the organisation hunting him. It is a fantastic ""you got owned"" scene that does so much to empower our hero and validate every other characters' fear of him.Of course, I said earlier I love this trilogy. Supremacy is redeemed by its successor, and Supremacy is the glue that the series relies upon, take it out and it falls apart. But as a singular experience I really don't think highly of it in cinematography terms.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Supreme Disappointment,"Although the original was an engrossing thriller, this is like a theme park thrill ride version of it, with the faces & scenery painted on the walls.The story & acting were passable, but the direction & filming technique made it almost unwatchable. 'Shaky-Cam' is a stylistic trend that needs to end ASAP. About 40% of the film is so badly shaking it almost made me nauseous.Perhaps watching on a small TV in daylight would help.... Naah, just skip it. Way too short, also. No resemblance to the quality of The Bourne Identity at all. The whole result seems like an attempt to quickly git'r'done & go count the money.

Ruined by a gimmick,"I really only have two complaints about the Bourne Supremacy - it was too short and the gimmick of the hand held, in and out of focus camera work was very disturbing and distracting. Let's face it, The Bourne Supremacy was never intended to win an Oscar, it it probably won't. But what it was designed to do was to entertain, and it does succeed, at times better than the original. Matt Damon returns and does a great job playing the 'every man' assassin. Matt is convincing in his physical portrayal as Bourne, Joan Allen is also good as the CIA manager, and Brian Cox is his usual swarmy self.The fight and chase scenes were well choreographed, but were lost in the camera work. By the time your mind and eyes had adjusted to the camera movement, much of the scene was over.

Another great entry in the series!,"'The Bourne Supremacy' is a very, very good film indeed. A spy thriller with heart and soul, and emotion. I therefore hesitate to say I enjoyed 'The Bourne Identity' more than 'The Bourne Supremacy'. I don't want to say I enjoyed 'Supremacy' less, as it might give the indication I didn't enjoy the movie that much. On the contrary, I absolutely loved the film.Matt Damon once again delivers a great performance as the titular character. Jason Bourne has a new life, but is still trying to figure out who he really is - and still constantly looking over his shoulder. As it turns out, the CIA he worked for now view him as a threat to the company and wants to eliminate him. There to counter-act Ward Abbott (Brian Cox)'s decisions, is Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), who wants Bourne alive to get answers. Pamela is a strong, thorough and determined character, and very well portrayed by Allen.This time around, Bourne is framed for theft and murder, and he is on the run whilst also working his way closer to the agency to get answers for himself. 'The Bourne Supremacy' is an excellent cat and mouse game with fantastic action sequences. The chase sequence during the climax was just awesome!!The Bourne films remain the better spy thrillers (to James Bond), as they are more realistic and believable.

That being said, the Bourne Supremacy (BS) was much better than the Bourne Identity. I gave BI an 8. BS I give a 9. It could lose some profanity and I would like it better.

Julia Stiles also returns as Nicki and has a little bit more to do this time, even though it is still a glorified cameo.  For the third Bourne movie, I would like to see Stiles with Matt Damon as possibly a love interest.  It would be a good change of pace for her who is known for teenage dramas and comedies to play more adult roles.

Better or worse,The movie in my opinion has a great feel to anyone who has traveled the world or at least Europe. If you have been to any of these places it gives you more of a realistic feel. Also the manor in which Bourne is shot gives many people the idea that he miscalculated something that he all ready new about or something like that. Because he has so many slip up and does not seem like he knows what he is doing half the time when he does not know why tredestone has been shutdown. Also the idea that there are still memories that he does not remember gives me the feel that the entire first movie was pointless. If he does not know about his past then how can he move forward.The movie seemed to me like it was the Bourne Identity with a bigger budget but the same good ideas and spy feel. It is one of the only movies I know that has done well with a bigger budget and has not lost all the plot in their action sequences. It was a solid movie and I know the Ultimatum will put this up with Indian Jones and Star Wars like other trilogies.,,Anonymous,Mystery

Karl Urban is also a favorite and he was great, too, but much like Clive Owen in the first, it was a very underplayed character. Music was great and effective in sustaining tension and pacing.

A smart action packed thriller,"Can you guess what movie topped the charts as the most rented film of 2003? In the year that brought us such blockbusters as two Matrix sequels, an X-Men and Terminator entry and even a Big Fat Greek Wedding, you may not hit the jackpot if given 10 guesses and a handful of hints. That is because the $121 million domestic grossing Bourne Identity is the answer to the query, and with movies now being able to double and triple their theatrical runs on the small screen, it is no surprise that this week sees Jason Bourne back for another adventure in the Bourne Supremacy.For those of you that require a refresher course before sitting down to new sequential installments, Bourne (Matt Damon) was fished out of the water in the Bourne Identity and struggled through the film to regain his memory whilst dodging deadly assassins through Europe. Bourne would later find out that he was once part of the CIA, but he leaves that world behind and runs to a India with new female companion Marie (Franka Ponete) stating that '..if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast I will bring this fight to your doorstep.' Well, this is the entertainment business and a statement like that can only mean one thing.non-compliance. The Bourne Supremacy picks up with Jason's new life being threatened when he is framed for a murder of two individuals of a CIA covert action 4,000 miles away. The perpetrators of the crime want to kill him to cover their tracks, the CIA wants to kill him because they are convinced he is a loose cannon and Bourne dodges both parties from city to city putting the pieces together to help clear his name and ultimately reveal who the is the wizard behind the curtain. Since it is too easy to compare a sequel to its predecessor, I will follow the rule to a tee and reveal that the second Bourne is better than first.Hats off to new director Paul Greengrass who's only resume green flag was the 2002 documentary Bloody Sunday which chronicled the Irish civil rights protest of 1972. A curious choice then indeed, but now in hindsight, probably the best man for the job. Supremacy flings us through country and city after city with such ferocity that I felt I was reading the bottom left hand side of the screen every five minutes to have revealed the next extravagant location. A director with a flare for documentary film-making knows about pacing and with India, Virginia, Berlin, Munich and Moscow all being thrown at us before we get to the rim of our popcorn bags, the pacing in the hands of simplistic action director may have sunk the film.But even as I give kudos to the man behind the camera it is the action star with the franchise strapped firmly on his back that I have to give the most credit. Matt Damon (Bourne) has left his fellow childhood friend Ben Affleck in his dust with his choice of roles and acting ability and with the Bourne films he is able to pull off a superagent persona that doesn't seem to realize his ability until forced into action. A scene at a Naples airport where Bourne is detained and sits quietly waiting to erupt is a classic example of what we have come to expect from the once covert assassin. He sits without emotion or expression only to in an instant, overpower two guards and download information from a hand-held computer device in what shoots across the screen in about 7 seconds.Also back for a second time are Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) as the CIA director that has more secrets than helpful ideas for the cause, and Nicky (Julia Stiles) a CIA agent profiler that might have a few keys to the locks in Bourne's brain he is so desperately trying to access. Luckily these two characters have significant, but small parts as both actors provided weak performances in an otherwise strong cast. Cox looked tired and delivered his lines like he had a bus to catch which is probably truce since he has participated in no less than 5 movies this year alone (look out Stiller), and Stiles breaking down and crying when confronted with the inquisitive Bourne was hard to believe as a character that responsible the analysis of the mental well-being of other agents. As for action sequences, Supremacy delivers two fold over the original. It's climactic chase scene was incredible in its choreography and you will undoubtedly shake your head wondering at what point did they extract the star and replace him with the stunt actor. Damon looks to be the director's human piñata and the authenticity of seeing broken glass fly into his face as his car skids, smashes and ultimately becomes undriveable makes this one of the best car chase scenes since Ronin.The Bourne Supremacy is more complex than the first and the addition of the Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) character and the complex way to which she is between two agendas trying to find the truth while Bourne both somewhat trusts and uses her to find the truth, is a refreshing way to have a story unfold in a summer of huge explosions and pointless humor. I understand that there are three books in the Robert Ludlum trilogy of Mr. Bourne's adventures and it has been a while since I have looked forward to the hopes of a sequel so quickly after exiting the theatre of the last. But that is exactly what these films have done. We actually care about the hero of the film and we want him to find out more about his past as it sits like a piece of popcorn stuck in our teeth that we want to expose. I look forward to installment three and have already cleared a spot for the DVD box set beside the Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan series on my wall unit. Thumbs way up.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bourne For Success,"The Bourne Supremacy is this summer's perfect companion to Spiderman. It follows the same rules of ordinary person with amazing powers but at the same time, giving this person some emotion such as doubt and fear. Catwoman, released this weekend as well, is like the weaker cousin to these two. It's not that girl power isn't cool but it needs to be treated with the same maturity that the old fashion man gets.Maturity is what sets Bourne aside from his closest comparison. Bond, James Bond. Not that age is the gauge here but Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is more serious and less happy-go-lucky-I-think-I'll-forget-my-mission-and-go-talk-to-this-girl in his manner. Hence the lack of abrupt stops for a half naked woman to coo softly `Oh, Jason' during this film.The emotional tone of this movie is created in a very honest way. If the scene calls for the audience to be on edge, the camera does not dart behind the hero and take him into dark areas where it is hard to see what might jump out next. Cheap sight gags are a dime a dozen in most suspenseful movies and even though Supremacy' is not a suspense driven feature, it comes with its share of uncertainty.Actually, uncertainty is a major tone. It speaks of Bourne's lack of knowledge about himself and his past. The camera takes on a very loose feel during a hand-to-hand combat scene and that puts the audience just far enough out that we can't tell exactly what's happening. It doesn't help that both men look alike and are clothed in all black. We are unaware of how Bourne is faring and that puts us in his mind set. At the same time that we feel this way, however, Damon gives his character an almost unreal sense of knowing everything. Maybe he doesn't know why but he still can figure things out fast and seems to know exactly what to do all the time. He always knows where he is going and what he's going to do when he gets there. He also has this amazing way of knowing what his opponent is going to do.The plot is not over looked in this movie in exchange for high-speed car chases and extensive damage for no reason. Yes, these exist too but not in the same way that they do in movies like Independence day or Minority Report. What drives the plot is the supporting cast actually. Bourne spends a lot of time getting from here to there and occasionally will move the story in a new direction but not as much as his cast mates. The strongly written part (played by Joan Allen) of the CIA member looking for Bourne is aided by the return cast member Julia Stiles showing that she is stronger in supporting than in lead (don't see The Prince and Me). Both women display a strong screen presence and the girl power that Catwoman was trying for. ****/*****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Going to be a great series....,"I won't repeat everything already said plot wise. Matt Damon is excellent, and Joan Allen and Brian Cox give outstanding support. It makes all the difference when you shoot ON LOCATION, not the streets of LA. There is a scene in a Munich apartment for example: It could have been shot anywhere by lazy filmmakers. But the cars on the street are European, the outside of the building is European, the inside of the apartment is European....you get my drift. The Berlin hotel is, well, a BERLIN HOTEL. It really makes all the difference. 2 minor flaws: I agree there is too much hand held camera work that moves around WAY too much. It kind of dilutes the fight scenes. And the relationship of the Russian husband and wife to the other Russian gangsters is a little hazy. Otherwise, this kind of film really shows how sad the whole Bond franchise has become. THIS is how international spy films should be done! Can't wait for the third one.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sequel worth watching,"I'm not a big fan of Hollywood films, particularly sequels, which is probably why I've held off on this series for so long, but continue to be pleasantly surprised by both the intelligence and execution of the ""Bourne"" films. This is less of a sequel and more part two of a complete story. Matt Damon plays a vulnerable Bourne with humanity and empathy, which all lends to the believability of the character. The story is well thought through, leaving none of the gaping holes that are the hallmark of most action films. The dialogue is considered and realistic. It's also refreshing to see women treated as fully drawn characters, rather than pretty props. Worth watching just for the car chase, easily one of the best in film history.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Kept my attention,"I saw this movie early on the first day, and it kept my attention throughout. There are a couple of minor flaws in the movie, but that's negotiable through the twists and turns of this spy movie/psychological thriller. The one time I almost left to go to the bathroom, the credits started to roll. Now that I know what I missed by not seeing the first one, the reason being is because Matt Damon didn't match who I felt was a good choice for Jason Bourne, so I have some catching up to do. The direction was odd in the sense that I felt it needed more in the way of pans and cuts, not bumpy handhelds and short cuts of steadycams. It takes when you think you know about Jason Bourne, answers a few questions, provides some more, and leaves room for the next one. I recommend this as a good date film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Stellar work, all around","I won't bore anyone w/ plot specifics - those are easy enough to find. From a critical perspective, just about everything in this film is top notch. Matt Damon continues his good work from the first film with a restrained but well defined performance as a man skirting the edges of his humanity. The plot forces his character to draw from both his background as a killing machine and his budding life as a (somewhat) everyday Joe. While the former clearly takes precedence, the latter drives Jason Bourne's decisions - and gives the film its emotional core.Joan Allen and Brian Cox do a great job in their strong supporting roles, playing a sort of yin/yang of modern vs. old school CIA. Effective in smaller roles are Franka Potente, Julia Stiles and Karl Urban, who plays Bourne's Soviet superagent equal. The writing is effective - everything is quick and to the point - no wasted air here.As for technical work - the stunts could not have been better. The film culminates in one of the best chase scenes put to film. The photography is gritty, helped certainly by the harsh whites of the overcast sky throughout the Europe depicted in the film. The direction seems to have received a lot of space in reviews. I think Paul Greengrass has a fantastic idea in trying to engage the audience through Jason Bourne's eyes. It's an absolutely visceral experience, and while Greengrass does go a bit overboard with the camera movement and editing, the pace of the film is resultantly so frenetic that one almost leaves the film breathless. Many people will have a difficult time with the style - I applaud the effort and while a few more establishing shots would've been nice, I think the general effect was successful. Go in warned, however - this is not one to experience from the first 5 rows.While The Bourne Identity had a freshness and gee whiz quality to it, this second installment takes a darker, more brutal path. This film doesn't have a lot of underlying happiness. Still, what emotion it does contain is well placed. All around, a very satisfying thriller. Kudos to the filmmakers for pulling off what I believe is a better 2nd chapter in the Bourne trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Yes, they should have left him alone!","Jerky camera movements to create a false sense of urgency may fool you into believing, for a moment, that there is something about this movie that isn't completely predictable.  That feeling won't last long, as you realize you know every single thing that is going to happen, and that you know it within the first 30 minutes.  There is one brief exception, with the death of a minor character, but even that is foreshadowed a few minutes before it happens.They did cut the trailers so that the death of someone I considered to be a highlight of the first movie is not known before you see the movie, but, again, it's obvious that it will happen very soon after the movie starts.Good action, great direction and set design.  Too bad the plot couldn't be more original.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great movie, but camera too jerky/choppy during action sequences","This movie was a great continuation from the first movie. Good story, acting, and a lot was accomplished in 1hr, 48 minutes(run time). It always kept my attention. The only problem I had was the choppy, jerky camera work during the action sequences. The example I will use is the fight in the home of the other agent Bourne worked with. The fight was intense, and well done, but it was extremely hard to see exactly what happened during it. I know that the point to make the camera work chaotic during a fight is took make it look realistic(like the viewer is actually in the fight), but the whole point of WATCHING a movie is for the audience to easily SEE what the director created. Watching the movie shouldn't require work. The sequence in ""Bourne Identity"" in Bourne's apartment with the blonde-haired assassin was one of the best fight sequences I have ever seen. Every motion was fluid and well displayed for the audience, while keeping the fight intense. In my opinion, it's OK to sacrifice some realism for the sake of the audience being able to see the fight more easily. Other than that, the movie was great. Without the jerky camera movement, this movie would be a 10 out of 10. Go see it if you haven't!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good sequel, but flawed.","Much like The Bourne Identity before it, this movie is a decent action movie with great locations, competent acting, and wonderful atmosphere. Very loosely based on the novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Supremacy skips much of the source material to deliver a trim and well-paced spy thriller. Since there is a third book, one might reasonably expect to see Matt Damon starring in The Bourne Ultimatum before long.If anyone here has read the excellent Ludlum novels, you might be disappointed to find that many aspects of the character of Jason Bourne are completely absent from the movies. Still they both work in their own right as action films. My only real complaint with the movie is the shaky camera that others have mentioned. It really does make some of the action scenes totally incoherent. What ever happened to actually choreographing a fight or a chase scene?As a side note, given the amount of screen time she gets, on wonders why Julia Stiles even signed on for this trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"9/10 Refreshing, smart, some tight dialog, shaky camera gets a bit old, but I loved this movie!","No spoilers here.I've waited years for this movie.  Finally, a picture that captures action in a more realistic way than we normally see. I ignore most action-genre donuts. (Fatty with an empty heart.)I didn't see Bourne Identity, so I can't compare this with that.Acting: Really good. Appropriate casting, nice to see Brian Cox and Franka Potente involved in this film. Yes, I threw that in just to feel worldly. I confess.Plot: It's a fine plot, nothing really wrong, though I do question a few things that I won't mention here. Don't worry, it's small stuff.Script: I liked the script. This movie gives you some fresh dialog in places where other movies give bloated, cheesy, wordy goo. I wish there was more original material, but that's ok.Cinematography: The camera work was a bit of an issue for me. In some parts of the film it worked very well giving the viewer a sense of motion and speed and a feeling of loss of control, loss of spacial awareness. In other cases, it was obvious that the operator was shaking the camera like a baby's rattle. Hey, it worked for Blair Witch Project, mostly, and it works here, mostly.Techy stuff: Ok, I somehow managed to ignore most of the high technology presented in the film, so they must have done a better job than most films. So, thumbs up for technical presentation I guess.You know what I mean: a typical 'movie' computer makes about 20 unique noises per minute, processing, downloading, uploading, thinking, burping. Imagine sitting at the terminal for 8 hours hearing bleeps, bloops, swishes, dings, and blips. Now add that to all the other computers around you. Yeah, somehow most directors think we're stupid. Considering that many of us use computers daily, and those computers make no noise at all, it's surprising. Why can't they use a more realistic set of sounds, like a person saying ""C'mon process my stupid request for crying out loud!"" while the computer SILENTLY does its work. Or someone telling a stupid joke, or nervously tapping a pencil. Oh, and don't get me started about fancy red blinking ACCESS DENIED windows. Oh man. But I digress.Overall, this is a refreshing intrigue/drama/action movie. If going to see an action film makes you feel dirty, rest assured, you will feel squeaky clean after this one.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Low Key Espionage, High Intensity Film","Having not seen The Bourne Identity, I entered the theatre to view its sequel with some trepidation.  I knew the basics of the series, and the second film reintroduces the key plot information succintly. The plot of The Bourne Supremacy is deceptively simple, although it appears muddled at times during the film.  I'm told that the plot of the movie has little relation to Robert Ludlum's book of the same name, but that doesn't matter to me as I have not read the book. Matt Damon is quite effective as Jason Bourne/David Webb, and his low key portrayal sets him apart from flashier spies.  The other key performances are from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, both of whom are very good.  Julia Stiles has a small role as well, although I'm ambivalent about her as an actress. My main complaint relates to director Paul Greenglass, whose hyperkinetic editing combines with the heavy use of handheld cameras to make the film jarringly difficult to watch at times.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Successful Sequel That Isn't Great But Better Than The First *** out of ****,"The sequel to The Bourne Identity this well done film beats the first but neither film is my idea of a Masterpiece action film.

The only real problem it has is the plot drags in the middle and the shaky and choppy editing is a little overwhelming in moments (sometimes it's hard to tell what is going on). It's a good movie but its not really my type of movie but many, many people would love it.

Great Spy Movie,"I saw this movie at an early premiere last Wednesday and was blown away. Ifonly James Bond movies kicked this kind of butt. Not the greatest spy movie of all time, but riveting and compelling the entire time. Matt Damon has againproven his ability to carry a movie and he makes a great action star. There is a car chase scene in this movie that is worth seeing on the big screen. My only complaint is the over-use of camera-shaking during the fist-fight scenes. What a distraction...otherwise a solid action film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No need to see 'Identity' after realizing 'Supremacy' of second...,"""The Bourne Supremacy"" is an action packed thrill ride and spy flick all wrapped around a simple, confused, amnesia-stricken man trying to find his way in the world while dodging fellow assassins, CIA officials and his framed crimes...Now, I decided to give this film a hesitant 9/10 instead of an 8...here's why it received a 9...and why it was a hesitant 9.Matt Damon reprises his role as the former-CIA-employed assassin, Jason Bourne.  Bourne is still searching for justification to his thoughts and visions while still trying to cope with the realizations of what they might mean.  Damon himself is very good as Bourne, a nice increase from his part in 'Identity', although he was good in that as well.  There are moments when Bourne must rely on his primal instincts on the spot to find out just what he is going to do next and how he is going to stay that instrumental step ahead of his followers.  In these moments, Damon really shines brightly as the deeply methodical and deadly Bourne.  The rest of the cast does very well at keeping up with Damon's fast paced but disturbed performance.  Most noteworthy is Simon Cox as Ward Abbot.  The great thing about Cox's character is that you never really know whether or not he is trying to defend Bourne...trying to kill Bourne...or trying to defend Bourne in order to defend himself.It is this kind of shenanegan that brings ""Supremacy"" its greatest triumph. Most of the events that occur within the timeline of the film are somewhat routine and have been done in other films to a certain extent, but the great characterization that follows the preferably-action-before-words Bourne and the intertwining, ever escalating plot keeps each event fresh and gives it that nice boost of energy and charisma that this movie really deserves. ""Supremacy"" is so good at keeping the audience in tact and allowing them to attempt to figure the events, the plot and the characters out before it is finally revealed to the audience that I did not lose interest in this film once during its entire duration...a whopping one hour and fifty-five minutes.One thing that I really liked and enjoyed realizing was the shaky camera movements whenever Jason Bourne was in a shot.  It represents just how unstable his life and mind have become, and especially how unstable Bourne is during this phase of his life.  Bourne himself is not a borderline psychotic, but doesn't reserve himself from punching down a field officer if he has to.  Bourne is deeply methodical and I really found it intriguing that he can pull himself away from his own delusions and memories to focus on the moment.  It shows just how smart and cunning Jason Bourne is.Another great thing is the pacing of this film.  Even in its slow moments, ""Supremacy"" is wonderfully fast-paced.  It is a very quickly-paced film, but the audience has no need to struggle in keeping up with it...masterful pacing to say the least.  The action sequences are dazzlingly fast and work superbly well, although there is a fight scene that gets a little too caught up in its own momentum and the audience does lose track of exactly who has the knife, who just got poked in the eye...that sort of thing.  In truth, however, that pace and uncertainty about it adds to the suspense of it all.Now, for what is bad about ""Supremacy"", and I must say, there isn't much. The characters outside of Bourne and the three main supporters aren't exceptionally deep, and the audience has to rely on not much more than the actor's faces to keep them separated.  Some of Bourne's visions are so fast that many of the audience members digging through popcorn bags will miss anything important shown in them...the visions are supposed to be fast, but lets keep the demographic in mind, here, shall we?  As mentioned earlier...the fight scene that moves exceptionally quickly is hard to follow...yes, the winner is determined after a few moments so there is no reason to panic, but it still brings nostalgia of those old Godzilla films where the two monsters clashed so close to the screen that the viewer couldn't make out just what was going on.All in all, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is well worth viewing for a measly eight dollars.  A nice step up from the original where the entire film is a giant chase and the audience gets a real sense of being paranoid and being on their toes.  Again, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sequelitis,"The Bourne Identity is a very good film. Its realistic action was given depth by the relationship of Jason and Marie.This vitality is missing from the mediocre sequel, The Bourne Supremacy, in large part because Marie's appearance in this sequel is just a brief cameo with no depth, and which would have no meaning apart from her central role in the first Bourne movie. Franka Potente still gets top billing in the credits, even though her screen time in Supremacy is barely a couple of minutes.Moreover, the conflict of Bourne vs Conklin vs Ward Abbott in the first movie gives both energy and plausibility to the action. Ward Abbott alone is not an interesting or energetic enough adversary to build this sequel upon, and the addition of Kirill does not add much, since he has no more depth than the disposable Treadstoners of the first film -- just more screen time than they had. Pamela Landy might have been an interesting antagonist turned protagonist, but her character does not evolve over the course of the movie, even when she changes her mind about Bourne, and neither for that matter does Bourne's character, nor anyone else's.Many reviewers, even some halfway intelligent ones, rated this Bourne sequel higher than the first film. Are their standards really that low?I've tried to apportion the blame for the sequelitis suffered by this film, but with limited success.Maybe it's fault of the original novels, but I haven't read them. The story of Bourne Supremacy is certainly weaker than that of Bourne Identity. It is merely episodic, rather than following a true story arc. Its arc is so low that even a really talented director would have trouble Limbo-ing under it. Various things happen in sequence, but none of them really matters, or changes anything. The movie ends with yet another sequel hook. Sigh...Doug Liman did a much better job directing Identity than Paul Greengrass did with Supremacy. Even though I detest Liman's movie, Swingers, he does have what it takes for cinematic greatness. Greengrass, on the other hand, seems to be a journeyman second-unit director who has over-reached himself. Greengrass's disjointed car chase in Moscow is a weak shadow of Liman's brilliantly choreographed turn in Paris.The cinematography of The Bourne Supremacy is downright bad. Greengrass's odd trick of constantly jerking the camera to agitate the action is annoying after the first 10 seconds, and painful to watch thereafter. It was a bad idea, badly executed -- or maybe it was merely the vacuum resulting from a lack of good ideas.Bourne Identity: 8+/10Bourne Supremacy: 6-/10I wish I had never seen Bourne Supremacy, because it has cheapened Bourne Identity for me.

"The Rock, Vin Diesel, Arnold Schwarzenegger take heed...","The Bourne Supremacy is everything an action-packed, gadget-filled, butt-kicking action film should be. The story is superb... maybe even better than the original, the action is intense, and the pacing is quick. There's never a dull moment. 'Supremacy' is smart, quick, and exciting. All those Arnold Schwarzenegger, Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), James Bond vehicles should be ashamed of themselves.Matt Damon returns as infinitely-more-compelling-than-James-Bond super spy Jason Bourne. Set two years after 'Identity', Bourne is forced out of hiding to once again protect himself and Marie from shadowy bureaucrats and possibly Bourne's own shadowy past. 'Supremacy' is grittier, darker, more suspenseful than 'Identity'. Bourne seems more desperate and has more difficulty eluding his would-be captors, and the film is better for it.The one problem I have with the film, and it seems I'm not alone on this, is that the hand-held camera work is atrocious. Thankfully most of the camera work is steady, but some of the more action-filled scenes shake uncontrollably. So much so that it's hard to focus on what's happening. This prevents me from giving an otherwise flawless action flick a perfect score.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The down time worked well with the more intense sections. The suprm.'s constant camera movement and action had me wishing for the remote.

What movie are all of you watching?,"So, here's the thing. If you don't give one damn about any character, how can you care how a movie turns out.I was watching this movie, and it was serviceable enough, but I ended up not finishing because I just didn't care who was doing what.Jerky camera work feels dated for such a new film, and there are a lot of stupid holes that make you doubt too many people in this thriller are really master spies or assassins, at least in the way we have come to understand them through other movies.And, for those who like Ludlum books, don't waste your time. I only read Identity, and they changed that horribly so that the USA looks like the bad guy (not really the case in the books). This movie seemed to do the same for the hour I watched.Ludlum is likely spinning in his grave, which explains the timing of these films. He died in 2001, and these two films are 2002 and 2005 because they couldn't have gotten away with usurping Jason Bourne in this way were he still alive.

More good fun from this franchise with a new director,"Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels are a great basis for a movie franchise. Their hero has lost his memory. He has lost touch with the Who, the Why and the What of his life. Only the Hows of his training as an espionage enforcer remain with him as root instincts -- all the quicksilver alertness and killing and breaking-and-entering and language skills. This means you have a neutral action star. You can make up the plot as you go along. And since he's still in the process of finding out ""the Bourne identity,"" character development is optional and flexible. And in Matt Damon the franchise has found a rugged young star with the quality of energy, physicality, and neediness such an emptied-out individual might have.In fact character development in ""Bourne Supremacy"" is minimal and limited to recognizing faces and voices. Not a warm and fuzzy individual, our Jason. He'd as soon garrote you as kiss you, be you man or woman, and he may do both in the space of few minutes. In Bourne 1 (AKA ""The Bourne Identity,"" directed for maximum fun by ""Swingers'"" Doug Liman), Jason bonded with a woman he needed as a partner, Marie (Franka Potente), who was very nearly a match for him. But this time he's forced, early on, to let her drown in a chase, and though he attempts mouth-to-mouth underwater and sheds a brief tear or two later, he pushes her off into the deep without hesitation. End of relationship. There is no other, except for the telephonic one with his wouldbe nemesis, CIA officer Pamela Landy (Pat Nixon look-alike Joan Allen, not a romantic possibility).Bourne's idea of fair play in ""Supremacy"" is to go out of his way to tell a young woman he's killed her parents so she knows one didn't kill the other as it was made to look.The plot is not minimal. It has its intricacies, but we need not go into them here, and to do so would spoil the suspense. The mystery of why Bourne has done the past killing in Berlin that he's now investigating, and why part of Langley is trying to kill him again and the other part is trying to bring him in to find out the secrets behind the ""Treadstone"" assassination team and ""tie it off"" is the motor behind the action.The film was directed by Paul Greenglass, who made the excellent 2002 pseudo-documentary ""Bloody Sunday,"" about the quelled Irish uprising of 1972. His taste for vérité effects has led him to adopt a jumpy camera style with many zooms and closeups, which the editors augment with accelerated cutting. A warning for Bourne 2 users: prepare for nausea. Consider bringing Dramamine for the jumpy camera and jerky cutting. A lot of it really is a blur. If you are to enjoy the film, best to let it wash over you. Think of it as an art film. Imagine you're watching a video at MoCA or MoMA or Tate Modern. It's more a sound and light show than a traditional spy thriller. Greengrass's desire to achieve an original look and feel may have gotten away from him.Nonetheless it has many of the trappings. Like other recent efforts, you get scenes of mission control -- CIA HQ in Langley, Virginia, known affectionately as ""Langley."" Pamela Landy's effort to unearth Jason Bourne and figure out why he was ""killed"" are no fun for CIA old timer Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), who has a secret he doesn't want let out. So there's intrigue on the ""good side."" In fact as in the novels of John Le Carré it's not at all clear what the ""good side"" is.As in any good espionage thriller much of the fun of the Bourne movies is the locations, which range from a hot humid opening scene in Goa to a climax in the big bare snowy spaces of Moscow, with exotic travel spots like Morocco, Berlin, Amsterdam and Naples in between, not to mention Langley. And despite the lack of Bond-esquire seductions, there's the sexy former cohort of Jason, Nicky (Julia Stiles); and fleetingly, the cool Franka Potente.The charm of these movies is that you enter a room fully expecting a karate fight with broken glass, plastic handcuffs, and packets of neatly printed new fake movie-money American dollars flying about. Everybody has a minimum of five or ten alternate passports and identities near at hand. What a travel fantasy! With a ""go"" from Langley, you're off across the globe not only with the trip all paid for but a new moniker and an exciting mission. And all this is so far from any conceivable reality, espionage or other, that despite the speed and violence, it becomes surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable to watch.The difficulty of the style Greenglass has heightened, in which the first fifteen minutes contain a mood of panic and everything is edited in two-second cuts, is that it's hard to amp up the excitement  which is what any thriller is about (if nothing else)  and what you get is really increasingly eye-boggling. There are different ways of outdoing yourself. You could become wittier and sexier. Or you could just become faster, which is pretty much what ""The Bourne Supremacy"" opts for. The result is that the first quarter hour is just as good as the last, perhaps better, since it had all the potential, and much of the authentic non-digitalized physical action is wasted, because you can't really make it out till you get a DVD and run it frame-by-frame or in slo-mo. But still you've got fun on screen, and something a lot better than the average auctioneer with nothing better to offer than buxom babes, loud crashes, and Vin Diesel.(Originally seen in a theater August 2004.)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Top-notch thriller, with Jason Bourne on the run","As a follow-up to the excellent ""The Bourne Identity,"" we have ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" with Matt Damon reprising the role of ex-government assassin Jason Bourne. This time, two years later, Bourne, suffering from amnesia, is trying to find out who first tried to murder him and succeeded only in killing his girlfriend, and who then framed him for murder by placing his fingerprint at the scene of a CIA operation gone bad.This is a dizzying movie - literally, as the camera never seems to stop moving. What elevated ""The Bourne Identity"" was its ability to surprise and shock the audience by a sudden turn of events in a scene -""The Bourne Supremacy"" retains that with heart-stopping effect. As Bourne investigates his old group, his memory comes back to him in spurts, sometimes at inopportune moments, but he still proves he's sharp at the game. Somehow we're drawn into Bourne's paranoia and feel it ourselves - this is particularly true in the hotel scene. The long subway station scene, as he leaps from track to track, is great. The viewer also gets to see a lot of Berlin during the movie.Matt Damon is fantastic as Jason Bourne, a confused man who possesses visceral killer and survival instincts. Joan Allen is excellent as the director of the blown operation who believes Bourne is responsible. All the performances are, in fact, top drawer.Directed at a brisk pace by Paul Greengrass, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a superior example of the spy thriller genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid sequel that adds depth to the title character,"The Bourne Identity showed a man on the run from an enemy he couldn't identify. It showed what that man was capable of when pressed, and the lengths he would go to for survival. It was interesting stuff, and Matt Damon played it beautifully. You got the sense that a very dangerous man was hidden behind that stony mask, though you only caught glimpses of it when things went sour.This time out, we get to see what Bourne is capable of when he's just plain p****d off. Here is a character much more parallel to the one presented in the novels, a much more ruthless and imposing figure who will stop at nothing to accomplish an objective. This is Bourne as he should be: a very dangerous man indeed.That's not to say that the sequel is better than the original. In fact, in most ways it's a tie. Excellent fight choreography (though we don't get to see much of it in this film), incredible car chases, and bits of edge-of-the-seat suspense are showcased in both. Personally, I give The Bourne Identity a slight edge thanks to the freshness of the storyline and the more coherent action sequences.An 8 out of 10 movie that I give a 7 because of the much overused ""frantic"" fight scenes.Note to Hollywood: stop filming hand-to-hand fights by hanging a camcorder between the two combatants to make us feel like we are actually there. It's a movie. Let us watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Follow-Up,"The Bourne Supremacy is an excellent sequel that is as good as the original. Mat Damon delivers an excellent performance and plays his role well. The other actors and actresses deliver good and excellent performances and also play their characters well.The only complaints about this movie are about the director Paul Greengrass(who I've never heard of until I saw this movie). Greengrass has done something drastically different than other directors-he used a hand-help camera for the majority of the scenes.Although sometimes confusing they do add a thrilling and entertaining element to the film. However the hand help camera I admit was a little over-used. This film isn't suited for people who get motion sickness frequently and this accounts for most of the negative reviews.This movie is really special because it is as good as the original (which most sequels don't even come close to the original). This movie includes a lot of thrilling, action-packed scenes equal to the original. I definitely recommend this to anyone he liked The Bourne Identity.My Rating: 9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Director Paul Greengrass (United 93) can build excitement like no other.The one disappointment I have is that we will no longer get to see Franka Potente.

"Bourne develops ""supreme"" status in strong second installment","If you need proof that an action super spy franchise can handle a through plot line/sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is it. It is a very true follow-up to 2002's ""Bourne Identity."" There is no re-imagining done by new director Paul Greengrass. In fact, he makes Bourne even better. The action is grittier and more realistic and the pacing just as intense and engaging despite a story that is a little more complex, being more wrapped up in Bourne's past than the first installment.At the beginning of the film, Bourne (Damon) is in India with his love interest Marie (Potente), thinking that the CIA program Treadstone that turned him into a super-assassin is officially old business and going to let him be. Well, they don't. In addition to someone coming to kill him, It turns out Bourne is set up for destroying a separate CIA operation in Berlin, so once again he's a wanted man. This time, the casting directors throw in another gem in Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, who heads up this mission to find Bourne. She's joined again by Brian Cox as Abbott, presumably the only person in the CIA left who knows anything about Treadstone. Julia Stiles also reprises her role in the film.Bourne is motivated by anger and the drive to figure out more of his past (due to the amnesia he suffered at the beginning of ""Identity""). He has fuzzy flashbacks that allude to his very first mission as an assassin. Of course it takes him all over the world and he's chased by police in about 3 different countries. ""Supermacy"" is loaded with car chases as its primary action sequences, all of which are done in style by Greengrass, who took the director's chair from Doug Liman, who moved to producer for this film. Greengrass uses a lot more cuts and hand-held camera-work to up the intensity of the scenes.The film really works as both a sequel and its own plot. Knowledge of ""Identity"" is only necessary in this film if you want a better understanding of Bourne's character and parts of his motivation. It certainly does make ""Supremacy"" better but isn't a must to enjoy and understand the film as well as how awesome of a protagonist Jason Bourne is. Tony Gilroy, who worked on the ""Identity"" screenplay, makes sure this story functions on all these levels. Damon also continues to give a performance that capture's Bourne's fragility despite his stone-cold action persona.While it's more of a continuation, another episode in the Bourne journey, it really does function well as a whole, stopping you from demanding more answers about Bourne's past. It also shows that clearly Bourne is the dominant movie action hero of the decade",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great story, great scenes, and then a f.... up camera! :-(Paul Greengrass must have been inspired by the danish dogme-directors or something, since almost every shot was made by a guy running along Daemon with a hand-held camera. The result being brilliant action scenes, where you spent most of the time trying to get a bearing instead of enjoying the filming.I would wish for two version DVD-edition of this movies: one with the dogme-camera and one without.

Bourne betrayed by the camera ...,"I was one of the many that immensely enjoyed the first Bourne and had been expecting to see this one for months.One of the things that made the first one so successful was the obvious pleasure the director had to shoot in all these nice locations in Europe. Although the locations are still quite exciting, the splendid cinematography has been replaced by a grim and dull photography.The major low point of the movie though is the shooting of the actions scenes, and there are many. The use of the hand-held camera and excessive close ups is used to the point of nauseating the audience. There is no way you want to watch a fight or car chase like that again. Too bad for the cast - especially Matt Damon and Joan Allen - who give an impressive performance. The music is also good and helps keep a rhythm and interest, although the story line and character development are quite thin compared to the original.Overall quite a disappointment.

Apoplectic Cutting Dull Film,"The first Jason Bourne film, The Bourne Identity, created a whole new style to making action movies. The rapid cutting and ultra fast pace set a new standard that all films since have imitated-including it's own sequel.

Yet for all of its apoplectic style, The Bourne Supremacy is a dull film that only progresses before your eyes while your emotions are left to stagnate.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Directors with Amnesia,"I'm not sure the Bourne Supremacy is a sequel so much as it is a reworking of the scope of the Bourne movies. The Bourne Identity was a white shirt of a film  it was a sleek, styled film that made it's metal on intelligent choices, disciplined acting, great chemistry, a streamlined script and clean, flawless direction. The Bourne Supremacy is not. In the Bourne Supremacy, you get bold almost reckless decisions, bullheaded direction, and a crash bang approach to storytelling and action.From the first moment of the film to the last, it's about movement. The handheld camera work abounds, as well as the whip crack editing and pulsing background score (and it's a great score). The characters are fast-moving, quickly figuring out their next move and acting on it. The plot has been trimmed down to accommodate the action, which you'll barely notice considering how the movie barely pauses to let you think. And when the pauses do come, they are filled with an emotional backbone so raw that you wonder what is going to happen when it all stops rather than what just happened.You have to know what you're getting into to enjoy it.Things you should know  if you're looking for accuracy to the books and you're going to judge the film on it's accuracy, you will not like this movie. Matt Damon carries the film with an acute sense of the responsibility to do just that he doesn't drop the ball once. If you can't make out every detail of the film or every detail of the story, it's okay, you're not the only one  same thing with feeling slightly woozy. There's less hand to hand but a great car chase scene, one that belongs in the category of films like The French Connection' and The Blues Brothers.' 	 In my mind, Identity still is a better film (and I recommend watching it before you see this movie) if only for the fact that it didn't let the action get in the way of the relationships, the locations, and the characters. This movie is completely about the action. You have to want to see the emotional undercurrent or even the locations to get them.Even so, this film is a head above its genre companions and its sequel companions. I recommend seeing this in the theatre if only for the car chase and to hear the score on THX.  (7/10: Supremacy, 8/10: Identity)",,Anonymous,Mystery
Nowhere near as good as the original,"Honestly, while I enjoyed this movie because it's Bourne, it actually felt like an excuse to bring Bourne back. I know there are several books, but the ending to the original felt like that's where they should have left it.
The movie's good, and I think there may be some small contradictions to the first, I think (could be wrong, though). The acting is great - Damon is excellent, as per usual. Some surprising twists and turns.

""" When two tigers meet with the intention to kill, the outcome is murderously obvious ""","If you are intrigue with the Bourne series as millions of others, this follow-up is not to be missed. The story is called "" The Bourne Supremacy."" Jason and his girl Marie (Franka Potente) are hiding peacefully from the CIA and the infamous 'Treadstone' project which originally trained and left him emotionally scarred. Unfortunately, the company has returned to permanently remove him from its list of operatives and blame him for a secret cover-up begun by Ward Abbott (Brian Cox). To insure his death, Abbott uses an experienced Russian Assassin called Kirill (Karl Urban). Believing he has killed Bourne, Kirill informs his superiors of success. Instead he mistakenly murdered Marie, which infuriates Bourne and causes him to launch a most volcanic response. Realizing he is marked for death by the C.I.A. he uses his considerable experience and soon tracks down the woman in charge. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is soon in the cross-hairs of Bourne's rifle and wants an explanation. She too is unaware of what is taking place within her agency, but seek to capture Bourne to answer conflicting questions. At the same time, the agency, Abbotts' men and hundreds of police are seeking to kill him. The result is perhaps the most dramatic, exciting and certainly the most action-packed film of all. What can only be described as a fast paced search and destroy spy thriller on steroids is the essence of this movie. Highly charged and fully packed with speedy car chases, physical confrontations and cat and mouse intrigue, this film leaves little to be disappointed with. Added to it are emotional segments which reveal Bourne's nightmarish memories and his quest to learn who and what he has become. Easilly recommended to anyone seeking an exciting sequel to his previous film. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bourne Supremacy,"At the end, Tony Gilroy's ham-fisted screenplay ponderously verbalizes what Matt Damon's sensitive performance has already conveyed throughout--that for what it's worth, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is about guilt and atonement. Until that point, though, it's director Paul Greengrass' thrill ride, pure and simple, and it really is a rush, with a story told through hand-held cameras (the director of photography is Oliver Wood) and editing (by Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse), both effective enough to deflect the violence that concludes many of the set pieces. Damon is perfectly cast as the amnesiac Bourne, who struggles to find his reality while methodically resetting the world around him with laser focus.

Bourne's Back in Business,"Bourne is back.Jason Bourne, contentedly hiding out with his girl (again played by Franka Potente), dives back into action when a hit-man comes calling. Turns out Bourne has been framed in the killing of two CIA operatives, and getting rid of him would mean the CIA would be left with no suspects. But of course Bourne can't be brought down by a mere assassin, and the rest of the movie is another virtually non-stop string of action set pieces, culminating in perhaps the most amazing car chase sequence I've ever seen.Director Paul Greengrass could film a bar mitzvah and make it exciting -- his films are edited to within an inch of their lives, but somehow his herky-jerky camera-work and lightspeed cutting never become distracting, as they would in the hands of someone else. He has a nearly genius ability to choreograph action so that we're always seeing whatever we need to see when we need to see it, despite whatever else is going on at the same time. The Bourne movies maybe aren't lasting masterpieces, but they're small classics in their genre.Since Chris Cooper copped out at the end of the last one, Joan Allen steps in as the lead CIA agent on Bourne's trail, and she does a good job of looking hot and pensive at the same time.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good direction brought down by the script,"It can be a little frustrating seeing a ""spy plot"" unravel to the point where you realize there wasn't much of anything there at the center of it. It's especially frustrating when the ending comes with 20 minutes to go, and you don't even really feel the need to see what happens afterwards. Luckily, this film has a tremendous amount of visual style, and it's almost surprising to me that this was enough to make me enjoy the film, as I'm not always a big fan of the ""handheld camera"" thing when it comes to action films. In this case, however, the jolting camera was an important part of the action and of the character, such as it was. I think ultimately, this is a very forced sequel that doesn't justify its undoing of the last film's ending (while also relying too much on the audience's knowledge of its predecessor). Most of all, though, I think it's a pretty clear case of a good director, Paul Greengrass, having been saddled with a half-assed script.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Bourne franchise stays strong,"The Bourne Supremacy continues where it left off from the innovative first instalment and maintains the same high quality for the action thriller fan.Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne, on the run from the US government after successfully escaping from his role as a highly classified assassination and covert operations team member. The second instalment sees him tracked down and implicated in the murders of some US undercover operatives.This is a very good movie and is close to maintaining the very high standards of the first. We get excellent action scenes played out without CGI as well as some of the best car chases put to film. We can moan about the 'shaky cam' method of filming, using fast cuts and non-stabilised cameras (this is personal preference), but you can argue it gives a frenetic and realistic feel and adds intensity to the fight scenes.Supremacy continues the character driven action thriller theme and never relies solely on the action giving us plenty to think on and work out as would a conventional thriller. Of particular note is the scene where he plots his own capture and reverse tracks who is tracking him from the US government, resulting in a nice one liner at the scene conclusion, letting the viewer know who is really in charge.Very good sequel. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Intelligent, well-crafted, and very satisfying","It's a joy to see a film which is not only intelligently directed but which assumes a certain level of intelligence - and sophistication - on the part of the viewer. From direction to camera work, art direction to editing, dialogue to music, the film is clever, but never self-consciously so. Yet, while it feels like the product of 'today's' film making - a film that any 'art film' maker should be proud to have made - it also tells a fast paced 'spy-versus-spy-versus-spy' story very well.Matt Damon's performance is compelling. He draws us into Bourne's predicament so that what happens to him at any moment is more important than figuring out the twists. I caught on half way what the main twist was, but that was irrelevant because of the way I was gripped by how the story unfolded.As someone who loves traveling and getting seeped in the flavour of each place I visit, I loved the choice of locations within each city and the way they conveyed subliminally where we were and what that place was about - and how that affected the story. I loved, too, the fact that while Matt Damon's character spoke several languages well, the local people he spoke to still knew him for an American.Most of all I found myself really caring about Bourne as a person and enjoyed the slow, thoughtful process of his self-discovery within the mayhem of the several exciting car chases and near escapes that keep the plot moving fast.Truly a film that 'entertains', i.e. takes a hold of you - and leaves you feeling very satisfied.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Too much razzle dazzle,"While The Bourne Identity was a classy, intelligent thriller, this sequel abandons much of the original's captivating elements and replaces them with a sensory blur.

One has to look no further than the five-minute or so car chase scene to realize that this movie didn't have enough depth to follow the original on its story-telling merits. On a positive note, Matt Damon again turns in an excellent performance as Jason Bourne. Joan Allen also does well in her role as a CIA big shot.

"Solid sequel, but did it HAVE to be shot in Shakyscope?","I can unquestionably say that by its end I had thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to (the better) ""The Bourne Identity"". But there were two factors that almost RUINED the movie for me (and they have been justifiably discussed below): the CONSTANTLY moving camera and the too-fast editing during action scenes. What was the director/editor thinking? ""Hey, if it works for Bruckheimer, it'll work for us!""? Did they ever stop to realize these are the two reasons why most of Bruckheimer's movies are AWFUL?! Even during scenes in ""Supremacy"" where two characters were absolutely motionless and merely having a conversation, the camera still meandered around the room, never stopping to register on a subtle expression here and there or on people's eyes. How was this ill-conceived ""technique"" ever born (no pun intended)? What moron ever thought for a moment that constantly moving the camera was a good idea? Were they afraid that audiences today had grown so jaded with time-tested cinematic grammar that they would flee movie theaters in droves? Hand-held camera work is fine for documentaries, out of necessity. But when it is so over-utilized in a theatrical film, it just translates to one thing and one thing only: the director has NO FAITH in the material. Did Greengrass never look at ""Bourne Identity"" to see how beautifully constructed it was?The action scenes in ""Supremacy"" were a joke. When will filmmakers understand that when said scenes are so chaotically edited together (see ""The Transporter"" as an example), the viewer's brain literally ""disconnects"" from the action; because there is too much information in too short a time to analyze adequately, it is impossible for the average film-goer to cognate and construct a linear visual narrative in their head. Consequently, the mind simply...gives up. The fight scene in the small apartment is a perfect example: all I could see were just two black blurs being tossed around for three minutes. Was I ever in the moment? No. Was I engaged? No. Was I empathetic to the hero? Uh...which one is the hero, I can't tell? I found myself actually looking away from the screen, I was so disinterested (more involuntarily than voluntarily).Whoever directs the next sequel, and I certainly hope it is NOT Greengrass, please do the following: learn as much as you can from Liman's success and Greengrass' blunders before you proceed.

"Good, But Could've Been Better!","I bought this movie the other day because I heard it was good and I wanted to see it. I was mostly pleased at the film but there were a few bumpy spots. Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne. Bourne was staying low-life until his wife Marie was killed. He returns to the assassin he used to be and while evading the CIA, he must track the Russians who killed Marie. The story was great and the actors did a great job acting. Julia Stiles and Brian Cox really supported Damon's great acting. The action was just non-stop and plainly high-paced. I also liked the nice European scenery. The first problem was that the beginning part of the film moved a bit slow, but the action camera little after. The second and the worst problem is the camera work. The camera was just very shaky and many people suffered from headaches. Myself, I suffered a slight headache. Otherwise, the film is good. I rate this film a 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
impressive espionage thriller,"Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel. Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program. Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As ""The Bourne Supremacy"" opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a ""normal"" life for himself and his girlfriend. But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him. As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents. Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter. Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrement's for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story's core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life. Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence. Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout. He uses a hand-held camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view inter cut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories. In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward. Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed. On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching. In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very weak. A major disappointment,"I'm amazed that this film rates so well here. The re-make of 'The Bourne Identity' (which I actually only watched for the first time two days before this movie) was a decent thriller. This was a hopelessly weak, half-hearted, over-stylised and predictable bore of a movie.The signs were there early on, when Jason reacts to a traumatic event with barely any emotion (nor at any time later in the movie). Events happen rapidly and confusingly, a blonde woman who talks very quickly is assigned to the case by the CIA, Bourne runs about the place using different passports, there are car chases. There is more editing in this film than in an Oliver Stone film on picture search. Honestly, there are fight sequences in which the shot changes so fast, so often, that you can't even work out who is hitting who. I actually sat down at one action sequence in the film and tried to time a camera shot that lasted for more than a second, and failed. This pointless stylisation is just really irritating and makes things difficult to follow.More importantly though the movie just has no feeling. You can understand why Bourne would be motivated to behave the way he does, but he doesn't actually seem to be experiencing any such feelings, except the usual confusion and determined anger left over from the first film.Honestly I just thought this was a weak, weak film. It didn't engage me emotionally, there was too much frivolous editing, the characters and plot were predictable, despite the best efforts of the director to render the plot hard to follow. It was just very obviously a case of ""Well the first film made a lot of money, we'll have to make a sequel."" If the ratings here are any judge, I suppose they'll have to make another one, but I can tell you now I'll be staying away from that.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Vulnerable But Vengeful Bourne,"Supremacy builds on all the strengths of 2002's 'Identity' by giving Jason Bourne a much more relatable and grounded side. It's far from risky or overly original, but The Bourne Supremacy is as tightly compacted and impeccably directed as a spy thriller can get.Stepping in for Doug Liman is Paul Greengrass, known now as a master of suspense films, and Supremacy was one of his first gems. As I've said before, the original Bourne trilogy gets better with each film, and I think this second entry in the spy series may give us the best performance from Matt Damon in the title role. With his increasingly likable performance and magnetic charm, along with Tony Gilroy's well strung script, Supremacy tends to hit on all levels.With a bigger budget and seemingly more freedom in that department, I feel like the filmmakers wanted to turn the series in a slightly more action heavy route. Instead of Bourne being on the run from the C.I.A., this time he's hunting them, and the action steps up because of that. Bourne has more time to plan out his moves and hence the scenes feeling more natural and polished. With that said, the reason the action works so well, is because the characters are written with depth and motivations. There are no mustache twirling villains, you understand where everyone is coming from, even if you don't agree with their decisions.One of those nicely written characters is Joan Allen's Pamela Landy. Landy, a new task force leader from the C.I.A., wants just as many answers as Bourne as she draws close to the truth behind Treadstone. Unfortunately for her, Bourne is after everyone who ever wronged him, and Landy may be one of them. Much like the first film, as the audience you suspect what's going on, but it's far more interesting to watch the performances and reactions of the characters finding out themselves. That's a tribute to the acting and directing.At the center of each Bourne film is the performance of the great Matt Damon, and I don't know that he's ever been as good as he is in 'Supremacy'. The wide range of emotion and flawless action sequences that he (reportedly) did stunts for is impressive. The best Bourne is revenge Bourne and that's what we get here. It's always entertaining to watch him rip apart the C.I.A.'s attempts to take him down, even on the 5th or 6th viewing.+Damon has never been better+Joan Allen+Amped up action, amped up characters+Vulnerable but vengeful Bourne9.4/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Really quite good, despite some Blair Witch camera work","I have not read the books and thought the first movie in this series was better than average, but nothing special. This one is a lot stronger, and is a stand alone effort that does not require you even see the first film. There are some combat and car chase scenes that have kind of a jerky, piecemeal affect that makes them harder to follow than they should be, but that is the only weak spot in the whole film. I am still having trouble with Matt Damon as a deadly assassin but he is a heavyweight actor and his situation grabs you and holds you through to the last scene. Very good supporting work from Brian Cox and Joan Allen. I believe there was a trilogy of books by this author, and if so I can't wait for the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bourne Supremacy was not as supreme as the Identity,"The Bourne Identity was by far the better picture! By contrast, the Bourne Supremacy, although ""gritty"" and intense fell down in a number of areas. It's plot I considered weaker of the two and the transition between scenes a little awkward. The high speed car chase totally over the top and far too long. I'm an expert in martial arts and the fight scenes not well done; whereas, in the former picture they were quite believable. I'm sorry to say this, but the Supremacy was riding on the coat-tails of the first picture. Moreover, the story might have worked better if Jason Bourne(sic), rather than remaining a victim of amnesia was further developed into an actualized agent bent on exposing the corrupt circumstances he found himself in with the real possibility of vindication! Finally, the death of his love interest I thought was gratuitous. This was an area where her character might have been greatly expanded, it was the interaction between the two in the Identity that served to create an unusual tension: her totally naive to the man that she (and he, for that matter) were fast discovering was a trained operative with very uncommon skills.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"a solid action movie, if not precisely as memorable as the first film","As much as I'm anticipating the third 'Bourne' film to come out into theaters, and as much as I'm not all aboard Paul Greengrass's style of film-making (mostly in due to United 93), The Bourne Supremacy works best as an adaptation of a book that, ironically enough considering the director, is good to bring along on an airplane ride. It's efficient and keen in how it observes the characters having tense talks on the phones (Joan Allen makes that work much better than expected, maybe the one improvement over the first film, as great as Cooper can be), and pretty well acted by its supporting players (one of the best scenes involves Julia Stiles, who was hinted at in the first film, who gets an emotional scene in a tunnel with Damon pointing a gun at her head), and it's even got one of the best car chase/smash-em-ups in the new millennium (the chase sometimes pops into mind when I'm in a tense traffic situation).But somehow it's nothing too groundbreaking, which maybe makes it just good and maybe just slightly unsatisfying for its potential. Not that the Bourne Supremacy needs to be a bold artistic achievement in the realm of international espionage thrillers. However if one feels that something it's lacking- and it's not quite because of the shaky camera-work, though I can understand how it can be seen as a negative- it's not to be unexpected. There's not the same suspense in the (anti?) hero's dilemma of identity, and so it mostly amounts to high-tech cat and mouse theatrics and a whole lot of attitude to go along with the potential of danger at every turn. It's not a film that I disliked in the slightest, and I might watch it late at night if it should strike my fancy. But as far as big smashing summer blockbusters go, it could be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Supreme!!!,"The sequel to surprise hit The Bourne Identity is a superb accomplishment and is even better than the first film. This is a superbly intelligent and polished thriller and like the first film harks back to great espionage films from the 60's. It's delightfully reminiscent of classic films like The Ipcress File.The story this time has Bourne hiding away in Goa with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente.) He is found by a German spook (Karl Urban) and is on the receiving end of an assassination attempt, Bourne survives and Marie does not. The idea is to finally kill Bourne and then frame him for the killing of CIA agents after a botched deal, headed by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen.). Bourne now wants revenge and goes to Berlin to find out what happened he wants to face the Feds head on. The story naturally is full of double crossing and intrigue as any good spy thriller should have and it all unravels nicely. This story develops Bourne's character even further and the impact of Marie's death has great dramatic affect throughout the film as Bourne also begins to have memories of a mission he did in Berlin that holds importance to events happening now.Like the first installment, Matt Damon is excellent. He perfectly balances the inner fragility with the outer sternness and composure of Bourne's secret agent personality. Also as before Brian Cox is superb and his dodgy dealings come full circle. Karl Urban who is an up and comer thanks to his appearance in Lord Of The Rings 2 and 3 is also very good and has a presence in the film similar to Clive Owen in the first. Joan Allen is also very good and I have to say looking sexier than ever!The action in this film is pulsating. It's documentary like and puts you right in the action and the centre piece car chase is the action scene of the year, no question. The fact that all the car chases are reality based is something I love about this and indeed the first film. In amongst all the over the top, surrealistic action sequences in blockbusters (which I like in their own way) this is a refreshingly exciting collection of action scenes that feel realistic, there are no 100 ft high explosions or cars that hurtle 50ft through the air. It's crunching, superbly choreographed stunt work, real crashes, real physics and real carnage. Much like the superlative car chases in Ronin the chases here are amazing.Overall this is a great thriller narrowly beating out the first film. It's great to have an action film with character, acting, an intelligent script and also with genuine tension and atmosphere. Not to be missed. ****½",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The 'Bourne' Density...,"Well, it didn't take long for Doug Liman to pass the torch to Paul Greengrass and adapt Robert Ludlum's second chapter of Jason Bourne's adventures titled ""Supremacy"" and released in 2004. Speaking rugby jargon, ""Identity"" scored the goal, ""Supremacy"" made the two-point conversion.Indeed, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is exactly what you expect from a follow-up to a promising spy thriller, it features the same amount of fights, chases, ambushes, killings and exotic locations (taking us from Gao, India to Moscow, Russia with a few shortcuts through NYC) and it provides more density to the pre-existing characters, more gravity to Bourne's existential troubles and a nice addition with Joan Allen. As Pamela Landy, she plays a CIA officer investigating the many loose ends of the ""Treadstone"" operation, the mysterious murder of a highly influent Russian and his wife. Both ways lead to Bourne and makes him the target of another cat-and-mouse game where Bourne is the mouse first and becomes the cat after, then a lynx near the end.There are two interesting things about Bourne, first it's the paradoxical nature of the character, making him a little more fascinating than James Bond whose timelessness made him predictable no matter how cool and confident he was, and hard to inspire a real emotional bond (no pun intended). However, Bourne is a man whose dissociative amnesia obstructed many memories from his past as a professional killer, which means the more he wants to know about him, the less he does but the more he tries to hide himself, the more of a target he becomes. There's something inevitable about the confrontations that occupies the final act, whether with the one character who reveals his true villainy, Landy, Julia Stiles as Nicky and finally, a girl who might not recognize him as the man who simply killed his parents.In a way, Bourne is a hero within the context of the film but with the background that has evil all printed on it and that's the trick with this character, his curse is perhaps his blessing. Still, he must face the game and plays with it as a sort of cathartic redemption. That's how he indulges to emotional breakdowns at times and loses his cool, while still being cool. The other blessing is that the amnesia didn't cancel off his skills and he's still capable to fool the enemy and lure them into his own plans. There's a great scene where he uses himself as a bait for an arrest because he knows that's how he will be spotted. The film might be labeled as an action film, which it is, but if you follow it closely, and close your eyes on one or two contrivances and some redundancy in the action department, you'll get yourself hooked by the stories and the many ramifications with previous backstories.To say that the film is a character study would be a stretch though: Bourne has a few quiet drama scenes, but he's a man of action, in a constant alert situation, spotting either the danger or the opportunity to get his enemies using not only his force but his brains (the way he outsmarts the big villain is unexpected and original). It's through his actions that we know a little more about Bourne, the film provides many information but they're never used as expositional samples. That said, one viewing might make the film look too complex and mazy and some flashbacks are shown like flashes of memories punctuated with blackouts, betraying some directorial teasing stuff. But it's not overdone (thankfully) and the presence of Matt Damon enhances the film, and so does the gallery of supporting characters with a honorable mention to Brian Cox. His interactions with Allen are top-caliber acting.And I will say what I said about the first, once again, it's about people who don't enjoy what they do: even the villain who comes the closest to kill Bourne is an average man who's paid for that and doesn't have the little edgy smirk or the flamboyance of a Bond villain. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" has this thing in common with its predecessor, it's straightout drama, it doesn't go for fancy catchphrases and one-liners and while it might seem sometimes too serious à la Nolan, it provides a nice feeling of continuity in tone and style. And at the risk of repeating myself, the film has no pretension to duplicate a James Bond formula but what it does (and does well) is establishing the birth of an iconic franchise, with solid entertainment and characterization and not much of melodrama, if we except the sad exit of Marie (Frannka Potente) and the last scene that seems a bit exaggerated but rewarded by the final phone-call between Landy and Bourne, and an interesting twist that I suspect might be the film's cliffhanger.The film can be watched right after the first and right now, I'm eager to watch the third opus. And if ""Idenity"" was a well-made thriller with a promising character, let's conclude by saying that ""Supremacy"" is a well-made sequel with a character that gains more density as we follow his quest to know who he was, in order to be someone else, and someone better. Yes, he might have a troubled past, but he's got the right stuff. In other words, if Bond is a cool guy, Bourne is a good guy.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Is this real?,"Bourne Supremacy is one of my all time favorite action thriller movies. I had not expected that, I had supposed that it is just another action thriller, watch and enjoy, no more, but it was beyond great. The direction is not only very stylish, but sterile that makes the movie peculiar in a good way. The editing and camera usage are peculiar too, despite some people seriously complain about it, especially when it comes the car chase scenes. In the movie, there is not any cliché also, it shows that the director is a 'conscious' director, I watched some of his interviews and comments on the film and extremely impressed. The fight scene which takes place in Munich is very realistic and deliberately directed. I learned that the explosion was real that's why it was fresh and amazing. The movie is very consistent on all counts or should I say solid? As for clichés, Bourne does not make love with the women who he meets which is a revolution in action thriller movies. Women don't fall in love with him or he does not allure women. There is a scene that takes place in a railway station, it recalls The Jackal, this scene was impressive, it was jaw dropping and pretty stark. Karl Urban's character is somehow different from other usual villains, realistic? And yes, the car chase. One of the greatest car chases of all time. Some people seriously complain about the shaky camera in such scenes, but it was not annoying at all to me, if you say Transformers, yes it was, but I loved this one. Some shots are extremely short, shaky camera, but brilliant. Also this is one of the longest car chases ever made like Ronin. Bourne Supremacy is my favorite movie in the series by far.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jason Bourne returns for another action thrill ride,"Matt Damon makes his return as the title character Jason Bourne, the CIA agent who was last seen in France on a mission to discover his past and evade the ruthless assassins that pursued him. This time however, Doug Liman who directed the previous film has reassigned to the executive producer with Paul Greengrass taking his place. More often than not, a change in directors during a film franchise tend to result in downward step in quality. Fortunately, Paul Greengrass appears to understand the heart and soul of the first film and manages keep it all alive in this sequel. Though it is hard to say whether this film improves upon the original or not as it does update in some areas but fall slightly short in others. Nonetheless, it makes a profoundly entertaining popcorn action flick. Matt Damon resumes his role as Jason Bourne who is now living in hiding in India with Marie (played by Franka Potente) after the events of the last film. Everything seems just fine between the two as they are living a happy, peaceful life together. That is until a mysterious CIA agent Kirill (played by Karl Urban) began following him around. Upon framing him for the murder of a former CIA agent, Kirill attempts to assassinate Bourne by the order of Bourne's former boss Ward Abbott (played by Brian Cox) and operation director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) which goes horribly wrong. Soon, Bourne finds himself drawn back into the life he though he left behind and search for answers of what they want from him.This second installment delivers just about everything you'd expect from the following of the original. Like the first film, it's fast paced, delivers solid thrills, and shows lead actor Matt Damon in his spectacular, high-octane sense. From the first twenty minutes, we are introduced with a tense, frenetic car chase scene with Jason Bourne and Marie as they pursued by the devious Kirill who tries to kill our hero, and the scene ends in disastrous results that set the plot in motion. This entire sequence is nicely shot, as it is heart-racing and intense to sit through. The rest of the action revolves around martial arts combat between Bourne and the assassins that, though feature some slick choreography, suffer from ridiculous shaky camera work and quick cuts that try to illicit the intensity of the action but only make it difficult to decipher what's going on. It seems pointless to showcase such distracting camera work of the actors are demonstrating some decent fight choreography since nowadays filmmakers tend to use this gimmick to hide more sloppy choreography. Above all, the film's plot comes out on top, even more than in the previous film. With the lead character Jason Bourne more fleshed out, more knowledge of his past acquired, and a well conceived antagonist played by Karl Urban, the film shines on some improvement and makes for a story than viewers are more likely to become in engaged in, especially the ending which illicits Bourne in an emotionally powerful scene that largely defines his character.The Bourne Supremacy is a smart, crowd-pleasing action thriller sparked with terrific, if flawed action sequences, and a polished treatment of our action hero. Whether the film marks an improvement in the overall quality is difficult to say, but matters most is that it is highly entertaining and makes a must-watch for all action flick seekers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The DNA of the new 007 adventures,"As I have always said, and I am not alone, the Jason Bourne saga, begun in 2002 and resumed here in 2004, has mainly helped James Bond saga producers to find a way to renew the oldest franchise in the action espionnage genre. There was a before and after CASINO ROYALE, itself mostly under JASON BOURNE influence, not concerning the topic nor story telling of course, but the directing and action sequences making. The James Bond franchise began to get very old and lousy with Pierce Brosnan, it needed some fresh air, more action packed scenes and many other things too. So, I repeat Jason Bourne saga contributed a lot to 007 adventures. I could not watch this kind of film every day, that would annoy me, because this directing methods can be tiring, though exciting when you are in front of the screen.

Top notch.  Again.,"SPOILER WARNING To make one good movie out of a Robert Ludlum potboiler may be considered a fluke. To make two good movies out of Robert Ludlum potboilers may be cause for concern. I know they say that the worst books often make the best movies, but this is ridiculous. The books weren't THAT bad. So why are the movies so good? The first in the sequence, ""The Bourne Identity"" was a very pleasant surprise in a year of tedious blockbusters and over-hyped garbage.And now we have the second movie, ""The Bourne Supremacy"". Where the first eschewed scenes in which people said, ""I want this guy taken DOWN"", the second at times veers dangerously close to cliché, but manages to avoid it by filling the screen with fine performers, relentlessly crunchy action and realistically grotty locations. Yes, Joan Allen's CIA executive overdoes it a tad, but there's always Brian Cox to calm things down again - ""with the greatest respect, Pam, I think you're working a little bit beyond your pay scale"", or words to that effect. It's a shame he blows his brains out in this one, as that leaves a Brian-Cox-shaped gap in the third one, but I'm sure the film-makers will think of something. Certainly Jason Bourne manages to think of everything. From death by toaster-and-magazine to how to get a CIA executive's room number, he has it covered. He goes from downcast taciturnity to explosive violence in the blink of an eye. As in the first movie there are ice-cold confrontations and nerve-shredding chases and through the middle of it all, there goes Matt Damon, the perfect actor for this kind of film. Neither too showy nor too distant, he fits this role so well you can imagine him playing it for many years to come. It's like a synthesis of his brainy arrogance in ""Good Will Hunting"" and his icy charm in ""Ripley"". Again, it helps that he is surrounded by talented and believable actors playing all the CIA drones and Russian scumbags. The action sequences are all uniformly superb. The fight in the German minimalist's flat is breath-taking and goes from nervous banter to wild violence, ending with a tangle of bodies that looks disturbingly authentic. The Moscow car chase, meanwhile, has to be seen to be believed. The best of its kind since ""Ronin"", it has no gimmicks or tricks up its sleeve beyond speed, crashes, more speed, and more crashes. That it takes place at the end of a film which has already given us a fine car chase at the beginning, only adds to the sense of an embarrassment of riches. That early car chase, by the way, is very well handled. The shots of Bourne's girl-friend with her hands on the dashboard to steady herself provide a sense of genuine danger. They really do look as if they are driving far too fast down those Indian back streets. It's not hard to see where this series is going - next he has to trace his own life by heading back to Nixon, Missouri, I suppose. No doubt there will be people trying to stop him, for one reason or another. What is hard to imagine is that the third film will be as good as this one.

Another good one.,The Bourne Supermacy is one of the best spy movie.Matt Damon was living with his girlfriend in India.They were happy.After a long time (2years) some one still wants to kill them. This nightmare comes true. The hitman attacked them.They run away. But the hitman was a sharp shooter. Hi killed Bournes Girlfriend. She was driving. The car get without control and the car fall into water. Bourne lost her.The scene was really sad in the water. Camera direction was excellent. It was very hard to accept this. Now the revenge started. Bourne wants to know whats going on. Why they are still behind him. The mission was finished. Why they wants to kill him.In this movie some one wants to trap him. This is why Bourne got trouble.The finish line was good. So the story is really interesting. Don't miss it.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I agree- poor script and crappy footage kill this film,"I really wanted to like this film, hell I wanted to love it, I loved the first one. But the action sequences are more like some sort of epileptic fit of blurry camera action that has no coherence and no excitement. My girlfriend got a headache from the crappy footage, and I simply had to wonder where the money went when it came to actually shooting the film. It looks as if a seven year old was handed a video camera and told to shoot the scene- there is no flow and a lot of reliance on shaking and swinging the camera all over the place like the cameraman is drunk, high, epileptic or all three at the same time. Since the BOURNE series needs good action to float, this totally slaughtered any chance of the film being any damn good. Then you add in the pathetic performance of the CIA operatives, yeah, all of them were wooden and confused. and here is a question for you.. why the HELL did they not close the blinds on the windows once they knew Bourne was outside?? How's that for good realistic CIA action? Oh, there's a sniper outside.. let's walk around the open windows a lot shall we?? Crappy acting, poor action and totally unrealistic feel. I give the movie a ZERO, because the first was so much better and this could have taken it to the next level.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Girl shot at beginning of Movie?,"It made the show so much more enjoyable, when I saw her eliminated at the beginning. I thought she was the low point of the first one. I was hesitant to see the sequel because of her. Now I think it is way better than the first one. I just wish he had capped the blond girl with the fat face (forgot her name). Oh, Julia Stiles! That would have made for an interesting third part. It was not as good as Bond (unless you are referring to the Roger Moore fake one) because he does not know who he really is for most of the movie and is trying to make restitution for his wrong doings. I rated this a ten because, this story could still unfold for many movies to come. This is not a spoiler, because if anyone has not seen this movie yet, they are never going to see. Please do not black list me!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
