Lack of commitment,"Seeing the character that George Clooney plays in Up In The Air reminds me of George Peppard in The Carpetbaggers. If you remember Jonas Cord was flying all over creation in his private plane developing and supervising his many enterprises. Just like Clooney here, Peppard had some deep seated issues about settling down even though unlike Clooney he was already married.Clooney has an interesting job that really keeps him moving. He works for a firm that specializes in aiding fired workers make a transition. I can testify myself that getting fired can be traumatic. In my case though my firing lasted two months and I went back to my old job and stayed there until retirement.Clooney's boss Jason Bateman has him going all over the country. He says that he spent only about 43 days in his sparse apartment in Omaha. It really is sparse the various hotel rooms look more homey. But a woman who also spends a lot of time traveling on her job Vera Famiga and a woman who is being trained by Clooney, Anna Kendrick help him see that maybe his life and lack of commitment isn't the best thing for him.Nor is his stated goal of gaining 10 million frequent flier miles. He spends so much time in the air that all the airline personnel on all the airlines know him on a first name basis. That's one significant accomplishment. Maybe Clooney should have taken up with a stewardess.The characters are drawn well in this script which got one of several Academy Award nominations, in this case for adapted screenplay. Up In The Air also got Academy recognition for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Clooney, Best Actress for Famigia, and Best Supporting Actress for Kendrick. I thought Kendrick was especially good as the young lady who sees a career treadmill she doesn't like and gets off.Up In The Air is an intelligent and modern comedy with some characters I think we can all identify with.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
George Clooney shows something he has never shown before. vulnerability.,"Halfway through this movie I considered it an 8 out of 10 and decently spent money. The second half came as a big surprise. George Clooney let go of all his suave and let his eyes show fear and isolation that real people feel.There were two things going on in this movie. On one end, we were looking at the people getting fired. On the other end, we were seeing the problems with Ryan's way of life. The interviews at the end with the people who lost their jobs explaining that it was family and support that brought them through bad times hit a perfect note for bringing both parts of the story together.The title of this film literally explains what it is like to not know what aspects of your life are solid, such as a home or a significant other. Everything going on is simply up in the air. One day, what you thought was one way will turn out to be something else entirely.Best of Reitman's three. Very much recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I'm like my mother, I stereotype—it's faster  Up in the Air","Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, George Clooney stars as corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham, who is hired to help ease the transition of long-term employees to the unemployment line across the country. Taking his job very seriously and loving the 290 days away from home—the only problem with that is the 70 days at home in his empty apartment—his world gets turned upside-down when a young upstart in the company threatens to ground the company to fire people via the internet. Not standing for a change in his life, nor the chance for his life goal of total airline miles to end, (""Let's just say I have a number and I haven't hit it yet""), he goes on a mission to prove how personal his job is and how key a face to face meeting can be to talk down an emotionally unstable person and really do the victim a service in an otherwise horrible moment in his life. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game-changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up.Clooney's Bingham is the loner businessman whose only relationships exist from random meetings with attractive females at the multiple airports he frequents. His wallet of plastic has become his lifeblood—credit cards from airlines that accumulate his mileage, hotel status perk cards that let him cut the disgruntled travelers and go straight to the front, and numerous room keys that never seem to be thrown out, causing him to always use more than one before finally opening his hotel suite's door. Detached from his family for years as the brother that exists but cannot be counted on for anything, he contemplates whether he should, or really wants to, attend his sister's wedding—the little girl of the family and someone he should have been involved with after the passing of their father. A series of style cramping incidents for him begins with a phone call from his other sister and the request to take a cardboard cutout of the happy couple, (Melanie Lynskey and Danny McBride, in a role that might actually show some nuance for a guy that usually flies by the cuff), and photograph it in front of famous places he travels to for work ""like that French gnome movie,""—I love the Amélie reference. Then comes the threat of being taken out of the air, his home for decades, in order to impersonally let go more people more efficiently; the challenge of taking Natalie on his next schedule of jobs to prove to her why the new system won't work; and the addition of a love interest in Vera Farmiga's Alex, a woman who describes herself to him with ""just think of me as you with a vagina""—one of many great lines.There is a lot of subtlety and intricate weaving of plot lines throughout the story, details and sequences that need to be seen fresh to get the full benefit of the film. What you might initially think is a witty comedy about a jerk of a guy who not only thinks he's better than everyone else, but actually is, that either finds the error of his ways or gets dropped down a peg or two, eventually becomes a tale chock full of heart and emotion. The real success story of the film is a revelatory performance from Clooney who really knocks this on out of the park. He always showed the charisma and chops to play confident and successful, but here is allowed to also branch out and express the pent-up frustration that comes with isolated loneliness, the passion one can have for a job that seems horrible, yet, when treated carefully, is a job to take seriously, and the compassion for humanity on the whole, softening enough to realize that there are people around him that need help besides his laid off strangers, help that only he can provide. The evolution he undertakes is really pretty amazing and I credit Kirn, Reitman, and Clooney for pulling it off with grace and laughter.Every single actor is unforgettable—even the bit parts like Zach Galifianakis and especially J.K. Simmons as two corporate employees who's jobs have been eliminated. Jason Bateman is hilarious as Clooney's smug boss, fully embodying the take no crap nonchalance he made famous in ""Arrested Development""; Farmiga is gorgeous and competent to be able to go toe-to-toe with Clooney in the detachment and power-hungry attitude of flying in style for half a year or more; and, if George's reinvention of character is revelatory, then Kendrick's naïve Natalie is masterful. This girl was top in her class, able to get a job in her field wherever her heart desired, yet settled for this firm specializing in firing people so as to not dirty the workers' real superior's hands. Young and confused about life in the big world of adulthood—set on a plan for marriage and children to occur as though set times on a clock—her eyes are opened to the intimacy and fragility with which a person's mental state can be affected by mere words. When you put them all together, Up in the Air resonates on so many levels; deserving of any praise and accolades to be bestowed upon it. Hilariously funny every second of the way, it is still unafraid to dig into the dark moments of life and treat them with respect and relevancy, going places you wouldn't think it would have the guts to go. You really can't say too much about the film, a top ten of the year entry for sure. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An engaging drama,"This film is about a man who fires people for a living. His world becomes upside down when his job is radically changed by a newly recruited young fresh graduate.""Up in the Air"" is a well made film. The plot focuses on character development and emotional changes of the characters. It is not easy to make characters interesting and memorable, but ""Up in the Air"" does just that. Both the characters of George Clooney and Anna Kendrick have strongly divergent attitudes and personalities, but they have great chemistry and change each other slowly but surely. How they radically shake each others core belief is engagingly told. I enjoyed watching ""Up in the Air"" a lot, as it tells an engaging story of self discovery.",,Anonymous,Romance

Bring your own wine,"I really liked the movie, it kind of invites you to bring your own wine. There's a lot of probing into modern life and relationships, and it's up to you what you take from the film and what you feel for each of the characters. I was quite grateful for having seen Reitman's Thank You For Smoking (2005) previously, because both movies are really arch in the way they set up people in thoroughly pariah job roles and then get you to warm to them. So it didn't really come as a shock to see Clooney as an HR consultant (Ryan Bingham) whose job is to fire people in redundancy exercises where the management are too yeller, instead it rated an amused and knowing eyebrow raise.Although a lot of the movie concerns the workplace, the disconnect between the interests of corporates and the interests of society (a link that was present historically in America, but which has been irrevocably decoupled), and how to work in that environment, the interest for me was more to do with relationships. From my male perspective there are some fairly poisonous insights into the female mind (though it may be unfair to generalise), the young Cornell grad Natalie Keener (played by Anna Kendrick) talks about her preconceptions of the man she will meet, the kind of name he will have, apparently the only thing he will love more than her is their ""golden lab"". The slightly older perspective from Alex Goran (played by Vera Farmiga) is that the man should be taller, should earn more, and come from a good family. To go with the aeronautical theme of the movie, the theatre should have provided some sick bags.The main theme is, for me, pure Frank Borzage, it's about earning the right to love and be loved. In common with 80 years ago when those movies were being made, it's an onus that only weighs upon the male of the species, which makes the film a little hackneyed.My favourite ambiguity of the film would have to be the backpack lectures that Bingham (Clooney) gives. He has a whole metaphor about everything in your life, the people, the trinkets, all the stuff you can collect, being in a backpack and weighing you down. He says that people aren't swans, they're not meant to be together forever, that they're actually sharks, who have to keep swimming continually, weighed down by nothing. I think there's an element of truth to both poles, I can see both arguments. I just love going to a Hollywood movie and not having an opinion shoved down my throat.I had a slight problem regarding the level of realism in the film, I felt that the air-commuter lifestyle that was being shown was over-slicked, like I was watching something of a feather with The Consequences Of Love (or Giulia Doesn't Sleep At Night, two of the great modern hyper-stylised films from Italy). Nothing wrong with stylisation, except that I think Jason was trying to go for a film that had a lot of resonance with Recession America. I felt it was awkward to introduce real-life folks at the end, and also realistic looking termination assessments (or whatever they're called when you can someone), when the actors such as Clooney and Vera Farmiga were just so damned suave, as if from a different universe.And this is to Claire.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breathes New Air...,"Director Jason Reitman, that has brought us great Indie classics such as Thank You for Smoking and Juno has crafted his most personal and most effective portrait to date, Up in the Air. The film stars George Clooney, also giving his most intimate and beautiful performance of his career, as Ryan, a traveling ""Firing-Man,"" who plans on racking up as much frequent flyer miles as he can. Completely void of human connection and emotion, even from his two sisters, one of which is getting married, Ryan seems completely content with his choice of living. All seems well until he meets his female version in the beautiful and charismatic Alex, played with sexual force and intensity by Vera Farmiga. At the same time, a change at his job makes him acquire a student, Natalie, played with sensitivity and vigor by Anna Kendrick, to learn the ropes of the business before potentially making a devastating change to Ryan's way of life.The film, based on the book of the same title, is a moving and witty piece of cinema. The line deliveries given are some of the best liners of the year. The adaptation by Reitman and Sheldon Turner is of beautiful and social importance in today's day and age. There was no better time than now, to bring a film like this to the table. Dana E. Glauberman's crisp and precise editing sets the pace as we travel with Ryan in this beautiful account. Reitman's direction shows he's a force to be reckoned with and should be in full blown force for Oscar consideration along with the adaptation shared with Turner.George Clooney, who's having one hell of a year along with his other comedic turn in The Men Who Stare at Goats, gains sympathy and emotion from the viewer, which up until now, Clooney had always struggled for. The role is right up Clooney's alley and with humorous strength, conveys the pain and loneliness of an otherwise charming man successfully.Vera Farmiga as Alex, is a beautiful as she is dark, and as sexy as she is ugly. Farmiga has finally landed the right role that, in her years of wrong place at the wrong time, should land her a first-time Oscar nomination. Never showing her hand, Farmiga keeps and earns your trust, attention, and admiration. It's one of the most divisive and structurally brilliant supporting turns of the year.Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices. Kendrick earns your care and concern for the character, as she follows Ryan around and constantly badgers him about happiness and love, she naïvely and courageously shows the tenderest parts of youth in today's world. Kendrick will likely be sitting along side Farmiga at Oscar's ceremony.Jason Bateman, playing Craig Gregory, the boss in charge, is amusing in a brief but memorable role. Amy Morton and Melanie Lynsky, who play Ryan's sisters, are valuable and sufficient enough to book end a wonderful tale. Danny McBride, an outstanding comic talent to watch, is as good as ever. And finally, in otherwise cameos, Sam Elliott and the great Zack Galifianakis are uproarious in their respective roles.This could very well be the crowd and critical pleaser of the year. It has what the 2004 film Sideways lacked, the emotional edge. Long after the film, you take these characters home with you and remind yourself of its authenticity in delivery, poise, and premise. Up in the Air is one of the best pictures of the year. ****/****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good mix of comedy and dramedy that really makes you think,"Up In the Air Movie ReviewI finally got around to seeing the soon to be Oscar nominated movie, Up In the Air today. A lot of critics are putting it on their lists for top movie of the year and I will have to agree with them. This is a very good movie. It's funny and witty and has some good dramatic moments at the end that really hit you in the stomach. It's one of those rare movies that is fun to watch and makes you think at the end.The movie stars George Clooney as Ryan, his job is to travel around the country and fire people personally and hopefully tries to help them move on with their lives. It's an art form that Ryan has perfected over the years and he is really good at it. I will have to warn you not to watch this movie if you have just been fired, because the movie is littered with scenes of people getting fired. Most of the people react in an angry fashion and it's almost comical in way they show these montages. Then there are people that react with a sadness and desperation that really makes you feel their pain. Ryan explains that he spends some 300 plus days traveling and a miserable 43 days at home. Through his travels he gives speeches at different hotels about putting your life in a backpack and feeling that weight. Your different attachments in life weigh you down. So he believes in having no attachments.Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga play Natalie and Alex in the movie and their characters provide a challenge to Ryan's way of life. Natalie is a young college graduate with big ideas that will change the way Ryan will do his job. Ryan is not happy about this and thus there is conflict between the two. Ryan's boss, played by Jason Bateman, pairs Natalie with Ryan so that Ryan can show her the ropes. Their totally different personalities and philosophies on life clash and these provides for most of the funny and witty dialogue of the movie. Ryan is an older man who is calm and full of confidence in his job and in his life. Natalie on the other hand is young, naïve, and looks unsure of what to do most of the time. Alex is another business room that Ryan meets on the road and has a fling with. During the course of the movie they keep in contact and hook up as much as possible. Natalie seems to be just like Ryan in life only in female form. Ryan enjoys being with her so much is seems that he is reconsidering his whole theory on not being attached to other people. Is it possible that Natalie and Alex can change his whole outlook on life? That's obviously where this movie is headed.So what is this movie all about? It's about life. Pretty simple but yet very complicated. There are two philosophies on life presented in this movie. There is Ryan who believes that relationships are the heaviest objects you can put in your backpack. Relationships weigh you down in life. There's too much negotiations and compromise that you have to do. You can't be truly happy with all these attachments with other people. As he likes to say, if you are not moving you are dieing. In a way we can see he is right. Relationships can be hard; you have to work hard at it. It's a drag sometimes. The people you are the closest too end up hurting you the most. We've all felt this at sometime in our life. We see in Ryan's life that he has no close relationships. He has no girlfriends, he has no plans to ever marry or have children, he has no close friends, he hardly has a relationship with his two sisters, he fires dozens of people daily and feels nothing for them, and he seems just fine with that. Natalie on the other hand can't help but being attached to other people. She has fond dreams of being married someday and having children. In fact she believes her life is not complete without this. You also see this when she has to fire people. She can't help but feel very bad for these people and can't detach herself from the situation of seeing these peoples lives destroyed right in front of her.So at the end of the movie you have to ask yourself, are attachments and relationships worth the effort. The answer I came to be is yes, they are. At the end of the day what keeps you going in life. Is it your possessions or is it the love of your family? For me nothing can compare to the love I get from my family and friends. It's unmeasureable.. As they say you can replace your possessions but you can't replace your loved ones. This philosophy is even more evident in this movie when you think about the people who are fired in this movie. They are devastated by this turn of events but they also realize that they couldn't get through it if it wasn't for their family. You can lose everything but as long as you have a family to go home to you can be happy, you can have hope for the future. Without these relationships you are alone and have no one to help you through the bad times. So I would think about your own life and be grateful for all the people in it.Grade- BRated R- Lots of use of the F-word and other cuss words through out the movie, 2 seconds of nudity of Vera Farmiga, lots of sexual innuendo and vulgar talk between George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A '00s Masterpiece,"So 2009, and the decade known as...(what do we call this decade?), are ending later this month. And there is no better film to wrap up a (frankly) terrible decade (in terms of news events, unemployment, the economy, the media stronghold, the trashing and dumbing down of American culture, technology, narcissism, vanity obsession, a divided nation, violence and hostility) than Up in the Air. The film, the best I've seen all year and one of the best of the decade, captures many of the factors that made this decade the worst one, at least in my 42 years. The 70s may have been bad economically but hey, at least we had Bruce Springsteen and real music on the radio, women still seemed to like men and not only if the men were millionaires, thoughtful movies in the theater, and only five or so TV channels to pick from. Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man with no ""roots,"" (that is, no wife, no kids, and his apartment in Omaha is about as furnished as a room at Embassy Suites), who fires people for a living because the companies who hire him are too cowardly to do it themselves. It is a juicy role for Clooney, who has made a career out of playing easy-talking charmers. The film sounds depressing and in many ways it is, but it is also witty, quietly hilarious at times, and full of pathos when it becomes a morality piece near the middle (and like the best morality pieces, it doesn't shove its message down your throat). It reminded me in many ways of American Beauty, the masterpiece that capped off the '90s when it hit theaters ten years ago. Clooney's character slowly is stripped of the things he only cared about--including a one-night-stand that becomes a ""Same Time Next Year""-like meeting in Hampton Inns and Hiltons in Miami, Detroit, Wichita and other random cities, with another constant traveler (we never know what exactly she does, and that's not supposed to matter) played by Vera Farmiga, who may win an Oscar nomination for her mysterious, slightly passive and jaded, 30something character. The final important character is an eager young Cornell graduate (played by Anna Kendrick, from Twilight) who thinks that a career in firing people is a wise choice now, and in some respects she's not that far off. Her character represents many of the Twitter-obsessed twentysomethings driven for money money money, who live for texting, and has naive and even immature ideals of what makes a relationship work. But she too goes through a transformation, as Up in the Air reaches a ""feel good while feeling bad"" quality of Frank Capra's darker films, like Meet John Doe. One of the most amazing things about this film is its use of real people in the ""firing scenes;"" people who have really lost their jobs several weeks or months before being filmed. Director Jason Reitman combines scenes of these people being fired by Clooney and Kendrick, and their instant responses are wholly authentic. There are a few actors playing the ""firees"" as well, but they blend in with the real folks. I really can't think of a better film to cap off this decade. This one will stay with you. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amusing and with interesting social commentary, but not an impactful film","Up In The Air takes a strange premise that could easily feel stale or cold, especially given the perfunctory connotation that airport travel has, but succeeds as a pleasant, if forgettable, movie. Clooney is very good as a detached but thoughtful lead, and Kendrick also impressed, injecting life and uncertainty into the movie. The comedy works well and doesn't feel overdone. The way the travel scenes were cut also showed Bingham's comfort and intimate knowledge of the airport drill in a way that was fun to watch. Reitman does a good job of keeping each scene engaging and is at his best when he uses subtle social commentary. The themes of personal connection and security were amusingly turned on their head by Clooney having to teach Kendrick about maneuvering firing, as she makes the job he loves obsolete. The twist with Farmiga's character was also good and surprising, keeping the film from being a by- the- numbers rom-com. The timing and reaction to the 10 million miles was also well done. It's not a movie that's exceptional in any area and not one that will ever immediately come to mind, but it's a solid, pleasant watch with some originality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Another hit from the Director of Juno, Jason Reitman","Anyone who has ever been fired must see ""Up In The Air."" Jason Reitman has done again. The director of ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno"" puts real life out there in an incredible way, where we all laugh and then walk out of the theatre thinking about what is really important. A film with a message that's entertaining: what a concept.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that flies all over the country firing people for companies that don't have the spine to do it themselves. He is so proficient at it, when he meets his ""expert traveler"" equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga); he is emotionally drawn to another person, beyond a passing interest, for the first time.Bingham's travels are a quest to be a traveling legend. When his company takes the advice of young newbie, Natalie Keener (Kendrick), he is grounded, endangering his quest to achieve frequent flier miles that number in the, uh, stratosphere. When his boss (Jason Bateman) assigns him to ""show her the ropes,"" so she can revolutionize the company's firing technology, the resulting road trip is not only riotously funny, it is a self-exploring journey into the three people's strengths and weaknesses. The life decisions they make are the emotionally important message of the film.The rest of the story must go untold, so you can savor every morsel from your own perspective. For that is what this film does best. Almost all of us have been canned. Sitting across the table, being told we'll be glad it happened, one day. Our participation in the film is subtle, as we sit across the table from Bingham as he cans us.The film's cast is like the story: they suck you in. Clooney is Clooney, like Cary Grant was Cary Grant. You think he's not acting, that's just who he is in real life. Maybe it is. Vera Farmiga's performance is seductively natural. You've met people like her. You admire her. Then you find out you don't know her at all. She is the mystery you wish you were. Anna Kendrick as Natalie is a perfect, perky, know-it-all that becomes all too human. Kendrick makes her character's transformation special parts of the film, when she could have easily have been regulated to a supporting character. This has become Reitman's trademark as a director. He empowers actors to make the movie their own.Up In The Air is a movie that is over before you want it to be. You want to get to know the characters better, to follow them around a little longer and make sure everything goes well for them. Another credit to Reitman for his extraordinary skill at taking the common things in life and make them extraordinary. Which makes us all feel better about the common-ness of our own lives.Written by: Vincent for Overcranked.net If you liked this come read more reviews http://www.overcranked.net/movies.php",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Decent Satire,"We are drawn in by interesting, unique storyline and smart satirizations. About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.What the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) don't stay put.A Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms.The two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, non-committal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have.There were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society.It is not so much Clooney's acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
My 304th Review: Modern Parables - But Only A Partial Success,"Up In The Air is a nice movie - a good satire about work and a comedy about the price of modern business.It looks like its going to mop up at the awards and I'm just not convinced it really deserves to.Why? Well, it has a good performance from Clooney as the confident consultant and good directorship, but it lacks true honesty - it sacrifices real integrity for Hollywood feelings and I'm not sure i want to see the top awards going on a film-flam type of film.Others will say this is honest and strong and entertaining (A tough act to pull off) but even though it is a nice film, well made, strong performances etc; it just somehow is a little trite. Even Clooney, who really can make anything work, ends up a little bemused. I think its a shame that films like $5 a day, which we loved, will be chiefly ignored and this will be lauded to the skies.Fun to watch and it does have heart; but for out money it is too shallow to really deserve all the accolades coming its way.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Overrated Film of 2009,"This was a good movie but I'm not sure why it's on top of all the movie critics top 5 lists. It seems to push all of the politically correct anti-business buttons in terms of heartless corporations mass firing downtrodden proletariats from their soul sucking jobs in the private sector while enlightening the movie viewer with the redemptive story of Ryan Bingham (Clooney) whose full time job is firing people while bedding down different women along the way. He is a ""termination consultant"" who is contracted by different companies to tell their employees they are fired. There are a number of scenes of him firing people with the predictable tears, violence, suicide threats, and so forth. You see, life in the private sector is really like this, day in and day out. Capitalism is exploitation, property is crime, we are all expendable components of an evil machine that ends up destroying us in the end. No wonder the left wing film critics love this movie.Anyhow, Ryan falls in love with a fellow business traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) whose soul is even more shriveled than his own. Ryan also develops a relationship with a newbie to his ""firing"" company, named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who eventually becomes disillusioned with firing people for a living. Go figure. Ryan becomes humbled by Natalie's humanity, not to mention his own experience of being used and discarded by Alex. Thus, we are lead to believe, Ryan becomes a better person for being on the receiving end of what he is usually dishing out. This aspect of it wasn't remotely believable.A good movie, but for my money, the most overrated of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Whatever Else It Is, It's Relevant","""Up in the Air,"" director Jason Reitman's follow up to his break-out hit ""Juno,"" is easily the most topical film I've seen this year. No other movie has been so in tune with current events and the cultural anxiety brought about by the recent economic crisis.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, whose job it is to do companies' dirty work for them and fire employees. He's a transient being, living out of suitcases and hotel rooms, and that's just the way he likes it. But then he meets Alex, a fellow transient being (Vera Farmiga) for whom he develops real feelings, and Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a spunky go-getter who's assigned to trail him and learn from him but who instead wakes him up a bit to the emptiness of a life devoid of meaningful emotional connections.""Up in the Air"" is a very solid bit of movie-making, never less than entertaining and extremely well acted. But it's a movie that doesn't hold together very well when you step back and start thinking about it. Vera Farmiga gives a lovely performance as Alex, but her character is the weakest written and doesn't make a lot of sense. She prides herself on being as detached from emotional baggage as Ryan is, and something we learn about her late in the movie proves that she means what she says, but would someone who really wants to keep emotional attachments to a minimum decide to be a man's weekend date for his sister's wedding? And after he crossed the boundaries she explicitly erected, wouldn't she call things off rather than leave open the opportunity to continue on with their relationship? Would there really be an audience for the kind of ""motivational"" speaking engagements Bingham delivers? Would anyone in his right mind even think of building a presentation from the concept of getting rid of everything in your life that has meaning? Too much of this felt like it serviced the plot without ringing true on its own terms.You can call these things quibbles, and maybe they are. Like I said, much of ""Up in the Air"" works very well. But the script calls too many things about itself into question for the movie to be completely satisfying.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Average story development on an Interesting Plot, processed with Rich Screenplay Components","Every year there are new film productions copying either independent, low-budget films or foreign language films. It's not always making copycats, but sometimes reflecting the same concept twice, as well. As the first thing to say, Up in the Air, doesn't reflect at all what the novel writer Walter Kirn tries to tell inside his story scoop. Besides, looking at this year's another production ""The Messenger"" , we see the same character models and same story development tools, there. Is it also a coincidence that both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick are being hired for the same type of work only within a different industry? If it is, the coincidences will continue by having Woody Harrelson and George Clooney as the trainers of our young fellas, and still continue with both Ben Foster and Anna Kendrick throwing in the towel before working their way up in the job. I find it necessary to look for external resources before evaluating a film after my first view. Up in the Air is a bad adaptation, totally messing up with its story; making it look cheerful and smart to the viewer. What's cheerful is making the audience feel sad and curious about the actors, and what's smart is the screenplay just offering a wise motto of life.The whole movie is actually the answer of one single question: ""What's Randy Bingman's motto in life?""George Clooney plays Randy the Mr.Backpack, who lives by means of his mouth. He makes a living with his mouth. From start to end, Randy just does 2 things: He talks and he travels.Randy's words are like passengers of a plane. When they are unspoken, they are at the gates waiting for their flight arrival. While they are being spoken, they may turn to have multiple meanings. But after they were spoken his words are in our memory:""I want you to pack your backpack with little stuff you own. Your laptop, your desk, your chair, and your bed, and your room, and your house. Now, I want you to leave everything behind of you. Now, do you feel a bit light?""""Your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. It's hard to get rid of them""Opening with a mocumentary style, George Clooney's confused character Randy introduces himself to us from the p.o.v of the people he sees and talks everyday. His job is his life and his personality. He is hired out to national companies of which managers prefer not to fire their own employees; instead Randy does this though job. He is a Human Resources professional. Awaring of his success, Randy's boss gives a trainee beside him. Thus Anna Kendrick's character -one of the best supporting actress nominees of the year in Academy- teams up with Randy. Clooney and Kendrick are coherent together, this gives us a chance to put ourselves in their shoes; even though their lives are boring and pockets are making huge amounts of paychecks with just talking and travelling.As the story goes it mostly becomes more boring, longer dialogues, longer scenes, terribly bad editing; very rarely there are important thematic values that offers us lifelong wise advices. On the other hand, the ideological concept is so feminist. Vera Farmiga's character, Alex always finds the right way to do and her acts are always right and she never makes mistakes; just like a super-heroine. Randy falls in love with her, and from her p.o.v it's Randy's mistake to come to her house to explore that she's married. 'Cause being open-hearted is not a proper code of conduct. This concept rules that women have rights to betray their husbands with making cool guys fall in love with them, while men are faulty when they think that marriage is an important decision and it must not be given very quick.Looking at the filming aspects, the first thing that comes to mind is there are so many directing and editing mistakes, mostly mistakes on the ongoing production phase: Deliberate errors by filmmakers... Crew and equipment visible when Natalie's being introduced due to the reflection in the glass window... Continuity mistakes expose that most of the scenes are reshot over and over again; and when the exterior scene backgrounds change, Jason Reitman's editors doesn't find it necessary to cut those scenes properly. When Ryan gets dropped off after leaving the school, you see him walking inside with the same car still in place, but in the next shot he's two steps behind of himself and the car is gone. During that party at Alex's place, she changes her sweater from satin blouse to black v-neck sweater and back again to her satin blouse in a very short period of time(less than a minute or two). Looking at all the picture compositions, all the qualities are just average; nothing more than that.Consider the Academy nominations, of all the 6 major award nominations Up in the Air got, it only deserves to win the Best Screenplay award. Myself as an amateur screenplay writer, even though I don't generally like adaptation scripts, Up in the Air is my favourite screenplay of this year. Sadly, the film altogether was nothing more than average. It should have nominated for Best Original Song as well for the song Up in the Air by Rolfe Kent.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Crisp script and comical moments are its miles!,"In times of recession, a movie about a guy who fires people for a living is not exactly anyone's idea of entertainment! But, the devilishly charming Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney just does that, making things oddly comical. Enjoying around 300 days on-board, at lounges and hotels, he laments the 40 days at home between trips.When he isn't firing, Ryan peddles his 'Baggage free' ideals at motivational lectures and occasionally has a 'good time' with fellow travel buff, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who hit off on a common ground of loyalty card vanity. As Alex calls terms herself as a feminine version of Ryan, the twosome often plan their sojourn across America.Things change when greenhorn Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) leads his company to a new policy of firing people via internet. Ryan is grounded and dismayed at the prospect of missing his secret ambition of 10 million frequent flier miles. Adding to his woes, his boss Craig Gregory puts Natalie under Ryan's tutelage to lean the business!Natalie and Ryan are opposites; while the former hates airports and loves to get back to 'home and family', Ryan loves his unreal life but wants to fire people 'with a personal touch', allowing the story its exploratory flight-path of mutual self discovery of emotional connections, love, family and propriety. While it is easy to portray such themes in gloom, Up in the Air is light hearted, sprinkled liberally with humor while keeping up its pace.Though, at first, it comes across as a movie on Ryan and his miles, it's not! His conflict is rather within himself, his fear of intimacy, family and commitment. Clooney actually makes you feel for the middle aged and lonely Ryan who fires people but is really not a grown-up within. To their credit, the filmmakers have worked well to create seemingly unreal characters but still leaving enough to imagination and things to relate to!Natalie and Alex have their issues too. While the Anna Kendrick plays a pretty, uptight and ambitious girl whose nervousness is situations is comic relief. Poor Natalie is eventually dumped over an SMS. Vera Farmiga as Alex adds her own shades of grey; she has a stable family but seeks out some fun. Do our characters get what they want? Typical to Hollywood style, some answers are direct while some are subtle.To bring out the best from those 'fired', the filmmakers actually cast people who had recently lost jobs! Their brief was to look into the camera and say what it felt like being 'fired'! Portraying multiple locales without actually filming there was intelligent production design. The Airport scenes were crisp and realistic. One of the best scenes is Ryan's slick passage through the security check, portraying a seasoned business traveler.Coming from the Oscar nominated directed by Jason Rietman of ""Juno"" fame, Up in the Air, adapted from a novel of the same name by Walter Kim is worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great and Original Film,"After watching this film multiple times, I decided to write a review. It is a film that works on so many levels. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who has the unusual service assignment of terminating people employed by other companies. (For a long time, I thought this was a service that did not exist in the real world until I was an African safari and met two gentleman who delivered this kind of service in South Africa.)The title has a double meaning: Bingham is in the air virtually the entire year and has no significant connection to his residence. He has accumulated all his travel miles on American Airlines and he stays only in Hilton Hotels, so he has all sorts of privileges that only an elite handful of travelers ever achieve with these travel service providers. So, he is literally ""up in the air"" in the course of doing his job.However, he is ""up in the air"" metaphorically. He has no roots to any community. He has an affair with a fellow frequent traveler, extremely well played by Vera Farmiga. He has no long-term, serious relationship, even with his own sisters. In fact, one of the great pieces of acting comes when Clooney/Bingham has to figure out how to coax his sister's fiancé to go through with the wedding. Clooney/Bingham finds this exceptionally difficult to do because he has never been close to having a relationship that would lead to marriage.The most interesting part of the film is the juxtaposition of Clooney/Bingham's status as a receiver of very generous ""loyalty"" rewards with the role he plays in denying employees of many companies the reward for the loyalty they have shown to their organizations. He gets extra-special treatment, especially from American Airlines, but the employees who have given the best 30 years of their lives to their companies are brutally ushered out the door.To me, this is the most thought-provoking and unique part of the film. This is not a remake of a 1940's or 1950's film, or even a 1980's film, because the sophisticated rewards programs from which the Clooney/Bingham character benefits did not exist. In fact, they were just being introduced into the marketplace in the early 1980's.There are other great performances and subplots, including the mentoring relationship Clooney/Bingham has with a young professional very well played by Anna Kendrick. Jason Bateman seems quite authentic as Bingham's ultimate boss.However, the center of gravity of the film is the character George Clooney plays, as only he can play it, and the many ways in which he presents a complex, multi-dimensional portrayal of someone who is ""up in the air.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movie titles,"'Up in the Air' - both Ryan's personal life and his job requirements. This movie is smart enough to tackle both personal issues like commitment issues and social problems like downsizing.I've watched so many movies and series about a guy who struggles to commit and settle. They are mostly romance genre films, and they are intended to instigate emotions and to call it out wrong. This time, I just sat down, listened to his side of the story, and understood where that fear was coming from (even though I did not empathize with the notion). Overused topic but told in a refreshing way.'Up in the Air' speaks about unemployment at the right time in the right way. Casting real-life people who lost their jobs rather than actors to record reaction to Ryan's script of dismissal increases the level of reality exponentially.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way to go George,"I was surprised with this film it took me to a place I was not expecting. This had the perfect combination of wit, charm, romance, and realism you could ask for. The movie was entertaining from the opening scene to the rolling credits. I did not find myself bored at any point of this movie there were no unnecessary scenes. The dialog was 5 stars, and the whole concept of the movie was original. This film reminded me of a great book, with excellent characters and a great plot development. George Clooney really blew me away with his character and delivery of Ryans performance. I do love George but he has played the same type of roles in the past, as for this role it took him to another level. Vera was a perfect compliment to George's Character , and Anna Kendrick really impressed me with her short career she was on point with her performance.

George Clooney + Jason Reitman = classic rom-com hit,"I attended the World Premiere of ""Up in the Air"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Co-written (with Sheldon Turner), directed, and produced by Academy Award-nominee Jason Reitman from a Walter Kim novel, the film features an all-star cast including George Clooney, Jason Bateman, Anna Kendrick, Vera Farmiga, and Melanie Lynskey.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life in hotels, airports, and on planes -- ""up in the air."" When companies need to downsize but don't have the cojones to send in their own people to do it, he's the one they're hiring to do the firing -- hatchet man at-large. It's not a life that lends itself to love -- trees need ground in which to grow. It's a classic rom-com premise that has all the makings of a hit.The film is primarily a vehicle for George Clooney and he's easily up to the task. There's quite a bit of sadness, though, which was unexpected. But a tour de force for Clooney and a clever script make it memorable. Co-star Anna Kendrick is a star to be reckoned with.""Up in the Air"" is clearly Reitman's vision and he's assembled a team that executes it perfectly. There are no bells and whistles here -- visuals take a back seat to the performers, and Eric Steelberg's cinematography is observant but not intrusive. Dana E. Glauberman's editing is efficient and economical.This film is so incredibly mass appeal that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. The audience was rolling in the aisles. Jason Reitman does it again with a true crowd pleaser.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie comes across in various layers, a man who flies and is bent on collecting the flyer miles, a man who wants to walk down the aisle on his sister's wedding, a man who sits at a place to fire people. Now it's the same and he has same kind of charisma and persona and a great dignity and in everything he does. He has a very understated style but nevertheless a style for sure.It's not a comedy, it's serious that does not make it a sob sob, it's a drama relevant to todays times. How do you feel if fired from a company? This film makes and observant look on such emotions but at the same not indulging much as it has got various other things to look at. I am happy to have seen this and each time I saw (3 in all for now) it brought to me the facets of a character that are so humane. This movie is very smart and slick and has all in it to be considered a modern classic.

"What's the meaning and purpose of all of it, our life,at the end of the day","What worked:
You know, it's one of those movies that you relate better and understand as you age with grace. I felt I loved the movie very much in my second viewing contrary to a nice movie in my first watch. The movie has a very heartwarming message and maybe that's one of the reasons that I found the movie to be a great one. As an adopted screenplay, the movie stands tall and proud, and I want to believe that the novel is as good and way better than the movie. Vera is one of those actors that I loved seeing on the big screen and she was great. George Clooney might have selected, if not the best then, one of his best project as a filmmaker and I was impressed by his portrayal. It's one of those movies that regard what's something we as a human aspire or something that's important in our life ultimately. The movie might not have answered our quest perfectly or make us happy with the happy ending we see in the movies, it still put out its message loud and clear and I think that's a very strong aspects of the movieWhat did not work:
The movie might not have an ending that we all want to see, meaning we might not be so glad with the movie ending because ,like in real life, it's not an happy ever after kind of movie. It's how it is and personally I don't mind the ending but sometimes we want an escape from our reality

Travel light,"Up in the Air has many corporate digs. Clooney plays a corporate consultant who criss crosses America firing people on behalf of bosses who are afraid to do so.He is a lone, solitary man with no baggage and a love of frequent flyer points. Hence when he gives corporate talks he always focuses on baggage straps that dig into you.His boss played by Jason Bateman sees the recession as a golden opportunity for growth for his company as it means more people will be laid off. When he hires a young, smart executive (Anna Kendrick) to fire people via the internet. It means less consultants who travel, he is even more buoyed.Clooney sees the flaws in these plans. After all he is skilled in these face to face encounters. If it happened via the computer, the sacked employee will just walk off with the computer!Clooney takes Kendrick on the road with him to give her some experience in corporate downsizing as well as travelling on planes efficiently.Along the way Clooney encounters a female version of himself as they have a romantic encounter and invites her to be a date at a family wedding.The film is a comedy drama which takes barb shots at corporate America. It also has an insight on the empty, shallow lives of some corporate executives who may be smart and can flee at a moment's notice with no possessions. This contrasts with the people they fire who have mortgages, families and bills to pay.Eventually Clooney reaches the target of his air miles but he is literally up in the air with nowhere to go.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Strong performances, likable script, lack of stereotyping","As firer-for-hire Ryan Bingham, George Clooney is perfectly cast in Jason Reitman's Up in the Air, and the script, based on a novel by Walter Kim, crackles with wit and maturity. Only a predictable final twenty minutes or so prevents the movie from being a bittersweet classic.Ryan is what you call a real frequent flyer; he's the proud owner of millions of miles in the air and scores of elite-status cards and chotchkies. His company sends him to other companies for the sole purpose of letting go staff, rather than having the senior staff do it. (Wussies.) Anyway, it pays very well, but Ryan's on the road over 250 days a year. But he gets star treatment literally everywhere, so it all works out okay.However, Ryan's boss (played by an oily Jason Bateman) wants to try something a little different. A newcomer to the team, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), has the bright idea of firing people remotely. This way road warriors like Ryan could stay at home, thus saving the company travel expenses. Bateman likes it, Clooney's Ryan does not – and why would he? He'd lose all the perks of traveling, probably lose a lot of salary, and have to deal with real life for a change. He pitches enough of a fit that boss Bateman sends him back on the road – with Natalie. You know, to show her the ropes.Which actually brings us to one of the more poignant parts of the film. We see Ryan lowering the boom on senior management and junior staffers alike, and their reactions (from acting calmly to pouring bleach in the coffee). Reitman actually brought in people who had just lost their jobs, so their reactions are more are less genuine (they were instructed to react either as they actually did when informed of losing their jobs or how they wish they had reacted). The theme couldn't be more timely, with the American economy doing so poorly and so many people out of work. Ryan has to deliver the news professionally and implacably, something that the straightlaced Natalie cannot always do.A secondary thread has to do with Ryan's relationships, those with his family and those with, well, other people in general. His sister is getting married, but he's so self-absorbed that he can't find time to care much about it. Then Ryan meets cute with a fellow traveler in an airport bar (Vera Farmiga) and falls in lust with what he sees as a kindred spirit.That's another important theme here, really: the perceived isolation in which Ryan finds himself. Sure, he's surrounded by people all the time, but he has intentionally never pursued any kind of meaningful relationship, choosing instead to put more stock in the elite status that million-mile travelers get.You might think that because Natalie is on the road with Ryan, the two will inevitably hook up. But this is a more-mature look at relationships than Hollywood is used to churning out. Typically, you'd expect physical sparks to fly, because Clooney is Clooney and age differences mean little in Hollywood if we're talking an older man and a younger woman. But both Kendrick and Clooney are lights-out amazing; Kendrick in particular is tremendously effective as the inexperienced go-getter. Natalie is certainly not perfect, but she's also not a one-dimension prude, either. In fact, the scenes in which she explains herself – whether it's to a group of downsizers or to Ryan himself – are where the picture truly shines. Kendrick's artful delivery evokes both sympathy and envy for Natalie, who's in her situation of her own volition and accord.And you might also think that because Alex (Farmiga) and Ryan meet on the road and have some fun that their relationship will immediately dissolve into a pool of boring. It's not so. Farmiga – a largely unknown quantity to me – was fantastic, playing Alex neither as another conquest for the Ryan Express nor as the kind of woman who will settle down with someone forever and ever. In fact, she's more than a match for Clooney in the charm department.The movie loses its way, slightly, near the end, when a twist arrives with as little subtlety as possible. You'll probably be able to spot the plot change from a mile away. That's about the only thing that keeps this from being a superb movie, a sagging denouement, but certainly the three standout performances are nothing to be sneezed at.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Underrated Masterpiece,"Prior to this movie, I didn't know who Jason Reitman was. Little did I know that I had watched most of his filmography before without ever realising it. Movies like Thank You For Smoking, Kindergarten Cop, Twins, Tully, Juno, and Demolition, were nothing short of masterpieces. Often forgetten but usually becoming cult classics as time goes by. Up in the Air is no different. I was exactly 15 minutes into the movie when I thought to myself, ""this is gonna be good."" From the writing, to the characters, to the flawless direction, this movie has it all. We all know Clooney is a good actor, but Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick's performances were absolutely incredible. For a movie made in 2009, it still manages to feel refreshing and unique. If you look closely, the moral of the movie is one that we've seen since the dawn of time. But predictable isn't the word I'd use to describe this movie.

Brilliant,"The story of a man, whose career is to fly around firing people, is well told by a writer/director (Jason Reitman), who cannot be fired because his employer is his producer/father (Ivan Reitman). This is a true Hollywood story; it's about an industry in which, as soon as a shoot wraps, everyone is essentially fired. To empathize or not to empathize: that is the question. Clever, charming George Clooney's job is to spin immiseration into something positive, even hopeful. Spinning is America's national pastime, especially in times of trouble, as when this movie was released. Clooney is challenged when he beds Vera Farmiga, who declares she's the same as he is, ""except with a vagina."" He's further challenged by Anna Kendrick, his young assistant, who can get emotionally involved at times with those dismissed. It would go well on a double feature with ""Patterns"" (1956). In his book, ""Psychopaths,"" published in 1972, Alan Harrington predicted that, in the future, psychopathy would become more widespread and acceptable than it ever had been before: ""Up in the Air"" illustrates this argument perfectly.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The audience for this flick would presumably be comfy white folks earning six-figure salaries, who can relate to all the emptiness that its lead character is striving to overcome. So who do we pity more--the director who thinks this message needs transmitting, or the dumb saps who will watch it and think it's really meaningful?

He's like the Grim Reaper in a suit and tie, delivering bad news with a smile and a handshake. But don't let his corporate façade fool you - Ryan's a man who's mastered the art of detachment, living out of a suitcase and drifting through life like a leaf in the wind.

She's like a breath of fresh air in Ryan's stale, sterile world, shaking up his carefully constructed routine and forcing him to confront some uncomfortable truths about himself.Up in the Air is a film that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, tackling themes of loneliness, identity, and the fleeting nature of human connection with wit and charm.

A good movie for a pleasant one-time viewing,"I know that many critics have gone into ecstasies over this film. It did not impress me to that extent. I thought it a fine film, well-acted. But I also found parts of it, where Clooney's character succumbs to the charms of the wife-and-two-kids life after giving no indication that he was unhappy with his single life, too unmotivated. At least the end was not a wife-and-two-kids end; I liked his decision to take off on his own.What I found most striking were the short scenes with the middle-aged individuals he was firing. Being a middle-aged individual threatened with the possibility of losing my job of 25 years, I hooked right into those. A closer study of their plights would have been a different movie, however.In sum, an enjoyable two hours, certainly, but not a movie that I have any desire or need to see again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great character movie,Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional hatchet man who fires people as a job. He is an expert flyer who gives lectures about how to pack for travel. He's good at his job and his most joyful goal is to attain ten million frequent flyer miles. He meets his perfect flying partner Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) at an airport bar. He deliberately avoids a personal life and his spartan apartment. His sister wants him to photograph a cutout of his niece and her fiancée at different places for their upcoming wedding. Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is a new hire with a new way to fire people by telecommunication. Bingham is dismayed at the proposal. His boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) forces him to show Keener the ropes.Clooney and Farmiga have a fun cerebral chemistry. They flirt well together. It's too bad that they can't be on screen more often. Kendrick is great at playing the uptight cute girl. She has a good fun mentor relationship with Clooney. It has some funny moments. The best is when the three leads finally get together. Kendrick in that scene is hilarious. Jason Reitman deftly handles these three characters beautifully. I'm not as enamored with the wedding section. It comes after Kendrick having such great scenes and then she's gone. Farmiga is back but the wedding takes too much attention away from her. The movie reaches a high point with the three leads coming together. I think the movie should have kept up that pace and the wedding took some of the steam out.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent!!,"*****Only minor spoilers***** Ryan Bingham has a job that has him travelling around the country firing people. He lives out of a suitcase as he travels around most of the year & he seems to love it in the air. But, when his company plans to ground him, Ryan isn't happy. He takes Natalie Keener, an extremely vibrant, young woman under his wing to provide her some insights to his work before they can ground him permanently.It deals with the sorry state of the economy last year. How it affected so many people & their families. This film works well on so many levels & the Oscar nominations for George Clooney & Vera Farmiga were well deserved. Even though Anna Kendrick did a very good job in playing Natalie, I didn't think that she deserved a nomination. Don't hate me for that. I love the Twilight films, this has nothing to do with her in those films. The background score really fits the movie well.I loved Ryan's character. Who wouldn't want to be like him (but just for a while though, you do want that someone special with you as you grow up). Jason Bateman also does a good job as the boss of Ryan. Jason Reitman has written & directed a wonderful story about a man who doesn't want commitments in life, who doesn't want to grow up, who thinks of himself as being a free bird. This is one of Clooney's better performances. The film can be watched again & again. I'm glad I watched ""Up In The Air"". This is about family values, how one shouldn't get afraid of commitments & one must be ready to have their hearts broken at some point in life. Vera Farmiga plays Alex, the woman who wants a casual thing with Ryan Bingham. Ryan & Alex are both funny, smart, don't want to be in a serious relationship & just seem to us, as an audience, the perfect people for each other.The one scene I really loved was when Natalie breaks down at the airport & starts crying & Ryan was just so unsure of what to do. I didn't think Anna Kendrick was a good actress before this, but she's absolutely an amazing talented actress. Each scene stays with you, long after the film has ended. The whole thing is good. This is one of those films which has to be in your collection.9/10-Girish, 20",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

As the story progresses, you feel for him. He gets hurt by his family and the person he wants to be with. There is a warm feeling in the heart when the movie ends. No one should be alone. Everyone deserves someone to brighten their life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of time and money.,"If I could give 0 out of 10 I would, as this film does not deserve a rating. The money would have been better given to charity. A completely awful film, wasted my time watching it as there was nothing fulfilling, gripping or moving. The second worst film I have ever watched after sex lives of the potato men. I cannot emphasise what a complete load of nonsense it was, there is no way anyone in their right mind could give a higher rating than I have unless they were drunk, stoned or in a coma. I honestly would have rather not watched it and I intend to never see it again. Actually if I ever see this on a shelf I will burn all copies of it as I would be doing anyone who has never seen this waste of time film a favour!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Film of 2009,"Whenever I watch a movie I attempt to put myself in the main character's position. In the case of Jason Reitman's Up in the Air I pictured myself as a person who makes a living traveling from place to place releasing people from their jobs, in which the majority of time they have at least ten years experience and have done nothing to deserve being let go. For me it would be an impossibility because I personally have a hard time being the bearer of bad news. However, for Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) firing people is simply a job, in which he believes is a necessity. Most people have been fired at least once in their lifetime, and for Bingham he attempts to make the experience of being let go as painless as possible. There are many people who believe movies should be created purely as a means to escape reality. If you are one of these people I would recommend avoiding Jason Reitman's Up in the Air, a film that prides itself on depicting realistic situations, characters, and relationships. I for one believe that in this modern time period our society can benefit from such a movie, because it explores the same individual and societal challenges most of us are experiencing presently. Up in the Air is a character study of a man who chooses to avoid relationships with all people because he has discovered that being alone is better than the complications that come with romances and friendships. However, after meeting the woman of his dreams he has a tough decision to make. Relationships are the cause of true happiness, but they also have the potential to produce misery. Perhaps a life a neutrality is the way to go. Up in the Air is not a movie that supports the actions of a particular character. Instead it simply presents realistic relationships and allows the audience to decide for themselves who is right and who is wrong. This is what makes Up in the Air so clever. This movie is one of the smartest movies I've seen in years, which for me makes it one of the best films of 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film but nothing spectacular or particularly memorable,"Ryan Bingham (Clooney) works for Omaha based Career Transition Counseling whose contracts are in corporate downsizing. His job is to meet employees face to face and subsequently fire them. Ryan flies around the US over 320 days of the year, which he feels is the best part of his job. A secondary job he has is to give motivational speeches on relieving one's life of excess physical and emotional baggage. Ryan's life may change when the company hires Natalie Keener, a young overachieving woman who recommends that the company change the nature of the work by conducting the ""firings"" via remote computer access. Ryan believes that Natalie does not fully understand the nature of the business, and as such, their boss, Craig Gregory, suggests that she accompany Ryan on a business trip. Ryan is also trying to protect his way of life, which now includes meeting up with a woman named Alex Goran whenever their flight schedules mesh. Like Ryan, Alex, who he met in an airport hotel bar, is constantly traveling for work.Up in the Air is a well made, entertaining and quite enjoyable film. There's no doubt about that. It's poignant, quirky and balances extremely well comedic moments with more dramatic scenes. However, it's not a spectacular film by any means. And although it touches some pretty interesting subjects, the film is predictable and quite conventional following the same formula and using the same gimmicks that so many other films use. The message of the film is clear; Man need connection, people need other people in their lives, we need significant relationships to be happy. No matter how happy Ryan thought he was in the beginning of the film, leading his independent and carefree life, he eventually comes to the realization that, like everyone else, he too needs meaningful connections, either if it's a lover or a sister, doesn't matter. The performances were all extremely solid with Clooney being very charismatic as always and newcomer Anna Kendrick showing quite a bit of potential.And yes, the film also has a certain ""extra"" relevance due to today's economy. There's millions of people loosing their jobs and the films shows a bit of how corporate America works and how ruthless it can be. There's no question that this is a film that deals with the real world, but again, there's nothing that impressive or striking about the film. And let it be perfectly clear that I enjoyed the film very much but, having said that, I would expect a film nominated for 6 Oscars to be outstanding. And I could address the fact that today the Oscars are nothing but a joke but that's a completely different subject. In conclusion, Up in the Air is a well made film, with a good script and solid performances. Just not what it's made out to be.7/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"Well Made, But Just Rather Blah","With a job that has him traveling around the country firing people, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) leads an empty life out of a suitcase, until his company does the unexpected: ground him.On a technical level, the film is well made. It looks good, the script is decent, and any film with George Clooney has to be at least mostly good. He is one of the great actors of our time. And the ""twist"" was predictable yet redeeming to such a standard romance. Heck, I even appreciated the political message of what it is like to be unemployed.But I found the mix of comedy and drama to fail, especially because the drama was so boring compared with the comedy. The balance was off. A few good moments -- with Sam Elliott and Young MC -- did not make up for the lazy romance, Anna Kendrick's atrocious acting, or the awful soundtrack.I still have to give it a good rating because, heck, it is still a good movie. But so much was unbalanced, and it would probably have worked best as a straight comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Don't See What All The Fuss Is About,"It's not to say that this isn't a good movie, but what's so great about it? Why is this considered award worthy? I'll grant you there are good performances, but the movie itself isn't quite as good. George Clooney is good here, but he's subdued. Aside from firing employees, and taking a young college graduate (played by Anna Kendrick) under his wing, what is the point? I am recommending the movie, but only as entertainment, nothing else. I enjoyed the movie, but basically, this is nothing special. I was expecting something conventional, say, for example, a hostage, or maybe Clooney and another employee his age trying to compete with one another. But, what we get isn't much of a story. And we also get a subplot about a family wedding, which I think could have been told more often during the whole movie. I was actually more interested in the wedding than I was in the main story.*** out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

First-Class Dramedy,"""Up in the Air"" manages to be funny, poignant, and troubling, often all at once. It's a film about people, jobs, and the fulfillment that these things do or do not bring. It's also director Jason Reitman's most mature and even film so far in his career.Protagonist Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) constantly flies from city to city to fire people. When a boss is too cowardly to let his/her employees go, Bingham steps in with his sleek suits and ominous ""new opportunity"" brochures. Like Aaron Eckhart's tobacco spokesman in Reitman's ""Thank You For Smoking,"" Clooney's Bingham is superb at what he does. From his cleanly efficient airport behavior to his awe-inspiring firing routines, Bingham is a force of nature; Clooney captures his bravado perfectly.The plot really opens when Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young upstart, introduces a new system to Bingham's company; firing sessions will now take place through a Skype-like video conferencing system. An outraged Bingham has no choice but to take Natalie along with him for his next round of sessions, so that he can ""show her the ropes."" The plot lifts off at this point, with some turbulence and some twists along the way.""Up in the Air"" works primarily because of its performances and its script. Clooney sells Bingham unquestionably as a loner who loves to travel. Bingham seeks fulfillment through the collection of Frequent Flyer miles and premium membership cards, but his vision becomes cloudy when a love interest enters the picture. As Bingham's potential soul-mate, Alex, Vera Farmiga is bold, funny, and mysterious. She has a Lauren Bacall sensibility, along with a unique sort of beauty. Yet, the heart and soul of the film is Anna Kendrick. As the film's most dynamic character, Kendrick is totally convincing and compelling. For Bingham, she becomes a wrench in the works. She seems to know her character so well that she truly becomes her for 100 minutes.For its first seventy minutes or so, ""Up in the Air"" is a charming romantic/career/teacher-student- comedy. It's hilarious and smart. The rest of the film is a bit darker; it forces characters to step out of the terminal and confront reality (that's as specific as I'll be). While there are still funny moments, the movie becomes more of a drama. Both the mostly-comedic and the mostly-dramatic segments work wonderfully, and the tonal shift feels wholly organic and inevitable.""Up in the Air"" is a great film, with great dialogue and great acting. It bodes well for Reitman and its three stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Disgusting Mess,"Oh, Jesus, where to begin. Not only does this movie offer nothing we haven't seen before, but it inflicts so much pain on the audience that by the time the end credits start rolling, you'll be wondering why you hadn't gauged out your eyeballs with rusty spoons instead.As is widely known, the acting in this movie is just flat-out atrocious. George Clooney hasn't been this dreadful since Michael Clayton, and Vera Farmiga hasn't skewed out something this awful since The Departed. Unfortunately, neither actor is capable of humanizing their rather one- dimensional character.As the movie drags on, audiences will realize that Reitman's rather boring and unconvincing narrative provides little to no substance. The movie ultimately is a mess, transitioning with one incoherent scene after another.Simply put, there are just too many cuts and transitions to make this movie effective. And that's not to mention the horrendous acting and the rather lackluster script. Huge disappointment.",,Anonymous,Romance
"I'm sorry kids, but Avatar, New Moon, and Alvin and the Chipmunks are in the OTHER theaters....","It's hard to exactly put into words just how great this film is. After observing Jason Reitman's rise to fame with such very good films as Thank you For Smoking and Juno, this film clearly cements him as one of the top directors working for intelligent adult audiences today.What Reitman actually accomplishes in this film through his screen writing, directing, and editing pretty much puts 95% of the other directors in Hollywood to shame. Unlike most Hollywood films that are made for marketing purposes to cater to a wide demographic in order to make cash, it's clear that this film isn't trying to please anyone or any studio executive. It never talks down to its audience by telling them how they should feel or what they should think, and never gives the audience any hint as to where the story is headed. I saw this film with my dad the other day, and he said that he was disappointed by the second half of the movie because it didn't have a message or any kind of clear resolution. I replied back to him...well that's what elevates this film beyond 95% of the mindless drivel out there in Hollywood these days! It's called originality. It's called allowing your audience to ponder what the movie was about, who the characters really were as people, rather than just going through the motions of a recycled, cliché-ridden plot (Avatar, anyone?). I also overheard a few women leaving the theater who thought it was OK, but were kind of disappointed that Clooney never got to fall in love and marry one of the women at the end! Oh no! God forbid Hollywood screenwriters and directors avoid romantic comedy clichés and actually tell us a realistic story about human nature and human behavior! (sarcasm)It's unfortunate that IMDb limits the number of words that I can use in this review, because I would like to write 10 pages explaining the greatness of this film. Where to start? 1) the movie is completely character driven, with all of the characters developed as 3-dimensional, likable, yet flawed people who are seen as very human and easy to relate to. Even Vera Farmiga's character, who we find out near the end is somewhat devilish, is seen as a human and likable person who doesn't know she is hurting someone else. The film doesn't care one bit about some kind of plot or climax, much like recent films ""Sideways"" and ""A Serious Man."" The characters just go about their daily business and we focus on who they are as people. 2) the humor and dialogue are outstanding because they focus on verbal wit and intelligent flirting/jousting rather than on stupid physical/slapstick gags. The ""R"" rating also allows the film to take risks with its dialogue because it can dare to go places ""PG-13"" films can't go. Most of this dialogue moves at a blistering pace, so you really have to pay attention to keep up. However, what really elevates this humor above that of other films is that it is so witty and based on normal human behavior! The 3 main characters all get a chance to shine comedically, but all of their comedy is based on realistic human behavior and genuine conversations people might have. 3) the film doesn't talk down to us an audience or preach to us about its message, but rather explores big ideas about work obsession, evolving technology, interpersonal connections, human desires, moral vs. immoral behavior, and lets us ponder them ourselves. The film especially focuses on these issues in its 2nd half, when the film suddenly stops being a laugh-a-thon and instead decides to become more dramatic and emotional. Some viewers may not like how the tone suddenly changes in its 2nd half, but I see it as a masterful move. 4) It's rare to see a romance between a couple that is older than the typical Hollywood romantic couple. Clooney - 40s and Farmiga - late 30s, and they are busy flirting and having as much fun as kids in a candy store! If there is one thing romantic movies these days usually tend to discriminate against, it's age. 5) Jason Reitman is working with very delicate material here, and the scenes with people being told they are fired are pretty emotional. Given today's economy, these parts may be a little too much for some viewers. Clooney's loneliness and search for a relationship are also pretty sad, but Reitman balances these emotions with the humor and wit wonderfully to not make the film either too humorous or too somber.The audience in the theater I saw this in was packed and about 2/3 female (I am a male), who were probably mostly there to see a romantic comedy starring Mr. super hunk Clooney. Yes, this film does have plenty of great comedy and plenty of romance. However, it is far different from your typical Hollywood romantic comedy that focuses on clichés and one-dimensional characters. It is much more of a thought-provoking, Sociology-oriented film about people's individual needs, characteristics, and motivations, and is especially relevant with regards to our current culture and society. In fact, most of the content of this movie should be of great interest to men, since at its heart it's about Clooney's sense of masculinity and how he allows his nonstop work schedule to act as a crutch to avoid any kind of deep, meaningful relationship he might have with a person. This is much more of an artsy, independent film than a typical Hollywood blockbuster aimed at making cash. With the 200 or so mainstream films released in America every year, only 3 or 4 of them are ever on this level of greatness. Adult audiences with intelligent brains who hate being preached to at movies should see this puppy 2 or 3 times to improve its box office profits. I know I am going to.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Was a letdown, VERY disappointed","Christmas weekend, visiting with family. My husband, son and I decided to go see Up in the Air since it has been tagged at ""best movie of the year""! It had George Clooney in it, which I thought meant that it had to at least be watchable. Do not waste your time or money. We were ""hornwswaggled""! Watching this movie was like watching paint dry. I'll start with what I did like: I have to say that the acting and character development were EXCELLENT. George Clooney is a fine actor and he is very easy on the eyes. The two lead women were excellent and developed their characters completely. What I did not like was the story. It was just a story of everyday living about a guy who travels all the time for business. When the movie was over I looked at my family and we all just shrugged our shoulders. It was just OK.

Timeless Treasure,"Ryan Bingham's tricky job involves trimming any additional fat ('fat' here synonimizing employees) from companies; he spends nearly three-quarters of the year travelling via air, dropping off at various locations to occupy one of the two seats in an isolated room, the other being alternated by the unfortunate workers who are to be sacked. His skill involves handling the situation tactfully and ensuring that they get the booklet that supposedly will bring them hope. And he is certainly a pro at his job, oscillating between multiple offices and seminar rooms to deliver his trademark 'baggage' lecture. He believes in 'advancing' at all times, and therefore rejects the prospect of marriage and family. His sister bluntly tells him that he doesn't even exist to them (the family). But Ryan seems contented with his lifestyle, and can't help dishing out his philosophy to anyone he meets.This egoistic ways of Ryan are punctuated by the arrival of two women who unconsciously bring a marked change in him. Natalie Keener is a young, sweet, confidant girl who has been recently absorbed into the company Ryan works in. She impresses the company's owner Craig Gregory with her cost-cutting idea of conducting the termination process via web-chat, something that irks Ryan for two reasons: (i) it seems crude and impractical and (ii) it would ground him to a place (of course, he doesn't disclose this personal reason to Craig). Craig instructs Ryan to take Natalie along with him and teach her the tricks of the trade. While journeying with the tyro, Ryan's initial animosity gradually depletes and it also acts as catalysis for his change. Natalie on the other hand is impresses with his convincing skills while rubbishes his bulls—t philosophy. The other woman is Alex Goran, a woman possibly in her thirties who indulges in sexual liaisons with Ryan and isn't squeamish about expressing her fervent hunger for lust. She can be called the female counterpart of Ryan as both seem to share not just similar opinions, but also similar gestures, facial expressions and movements. With Natalie's help, Ryan momentarily sees his life in a new light with Alex until his visit to her home.Prior to seeing the film, one assumes it to be a love triangle between the three characters from a glance at the poster. After watching the movie, one is very impressed with the outcome of Ryan's character while is disgusted by Alex's selfish behavior. Only with subsequent viewings can people truly appraise the true wealth the film possesses. Roger Ebert says laconically: the movie is about our times. I would instead say the movie is timeless, just like those grey-white clouds that hover above us as life goes. The most crucial question it puts up is: 'What is the point?' and ventures to search for an answer. The deeply philosophical and metaphysical concepts that it alludes to gradually leads to no concrete answer but makes us clearer about the essence of existence. Up In the Air does this without compromising on its mainstream appeal, thus making it accessible to all audiences.The movie is set up in the financial downturns in America due to the surplus lending by financial institutions. When the economy collapsed, a majority of the 'surplus' employees were given the pink slip. The affected had their families and fiscal burdens to worry about, and their unemployment aggravated their misery. These victims are one of the four important characters of the film. The second is Ryan himself, whose immaculate career record and self-perception is derailed by two ladies. The third is Natalie, whose burgeoning career and youthful confidence is affected by harsh realities she witnesses. The fourth is Alex, a highly misunderstood character who is being denounced as a b-tch by some viewers. I'll tackle Alex first: listening to her interactions, it seems her reaction at the climatic sequence was a form of snappy self-defense that was caused by the love she has for her kids. In a previous scene, she seems to discourse her opinion on ideal marriage with hint of sadness in her tone. This maybe because she felt happier with someone like Ryan but didn't have the courage to leave an unhappy marriage; rather than antagonizing her, I pitied her fragility. Vera Farmiga brings out these shades in her character effortlessly; she creates this flawed woman without making her last scene one-dimensional. The second one I'll take is Natalie. Look at her opening act itself and you'll see the put-on self confidence in her character as she effectively tries to convince her seniors. In the office scene with Ryan and Craig, she again tries to maintain her composure when Ryan questions her but then her anxiety gets the better of her. A wonderful performance from Anna Kendrick (sorry but just can't watch those Twilight series of yours) who retains the girlish charm (Never. Ever?) while molding the important aspect of the character as well (which is to show maturation). Clooney was absolutely tailor-made for the role; he can give us a poignant and memorable character even with his handsome face and mischievous eyes better than contemporaries like Brad Pitt. It's great that he manages to represent the movie as his character without letting his star-power consuming the movie's value.The last here I'd speak about are the fired employees. Despite the initial shock, they have their families to fall back upon. If Ryan Bingham has a fall, he has nobody to support him while Alex lives a perilous life that could potentially destroy her once the skeletons tumble out to everyone. In this case, only Natalie has the strongest chance among the three to build a life that would keep her happy and financially secure. The montage of the fired employees towards the end suggest living a stable life, down on the ground. The movie says: it's your life. Would you be up in the air, above all, or down on the ground, with all?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two stories in one,"The acting, cinematography, production values, and editing are first rate. There are gobs of good one-liners, even for more than one viewing. There are plenty of stellar views of flyover country, including those round irrigation circles in a square landscape. I've never seen so many different recognizable cities from the air. The shot of an airplane landing from the point of view of the airplane itself (not from the side of the runway) is even better than being there.Lots of fairly detailed strands of different subplots are woven together very well. It's sorta a comedy, but sorta serious too. It's one of those where after watching the ambiguous ending you leave the theater laughing, but at the same time thinking ""hmm..."".I was disappointed though that it's two different stories at once. There's the movie about the rootlessness of the frequent flyer, the connoisseur of tricks for faster boarding who uses his many club membership cards as a pick-up technique. There's also the movie about firing people, about sudden unemployment and what it feels like from both sides of the table. To a reasonable extent the two come together thematically: the emotional underpinning of the rootless frequent flyer is an awfully good base for firing people. As a former traveling software support person who became redundant, flying, computer technology, and layoffs all resonate personally with me. But those resonances don't dovetail in my mind like they do here; I'd prefer to see separate movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely a film for the times.,"In movies recently, American audiences are fed a lot of crap, frankly. We get the inevitable Saw VI, Alvin And the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel, and other tripe that American film goers seem to flock to. Rarely are we shown a movie that shows people for what they really are, and life, for what it really is, and even less frequently do audiences actually acknowledge it. And, for this holiday season, which is more or less a dumping ground for Oscar nominees and hopefuls, we are shown a bright, intelligent, fresh, witty, hilarious, yet depressing picture from some of the best in the business. That picture, my friends, is Up in the Air.Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man named Ryan Bingham, a ""corporate downsizer"", who goes from town to boring town, to fire employees, for businesses who don't have the guts to do it themselves. He's never had a real human connection in his life until he meets another frequent flier named Alex, lovably played by Vera Farmiga, who showed real, gutsy, raw talent in the criminally overlooked horror flick Orphan, earlier this year. Alex shares a lot of emotional stamina with Ryan, they click almost instantly. The chemistry that these two actors share is worth the price of admission alone.Later on, we meet an ambitious young worker named Natalie (a beautiful star turn by Anna Kendrick, who had a brief part in the Twilight movies), who has an idea to cut costs by conducting employee layoffs from the internet.After so many films a director makes, something of a trademark begins to appear, and Jason Reitman has his trademark down. And it's not a bad trademark like other directors certainly have. He has a knack for making emotionally relevant, and hilarious, yet deeply poignant and insightful films that are extremely watchable, and separate themselves from the usual Hollywood dreck that we're so used to.His last film, 2007's Oscar hopeful Juno did kind of the same thing. It gave us that salty- sweet combination, and a lot of memorable dialogue. I could only imagine what this picture would be had Juno's Diablo Cody written it. But Reitman, writing alongside Sheldon Turner, whose previous credits include 2005's remake The Longest Yard, which I didn't particularly care for. As I've said, the writing here is witty, hilarious, and completely realistic.Up in the Air is a very timely picture as well. Its major themes are corporate downsizing, and budget cuts. There's a scene in the movie where Natalie's boyfriend breaks up with her over a text message, and that's something that I know well, and I'm sure everybody else does as well. It brings up issues about how impossible love is if you're a member of today's generation, and that's part of what makes this movie so exciting.Up in the Air is a difficult movie to describe. It's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and there's romance, but it's by no means a romantic comedy, or a romantic ""dramedy"". There's triumph and tragedy, laughs, and tears. But what's so amazing to me about it, is how closely it relates to real life. It's real, and rewarding, and a movie I'd certainly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good and not so good.,"How does one go about firing someone? What is the best way to get rid of a worker? These questions are the basis of this movie which highlights the precarious nature of our existence. George Clooney gives a strong and convincing performance as man who lives his life according to certain principles and when he abandons his own principles winds up paying the price. This movie is rather offbeat and in some ways reminds one of the kind of movies made by John Cassavetes, with his semi-documentary style that emphasized reality over conventional story telling. For this movie is based on a theme that we can all relate to, namely the unpredictability of life. Whether this movie succeeds as an entertainment piece is questionable, but as a social commentary, it does have merit.There is a saying which goes something like this: know your limits. This movie completely ignores that maxim and the results are, not unexpectedly, a poorly crafted movie. While an attempt to explore the human condition is a commendable project, it may be asking a bit much for a Hollywood production company to do the job. Let's face it, Hollywood is good for churning out assembly line fluff but please, don't ask it to get into something as deep, serious and profoundly puzzling as the meaning of life itself. That is just being unrealistic, yet this movie, this Hollywood production, attempts just that, and not only does a poor job of it, but makes their effort even more embarrassing by trying to make light of the subject. You have a guy who basically lives in hotels and travels around the country doing corporate dirty work and we're supposed to expect that he has something serious to say? That he knows something that we don't already know? Yeah ... right. The theme of the rootless man was already treated in the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles with far better results because whereas this movie is heavy handed and flat, at least John Candy and Steve Martin brought some comic relief to an otherwise droll topic. George Clooney is an excellent actor for certain roles but he's no John Candy so don't expect the laughs that Mr. Candy would have elicited playing the exact same role. His acting is wooden, his demeanor flat, his persona null. It has to be his worst performance. There was a time when Hollywood had the creative capability to produce credible cinematic works that explore various aspects of the human condition but those days are gone, a relic of history, replaced by glossy special effects extravaganzas and dominated by the stunt men who are now the real stars. Let Hollywood do what it's good at and leave it to others to create more substantive work. After all, it's only a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Over-hyped and too subtle as satire,"Given the relentless marketing that accompanied this movie into theaters, expectations are necessarily going to be high. Unfortunately, for me those expectations set the bar too high for something I might have found more enjoyable absent the hype.Part of what made it hard for me to enjoy this movie was that virtually every character was over the top. On reflection, I see that that they were, in fact, caricatures and not meant to be believable characters. However that satirical aspect was a bit too subtle and they all came across as simply ""jumping the shark"", as it were. It wasn't billed as satire, it was billed as a tour de force for George Clooney and, as such, it falls somewhat short.Seen in the right frame of mind, I think this movie could be an enjoyable diversion.

"Good script and good cast for a bittersweet ""dramatic comedy""","There's comedy, but there's also much tragedy (the global job crisis being very actual and urgent), cynicism, some pettiness of everyday human life, false compassion. There's some necessity for a happy ending, which would be welcomed, obviously, but, without revealing the plot twist approaching the end, let's only that (some) women can be as repellent as only (some) men can be. One the whole, I liked this movie, being unexpectedly less predictable than it sounded, it gets to mix seriousness and fun with intelligence, above all thanks to a good script, never forgetting the tragic background it is rooted on. Good acting is delivered by the three main characters: Clooney has always that adorable but sometimes annoying (highly tolerable annoying, indeed!) face, but he delivers a really good performance, on the whole. Vera Farmiga, all refinement and enigma, plays her part in a perfect way. In the end, after one million of flight miles, the movie reminded me of a travel quote I once read on a plane while coming back home from a journey, it sounded more or less like this : ""No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow."", and I would add, until he rejoins those true dears who will listen to his travel account and will accompany him along the everyday journey of life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love love love love,"This movie hit me with all the feels.

Low-key version of Jerry Maguire,"Due to travel restrictions (or withdrawals,) finally found the time to watch Up In The Air starring George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick. Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, an outsourced corporation ""downsizer"": he is hired by different companies all over the country to lay off people in their office. This requires him to be traveling for the most part of the year and he comes across Alex (Farmiga) in one of his layovers. Natalie (Kendrick) joins him in one of his outings to get a feel of the business, being the new kid on the block. His interactions with both alongside a couple of personal stuff makes him rethink his philosophy in life that you need to have less In order to move more. More importantly, will his newfound direction in life stick?This is a great movie, the adapted screenplay is filled with many quotable quotes, enough to make you want to look for the novel by Walter Kirn. The characters were well-formed, they had their own personalities and they stick to their beliefs because that's who they are and not because that's how they want to be perceived. It's rare to see adults precisely portrayed as blunt and detached as Ryan and Alex and in that aspect Clooney's Best Actor and Farmiga's Best Supporting Actress nods were well-deserved. As for Best Picture, it's a little out of the league when compared to Up and Avatar, but then again The Blind Side also made it that year.An added point of interest for wanderlusts is the movie offers a peek into the world of frequent flyer miles and honorary memberships of hotels and car rentals. The perks, the incentives, the convenience, and personalized service offered when traveling is almost enough to make one become green with envy. With the pandemic grounding a lot of people, the only thing we can do for now is to live vicariously through Ryan and maybe learn a thing or two about how life, in general, is all very up in the air.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice Clooney Film but over-acted and over-rated,"I suspect most people will disagree with me but I found this film to be slow and generally boring, there was little acting in it for me and i don't find it a challenging role for George Clooneys acting ability, unlike in Burn after Reading and men who Stare at Goats, even Michael Clayton. As for the directing, not sure what to make of it cos I really liked the Juno movie.I know what its like Tobe e out of work, fired and to fire someone, we can all relate to the role play within this film both from the work standpoint and from the relationship standpoint as well also as the 'flying' standpoint.The title of the film carries a triple meaning - to do with flying too much, to be uncertain about relationships so 'up in the air' and to be up there when you re out of work.The idealology of the film is terrific, I just don't think it delivers and I might go along that Tom Cruise opr even Brad Pitt would have been better suited to the role than dear Mr Clooney who seems to want to grab all these types of roles for himself these days.Will be a travesty if Clooney wins Oscar for best actor. This film is very over-rated, slow to take-off, slow to land, predictable in many ways, not enough punch lines for a dramatic comedy .Even though boring, it IS enjoyable but I enjoyed Cloonety in 'Goats' so much more and Juno was definitely funnier. Maybe this film was aimed at a specific American audience, it just didn't deliver for me, sorry folks.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Forgettable,"Why was Up in the Air so widely acclaimed by critics and award ceremonies? It's the kind of movie that's so over-hyped that it makes me want to give it a lower score than it deserves. Because the fact is it's not a bad movie - it's just a decent one. I have nothing against Jason Reitman or his filmmaking style, but both Juno and Thank You For Smoking - flawed though they were - had freshness and originality that this one doesn't have. Reitman drew brilliant and surprising performances from Ellen Page and Aaron Eckhart; in Up in the Air, George Clooney plays the most stereotypically Clooney-ish character imaginable, and charming though he is, he doesn't seem to be putting enough effort into this. The writing is witty, the production is slick and the soundtrack is fantastic, but other than that it's a very mundane piece of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 7/10 plotline with moments of 6/10 dialogue finds salvation in a 9/10 execution,"Fairly short review here.The story is fine, but nothing to write home about. The film certainly has a rocky start in the dialogue department - main character Ryan Bingham (played by Clooney) has some head-scratching quotes with a key moment of the film revolving around his speaking engagements encouraging people to.. not have relationships? I also had a hard time buying the executive treatment for someone who's entire job could be replaced with an email (so I guess the video-call element of the plot makes sense) and it broke my immersion with the movie at several points throughout.Either way, the movie certainly course-corrects halfway through and ends with a nice mix of unpleasantly pessimistic yet realistic imperfection and a clean ending for most of the characters.Great performances by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Farminga. Especially Kendrick, who I think really shines in this role.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality,"Jason Reitman directs Up in the Air, a story he began writing in 2002 with Sheldon Turner when the US economy was thriving. It was supposed to be his first feature, but he ended up making Thank You for Smoking (2005) and Juno (2007) first. With the onset of the economic recession, the delay in Up in the Air's release became timelier.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)'s job has him flying around the country as a professional firer. He enjoys his lack of attachment and even moonlights as a motivational speaker to spread his philosophy of having no baggage, concretized by a convenient pseudo-relationship Ryan has with his lady equivalent, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Despite this, he successfully empathizes with the difficult, emotional turbulence firing people takes; he takes no joy out of this but he does have a secret wish: to rack up 10M frequent flyer miles and attain the ultimate elite card. So when his company takes on young upstart Natalie Keener (Twilight's Anna Kendrick), who proposes a cost-cutting measure by firing people online instead, Ryan has a lot more convincing to do, which could challenge the very core of the philosophy he preaches.I laud the way the characters are written because they are all complex. Clooney's role is so eerily reflective of how he portrays himself in real-life (being the eternal bachelor) that it isn't a stretch to see him play Ryan. However, his performance also allowed audiences a glimpse of his vulnerable side, which his usually cocky demeanor never shows. While Oscar Best Actress nominee Farmiga did her usual disrobing, the surprise this time is that she used a body double, having just given birth. Performance wise, her muted expressions were the perfect blend for the grand reveal her character delivers near the end. 1998 Tony Best Actress nominee Anna Kendrick was able to hold her own beside the two stars as Natalie; she successfully gets you to admire her, hate her and feel sorry for her all at once.If the clips of the people reacting to being fired makes you flinch at its rawness, it may be because they were real people who were recently laid off. They were reportedly asked to look at the camera as if it were the person who fired them and reenact what they did, or say what they hoped they had. Juxtaposing that with images of vacant office spaces made the scenes feel real for the audience, an effort that effectively translates genuine emotion on screen.I would have preferred a different ending, perhaps one that ties everything up neatly, but if the objective is to stay truthful, then life never really turns out to be that simple. We already know that we won't always get what we want, but in the off chance that we do achieve it, it sucks to sometimes realize that it wasn't what we expected; it's a toss-up between keeping lofty dreams and discovering the empty reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Down in the dumps at Up in the Air.,"At an hour and forty minutes, but feeling like 3 hours, this film is at least an hour too long. The film is made up of wodges of interminable dialogue, with a largely static camera focused interminably on Clooney's vacant grin. The action is inter-cut with air to ground shots of the various cities featured in the Clooney characters never ending flights around the country. These shots do not illuminate either plot or location, and one suspects they are a handy way of stretching thin material.Almost every character in the film appears to have been cast for, at best, plain looks, and at worst for ugly. Whether this is a sop to the vanity of the lead, or whether the director believes this lends some sort of realism to his film is unclear. Either way it is no incentive to like or care about anyone one sees on screen. I am not, by the way, referring to the hapless workers whose sackings are the background of the film. Anna Kendrick who plays the new girl at the company is ferret faced and unengaging, with a peculiar one dimensional performance. But then one cares not a jot about anyone in this cheerless, dreary, depressing film.Why it should have been nominated for any award except Turkey of the Year is a great mystery.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"With a fantastically executed story, some great direction, and some wonderful performances from Clooney and many alike, Up in the Air proves to be more than what could have been a simple dramedy film and achieves the high goals it needs on nearly every level. The script is mapped out beautifully, with such definition and complexities for each character, you can't help but feel at least a little bit for everyone, and with the story's journey throughout- its so incredibly entertaining it will simply feel too good to be true at times. Clooney is fantastic as Ryan Bingham and brings his total A-game to capturing this performance in the most human way possible. Other standouts include, but are not limited to, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, who also prove their acting skills to unforeseen heights before. The film is quite funny at times, but never at times where it feels too forced or out of place, the timing seems perfect. The pacing feels this way as well, and the emotion conveyed is almost stunningly perfect. In the end, Up in the Air is truly one of the best films of the 2000's and displays the best of all talents involved.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Up in the AirIn this dilapidated economy, I wouldn't be surprised if commercial airlines had to start making some major in-flight cutbacks. For example, reducing snack-size pretzel portions or implementing a ""no flush"" rule in the lavatory. Fortunately, for the frequent-flying corporate downsizer in this dramedy, things haven't deteriorated that drastically.Drawing closer to ten million frequent flyer miles, Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) solitary life of constant travel, confrontation and anonymous sex is interrupted when he must show a rookie, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), how to do what he does.Polar opposites when it comes to relationships, Natalie questions Ryan's emotional seclusion, causing him to confront his feelings for fellow friendly-flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga).A fitting tale for our troubled times, Up in the Air captures the economic climate and its vile repercussions, but, regrettably, its mawkish moments and unsavory characters make it hard to love.However, I do advise that you never fire a pilot while they're working.

Neither In The Sky Nor On Earth,"As the Croatian title for this film that practically explains the movie ''Neither In The Sky Nor On Earth'' this is one of those movie you want to watch when you feel like relaxing, as any other George Clooney movie, i guess.

"""Up In the Air"" is dry, dull, lacking emotion and tries to be intelligent about existentialism","Heard wonderful things about this film (mostly through the critics) and was looking forward to it but after seeing it at the Arc Light Theater last night I am wondering what all the critical praise is about? Is it coming from the influence of the heavy hitters on the cast like George Clooney, the Reitman father-son combo, or the studio? Not sure, but I am sure that the film is dry, dull, boring and did not move me in any way (and the audience in the theater).Some summary: Ryan Bingham (played by Clooney)is at home in his infinite aerial travel. He flies to offices where his job is to fire other people out of their jobs in a calm, cool and hazard free manner. He has a great travel routine, preferred rental car and hotel stay and seems to enjoy his away from home traveling lifestyle. He enjoys short flings with women as long as they stay in a controlled routine and do not affect his routine. In his life appear two significant women -- a young upstart (Kendrick) who threatens to reduce his travel with a Computer Chat methodology to fire people and a sexy traveling professional woman (Farmiga) who reminds him of the lack of substance in his life in spite of his concealed need for it.Well, that summary sounds like the makings of a good film and it could have been but the actuality of the filmic execution was poor. The acting performances of all the characters seemed so held back and unmoving and they are good actors so it must have been the screenplay or the direction. The comedy was dull -- primarily because of the pretentious dialog (look for the Cancer/Can Sir joke in the plane) -- and most jokes fail except for a sympathy laugh that you must give because they are so obviously in need of a reaction.The camera work as well is boring and when it does pick up it is inappropriate. We see rapid pans and the Steadicams pushes in quick when Clooney is explaining his travel routine expertise and I felt that these camera moves would be better for a ""Bourne Ultimatum"" film or a ""James Bond"" film. The rest of the film has slow dolly moves and traditional framing -- nothing good or bad to say here, just a display of uninspired camera moves.The screenplay is at best relevant because of the current job cuts and economic climate. The majority of it is an attempt to appear clever and substantial but it pales in comparison to films who really execute this like ""Annie Hall"", ""Sideways"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"".I usually like Clooney but in this film his performance is too cool, too reserved and unmoving. I suppose the real flaw is in the writing and directing of Jason Reitman -- he, thus far, appears to be a mediocre talent who seems to be getting his way with the Awards and Critics not on merit but on the influence of his father Ivan Reitman and other influential forces.Some positive notes: I have to say that the Opening Credit sequence was well done and so was the use of purposeful hollow or full fonts in the films inter titles. Also the color correction was strong -- they use mostly cool and clean colors to punctuate Clooney's isolation and only use warmer, richer colors when he is at his sister's wedding falling in love with the character played by Vera Farmiga.This year 2009, so far, unlike last year, looks fairly weak for the Oscar season -- ""Invictus"" and ""Basterds"" seem to be the only strong films; and if ""Up In The Air"" gets a Best Picture nomination or win we will look back only critically at the nomination and forget the film. Maybe I do not ""get"" Reitman's style because I found ""Juno"" boring, over-hyped and definitely not deserving of an Original Screenplay Oscar Win as well; ""Thank you for Smoking"" was passable to me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Firing people, a business that knows no crisis... in fact, it counts on it!","""Up in the Air"", from 'hip' director Jason Reitman, takes us back to that traumatizing year of 2009 where the future couldn't look any grimmer and anyone with a job felt like belonging to a Forbes club. I'm talking from experience, following that hypocritical euphemism, P&G ""let me go"" at the end of 2008 and for six months, I couldn't count how many jobs I've applied to, how many fresh alumni friends I reached out to, and the same answer kept popping up: right now, we don't hire. I finally got me a job but that was a close call and it wasn't in Europe anyway; the crisis hadn't spread yet to North Africa.But how about Ryan Bingham's job? Surely one that was begging for a film adaptation: his mission is to travel all around American big cities... to fire people! Their bosses don't have the guts to do the dirty work, it might seem ludicrous but it's not that easy firing someone, it means a lot of paperwork, many legal ordeals, the kind of stuff you'd better leave to a specialist with a smile as polished as his briefcase. And that job reminded me of a gag from the ""Simpsons"" episode when Bart's ""Angry Dad"" was published on the Internet; realizing the company went bankrupt, he's socked that ""Bubbles can burst"" and one of the workers who came to collect the furniture say ""It's a Golden Age for the repo business"". In the worst financial crisis after a certain Black Thursday in 1929, Bingham's company is living a real Golden Age.The merit of Reitman is to deal with a very unpleasant subject, one about people's lives being ruined basically in a rather tactful manner, and still making Ryan's job exciting to some degree, after all, it's not exactly life and death situation (although...). The film starts with a visually delightful opening sequence showing many air-view landscapes of American cities, the sequence provides the sort of dreamy imagery that might even cure someone who's got fear of flying (including myself). These are the sights Ryan enjoys on a daily basis, spending more days aboard planes under cotton-like clouds than Irish people under a rainy sky. The sequence provides us comforting images before we discover what the game is about.The film opens with various documentary-like reactions of people seeing their existential edifices collapse, It's touching and poignant but never pathetic, a sequence with Zach Galifianakis sets up the job in a didactic way, it's all about selling the same speech, telling people that anyone who ""build an empire"" sat in a similar place and that's what strengthened them. Looking at these people's devastated faces, we know they don't buy the line, but somewhat they accept it because they're at such a low point that anything cheerful is welcome. In another wonderfully written scene with J.K. Simmons, his character says at one point ""you're supposed to cheer me up"". Bingham knows he's got to deal with adult and rational people but in a very irrational and emotionally fragile situation. It's a tough job and he takes it very seriously.And one thing for sure, after the first expositional act, we get the idea; Bingham travels across airport check-points as smoothly and confidently as Henry Hill taking Karen from the side-entrance to the restaurant in ""Goodfellas"", it's his territory, his reason to be, as he says ""to know me is to fly with me"". Hotels are his second domain, in one of them, he meets Alex (Vera Ferniga) a woman whose job is never explicated, but all we know is that it exposes her to the same routine than Bingham. After a few introductions, they compare their bank cards and their experiences with car rentals and hotels and Bingham reveals his lifelong dream, collecting one million miles, and the dialogue in that scene, with all its double entendre is one of the film's delights. There's a reason Clooney was perfect for that role.There's a lot of 2009 Clooney in that competent man but estranged to his family or the very notion of family living occasional romances with no tomorrows. It's a hackneyed sentence but it fits him perfectly, he's the man ""married to his job"". But one woman might contradict this plan, a pint-sized ambitious newcomer who came up with a new idea: in-sourcing. Why go to the extent of travelling all around the world when everything can be settled through videoconference? The boss (Jason Bateman) finds the idea interesting, but Bingham finds the right way to tell her that technology isn't exactly the best way to handle human relationships and suggest an initiating tour so she can understand the real intricacies of the business. As Natalie, Kendrick plays the opposite of Alex, she goes from confidence to disillusion while the more mature Alex is confident but resigned. In many aspects, they're the most human characters of the film and the indirect triggers to Bingham's hidden humanity hidden under his cynical armor.There's a little running gag involving a miniature picture of his sister and future husband he carries in various places like that gnome in ""Amelie"", but it takes the relationships with both Natalie and Alex to grasp the emptiness of his life. Natalie's idealism might be shaken but never turn into cynicism, as for Nathalie, a scene had me scared: when Clooney left one of his darling conferences about his 'backpack' metaphor, racing across the airport, I was afraid it would be one of these contrived 'declaration' scenes but it's fascinating the way the film tie the two themes together: love and jobs.The final montage shows fired people saying how they went through it thanks to their family or their beloved one, it's not just a light of hope but a challenging ending after a fascinating character study: can you live without a job? Or without love? One is for a living? But is living possible without the other?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Irritatingly smooth ""americana""","I don't neglect the virtues of this universally acclaimed Oscar nominee. I cannot. No, sir. It has perfect editing, superior narrative fluidity, well written dialogue, a leading man so charming that can sell you a concentration camp as a lifetime vacation in the Caribbean These seem to be enough to get you an Oscar nod these days. This excruciating film by most recent keeper of the American faith, Mr. Jason Reitman, of the Juno reputation (another freak example of Midwestern voice with a coastal accent), chooses its hero to be a man who enjoys firing people of their jobs and coveting air-travelling mileage. The second gets reasonably resolved; the first seems to be perfectly OK with the filmmakers. People are disconnected in our fragmented times, they are in a continuous transitory state, metaphorically ""on air"" each and every moment. We don't criticize; that's just how things are – who wants to be accused of didacticism anyway?Furthermore, an unbearable filmic transition from the purity of physical attraction to the life-altering joys of domesticity takes on gradually. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against companionship, family love, whatever. It just is not the case for everyone. Let me phrase it otherwise: I enjoy Nora Ephron films; this one can be Ephron-cute.

Another Great Film About Men,"There are are a lot of movies out there about machismo. About a million of them. But there are very few about masculinity, and only a few of them are really good. The thing is, these films are difficult to review because people tend to get emotional about them. They hit us where we live. Men (and women) just get all worked up about them. They cause normally reasonable people to go all weird.The most recent examples of the genre are ""There Will Be Blood,"" ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Up in the Air."" These are movies that explore the dark side of masculinity with flinching. They illustrate aspects of being male that have been, almost always, glossed over with macho nonsense. They explore what it means to be masculine.What makes ""Up in the Air"" different from most other films of this type is that it is very, very NOW and features a lot of cool technology. But the story is the same in that it is about what is going on inside the mind of a man--in this case a man who has found a new way to to be an isolated, alienated man. He's found a home en route to somewhere else. He is perpetually going somewhere. So much so that his home is in the air.This is not so different from other men who choose to live as ""lone wolves"" but in his case he's managed to integrate it into a high-paying career. What a country! But the film is not about how a guy can just travel all the time on the company dime, it's about being a predator and living, literally, like a wolf and loving every minute of it. As my wife said, it's the ""hunter thing"" again. Guys like to hunt alone and kill stuff. Is it really so surprising that the guy in this movie likes to travel alone and ""terminate"" people? The fundamental question-- ""what is home?"" is asked again and again. As the film develops, it becomes clear that a man is only as stable as his home--whatever that may be--and if you throw a man out of his home--even if it is in the air--even the ""coolest customer"" may panic and behave irrationally until the ""stable home (in the air)"" is restored.A masterwork, highly recommended. But not for kids. In fact, I wonder if you really need some gray hair and to be a little condescending to younger people to really ""get"" this movie.Sorry if that sounds condescending...",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lost in flight,"Up in the Air is a drama, comedy, and romance all packed into one. Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney, fires people for a living. His coworker, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, comes up with the idea to fire people remotely to limit the amount of traveling for Ryan. Ryan decided to take Natalie with him, to show her how important it is to be face to face with the person you're firing. While helping Natalie, Ryan begins hooking up with Alex, played by Vera Farmiga, who is also always traveling for work. He later realizes the connections he's lost with his family and how it's has made him view things. This film sheds light on the theme of struggles of work travel and the personal connections Ryan has because of it. Similar to the idea of On the Road (2012), this film shows the unknown of what will come to Ryan as he travels, like maybe a plus one?!
The close up shots of Ryan later on in the movie on the plane bring out the sadness he feels for barely having connection with his sister that is about to get married. Long shots are used to show the lack of personal connections Ryan has with his family. They show how far away he's really been from them. In opposition to that, close ups are used to show the emotions Ryan has when he feels connected with his family vs. when he doesn't.
Lighting also helps portray Ryan's mood. In the beginning of the film, like when he met Alex, most places he goes are dark. By the end, most places are bright, like at his sisters wedding when he's dancing and having a good time with Alex. This seems to show the progress he's made, just by being with his family for a short period of time.
I believe this film is trying to show the viewers that traveling all the time for a job can be difficult and it can diminish many relationships, but at the end of the day, it is still possible to be close with family and have healthy relationships, if you put in the effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Every time you buy a ticket...,"you hope it's going to be a movie as good as this one.Jason Reitman puts together a superb cast, a polished production crew and some terrific writing, cannily, with a film premiering at a time when 10% of the American workforce is without a job. It's a movie about a ""terminator,"" a man who is employed for difficult situations when someone needs to be fired. It's a lucrative profession, and Ryan Bingham (another sensational performance by George Clooney) loves his work. Not only does it afford him a life in travel, but he has the notion that he cares for the people he's employed to fire, letting them down easy so they don't gopostal.While the performances are perfection, it's the screenplay that shines. Without apology, it meanders over and through (deeply in some cases) many aspects of modern life, scoring bulls-eyes each time. One part of the film is a romantic comedy, another a treatise on how to tolerate a difficult coworker, but it all adds up to the toll that modern life has taken on our emotional lives, effectively neutering all feeling and interpersonal joy for the good of the ""the company."" And as soon as you become irrelevant, you're tossed out and left with a packet of instructions on how to put your life back together againon your own, someplace else.While the audience may be ahead of the script in some instances, how it's all played is just off center enough that every twist is enjoyable. Clooney gets amazing support from Vera Farmiga, a seductress who makes you believe you're doing the seducing, and Anna Kendrick as a thick-headed youngster who we watch both learn a few things about living as well as teaching her elders about what is really valuable at the end of a workday. Kenkrick's role is the trickiest and she pulls it off with a kind of daffy dignity that gives the movie its charm.This should dominate the award season.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not What I Expected,"At first I thought this was gonna be a movie which glorifies 'alone' lifestyles and all those elite status. I mean, I wasn't wrong. but midway it sort of changed into a rom-com which i don't quite understand? and ends with a pretty sad ending.
overall, performances both by clooney and kendrick were nice. some pretty funny lines here and there. a lot of airplane shots and product placements.
this movie is probably for you if you're looking for a light movie with moderate twists. also if you really enjoy airport scenes and george clooney.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Cocktail of Romance, Drama and Comedy - Perfectly Blended.","Why did I like this film? I'm trying to get my head around what exactly made this film so lovable. Was it the romance, the drama or the comedy?An intriguing characteristic of this movie is that it doesn't seem to really find itself in any specific category of film. It's neither a romcom nor a drama....it's just a story. However to simplify this film is failing to do it justice, especially to a film packed with complex moral undertones and nuances of ever-growing characters, both which create a solid foundation for Clooney's brilliant performance. The characters are all flawed thus relatable and the story is told with such flair and pace that one never seems bored.I offer perhaps a biased view when it comes to George Clooney – as I tend not to take him wholly seriously, and, for this reason was somewhat dumbfounded by the way he showed he does indeed possess an all-round acting talent – I guess reaffirming that what he achieved in Michael Clayton was not a total fluke! Clooney begins 'Up in the Air' showcasing his typical brand of performance that we have grown to associate him with, contributing to the first 25 minutes resembling an extended version of his recent 'Nespresso' adverts – of course once you watch the film, you'll see that there is nothing wrong with this as it fits the bill of Ryan Bingham rather well. As the story progresses you witness an incredible transformation in the acting; with Clooney slipping from the perfect man to a lost soul in the most subtlest of ways, subtle in a way that makes it believable.Finally the supporting cast is much more than supporting and there's no surprise that Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick have been nominated for Golden Globes in this category. Neither is it any coincidence that all the best/memorable scenes involve the character of Natalie Keener – who, ultimately gives 'Up in the Air' the necessary X-Factor to be Oscar-worthy.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Believe in the Hype,"Up in the Air, based on the book written by Walter Kirn, is a solid masterpiece and my favorite movie of the year. It perfectly shows how our economy is affecting people's lives.The film follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) a man who works for a company that other companies around the world hire to let go their employees. So he has to fly all around the country to do his job. His main goal in life is to be the 7th person ever to get 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles. Then, a young woman named Natalie (Anna Kendrick)who works for the company brings up an idea to Ryan's boss, saying that it would be easier for them to fire people using video chat. This, of course, upsets Ryan, as this will mean he won't be able to get his 10,000,000 miles. He brings up to his boss that he doesn't think it's a good idea, he is then allowed to fly around the country firing people again, but this time, he has to bring her with him. He then meets a woman along the way named Alex(Vera Farmiga) He begins to fall for her, but always dismisses that fact when he is pestered by Natalie to find somebody to love.Up in the Air is a phenomenal film. It really shows what life is like right now for some people, and it has a great message about what is important in life. Definitely see this movie. I can assure you that you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What are we rooting for in this movie?,"What did George Clooney's character want? Who knows? At first he wants to stay on the road. But once he goes back on the road with the girl he doesn't seem to even try to prove his usefulness. Then when he gets the phone call from his boss that they are both being called back home he has a ""whatever"" attitude about it. So as an audience what are we rooting for???? The script was flat and boring and the ending was abrupt as useless. There was really no beginning middle and end. Just a lot of mindless depressing muddled middle. Why? What was the point?A good script has the character striving for a goal. We relate to that goal and want him or her to attain it. However when that goal is absent as in this dreck we disconnect because we are not sure what to root for to satisfy the character. Also good scripts have a ending that satisfies us rather than an open ended ending that just leaves us confused as to why we wasted our time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely Charming,"Up in the Air (2009)**** (out of 4)Wonderfully charming film in the same tradition as many Frank Capra movies has George Clooney playing Ryan Bingham, a man who believes in being by himself as his job takes him across the country the majority of the year where he must fire people. When a new woman (Anna Kendrick) enters the picture with plans of changing the company, Ryan takes her on the road and shows how difficult the job can be and why simply firing someone over the Internet isn't going to work. Ryan also finds himself getting involved with his family for the first time in years and a relationship (Vera Farmiga) that might change his views on life. This film blends comedy and drama unlike too many films I've ever seen. The laughs are never loud ones and the drama is never earth-shattering or something devastating. I must admit that the gentle nature of this film is what really grabbed me and wouldn't let me go as we've seen this type of story before yet the performances here are so fresh and the screenplay so sharp that you'll feel as if you're seeing this stuff for the very first time. Taking a cue from Capra and throwing in current political drama, the film takes a real look at unemployment and the drama behind such events but this is used to just make our three main characters a lot stronger and I thought this back burner story of this really added a lot to the movie and something we wouldn't normally see. The screenplay stays an a neutral tone from start to finish and even though there are funny moments, serious moments and some rather sad moments, the movie keeps everything at the same level and I really found this tone to perfectly fit everything that was going on. It should come as no shock but Clooney delivers another very strong performance as while watching him work it dawned on me that there's not another actor alive that could have played this role and made it work so well. Clooney has a certain laid back charm that perfectly fit this character and you can't help but fall for this charm while watching the film. He works extremely well with the two female actresses and I'd probably say that the romantic side to all of these perhaps gives us some of the best chemistry of any film of the decade. The stern Kendrick perfectly fits her role as she's so naive in some of her thinking that you can't help but like her. Farmiga is really becoming one of the best actresses to watch in today's cinema and she once again delivers a very memorable performance. The sexual chemistry between her and Clooney is quite erotic and the charm they give off really makes the film something special. We also have Jason Bateman in a nice supporting role as well as Sam Elliott in a brief part. This type of film isn't easy to pull off by director Reitman handles it all extremely well and makes something pretty special. Even though the movie was pushed as a Hollywood film, it's certainly far from that as there are certainly a few twists and turns that you wouldn't expect.",,Anonymous,Romance
The World May Never Recover!,"I am a firm believe that technology is about to be the death of us and I mean in the not too distant future. We have released the monsters and they will consume us. I hope I'm wrong but it certainly looks like we have separated ourselves from the directly dealing with fundamental human issues. George Clooney's character is at least trying to keep a hand in the past; at least he faces the people he fires. Back at the office people are so excited about being able to cut throats from a distance and let the chips fall where they may. Of course, there is the obvious situation of their own jobs potentially being jerked from them without a by your leave. In ""The Box,"" a recent film, people can become rich by killing off someone they don't know by pushing a button. Of course, most of the world doesn't know them. It's a dangerous game. The corporate world has become so incredibly warped and the machines we build that make our lives so much fun have put up walls like we wouldn't believe. I loved the movie because it still years for some humanity. Clooney is right, even though his work is cruel and dangerous. His return home is very effective and he finds his muse before it is too late, despite his own painful realizations.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"about an ""issue"", but also about the characters and a bittersweet lot in life","Jason Reitman is a filmmaker that cares about the issues of the day, or of some day or other. But I don't think he consciously goes out of his way to make a ""statement"" about lobbyists and tobacco with Thank You For Smoking or about teen pregnancy with Juno. Such as the case with Up in the Air, I think he was attracted first, from the book his film is based on, by the characters and the story of this particular guy with a very uncomfortable, morally repugnant but somehow available job of being sent across the country to fire people, personally, and send them on their merry way. Yet right now, even more than teen pregnancy or the demons of lobbyists, unemployment is hitting many people, everywhere. In Detroit, a city that's featured in one particularly disturbing scene in this film, the unemployment level is somewhere between 30 and 40% depending on the time of day.So it's bound to strike a chord with people, not least of which because of Reitman's usage of real people who have been fired featured in the film, spouting off to Clooney's Ryan Bingham, angry or teary or berserk or, in one most troubling case, perfectly calm. And yet what makes Reitman a strong storyteller is not that he cares first about hitting the hammer on the audience with the message (he's not, say, Paul Haggis with his dramatization), but that he wants to tell this story of a guy who we might not even know actually exists, until that moment he steps into a room and fires someone. Or, perhaps, one sees in a hotel reception room giving a presentation about ""How to Backpack Your Life."" It features a sharp screenplay that's wise about the nature of human connectivity, the lack of it in this character, and his realization of what's missing in his efficient but cold life.What's also clever in the story is how Ryan Bingham, played by an as-always cool and witty and very slightly vulnerable George Clooney, is also not entirely safe with his own job. His work of going out on the road, which he does more than 3/4 of the year, is threatened by young upstart Natalie's 'fresh' idea of putting a computer-cam link up so people can be fired right over their monitors. She goes out on the road with Ryan, however, and sees how it's really done, the actual humanity that goes in the process of telling someone they've been let go (not to mention the equally unsettling task of handing a booklet over on starting over). It's through this road trip that we see Natalie's own weaknesses revealed, but more-so she brings out some of the ambivalence of Ryan, too. Mostly as Ryan has a fling with a professional woman also on the road (Vera Farmiga), and what really unfolds from a seemingly safe, long-distance romance.Oh, there are one or two little scenes that do get in the way of it being truly phenomenal (there's one scene in particular, as Ryan and Natalie, charming and shrewd played by Anna Kendrick), argue on a pier, where she lays out everything wrong in Ryan's life, and it's too-spelled-out for the audience when we know what's wrong or conflicted already). But these shouldn't get in the way of what is another success for Reitman as a filmmaker. He navigates this tale of this man who is so comfortable with the ritual of travel, of hitting that impressive and pathetic plateau of ten million frequent flier miles, that he can't see any change ahead, either in that or in how he views his life with his family or his potential love interest. I won't reveal what happens between Ryan and Alex, but it's easy to say that it's not an easy turn out to the story. Just when you think Reitman's starting to get a little too comfortable with his characters and pleasant situations (i.e. wedding scenes), he pulls the rug out, and it makes sense completely.Up in the Air is funny, but completely disarming in equal beats (sometimes equal scenes) by it's tragedy. It's bound for Oscar contention and it deserves it, for its intelligence and observation and performances, all top notch. It's of and for our times without forcing it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up in the Air leaves it hanging,"A smart script and great actors don't require massive budgets or complex sets. This film is a typical Clooney venture into an intelligent world where he is a man with no soul and doesn't realise how empty he is until he runs into Vera Farmiga.George is magnificent in the way he down-plays his role: is it a romcom? maybe. A drama? Maybe. But what it is - for sure - is a film about someone who makes a living out of firing people for those who haven't got the gumption to do it themselves. He's shown how out-of-touch he is with modern life by the geeky but cleverly played young gun (Anna Kendrick).George spends his life up in the air, literally and metaphorically, and makes us ask the question of ourselves.Intelligent film-making.

"""What do you want?""","What do we want? Sometimes our life isn't enough to answer that question. We live day by day and we don't have the time. Ryan Bingham is asked, two times by the same person in Jason Reitman's ""Up in the air"": ""What do you want?"". He can't come with the answer. He travels through the world firing people for a living and doesn't have trouble sleeping; we hear his voice-in off saying the air is his home, the airports a reminder that everything's fine; we listen to his conferences that are all about leaving any luggage (literal and metaphorical) behind, and yet he seems unable to decide what he wants. He lives by a philosophy. And it appears that it's something he chose and defends, we can tell in conversations with the two women that get in the middle of his systemic, comfortable life. Well, not everything we choose is necessarily what we want.Ryan Bingham is played by George Clooney as the kind of man you wouldn't want to mess with. It's not the most appropriate thing for his line of work, but Clooney has that ability to make us believe he's the best at what he does and that's what we think of Bingham: unstoppable, flawless, cold hearted man with a perfect smileAnd classy too (you know, we're talking about George Clooney here). He did almost the same thing in ""Michael Clayton"", except for the smile. In fact, Bingham is so confident that he falls in love and is sure that everything will work out fine.I think ""Up in the air"" is a very good movie because Reitman makes sure that we never leave that place. He presents a character and provides him with a 'turning point' that any Hollywood movie would end up in plain happiness –in fact, his own ""Juno"" did just that- and decides to put everything on hold. Every time Bingham is on the ground, whether it is for a family wedding or a job meeting, we can sense that the air is calling him. It's something the movie makes us feel with elements: a melancholic music filled with acoustic guitars, some looks from Bingham, some smiles that don't seem completely right. The trick is that this doesn't have to be something sad. It's just what it is.We listen to the sound of backpacks closing, magnetic cards beeping, cell phones ringing. That's how it is in the air. A woman, Kate (Vera Farmiga) arrives and sounds like the perfect mate for that safe, suspended life. She seems to share Ryan's philosophy. Then another woman, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), younger, impulsive and willing to learn, sounds like cheap psychology –she has a major in psychology- and promotes, with and without intention (because she's young and impulsive) a version of a ""real"" life, the life of married couples and kids; the life that seems planned out; the life Mark Loring was so scared of and the life that more than one character in this film don't feel prepared forYet the life every man and woman that Ryan fires treasure.The contradiction is obvious, and it's Ryan's ""turning point"". But the characters in Reitman's films are never obvious. They are smart, quirky, sometimes weird people capable of resolving contradictions. The script by the director and Sheldon Turner, based on a Walter Kim novel, is insightful and powerfully dramatic without any melodrama. The employees getting fired suffer and speak the truth, we listen to every one of their words and we empathize.But we empathize with Ryan too, because we can see him wondering. The conversations he shares with Karen on one hand, the (mostly) discussions he has with Natalie on the other, and one particular three-way talk about life and love, are the moments the movie needs us to pay attention the most. The moments without music, the moments in which Ryan hardly says something that doesn't belong to his philosophy, but at the same time the moments in which he thinks or, at least, he's left with something to think about. We can see it in his eyes, even though the conviction of the performances by Kendrick and Farmiga help to generate this effect (performances that, if anything, confirm Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner should have had more chances in the Awards period with ""Juno"").Does Ryan need a second chance? Does he deserve it? Of course ""Up in the air"" offers more questions than answers, and I don't think that the journey of its main character has anything to do with redemption. With the risk of analyzing something that might not even be suggested by the movie, I think that Ryan Bingham's journey ends once he finds out what he wants. There are a couple of scenes that show people truly delighted and joyful when thinking about the things they want. One involves the perfect J.K. Simmons; and the other one a map of the world with a lot of photographs. I've always believed the world would be different if everyone did what they wanted because I've always known that it's not what happens most of the time. I don't know if it would be a better world, but differentDifferent is good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rent ""The Accidental Tourist."" Want to see a Hollywood liberal straw man attack on corporate America laced with enough F-bombs and T&A to earn an ""R"" rating? Rent ""Up in the Air."" The film is a great alternative to Ambien if you're an insomniac. Unfortunately, I viewed it at 7PM, so I was forced to look for other things to do in my house as its non-plot unfolded. Reitman needs to repeat Drama 101: create some stakes, force the main character out of his comfort zone early and often. Ryan (George Clooney) is a smug professional doing a job that doesn't exist in reality: traveling around the country firing white collar workers whose bosses don't have the cojones to ax. Hello, Jason: if a company needs to reduce its overhead, it surely will NOT spend money outsourcing HR to a guy who travels first class. Now if Ryan had been fired in the first 15 minutes, that would have created some stakes and forced him off the track, but that doesn't happen. Instead, Ryan falls into a road ""relationship"" that is every over-40 male's fantasy: a beautiful fellow traveler named Alex (Vera Farmiga)falls for Ryan's cheesy pickup line in a hotel bar and she becomes his best friend with benefits. The other female character is an overly earnest newbie on the corporate team: Natalie (Anne Kendrick)who is inexplicably taken on the road by Ryan after he demolishes her attempt to do his job in a computer chat environment. Why she isn't pink slipped for incompetence is never explained, except that the thin plot needs her for later developments. Eventually there is an O. Henry style plot twist, but it is too little too late to save this stinker of a movie. I wonder when George Clooney last flew commercial air as opposed to a corporate Gulstream or Lear jet? The alleged perks he experiences would not convince me to board the series of regional jets he'd have to use to go between Witchita, Kansas City, St. Louis and Milwaukee.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed messages,"Jason Reitman has again done something smart and skewered the zeitgeist. Clooney, who has two hits and a miss out right now (this, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the misfired Men Who Stare at Goats), is at the top of his game, and his performance here shows everything he can do; his limitations fit those of his character.If this is a comedy, it's a depressing one. Even with a gloss of wit and perfect timing, Up in the Air delivers a pill that's hard to swallow. Its blend of cynicism and uplift is at best confusing. It's a puzzle picture.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is a slickly shallow man whose job is delivering corporate layoffs (obviously an action of supreme relevance during the current Great Recession, but hardly a new thing). He flies round the country and his greatest goal in life, a rather abstract one, is to earn ten million miles of flying time. He works for the blandly amoral Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), whose staff zips around the country telling employees they're being let go and must clear out their desks, so their bosses don't have to have blood on their hands. If you have to have your dog killed, you take it to the vet's; this is the same thing.While Ryan celebrates what he sees as an easy life full of enjoyable perks, this movie is full of pain. It richly details the reactions of devastated employees who have just learned they're fired, or tell the camera what it's like to be out of a job after 15 or 20 years with a house and a wife and kids. The terrible anguish of this experience is made clearer by the fact that actual fired persons have been used for many of these vignettes.Ryan knows he is doing damage, and his focus is on being cool and businesslike about it. This could be compared to the job of the euphemistically titled Casualty Notification Officers in Moverman's The Messenger, who tell families their next of kin have died in Iraq, except that instead of the grim determination of Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster, Clooney's character goes about his work with brio, and seems to find life out of a suitcase hip and chic.Ryan celebrates non-attachment (a value to Buddhists, but in their case not linked with cruelty). He even gives motivational lectures in which he advises success-seekers to get rid of unnecessary stuff in their lives, just as he pares down his necessities so he can travel anywhere with only a carry-on bag. In one version of the talk, he hypothetically fills a backpack with all the people in his life and then empties it out. He likes being up in the air; it's where he lives. He's even given up keeping a permanent apartment in Omaha, his company's headquarters.Ryan is a teacher whose pupil learns a wiser lesson and who has to wise up himself. He meets his equal, Alex Goran (Vera Formiga, in a nicely modulated performance), in a bar and they become lovers. She explains to him later he should think of her as ""you, with a vagina."" We don't learn what she does, but she perfectly appreciates the prestige of Ryan's plastic cards that open doors or get him right on a flight or into a good rental car. She talks about the unknown size of his mileage as if it was the size of his penis, and ""it must be huge."" An iconic moment: their face-off after their first roll in the hay, laptop to laptop, finding a date when they're both free and in near enough airports to stage another rendezvous.Danger of the same fate he's doling out comes to Ryan when Craig calls the entire staff back to Omaha for a meeting at which they learn they're going to be grounded. Craig has listened to a cold ambitious young women called Natalie (Ms. Kendrick), fresh out of business school, who's convinced him he can save tons of money by having his people do their hatchet jobs from headquarters via video hookup. Ryan is sent out with Natalie to test the new technology by firing people, first in the old way in person, then via video screen. He teaches her the elements of pro travel -- dumping unnecessary baggage, following Asians through security because they're organized and fast and wear slip-on shoes, and so on -- and then how to deal with angry, violent, or suicidal people they've just fired. That lesson she's not so ready for.The irony is that being fired by an outsider is downright warm and human compared to having it done by somebody on a computer screen. Meanwhile Natalie's boyfriend fires her from their relationship via text message. She took this job and came to Omaha to be with him when she could have had a better job in San Francisco. Things get complicated with Alex for Ryan, and when Natalie meets Alex she challenges Ryan's complete unwillingness to accept commitment.The movie gets preachy when Ryan and Alex attend his sister's wedding. Eventually the message is E.M. Forster's ""only connect,"" and it's clear Ryan will become a very lonely guy if he doesn't reform. The sophistication of Alex and Ryan and their slick shared gamesmanship become hollow. They might be a couple out of the great age of Hollywood studio comedy -- except they aren't funny, and aren't meant to be. The trouble is, we only care about George Clooney when he's being a charmer or getting the better of someone and when his character is being shown up, he can seem shallow, tarnished. His gloss isn't invincible like Cary Grant's. What Reitman's doing here is complex and interesting, but the screenplay is weak in various areas. The focus wavers too much between being about job loss and corporate wising up, and the movie's too sophisticated to wind up so reliant on cornpone wisdom.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"I don't think it's particularly memorable, but it's quite enjoyable while it plays","George Clooney stars as a man who spends most of his life up in the air, flying throughout America. His profession: a man who fires people. Companies hire his company to send experts in to ease laid-off employees through their transition period. It's pretty loosely plotted, but the biggest events are his hooking up with fellow frequent flyer Vera Farmiga, with whom he builds a nice, no-strings-attached relationship that becomes about the only set thing in his life, and his training of young Anna Kendrick, a hotshot Cornell grad who hopes to revolutionize the industry by introducing teleconference firing. Clooney, of course, objects, partly because he thinks he should be there when he's terminating employees (the personal touch is needed), and partly because he hasn't reached the fabled 10 million mile mark. And he doesn't want to be home in Omaha. The film is basically an examination of a fleeting and lonely lifestyle. It actually manages to make it look kind of romantic, even with the loneliness (Hell, one can be just as lonely when they're stuck in one place). I think some of the later parts of the film, especially the whole sequence where Clooney attends his sister's wedding, a tad weaker than the flying bits. I don't think the film really has much of a coherent theme - the lay-off parts seem to me just a gimmick to set the film in the present, to give it a contemporary feel. The airport lifestyle remains the bulk of the film that is most memorable, and it's quite wonderful and sad in its way. It's also quite funny and charming. I don't think it's an especially memorable film, but it's a pretty darn good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrific Adult film,"""Up in the Air"" is a rarity; a film specifically aimed at adults. The content and maturity level are aimed at people in the business world. There are no unique special effects or sound ques to alert those who wouldn't otherwise get the joke or understand the dialogue to get the picture. While that may eliminate the most lucrative audience (teenage boys), for those in the film's target range, it makes it more special and fulfilling.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a man whose job is to go all around the country and ""assist companies in transitioning their clients."" In his words, he's the guy bosses hire to fire their employees. Ryan spends about 90% of the year either in a plane or in a hotel room, and that's just the way he likes it; this eliminates his need for companionship. But when a new employee, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) develops a new way to fire employees over the internet, he shows her the ropes in order to avoid having to go home to an empty apartment. However, she opens his eyes to why human companionship may actually be really worth it, and he begins a romance with a fellow full-time traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga).This is a standard order romantic comedy/drama. Plotwise, there are no real surprises, so in order to fill up the void, the film must rely on smart dialogue and terrific performances. ""Up in the Air"" has both. The characters are richly developed, and some scenes are laugh-aloud funny.This is easily George Clooney's best performance; another Oscar nomination is a given fact, and a second win certainly isn't out of the question. Clooney has a reputation for playing guys who do their own thing, regardless of whether it makes sense (or is legal). Ryan Bingham is no different, but Clooney works hard to add a few more dimensions to his character, and it works. Anna Kendrick is wholly believable as the Ivy League yuppie who opens his eyes to why staying single and alone maybe isn't the best thing. She also opens some of the film's funniest sequences. Vera Farmiga is also great as the woman whom Ryan begins a romance with. Clooney and Farmiga have terrific chemistry together, and co-writer/director Jason Reitman develops their relationship slowly and carefully. With romances where circumstances require the lovebirds to be away from each other for most of the picture, we only really want them to end up together in the end because the movie tells us to. This is not the case here. Once Ryan figures out that he really does want someone to spend the rest of his life with, the film focuses on the relationship between Ryan and Alex. This romance, which has already begun to burn is now allowed to catch fire and burn up the screen.The only real problem with the film is the ending. The film throws a one-two punch at the viewer, and while it's not typical, it's been done before. Sometimes this kind of ending can work, but I'm not sure it does here.Still, ""Up in the Air"" is a wonderful film and highly recommended for corporate world adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

'Up in the air' sweeps across America and fleets away,"Jason Reitman is a wonderful director and one of my favorites. He can take on the most serious of issues and turn it around to make us smile and enjoy a movie about the issue without deviating away from reality. He has managed this with Juno and one should appreciate the morals of his story telling that however flawed the characters of his movie are from the outside for the society, there is simmering humanity in all of them. Jason has brought the same style of storytelling back in his latest 'Up in the Air'.'Up in the Air' is about Ryan Bigham played by George Clooney, who is a downsizing expert, which in today's corporate job scenario means Satan's messenger. His job is to travel around the country to various corporate offices firing workers on behalf of their employers. He lives a life in a suitcase and travels across the country for almost the entire year. Due to which he has a fractured relationship with his near ones which in this case are his sisters. But he cherishes his life away from home and has a playful time flying in the air counting his record touching flying hours across United States.As opposite to leading a lonely life, he actually relishes the idea of meeting new people and has a transnational love affair with a fellow frequent flier 'Alex' played by Vera Farmiga.Things start to unravel when his company hires a rookie with an innovative idea 'Natalie', who succeeds in selling her idea of firing people across the country through web conference calls. Anna Kendrick's 'Natalie' comes out as arrogant and she is of the opinion that there is no humane way of firing someone hence the company should not bother about the human factor about their jobs. This new idea becomes a confrontational point between the Company Boss Jason Bateman along with Natalie and Ryan who now is assigned to take Natalie on a cross country tour displaying her company's job profile i.e. firing other employees. How the experience of their jobs affects these characters is what forms the rest of movie. Well Almost!'Up in the Air' starts well and has an innovative way of telling stories. His usual first character narration is solidly given by Mr. Clooney, but the topical issue of corporate downsizing needed a touch of reality which Jason provides by casting real employees who have lost their job during the economic meltdown. Viewers are able to feel the eventual guilt in the characters eyes about their job profile.But the movie at its rear end loses its credibility and drifts away from the central topic to focus on Ryan's personal story. His sudden about turn at the airport to go at his sister's wedding along with a date with Alex is filmed with excruciating detail that covers third-fourth of the movie's final reel. The movie fails to lift itself away from a sudden Romantic comedy drift to end the movie with a certain incomplete agenda. Jason fails to conclude anything substantial from his story other than the conclusion of the movie's romantic track, which also shows some shocking predictable sequence.'Up in the Air' can be said to be Mr. Reitman's most real movie to date after the dark and sarcastic 'Thank You for smoking' and the sugary coated 'Juno'. But it fails to elevate itself to be a movie of any social importance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up In The Air,"Up In The Air is about a middle aged man named Ryan Bingham, who works for a large company who has hired Ryan, along with many others to professionally let people go of their jobs. Ryan, will fly all across America and is paid by other companies to do their dirty work, which in this case, is letting go of employees. Ryan has been doing this for years and feels he has a certain technique and style to it. He also doesn't have a place of residence other than a hotel room and otherwise most days of the year he is on airplanes, travelling and in various assorted hotel rooms. Ryan also does professional speeches on how to lose baggage (for example relationships and stress that goes along with it). Ryan seems like the perfect person to deliver these types of speeches because he has not one bit of baggage. He has never been married and has no real emotional connections and claims to like it that way. Things change however, after he meets a woman while at one of the hotels. Her name is Alex, and after meeting a couple times, Ryan starts to decide, whether or not he should eventually get over his fear, or dislike of commitment and finally do something in that area of his life. Another part of the story focuses on Ryan's new co-worker named Natalie, who is an overly confident young woman, who goes on the road, or should I see in the air, with Ryan to different destinations to learn how to fire people properly. At least that is what Ryan calls it. The film looks at many different kinds of relationships and characteristics of these characters and also is right on time with it's back story of letting go of employees due to the current financial recession being felt all over the world. Up In The Air works for several reasons. One, I think is the well layered characters here. For example, Ryan the main character. He comes off as quite sure of himself and what he is doing and many people seem to think he is quite happy with his lifestyle and the choices he has made. However as we watch the film we start to realize that maybe that is just a front he is putting on and deep down he is a sad and lonely person and perhaps scared to commit to any kind of relationship, perhaps out of fear and because he is so used to his lifestyle and change is never easy. Alex and Natalie are well developed characters as well and we get to see more about them through the film and it is just as intriguing and interesting to watch as with Ryan's character. All of these characters are brought to life by great performances by George Clooney (Ryan), Vera Farmiga (Alex) and Anna Kendrick (Natalie). They are deep and layered performances and we feel as if we have gotten to know these characters quite well after watching them, but on the plus side, there is also some mystery left to them, which leads the viewer to some intriguing thoughts and deconstruction of the film after being viewed. Count on Oscar nominations for all three acting performances. The film's script is also a winner blending in comedy, tragedy and real life melodrama. Not once does the film feel unrealistic, or sugar coated and it is one of the more believable and realistic films dealing with relationships in the past little while and because there are no easy answers to these characters, or their situations, I think the way they are handled is very appropriate. And again the depth and layers to these characters plus some good dialogue and occasional humour lead to a sure to be nominated best adapted screenplay as well as best director for Jason Reitman. Up In The Air is a powerful film in many ways. I think for many it will leave us reflecting on our past, or present and think about the situations and current times we are in. It definitely leaves an impact on the viewer and will have you thinking, which I think a great film does. It blends sadness and humour quite well and makes for an intriguing watch. One of the best films of 2009 and will continue to be a winner among the awards circuits and for good reasons too.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Black Comedy,"On the whole, Up in the Air is a good dark comedy about the financial crisis and the corporate world in general, in particular its production of a peculiar, airborne life style.The film benefits from strong casting and, for the most part, good writing. George Clooney turns in another excellent performance, while Vera Farmiga's turn should cement her stardom, as she gives a sultry yet complex performance. Her magnetism and charisma are among the high points of the movie. All the major actors make their characters believable.However, in its last third, Up in the Air suffers from an attempt to impose a moral on a dark comedy, blunting its satiric edge just as it should be plunging the knife in for the kill. More importantly, the personality shifts in certain characters are less than believable, and seem designed more to convey a ""good"" message than out of faith to the story.Nevertheless, the film is well worth seeing, and stands out in a film season known for overly sentimental fare.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
not sure what the point was,"Very little happens in this movie. It's about Ryan, played by George Clooney, whose job is to fire people. He flies around the US firing people. He meets up with this pretty woman, Alex, whom also flies a lot for her job. So they start meeting up and texting and start a little romance. Meanwhile, Ryan's company hires a young gun, Natalie, whom suggests to save money by firing people over the computer. The boss tells her to go with Ryan to see what's it like to fire people. Along the way her relationship breaks up and she sees it is not as easy as she thought. Ryan invites Alex to a wedding, and comes to think he wants what Natalie's been talking about with marriage and someone to come home to. So he goes to see Alex in Chicago and sees what he should have suspected along.

predictable and annoying,"Anna Kendrick was amazing as always. George was just absolutely annoying to watch. The guy is neither handsome nor capable of showing any type of emotion. It's just annoying to watch him do this. The worst part though was the story. It had so much potential yet it didn't go anywhere. Total disappointment. Also, incredibly predictable. Like, I could have written this and I'm not even a film writer kind of predictable. How this movie got nominated for anything is beyond me!",,Anonymous,Romance
perceptive comedy/drama about human relations,"Sometimes karma can be a real b***h. Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees. Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead. He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year. He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan. He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company. The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference. For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered. Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the ""personal-touch"" can be when terminating an employee. Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially ""casual,"" typically no-strings-attached romance. But will it stay that way?""Up in the Air"" is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" in recent years. Like those earlier efforts, ""Up in the Air"" is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist. Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one ""special"" individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life. For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him. He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on. Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him. It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with. The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try? Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women: the brash but actually quite naïve Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards. The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers. For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.Given the hard economic times in which we live, ""Up in the Air"" could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it. The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Liked it, thought I would love it.","I attended an industry screening in LA on Nov 24, a small group, 30-40 people. I was surprised by the lack of excitement at the end of the screening. It didn't seem like anyone was bowled over with the film. I enjoyed it, always enjoy George Clooney, and I think he did an excellent job on this film, particularly when he portrayed some vulnerability. I didn't particularly care for the two female leads. Competent actresses, but I didn't spark to them or their characters. I enjoyed the plot and appreciated how the subject matter fit into today's economy even though based on a book and with a script that was written prior to the economic free-fall. I guess I just expected to SUPER LOVE this film, and I merely liked it. Maybe on second viewing, I will like it more. So far, Thank You For Smoking remains my favorite Jason Reitman film.

"A lightweight serious look at a jet age nomad, with Clooney his natural best","Up in the Air (2009)Working with a witty, contemporary script and a casting a great leading actor seems like an easy enough bartender's recipe. And for a third time, director Jason Reitman pulls off a movie that is fresh, crisp, and sometimes touching. Thank You for Smoking was a kind of Luke warm warm up, but next came the fabulous Juno, a hard act to follow. Up in the Air is somewhere between the two in sentiment and success, not a bad place to be. It's a terrific movie at its best.I mention all three films because they have a consistent flavor. And they all build around a very serious kernel, in this case, about the loneliness of a business traveller always flying from city to city. It gets exaggerated here, but not with comic excess (as with Smoking). Clooney's Ryan Bingham is just this side of believable. When he meets a Alex (played with perfect energy by Vera Farmiga) who seems to be his female vagabond counterpart, and they hit it off, it looks like we know the arc of the movie ahead. (We don't.)The more obvious plot, about a firm that turns to iChat (computer screen conversation) to fire people, is laced with tragedy, but it is a set up for a series of laughs, too, and in the end isn't the most important element at all. (The timing is great though, talking about firing people left and right during high unemployment.)No, the real point has to do with Bingham's existence as a jet age nomad. Up in the Air lacks any sense of visual art, for me. The camera-work is professional and undistracting, but lacks some of the effective elements of, say, Lost in Translation, which has the one similarity of a the traveller in another place without possessions and with nothing really to do outside of work. Up in the Air hints at bigger potential here at the end, with Clooney in front of the departure schedule, and the camera suddenly seems to contribute in this host, and the next, which reverses direction, and then for the ending, and its surprising, cool, almost tragic certainty. A great ending.The music seems a carryover from the light, folk-tinged singsong pieces that made Juno really special, but it makes no sense here. This isn't a movie about highschoolers, or about innocence, but about either being very adult (Ryan and Alex) or about becoming an adult (as we see in the quirky and complicated third character played with precision by little known Anna Kendrick). The third thread in the plot(s) about Ryan's sister's marriage is more useful than moving, and more for comic effect than really building any depth, but it does give us a chance to see Ryan think out loud. And change. And confront loneliness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""What's in Your Backpack?""","There are some movies you see because you want to, and some you see because you have to. Little did I suspect that ""Up In the Air"" is both.""What's in Your Backpack?"" is the motivational speaking sideline of Ryan Bingham, the 'termination engineer' played by George Clooney in this movie, which deftly comes disguised as a romantic comedy – right down to a pivotal wedding scene- but really challenges us to consider what is in OUR backpacks – that we ARE all bogged down both by 'stuff' and by commitments to people. As Bingham preaches, we can chose not to be weighed down. As Bingham comes to realize, we can also make choices to refill our backpack with the things we want in our lives. We may all die alone, as Bingham points out, but it is how we enjoy the journey that is the central puzzle of life, and the object of this film.Nothing in this film is pretentious or preachy. It is tightly crafted. Though it is a tad heavy with exposition early on, there is significant action – in Bingham's hotel beds; at a party; at a wedding- to entertain. There is humour and melodrama, done lightly – I barely teared up before the wedding, and then again towards the end.The principal actors – Clooney, Vera Famiga, and relative newcomer Anna Kendrick as Bingham's foil, who demands that he consider whether his life has more meaning than accumulating 10 million American Airlines frequent flyer miles- all become their characters – never once do you see them acting. Kendrick is an especial surprise, playing a character who grows through the narrative, and convincing us of the transition.Don't be fooled by the plot surrounding Bingham's job as a travelling harbinger of employment death – the film does not skip lightly over this reality, but, as he did in Juno with abortion and adoption, Jason Reitman folds this theme neatly into the mix.In a decade of big explosion movies and computer animation, this human scaled film about real life is a rare treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Traveling Light,"""Up in the Air"" is ""The Accidental Tourist"" light. A charming con man and road warrior (George Clooney) with, inexplicably, nothing to live for besides accruing frequent flier miles on a major airline eventually finds something (Vera Farmiga) to live for. Or does he?That's it, and it's not much. Fortunately, getting there is at least half the fun. Until Clooney's character experiences his epiphany, the audience gets to enjoy the smooth illogic of his perverse sales pitches, the comedy of his office politics, the comedy of his sister's wedding preparations, his sophisticated banter with Farmiga's character (""I'm you with a vagina,"" she tells him) and her body double's well-equipped rear section, the angst of employees let go in a bad economy, Sam Elliott's increasingly face-dominating white mustache, and a couple of dozen high-definition shots of American cities taken from the air. If you like traveling by plane, you'll love this movie.If truth be told, ""Up in the Air"" isn't Oscar material. As airplane movies go, it trails far behind ""Airplane!,"" ""Airport,"" and ""The High and the Mighty."" But there are enough pokes at hospitality industry loyalty programs, motivational speaking programs, and corporate business strategies and other laugh-out-loud lines to be worth the price of admission.Clooney, whose real-life aversion to establishing a family is eerily similar to his character's, is fun to watch. He is a star who works in pictures as often as star system actors ever did. The other actors handle their material well enough. ""Up in the Air"" is from the director who brought us ""Juno.""

She's more than great in everything else I've seen her in, and this performance may only be a hiccup for her.

The movie dives deep into the day-to-day activities of Clooney's character, Ryan Bingham. Even given the name of the movie, you'll never guess what the story will be, and it twists enough to stay interesting.To sum it up, although being great in its own right for today, Up in the Air may not stick with you for a lifetime, therefore, scores only a 7 out of 10.

Up in the Air Gives Modern Hollywood a Good Name.,"Think about the fabled ""Golden Age of Hollywood"". A time gone by when The Movies had dignity, distinction, class. When actors and actresses were revered stars. When honest-to-God adults could schedule a trip to the theater and be treated to a robust, well-rounded good time. That feeling; of refined, professional, mainstream entertainment is all over Up in the Air. Starring actors and actresses with vintage charm and grace, in an intelligent, funny, touching screenplay, Jason Reitman's film reminds us that the joys of the golden age didn't quite end with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.George Clooney is the star of the show as corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham. His role, a frequent flyer by day, high flying playboy by night, represents a miraculously natural fit for Clooney's once-in-a-generation movie star charisma. The script, based on a novel by Walter Kirn, introduces Bingham's occasional lover, played by the similarly vivacious Vera Farmiga. Her character, every bit Bingham's romantic equal, sets the playboy on a journey of self-discovery (pardon the cliche) that actually works. Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner's script is sharp as a tack about a number of topics. Family, romance, personal responsibility, and corporate America are among the subjects considered, dissected, and explored in a story that makes no entertainment sacrifices in sending out its themes. Up in the Air is just as lightly comic as it is thoughtful. Just as emotionally stimulating as it is intellectual. That's a real accomplishment from both Turner and director Reitman. So rare it is for something as slick and big-budgeted as this mainstream Tinseltown dramedy is, to feel so insightful about our real world.The acting on display in Up in the Air is unusually fine. Let me bury the lead by first mentioning a string of winning supporting performances by Anna Kendrick (an adorable, star making turn that lights up the screen) Jason Bateman, and Amy Morton, and one brilliant scene with J.K. Simmons that expertly captures a very real, very poignant reality of life circa 2009 that holds just as true circa 2020. The exchange is really incredible.But let's face it, Clooney and Farmiga are the lifeblood of this film. Vera Farmiga is as strong a female presence as I've seen in the movies. Few actresses her age seem as adult onscreen. Controlled, reserved and coolly playful opposite Clooney, she's a knockout all the way through this film. A grown woman in an ocean of girls.Clooney is sparkling. I don't hesitate to call him our generation's finest movie star. He's a lovable stud; an approachable charmer. Handsome, funny, with hair salt-and-peppered enough to betray a certain level of endearment as well as distinguished confidence. He's a star to root for. His performance in Up in the Air is sublime. Sublime in the sense that it zeros in on and amplifies his built-in persona. Clooney gets to be Clooney, fully and without reservation. He's a specialist fulfilling his speciality, like Brett Favre throwing nothing but 50 yard bombs... and putting every one of them on the money. The role is great; detailed and complicated, but only George Clooney could have infused it with this sense of warmth, charm, and Clooney-branded scoundrel wit.Critics come up with their ""very best of the year"" lists, and normally one has to trudge through a half dozen foreign indie ""films with ideas"" before one gets to the real movies. The studio entertainments palatable to the plebs, but less nourishing to the mind and/or heart. There's no compromise with Up in the Air. It fulfills that old school Hollywood ideal: Classy stars giving great performances in a grown-up entertainment that masters gentle humor and touching drama to carry audiences along for a couple hours and give them plenty to think about after they leave. Up in the Air is George Clooney's best movie; the one we will remember him by 50 years from now. It's an old adage, but actors, even the greatest of them, truly can go an entire career without finding their perfect fit. How lucky are we then to have seen the planets align so precisely for this film? Up in the Air is a movie to cherish.94/100",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loyalty is never cheap,"Corporate America is verging on collapse with the housing market in turmoil, automotive industry in free-fall and no veritable option for recovery in sight. Life couldn't be better for high flying Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who spends some 320 days per year traversing the country being paid heavy cash for firing people. Living out of a suitcase the ultimate goal for Ryan is collecting 10,000,000 frequent flier points at American Airlines (already being a Concierge member) to receive the vaunted privilege of being only the seventh person ever to reach this total. Loyalty is never cheap, and Ryan offers his to various programmes, never to people, only ever entering into casual on-road relationships, like with Alex (Vera Farmiga). When confronted with the niggling possibility that his line of business will become stationery due to tele-conference technology forwarded by young, but brash new recruit Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), Ryan must confront his lifestyle with the reality of whether having an empty backpack truly brings him satisfaction.Since ""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno"" Jason Reitman's witty, if sometimes dry humour has brought him to the forefront of comedic-drama directors. However his first features, however blessed with undeniable charm, lacked a conscious moral backbone, which brought together the story and incorporated a clear message. ""Up in the Air"", filmed on the basis of the same-titled novel by Walter Kirn, borrows the premise and is contextualised by the author's work. The Reitman brothers script helps focus the attention and introduces wry wit to create a cohesive story attacking key aspects of human life, aspiring to answer questions of what is important, what is true happiness. Maybe somewhat of an overreach and the philosophical credentials of both source material and Reitman aren't notable enough to attack these issues with intellectual gusto. Nonetheless the movie takes on meaning of life questions with true emotional intent, never relenting and rarely dropping focus.Clooney gives a powerful performance, as the cool self-centred man in the clouds, detached from possessions and stability, instead dedicated to ever soaring: living requires movement. Opposite her are offered two stances. One of a middle-aged female, for which travel is a mere escape, not a way of life - no strings attached, frivolous and meaningless. The other of the youthful Natalie, who lacks experience, but never fervour to change. Her person is key as she indicates a starting point (of Alex and Ryan 15-20 years in the past) - full of hope, exuberance and lack of perception in regards to the bigger picture. Despite her career push Natalie is burdened by her emotionality and lack of control or understanding of human needs. Meanwhile the wiser Ryan, despite reneging on leading a life 'hampered' by objects and persons, has a wider outlook, in someway deciding to live a vagabond life in order to never having to be the 'person on the other side of the table'. He escapes a so-called stable life, understanding how all-engulfing commitment is and how painful it can be. Both Natalie and Ryan have there points - the movie offering a meeting point somewhere mid-way, far from a fairy-tale and easy options. The outro of real-life interviews with people losing their jobs offers a substantial culmination - life may not be a bed of roses, but all in all when memories of happy times are brought about a second person is always involved, not frequent flier miles or computer screens.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up in the Air is a decent flight with an extremely rough landing,"There is nothing pretty about the current economic crisis out here in the United States. For whatever the reason (and this will be a totally separate argument), most of your small and big businesses are dropping people like unwanted flies, and at a very dangerous rate. To find any sort of charm or humor in all this is extremely difficult, yet Up in the Air manages to loosely pull it off. This film is a charming little adult movie about a man's job and his unique lifestyle. The third film from Jason Reitman is entertaining; full of great acting, but like Juno stretches the running time just a bit much. Slicing a major portion of the movie aside, Up in the Air is fun to watch, and provides a lot of insight into today's cruel business world.Up in the Air follows a businessman (George Clooney) whose job is to fly to different parts of the country, to different businesses to fire people when the actual bosses do not have the guts to do the job themselves. This sort of life requires cynicism and a lack of personal connection. But, his boss (Jason Bateman) hires a young and up-and-coming businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) that develops a way to fire people without all the flying. Before the new technique of terminating people takes place, Ryan takes Natalie on a tour of how his business life is. Along the way they run into a beautiful older woman (Vera Farmiga) that starts a casual relationship with Ryan. Based off of a novel by Walter Kirn, this movie's screenplay was written by the director as well, with some added touches by Sheldon Turner.Jason Reitman's best ability as director is pulling excellent performances out of his cast. Whether the roles are small or large, every actor and actress did a fantastic job in this movie; and let's not forget the sympathetic performances of the people that were fired in real-life. George Clooney once again shines in his new-school Cary Grant-like performance as a man with a lot of vulnerability, but hides it in his charm, suave cockiness, and winning smile. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are strong female leads that went toe-to-toe with Clooney and did not disappoint. Kendrick, being so young, was the more impressive of the performances by remaining very likable in spite of her tough personality. Keep an eye out on J.K. Simmons for his fantastic few moments as a father of two getting fired.In adult dramas like these, the writing is pivotal in propelling the acting performances and the realism of the entire piece. Bateman heads back to the typewriter after directing someone else's decent script with Juno. Just like in Thank You for Smoking, the plot was simple, but dwells much deeper into the motivations, mannerisms, actions, and reactions of all the characters involved. The dialogue was great, some of the conversations were slick and hilarious and not one work was put out of place. Up in the Air also has a share of great one-liners and monologues.The directing of this movie was nothing special, but gets the job done. There are some wonderful shots of the cities featured and wonderful sights above the skies, but the directing is mostly focused on human emotions and pacing of the conversations and revelations. In the first two-thirds of the movie, it works out well. The movie paces itself nicely, and was entertaining, even when some scenes were heartbreaking (Firing someone always leads to emotional moments). And then came the final third.Falling into the trap of most decent movies that have trouble wrapping up (Cast Away being my personal favorite example), Up in the Air begins to stumble in the later scenes when Ryan tries patching up old wounds. These elongated scenes slowed the pace a bit, lost its clever bite, and even contradicted itself a little in terms of content. When the career didn't become the focus of the movie, it became a bit jarring and stale. Then by the time the plot shifts back to the career, it becomes very rushed, and the ending appears right around the corner. The resolutions fly in out of nowhere and before you know it, the credits are rolling. Some of this might be exaggeration, but in a movie where dialogue runs rampant and action is limited, off-screen major events was not expected.Bottom Line: Up in the Air was fun, entertaining, lightweight dramedy for the adults. That is, until the final third when the movie shifts a little, and then bolts towards the exit. The only blame for this change of pace was the editing team and the writer—which happens to be the director. Movies do not have to run two hours, excellent 90-minute movies can indeed occur (Up, the best movie in 2009, was a mere 96 minutes). If Up in the Air had paced itself to be such a length, it would have been a much better film, supported by slick dialogue and fantastic acting, with a hintage of subtle criticism and clever commentary on current events. Unfortunately, we have a misguided third act that was a fraction as good as the first two acts. Overall Up in the Air is a decent film, but nothing fantastic or Best Picture Nominee worthy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Except ""The Blind Side"", the least of the Best Picture Oscar noms.","During late 2008 through 2009 the unemployment rolls swelled so much that 1 out of 10 Americans were out of work, a number that understates the problem because it leaves out those who have given up and either stopped looking or took low level hourly work. The most relevant number is more like 1 in 6. Against this backdrop, Jason Reitman's drama about a professional corporate hit-man couldn't be more topical, unfortunately this relevance has lead a lot of critics to overestimate the film. My major issue with the story is the ""Sixth Sense"" twist near the end. George Clooney's Ryan Bingham's torrid romance with a similarly transient Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) is portrayed as very intimate (the film's R content comes largely from a single full dorsal nudity shot of Vera) so without spoiling the ending, shouldn't Ryan have seen some evidence of the twist. Also, given the constant interruption of cell phones, how was this secret held through the extended time they spend together at the sister's wedding. Also the critic's comparisons of the dialogue to old Billy Wilder movies (although this film reminded me most of ""Desk Set"" with was a Walter Lang film) seems a little generous. When it is talking about the business of firing people and travelling to do it, there are a number of sarcastic laughs and sharp insights but otherwise the script often drifts. Also, Ryan has a side business as a motivational speaker where he urges people to drop their burdensome attachments (something he has done to the point of hermetic airborne isolation). Doesn't real motivational speaking involve trying to get people to assume burdensome attachment? Having whined for about 300 words, I will say that the story's cynical and world-weary view of human relationships as we enter the teens very much as ""Sideways"" (among my favorite 3 films of all time) captured the earliest parts of the millennium's zeitgeist of over-indulgence, self-deception and unfulfilled dreams. In summary, I would say urge anyone over 35 to see the movie and warn anyone younger against it -- as far as you know your marriage will hold, your employer will take care of you when you get older and technological progress is always an improvement. You can wait to find out there is no Santa Clause.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
smarter than your average dramedy,"While it doesn't achieve the status of masterpiece, this is another very solid dramedy from Jason Reitman, a gifted filmmaker who proves not to be overshadowed by his father's persona any more. Up In The Air is far from being hysterically funny, yet its clever script happens to be timely due to the economical crisis. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is one of the top employees of the agency that dismisses people. Thus, he is always on the run flying to different parts of the US. During the course of time he meets two women who are about to change his viewpoint on becoming involved in the romantic relationship. The story is fluidly told and never ceases to be gripping. Reitman superbly balances the two subplots concerning dismissing people and Ryan's affair building to the climax that involves a surprising, well-calculated twist. George Clooney is graceful, if slightly underwhelming delivering some over-intelectualized lines even through voice-over. Once he gets criticized for it by his new co-worker Natalie Keener played by splendid Anna Kendrick. Both she and Vera Farmiga as Clooney's love interest are both amazing displaying unique characters with totally distinct features. Although Reitman's direction is always compelling, he still overuses sloppy indie music I dislike so much. Overall, Up In The Air lacks the edge and controversy to be classic in my view. It's still way smarter than your average dramedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable movie,"My wife and I both enjoyed this movie. It's no classic and, in my view, doesn't merit an 8+ IMDb rating but it is a nice movie and I'm sure that most people will enjoy it.""Nice"" maybe isn't the right word since it has a message about how to live your life - and reminds us how awful being fired really is. So it has a serious message -- and it's a pleasure to watch, thanks to excellent performances by all the lead characters. So what's not to like? Well, for one thing, the story is worthy and well-told but don't expect some great movie since the plot isn't up to those expectations. I preferred Michael Clayton, which was a much deeper movie than this one.But you won't be disappointed with this film unless your expectations are too high to begin with. A worthy 7/10.

simplistic with no redeeming values and acting below par,"the movie was nothing new and nothing subtle, even the acting; why so many regard the movie as worthy of nomination is curious; the values resemble the 60's boomer's attitudes with a twist; there is more tragic comedy that lacks force and was not convincing; more of the same of a society with no limits and no values and an attempt to establish what all want through dumb tricks of the trade; a one dimensional movie that garnered fans due to the lack of demand made on them; and a movie that makes lots of money for the actors while taking the Oscars even further down the road of lowest common denominator; none of the movies up for best picture are Oscar caliber and none approach the depth of acting and directing that Shutter Island does; George Clooney has made some very wonderful and thought provoking movies; this one is lacking in depth and color; it is a movie that is obvious and is offensive to the economic times for it does little to truly portray the complexities of human lives be it in the raw sad negative or the sorry tragic comedy of life.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great date night movie.,"Up in the Air"" is a captivating mix of drama and comedy, anchored by George Clooney's superb performance as a frequent flyer leading a solitary life.

Up in the Air  -- it's a nice adult film,"I'm not sure what percentage of movies are about the complexity of meeting the right person in this day and age, but it's got to be 30 percent or more. I find it interesting how these kinds of films have evolved over the years, from the simplistic, hyper-romantic films you got pre-1970s to movies like Up in the Air and Love and Other Drugs, both of which are good movies.Recently I saw When Harry Met Sally again and loved it, but what made that film interesting at the time was the non-traditional way the two main characters came together, first disliking each other on a road trip, meeting in an airport and then finally becoming friends despite Billy Crystal's relationship law #1 that ""men and women cannot be friends."" I loved When Harry Met Sally, but it's amazing that in just 20 years that film's dated that story's plot now seems when compared with Up in the Air, which follows the life of Ryan, a professional hit man, who flies from city to city firing people instead of killing them.He's good at his job and enjoys traveling all over the country, amassing frequent flier miles while easing people out of their jobs. At some point along the way, Ryan (played by George Clooney) he meets the character played by Vera Farmiga, a fellow business traveler. After a nice little fling, they decided to synchronize their schedules when possible so they can continue their ""casual"" relationship whenever they can. But as the story moves along, you see Clooney's character start to question his philosophy of life (it's easier to travel with an empty backpack than a full one) as he begins developing a deeper interest in Farmiga's character, something he eventually decides he wants to pursue beyond the limits of hotel rooms. It's a nice, subtle film that's well acted and scripted, painting what I think is a fairly realistic, yet entertaining, picture of the complexity of white-collar relationships.I'm guessing Love and Other Drugs, UP in the Air and 500 Days (of Summer) simply reflect back to the audience the changing nature of relationships. If you liked any of those films, DO NOT SEE the movie It's Complicated, one of the worst and most predictable films I've seen in years. Trust me on this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Endearing and funny despite the melancholic story.,"The strangest thing happened to me while watching this movie: I started to like this character, who fires people for a living. Garbage men get more respect, but Clooney pulled it off and made this coldhearted manager's character likeable, while in real life I should have loathed such a manager, who fires people for a living.Lots of praise for the direction by Jason Reitman, because he achieved to make a melancholic feel good picture about a subject that is just depressing: firing people. Everything is smooth about this picture. Endearingly, funny smooth. Just a lovely melancholic romantic comedy mixed into a depresing story about firing people.Acting is terrific. Really subtle. The funny and endearing characters got my sympathy, although all of the characters were rather selfish and superficial. Still I really liked and understood them in the end. Great role by Anna Kendrick.This movie might seem like an innocent story about Clooney flirting with stewardesses while travelling the country for his job, but there is a lot more to it. It really gives a warmhearted message about the pros and cons of commitment in a relationship. Touching, funny and true to life portrait of a loner who is in doubt wether he wants to settle down and have a family... Will he or wont he?Gorgeous soundtrack. Mesmirizing photography and very impressive editing.It is truly a splendid gem. I think it is director Reitman's best work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Questions and questions popping into my mind while watching..Bingham (played by Coolney) is sure an a..hole. Sorry but he is. But he is also cursed to be lonely. He believes that is his own choice but I think it's just a curse. He got shocked when newbie Natalie (Anna Kendrick) comes with the idea to use the Internet to fire people instead of traveling across the country. I actually expected Bingham to got fired after this Internet thing, but it didn't happen.But about Alex (Vera Farmiga)? She is a real jack? Having a family with kids but getting layed by man whom she met in the bar or even at airports? She somehow lets the curse carry on him by disappointing him about marriage and attaching with people.Anyways, whatever side you look at it, Up In the Air makes you think carefully about many things for sure.

Some of the Best Performances I've Seen in a While,"Up In the Air follows a man, Ryan, who fires people for a living. Then one day a young woman, Natalie, shows up with ideas to change the company. When she receives Ryan's disapproval, his boss sends the two out to work together so Ryan can prove to her that the old way is the best way.This movie surprised me. I haven't been really impressed by any of the three main actors in this movie before (although I haven't seen many of their movies either). And after seeing Anna Kendrick in Twilight it was refreshing to see her in a role that she both fit and excelled in. She pulled off probably the best performance of this movie. She plays the uptight fresh-out-of-school top-of-her- class girl who thinks she can change the world without experiencing it. I've seen plenty of characters like this, but Kendrick tops them all. She manages to bring humanity to her performance, and makes her very professional character seem very real. It's actually quite refreshing. As for George Clooney, I think he's okay in the movies I've seen him in. And yet he fits this character perfectly and performs it just as well. As for Vera Farmiga, she's also great. It's hard to talk about their performances as much as Kendrick, but trust me. They're great. Every other performance was solid as well, just not as good as these three.The relationship between Farmiga and Clooney is, while not developed a whole lot, very natural. They have fantastic chemistry together, and their characters clicked with me and with each other right away. So normally when I would've felt their relationship was rushed, I instead felt the opposite.The characters portrayed by these actors are great. Their well- written, interesting, and like I briefly mentioned earlier, human. These characters are built somewhat around stereotypes, but the writing brings humanity to these stereotypes. The dialogue is realistic and extremely well delivered.Generally I don't really like conventional movies, specifically ones that are overly happy. But with Up in the Air it doesn't matter because everything else is so great and the happiness actually works and makes sense with the story.I particularly loved the ending. It's pretty emotional, and I felt myself starting to tear up a little.To top all that off, the soundtrack is pretty good. At least I thought it was. It fit the movie pretty well too.My one and only problem was with Jason Bateman. It's not that he wasn't good in this movie, but more that he was kind of out of place for some reason. I don't know why. His role is very small, however, and it didn't affect the movie at all really. It was more of a personal thing than anything else.Overall Up in the Air is a pretty perfect movie. The actors are extremely competent, the writing is great, the characters are great, the movie is happily conventional with reason, the soundtrack is great, and it's got a great, emotional ending. I could list it's praises for ages, yet it's problems are pretty much nonexistent. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie.

Comfortable Movie,"Ryan (Clooney) has a job whereby he flies to companies all over the country and fires selected employees. He is single, loves his job and prefers being on the road (so to speak) and has no ties to anyone.I can see why this was nominated for Best Picture. It's very good. Okay, it's more than that - it feels more like an old pair of shoes we will never throw away because they are always comfortable. I hated to see it end. This is a very comfortable movie. The actors make it so.I am not familiar with Vera Farmiga, but her performance was seamless throughout and she was deserving of a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Also, the Efficiency Expert Natalie (Kendrick) did a good job, but am not sure if a Best Supporting Actress nomination was in order (well, some believed it was and she got the nomination too). And, I think we are beginning to see deeper ranges in George Clooney. He has those expressions that show us how he feels at times, and you feel it too. You like his character and want the best to happen for him. I was not surprised he was nominated for Best Actor.But, the acting aside, the thing that also makes this comfortable is the dialogue. The characters say what you would say if you (okay, if I ) were in those positions. Yes, the movie is slow, but hey, it's not a Jason Bourne thing. We are looking at Ryan, who has no ties to anyone and then he meets Alex (Farmiga) and begins to reconsider by falling in love with her. He's up in the air about it and about his life in general.

"Up in The Air is a beautiful analysis of daily human relationships, their fears of relationships in general and the deep anguish of being alone","With his first two films, Thanks for Smoking and Juno, Jason Reitman has proven not only that he has a gift for approaching his subjects with precise sarcasm and a keen critical sense, but that he also knows how to work with and discuss the human relationships so present in our daily lives. To-day With a very sharp cast, headed by a George Clooney at his best, the feature film is delicious, managing to walk very well both through drama and comedy. As is customary, Reitman uses a relevant subject as the backdrop for his film. If in Thanks for Smoking the theme was the dangers of cigarettes and Juno talked about teenage pregnancy, Up in The Air puts the world crisis and the high number of unemployment in the United States as an opportune point of convergence in the life of the main character, Ryan Bingham (Clooney).In Unstoppable Love, his third film, this is clearer than ever, as this time our protagonist, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a guy who constantly travels around the world, has the task of firing people from their positions in companies. After the financial crisis that hit the United States. With such a role, Ryan needs to know how to deal with the people he fires, needs to know how to speak up and deal with every reaction. Ryan is an extremely balanced and meticulous guy in his words and actions and, for that very reason, he leaves the impression of being someone apparently cold.And Ryan lives up to this thought: without a fixed place of residence, Ryan likes to live in constant movement, he is lonely by choice and avoids any kind of more serious relationship, which even leads him to create a distance from his own family. His biggest goal is to reach ten million miles on the frequent flyer program of his favorite airline, but in the midst of all this, Ryan ends up meeting Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), for whom he begins to nurture stronger feelings, at the same time that he must deal with the obligation of working side by side Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young and intelligent girl who proposes a radical change in the method of firing people, which would disrupt Ryan's plans and daily life.Up in The Air (2009), by Jason Reitman, seeks inspiration in a specific socioeconomic context: the consequences of the 2008 crisis in the United States. The properties received a much higher increase than their real value and formed the so-called ""real estate bubble"". When prices reached their limit and the ""bubble burst"", the worst came: greater distrust in the market, banks making it difficult to borrow, companies reducing investment capacity, mass layoffs. As a consequence, there was a drop in consumption, less profit in companies, more layoffs. Chaos had set in. It is in this context of crowds losing their jobs that the film seeks to anchor itself. But he is far from dated. The background may even be particular, specific, but the reverberations of its focus are universal.Apparently, Up In The Air shines its spotlight on the coldness of the corporate universe, having as an instrument for this the exhibition of characters specialized in firing. The scene in which Natalie (Anna Kendrick) feverishly types a flowchart with techniques for sending employees out is emblematic. The objectivity with which it is intended to prepare unemployed people to find a new space in the job market and reduce lawsuits against the company that they dismiss is such that it easily gains a new name: coldness. Slightly sharper eyes, however, will observe in this work by Reitman a look into the humanity that circulates in the ""inhuman"" and calculating organism that is a large corporation. History is full of feelings, even if there is an insistence (calculated and very well contextualized) to overshadow them with the rational behavior one would expect from a reputable professional. Thus, reason and emotion wage an intense and, simultaneously, discreet war. One of the battles masterfully opens up the high load of meaning that a parenthesis can contain.Although it still relies on much of the sarcastic humor so characteristic of Reitman's films, Unstoppable Love follows a more moderate path, preferring to focus on the relationships between the protagonist and the female presences around him. Curious that, despite bringing the recent US financial crisis as a motto (the scene in which Ryan and Natalie arrive at an office and it is completely empty), it is more of a kind of background for Reitman to create a very interesting character study (ns), questioning issues such as family, trust and even marriage. Like Juno, Reitman deals with very personal and intimate issues in the daily life of human beings.The dialogue conceived by Reitman's script (in turn based on the book by Walter Kirn) is intelligent, ironic and sharp. Many of these dialogues serve to demystify the emotional shield built by Ryan, and the gradual way in which this defense is being undone. Reitman creates a narrative with a pleasant and coherent rhythm, allowing Ryan's self-questioning throughout the projection to take on a more natural and believable tone, something highlighted by the clever way in which Reitman avoids melodrama and out-of-time drama. As the narrative progresses, Up in The Air takes on more tragic and melancholy airs, as Ryan himself becomes a more emotionally vulnerable man and, therefore, more human in the eyes of the public.To achieve this feat, Reitman has a trio of competent and versatile actors, each giving their characters their own personality. The ever-charming Clooney lends all his charisma and humility to Ryan Bingham, moving with extreme effectiveness from initial coldness to later vulnerability. Clooney adds layers to his character, who for all his wisdom is at heart a man with his own flaws, hopes and frustrations. Vera Farmiga, who had already attracted attention in films such as The Departed and Orphan, surprises how the equally vain Alex, stripping (literally) of any feminist modesty that a character like this could carry. But the highlight goes to Anna Kendrick, who, by putting aside her small participations in the Twilight Saga, proves that she is a talented actress, knowing how to oscillate with extreme effectiveness between youth drama and humor coming from a typical young American who still has much to learn about life's disappointments.The performance of the main trio, linked to the great script signed by Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner - based on the book by Walter Kim - is certainly a good program. Full of good jokes and interesting dramatic moments, the script makes good use of the premise and doesn't fall into the easy traps of the genre. For being brave in not giving in to a banal ending, Jason Reitman gets more points. And his direction is increasingly safe, mixing moments of complete control over the situation (the opening scenes, at the airports where Bingham travels, are good examples of this) with stretches in which the director lets events out of his hands (such as the wedding scene, which the director recorded as if he were witnessing a real ceremony). Another good point to highlight is the great idea of bringing in people who have been laid off in real life and using their testimonies in the film. Most of the employees fired by George Clooney during the film were chosen after an advertisement in the newspaper. Reitman explained to the non-actors that they should tell the camera what they would have liked to say to the guy who fired them. And so came the priceless - and sad - scenes of Ryan Bingham's work. A small touch, but it shows how careful Reitman is when sculpting his work.The national title can give the impression of a romantic comedy. But Unstoppable Love is more than that. There are, yes, comedic elements and some romance in the air, but there's also all the drama that comes with riding on Bingham's job. It may not even be the movie of his life, but it is a movie that will certainly make you stop and think about what you are doing with your life. Also featuring a soundtrack full of 60s songs, Up in The Air is a beautiful analysis of daily human relationships, their fears of relationships in general and the deep anguish of being alone. Reitman dissects these themes with wit and wit, making Up in The Air his most mature film yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Life's better with company.,"An appealing George Clooney gives one of his best performances in this adaptation (credited to Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman) of a novel by Walter Kirn. Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a slick and polished man who's happy to be a bachelor. His job allows him to constantly fly around the country, firing workers when their immediate employers are too gutless to do it. He's become accustomed to, and contented with, this lifestyle. What shakes him up is when he actually makes a connection with a female executive (an enchanting Vera Farmiga) who similarly is always travelling, and then a fresh-faced kid (an adorable Anna Kendrick) with ""new and improved"" ideas on how to approach mass firings.This intelligent, likeable comedy-drama is careful to stress its point that the journeys that all of our lives are taking are not as complete without connections to our fellow humans. Although Ryan is sensitive enough to know how to handle people - and yet distanced enough to go through the firing process without getting flustered - he comes to really appreciate the fresh perspective he's gotten from these new acquaintances. And Natalie (Kendrick) learns from his experience, getting some first-hand lessons while accompanying him on a series of trips. Ultimately, Ryan will start to think hard about actually setting down roots.There's a rich variety of engaging characters, with nobody ever grating on the nerves; even co-star Danny McBride, who plays Ryan's pending brother-in-law, is more restrained than usual. A number of familiar faces pop in and out of the story; Jason Bateman is Ryan's boss, Amy Morton and Melanie Lynskey his siblings, and Sam Elliott has a cameo as a pilot. Some of the many people reacting to being fired are played by known actors (Zach Galifianakis, J.K. Simmons), but most of them are played by non-actors who had been laid off in real life due to the recession. They're either saying things that they said at the time, or *wished* that they had said.Although some of the roles may initially come off as cliches, the actors are all skilled enough and believable enough to still have them come off as real people. And that is what makes the difference in a tale dealing with misfortune and unpredictability in life.Another creditable filmmaking job for Reitman.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jason Reitman's best,"Up in the Air follows Ryan Binham (George Clooney) as he is sent to offices to fire their workers. George Clooney gives a wonderful performance as he dwells into the loneliness of his character. Also, Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga give their Oscar worthy performances as Natalie Keener and Alex Goran respectively. The cast is rounded out by memorable performances from Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Sam Elliott, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifanakis.One of the other reasons why this film is one of Reitman's best is the personal nature of the story. Reitman used clips of real people being actually fired, and this helps add to the sincerity of the film. One of the most memorable aspects of the film is the theme of friendship and family. The fired workers talked about how their friends and family helped them through the tough time, and even Bingham himself admitted his most important moments in life included other people.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It may not be as affable as firing someone face to face, however it conserves a lot of money on airfare.This isn't a comedy. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an alert observation of how people in 2009 do their jobs. Bingham adores his profession. He doesn't want a home. He doesn't want a family. He orates self-help speeches on how and why to unpack the backpack of your life. Clooney plays Bingham as one of those people you know yet you never break the ice. They endure all the motions, and make all the appropriate overtures, and you're ""friends,"" yet who's in there? There are two women in Bingham's life. Vera Farmiga plays another commercial traveler, and for some time they've been having rendezvous in lifeless ""Suite"" hotels, eating, having sex, pretending to be the happy couple neither one will go in on. Anna Kendrick, who was terrific in the 2007 buried gem Rocket Science, here plays a promising, driven new graduate who has acquired an opening at Bingham's company as it's close to her boyfriend. Bingham takes her on the road to show her the business. Farmiga is him now, Kendrick is him then.You probably won't peg all that Farmiga is thinking. Kendrick's character is bursting with such liveliness at the advent of her career that it radiates even on the departures of others'. Nothing better than pleasing your employer. The movie's strongest scenes by far involve Farmiga or Kendrick. Farmiga is so completely real and becoming that everything she says is worlds better than anyone else would probably put it in as little time and words and with as little effort as her. And the scene where Clooney puts Kendrick on the spot and tells her to fire him while he fires one hypothetical curveball question after another is pitch-perfect in its razor-sharp and rapid-fire reminiscence of a classic Howard Hawks picture.I like how Reitman begins with the way corporations rationalize degenerate methods and then administer their justifications with seamless coherence. That approach was at the heart of his exceptional debut, Thank You for Smoking. Reitman also made the cute but phenomenally overrated Juno. With these three films at the outset of his career, we can just wonder what's coming up. He makes clever, subversive commercial films. That's more of a challenge than making clever, subversive art-house films.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A safe landing...,"Up in the Air follows the life of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a mature, single, middle aged man whose job is to fire people. Directed by Jason Reitman (Juno and Thank You for Smoking), it hits home in relation to our currently troubled economic climate, which is bound to get our attention. Ryan is a charming man, liked by just about everyone albeit his clients. His employment has him flying just about everywhere in the country, and as such he lives a life composed mostly of solitude. Fortunately for him, the trade off of close personal social interaction gives him the bonus of high-end credit cards and VIP hotel accommodations.However, like with a lot of other fields, his job is changing and evolving. Enter the young and very bright, Natalie Keener played by Anna Kendrick (the Twilight Saga) who has a brilliant idea to save money by doing all the terminations via webcam on the ever-practical internet. Ryan's new job is to teach Anna the ropes before the company is totally sold on her idea.Also joined with the cast is Vera Flamigo (the Departed) as Alex, a fellow frequent flyer with a similar 'no-strings attached' attitude and an obvious affection toward Bingham.This movie was smart, witty, and playfully cynical. Clooney does a great job as usual, trying to mentor sweet Anna of the detached yet falsely hopeful persona this position requires. Under the guise of a documentary crew, the director actually held real interviews for the film with people whom recently been fired from their jobs and asked them to express the way they felt during their termination.The story is interesting and engaging, but not necessarily unpredictable. However, it by no means follows the Hollywood general criteria. Put simply, Up in the Air gives perspective on what should really matter in life, and the effects of our appreciation, or lack thereof.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Unexpectedly Moving Dramedy,"I wasn't expecting Up in the Air's last fifteen minutes to hit me like they did. But writer-director Jason Reitman's film packs a punch. The film follows Ryan Bingham, a corporate ""downsizer"" who spends the majority of his time traveling from city to city. Contrary to what one might think, Bingham enjoys the constant traveling. His Omaha apartment is bare and the 43 days that he had to spend there the year prior are described as ""miserable."" One night in Dallas, he meets Alex Goran, a traveling businesswoman, and the two immediately hit it off due to their similar lifestyles. George Clooney is in top form as the cynical Bingham, whose career has insulated him from human contact. His chemistry with Alex is palpable, exemplified by the twinkle in their eyes when they look at each other for the first time to the way that they interact when Bingham gives her a tour of his old high school.Reitman's writing establishes the connection between these characters but Clooney and Vera Farmiga bring it to life. Farmiga herself delivers a performance that rivals Clooney's, magnificently capturing the sensuality and tenacity required to make her character work. And as a recent Cornell grad named Natalie Keener who has big plans for the future of the company that Bingham works for, Anna Kendrick delivers her best work to date. Keener accompanies Bingham on his travels in order to learn about the difficulties that he faces in telling workers that the company that they are working for has decided to unemploy them. In the process, Kendrick captures Keener's naivety remarkably, and we watch her wide-eyed enthusiasm fade away because of the draining task at hand.Reitman succeeds brilliantly at transporting the audience right back to the late-2000s, bringing memories of the economic downturn back to the forefront. In a stroke of genius, Reitman interviewed dozens of recently laid-off workers and included segments of these interviews in the film. While they don't take up too much time, they do touch on the bitter realities of unemployment and the recession. However, the film is primarily a character study focused on Bingham, with existential undertones and moments of genuine hilarity. Because of his relationship with Alex (and to a lesser degree, his relationship with Keener), Bingham begins to let his cynical exterior fade away and falls in love, despite his aversion to marriage and lack of human connection. I suspect that it's this subtle shift in character that Reitman and Clooney so expertly portray that allowed for the last fifteen minutes of the film to land with such a brute emotional impact.Up in the Air proved a more difficult watch than I was expecting. Not because it requires superior intellect to decode its jokes or anything of the like, but because it's deviously complex. The relationships between our three leads are one thing, but Reitman's willingness to comment on mass unemployment and human connection, all with an existential touch, is something else entirely. And all the way up to its unexpectedly moving (and somewhat devastating) conclusion, the film manages to delight and entertain.Rating: 8/10 (Great)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't believe it.,"My problem with this film is that, as good as Clooney's performance is as Ryan, I didn't believe the character for a second. There was no reason to accept that Ryan was a real person the way that he is. No way to think that a person could be in his situation where he was ""ready to make a connection"" because there was no explanation as to why any functioning human being would be so connection phobic in the first place. It's not Clooney's fault. It's simply that the character was written without enough back story to make him realistic. He's a plot device and nothing more. Which is why the story ultimately fails to work or generate much emotional impact.The rest of the cast is terrific, and both Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick deserve the nominations and awards that they've received so far. Pacing is good, and the script is well written, except for the big hole where the main character should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The storyline leaves everybody wanting more. When I left the theater, the entire crowd was murmuring the same thing, ""the worst movie I've ever seen"", and the theater was packed.Why critics ""like"" this movie is a testament to why they write in the first place; they know not how to do anything else.

"Strong performances by George, Vera, & Justin, Anna's a little weak!","Multinational companies have no loyalties, not to nations, not to people, just to the bottom line! Those who ""manage"" these multinational sociopathic organizations pillage what they can so they never have to ""work"" again (e.g. Jack Welch)! This movie aptly demonstrates that the business model of the day (the neo-feudal model) cares not where they get their workers nor do they care where they get their customers, they just want to keep the elite happy while the managing sub-elite take what they can (e.g. stock options they can exercise for zero dollars) doing what they must to remain in power so they can plunder what they can for as long as they can! It's a race to the bottom for the 98% and an orgy of gluttony for the top 2%! The rest of us are or have become serfs or worse slaves and we bend over take our severance packages (if any at all) and roll over like the good dogs we are! Great movie for exposing this reality!

Come fly with them,"It's smart, satiric and thoroughly engaging. Writer-director Jason Reitman broadens his tonal range with the follow-up to the unwanted- pregnancy comedy, Juno (2007).Adapted from the 2001 bestseller of the same name, Up in the Air tells the story of a management consultant (Clooney) who specializes in giving the pink slip to employees of companies that are downsizing.Jetting around America on a daily basis, the serial sacker is more concerned about accumulating frequent- flier miles than forging any lasting emotional bonds. He even gives motivational lectures extolling the virtues of living with minimum material baggage.However, he has to re-assess his own priorities when confronted with a sassy fellow jetsetter (Farmiga). His nomadic lifestyle is further threatened by a new recruit (Anna Kendrick) who proposes to terminate jobs via video-conferencing. For once, the female characters aren't mere fodder for the male protagonist.While there's no doubt that Reitman and his co-scenarist Sheldon Turner can write acerbic dialogue, the momentum does tend to sag towards the climax. A pep talk about the joys of marriage is uncharacteristically sappy. Consequently, the film never quite regains its verve.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Occasionally poignant, sometimes conceited, but always entertaining.","After his critically acclaimed, but commercially underrated, debut feature film Thank You For Smoking, Jason ""son of Ivan"" Reitman proved he was one of those uncanny directors who could make those type of indie movies that seep into the mainstream. Then there was Juno. Reitman's sophomore effort won all sorts of awards, especially for Diablo Cody's unique screenplay. But it was Reitman's handling of the dialogue on screen that really makes it work and turned what would have been a cult favourite into a widespread, modern-day classic. Third time round and Reitman has his first bona fide Hollywood star – and budget – to work with. But with great resources comes great expectations.Already tipped as an Oscar frontrunner by the critical world, Air is actually Reitman's least successful film. That's not to say it isn't very good and doesn't show glimmers of brilliance, but unlike his previous works it just feels a touch overdone with the self-knowing hipness and metaphorical messages. Where Smoking's biting satire and Juno's razor-sharp dialogue felt natural, Air's quirkiness has an – wait for it – air of arrogance. This may be misleading though as Reitman's slightly subpar output – compared to his own work – is still an enjoyable journey that most filmmakers could only dream of creating. He obviously has a confidence when dealing with multi-layered characters and plots as he handles them with ease; Ryan, Natalie and Alex all go through a massive arc that is realistic and intriguing whilst the underlying stories of family, love and job-loss are always present, even if only in the background.Whilst I would be extremely hard pressed to put Reitman or his film as the one to beat at the Oscars this year, Clooney is a different case altogether. The notorious ladies man gives himself over completely to Ryan Bingham, a middle-aged bachelor who seems entirely comfortable and content with his isolated, travelling lifestyle in the clouds, but is possibly a different man underneath the facade. He should be loathsome and unrecognisable, however Clooney's inspired performance ensures Bingham is neither; in fact he is quite the opposite. Without seeing the other touted Oscar contenders it is hard to say, but Clooney gets my early vote for Best Actor. In the peripheral is the tremendously talented Farmiga, who has etched out a respectable CV for herself over the last few years, and Twilight¬ sideliner Kendrick who proves she is worth more than just teenage guff.Occasionally poignant, sometimes conceited, but always entertaining thanks to a career-best turn from Clooney.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Lonely Up There,"There's a lot of people out there that are so afraid of being alone, or feel so pressured to aspire to certain merits, or just feel the most comfortable meeting someone, marrying them, and making a family. Then there are other people out there who prefer isolating themselves, keeping their emotional connections tenuous and living in the perfectly controlled world of zero social responsibility. They work, they love their job, and they fulfill vaguely relationshipy things that eventually fade out. George Clooney (who is either terribly unhappy or just really enjoys acting sad in his movies) is Ryan Bingham, and Ryan Bingham has a backpack he wants to burn and a pink slip he wants to give you. He has women in his life: those he avoids because they represent too many emotional connections, and those he sees casually they come and go with the wind. It's a certain one in particular, a new coworker played by Anna Kendrick, who knocks him off his rhythm and inadvertently forces him to ask questions he's been avoiding all his life. She's an idealist: young, brilliant, and horribly naive. For all intents and purposes, she essentially ruins his life. It's by pure accident and we essentially watch him give birth to himself. It's beautiful and messy and it's rather unfortunate that the film ends with the baby in a basket, so to speak. But a sequel to this film would end up being a Hallmark Movie of the Week, and those are too gushy for this cynical, bittersweet piece. Vera Farmiga is delicious in this movie up until a random point that, while well told, I don't agree with. Anna Kendrick is adorable as always and Clooney manages to once again skirt that line between godlike and everyman that just leaves you in tatters. He's like Cary Grant with just the perfect pinch of Gary Cooper.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Up In The Air lures you in with its witty humour, and then smacks you in the face with depression.","Much like a plane, this flies past at a speedy pace and somehow takes loneliness to refreshingly elevate it to atmospheric levels. Such an easy watch, thanks to competent directing and writing from Jason Reitman. An experienced employee from a firm who is hired by companies to fire individuals is tasked with training a young rookie. During this process, her perspective of life and maturity slowly changes his attitude where loneliness and worthlessness are fragmented in his mind. A surprisingly meaty narrative that is executed decently. Receiving an opportunity to chase your dreams after getting fired, evoking opportunism and optimism. Generational communication which involves describing idealisms regarding love and life. The thin line between casual encounters and conjuring up a romance, provoking paranoia and jealousy. The disadvantages of living on the job having to travel constantly where luxuries and class overcome family and friends. Advancing technologies replacing the need for physical employees in the quaternary sector. All of the above are interesting aspects to a consistently engaging plot. Reitman's scripts allows dark humour to seep through cracks and enhance the characterisation of the film. And what a script this was! The juxtaposition between Natalie and Ryan provided witty banter and sarcastic debates, they felt relatable and their chemistry was conveyed naturally. A script that contains the line ""a cocoon of self-banishment"" is a winning script in my book. Acting was solid all round. Clooney was pretty much himself but Farmiga and Kendrick were electrifying in two very nuanced performances. Going from location to location does feel slightly repetitive, and the twenty minute wedding scene does slow down the pacing. But the small heartbreaking twist at the end was worth it. A thoroughly entertaining drama which provided both laughs and sentimentality.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's just not about very much at all - a total yawn,This movie is really disappointing. The story is weak. It's about very little - a corporate downsizer and a boring little affair.The praise and nominations are really undeserved. Everyone hardly has much acting to do. George Clooney is his usual self with that little half smile. Vera Farmiga is attractive but she really doesn't have much to do. Anna Kendrick's much lauded performance as Clooney's young colleague is adequate but again there isn't a lot required of her. The story is not moving or interesting. The ending is predictable and you feel that nothing happened at all.If it wasn't a Clooney movie and heavily marketed I don't think it would have even got any nominations at all.

"Good Movie, Somewhat Unique","I tend to seek out movies that maybe have a unique theme, a theme that has not been overworked by Hollywood. This movie has a fairly unique theme - with George Clooney Road Warrior. In the business world, a road warrior is someone who travels a great deal, which today mostly means planes,rental cars and hotel rooms. A good number of people have lived that life, including me (but not to the extent as George) and it was great to see it as a movie subject. If you have traveled a lot, especially for a business, you would likely smile at his inside knowledge how to get through airports fast and comfortably and dealing with life in a 10 by 15 foot hotel room most of your life. Nice Portrayal.That is part of the movie, and another part I feel was a fairly serious portrayal of relationships. Business relationships to be sure, but also personal relationships of singles and married folk. Since these are relationships, perhaps not all will always like how things turn out, but I felt it was a fairly deep portrayal that does bring you into the feelings of the movie characters. The acting is good or better than good, the movie has both a light feel and a very serious one both at the same time - which gives it depth.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A beautiful movie...that self aggrandizes Mr. Clooney.,"First let me start out with a few things to get out of the way.The acting in this movie is beautiful. This is probably the best acting I've ever seen out of Clooney, who is a great actor in his own right, but this is a top level performance by him. Vera Farmiga not only is absolutely gorgeous, but plays her role beautifully. Anna Kendrick, who I thought was going to be a bit of a stifler, was absolutely wonderful. These three make up the crux of a great acting trio in the movie that bring everything to life.The soundtrack was fantastic. Very much something I would expect out of a Zach Braff type of movie that explores relationships in a quirky way. The music ebbs and flows with the ups and downs of the characters that definitely draws the audience in with huge emotional pull. I love that in my films.The story itself, a man that lives his life with no attachments, learns to build them and try to find love. Powerful stuff.Except that its all a farce. While he does learn to build important attachments with family, the movie feels as though its just a mirror of his own life, at least the public one that was in all the tabloids and magazine articles from yesteryear. An actor that is devoid of all attachments, eventually settles down. Except in the film, that doesn't happen.There is no payoff. His theory of people should just drift and move is proven right. Maybe because its a self fulfilling prophecy, he always lived that way so when the opportunity to do that it was all a farce, which is why it blew up in his face and the goals he had before meant nothing. The film, at its conclusion, feels like it meant nothing. I loved it, until the last 10 minutes. No character had a real change, learned much of anything, and no one, except for a little bit of Clooney, experienced much of an end to an arc. If I hadn't of seen the last 10 minutes of the movie, I would've given it a 9/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The story of life up in the air.,"Jason Reitman's third feature is the most personal-feeling of the three and perhaps the best. After exploring the life of a tobacco lobbyist and a quirky pregnant 16 year-old, Reitman turns to a more global issue and one every human can relate to: employment. At first attempting to make a film on the booming economy earlier this decade, the tone changed completely and now this is a downward, somewhat depressed and bitter look at the situation we face as Americans today; more relevant now than ever before.George Clooney gives the performance of his career, even better than his offers from Michael Clayton and Syriana. He portrays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to tell others that their working days are over. He travels for a good 2/3 out of the year and is never more happy than when he is on a plane, going through safety inspections or walking through the airport. He knows all the rules and ways to sidestep and save time, travels lighter than most ever will and has all of life in perfect order. His life is turned upside down when his no-nonsense boss (Jason Bateman) announces that a young, perky up and coming employee has created an idea to do their job over the Internet and with computers. Played by Anna Kendrick with fierce tenacity and focused determination, she is taken on the road with Ryan to be shown the ropes of how this job is done; and there are definite rules on these things.What is so interesting about this movie is the way in which co-writer/director Reitman so easily and fluidly weaves together the alleged comedy and the unmistakable sadness and bitterness. There are scenes in which we chuckle or maybe laugh out loud at a one-liner, but then there are heart-wrenching scenes of people getting laid off and no one cannot feel sorry for each and every single person. It isn't important to know what they did or who they are; simply that they had a job and now they are gently being shoved out the door.To counter these scenes we get the more personal story of Ryan's life, which basically consists of his suitcase, its belongings and traveling until he comes across a woman who shares his interests and his lifestyle; Alex played with incredible charm and class by the lovely Vera Farmiga. Together, they laugh, hang out and basically try to hang onto one another amidst the turmoil all around them. Ryan's relationship with his young protégé, Natalie, is also intriguing because he at first despises her idea since it undercuts his lifestyle, but soon he warms up to her and sees beneath the rough exterior someone who is still very much afraid that her life is over before it began.There are also scenes with Ryan's two sisters; the only family he has and seems even cold to them. However, with a little push from Alex and Natalie, he starts to realize that perhaps he has missed something important this whole time and needs to get involved now more than ever.Beneath the cynicism of America's current economic status, there appears a glimmer of hope but it is not pushed to the forefront like so many other movies. Rather, Reitman lets sit there and lets us see the whole picture. The acting brings everything into focus with Clooney showing a reserved, relaxed man with all the answers but also a side of vulnerability he never knew he had about his job and the way things work. Farmiga is eager and able to go toe-to-toe with him and Kendrick needs to get away from those awful Twilight films because this role shows she has real potential to be a real actress. And Reitman's screenplay covers a lot of ground and material, but never too much and sheds just enough light on everything so we catch it all but aren't overwhelmed.If nothing else, this is certainly one of the best films of 2009. It further shows Reitman's ability to find humor in the saddest and strangest ways and does it with such class and distinction. Perhaps what this is saying is what the people who were fired had in common was that there was someone in their life with them to take the impact. I had a somewhat drab feeling after leaving the theater but I realize that it wasn't because the movie was sad so much that it was right.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One big American Airlines commercial sponsored by Hilton,"It was a good watch nonetheless, and movies do need somebody to pay for the budget. But the only issue with me is that when there's too much of it all over the place it just gets annoying. I think the point was made many, many times. But towards the end it just came to show. I mean, Adam Sandler is most notable for putting the sponsors in his movies but he doesn't typically flaunt it all over the place -- Little Nicky is the last one I remember with it being one big Popeye's Chicken commercial.Other than that the story, cinematography, the acting from George Clooney, Jason Bateman and Anna Kendrick were all very good.

A movie with so many layers,"Just like a memorable song or book, a film could be a representation of a certain time period. ""Up in the Air"" is not only a masterfully written, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed picture, but it is one that is extremely layered. Look past the basic premise of the film and you will see that it shows how the world is changing through relationships, business, and technology. There is a film society called ""National Film Registry"", which films that belong to it are significant to a time period.

There are a few great quips and lines of dialogue which are delivered brilliantly, and in general there is great clarity in the direction of the narrative.Separate arcs don't join up seamlessly, and characters (played by well-known faces) are brought in and dropped out within a single scene. Plus, whilst there is a conclusion to the key plot, the film does drift off without a definitive ending. That said, still thoroughly enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
About as filling as airline food...,"I found this latest offering from writer-director Jason Reitman to be a bland, meandering film consisting of vaguely defined, mostly unengaging characters going through the motions in a threadbare, paint-by-numbers script. One couldn't help but notice the sheer effort in rendering the limp material meaningful and on message enough to give it that cherished Oscar cred. Thus, we have: George Clooney's earnest, resonant intonations about the vicissitudes of life - often provided in handy V.O. just in case we get lost, the use of ""real"" non-professional actor people to portray the characters receiving the corporate axe wielded by Clooney's mercenary outplacement agent, the jangley, twee acoustic ballads that accompany the various ""theme montages"" sprinkled throughout the narrative, and always, always, Clooney's ever-present warm, tender gaze impregnating his barren surroundings with richly detailed meaning.Now, granted, there are some genuinely funny moments that crop up--seemingly by accident, like they were the itinerant left overs from an earlier ""funny"" draft of the script, presumably written before the Great Recession rendered any comedic treatment of the subject matter unpalatable for Hollywood's delicate sensibilities. These include a delightful Q & A session between Clooney's road mistress (Verna Farmiga) and his young up and coming protégé (Anna Kendrick in an erratic, occasionally annoying performance) regarding relationships and marriage. Another charming moment occurs between Clooney and his very distant potential brother in law who is getting cold feet before his imminent wedding.It's clear in such scenes that Jason Reitman has a gift for comedy and creating clever, and sometimes touching laughs. But his attempts at serious and topical drama come across as pandering and are too on the nose. All in all, there just weren't enough genuine or engaging moments to dispel the feeling that this whole exercise was an attempt by the director and his creative team to amass the necessary number of theme and message points needed to collect the golden Oscar hardware.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A movie that's cold and shows harsh reality. Yet it's a drama that tries making a sharp connection, plus it captures the current times really well.","Without a doubt Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" is one of the best films of 2009, as when watching it you see it really connects and shows the current times really well. As it's themes though cold and harsh are now an everyday reality like layoffs, corporate downsizing, and the firing of people everywhere across this great land of ours. Still aside from the picture's timely themes it's blended with enough vivid characters and a sharp love story that make it an instant classic to never forget.George Clooney(in one of his most standout roles)is Ryan Bingham a lonely corporate downsizing executive who's life is flying in the air around the country to fire people. Ryan goes city to city company to company and gives people the harsh and straight news that they have no longer been needed and Bingham is good at it too he doesn't seem to miss any sleep. Ryan also has an obsession with frequent flying miles it's his goal to break the record.Only Ryan's boss Craig(Jason Bateman)wants to tame it down some and keep Ryan out of the air and keep him grounded and change the game up some. Those new ways happen to be more high tech firing by conference calls of the internet and sugar coated meetings. And much of this rest on the newly hired young gun the bright and sassy new partner of Ryan's that is Natalie Keener(Anna Kendrick who's character shows such a fragile state behind her cruelness). Along the way as they journey together along the cities and conference rooms a lot is learned as Natalie sees she just isn't made out for this harsh world as she's taught lessons by the old pro Bingham which will open up doors for her in a new direction.The biggest dilemma for Ryan is he must choose between his goal of flying miles or a connection to his heart with another frequent traveler Alex. Ryan meets an attractive and elegantly sexy lady named Alex(Vera Farmiga in a nice sexy role)one night at a classy hotel bar for traveling executives they both hit it off as the chemistry is just right. It leads to a one night stand romp in a hotel room, as a connection is made right then as Ryan feels lust has captured his heart. Along the way on more travel both Ryan and Alex have more romantic encounters that Ryan feels is becoming more and more unexpected love which has him at risk of settling down. Only Bingham will find out a big surprise with Alex as she has hidden secrets and looked only at him as escape.Overall great film that along the way tried to change the central character of Ryan Bingham, yet in the end he rightfully stayed put as he belongs up in the air to make a living and that's his life. Most important it was good he was at least able to make some romantic connection along his journey even though if it wasn't meant and his influence in some way was used to change the life and attitude of the movies wild card Natalie(Anna Kendrick)showing her she was meant for a more sensitive job task not one like his of life flying and firing people. Really ""Up in the Air"" is a movie that will be looked upon for many years to come as it captures the mood and economic recession times of downsizing just perfect as when later and newer generations look back to see how a majority of people were living in 2009 they will look back to this film as it captures the harsh reality of the current life. ""Up in the Air"" is now a remembered instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
some people just work better alone,"Ryan Bingham is a middle-aged man who fires people for a living. He works for a company that corporations hire to perform mass layoffs, a soul sucking task that managers often prefer to offload to third parties both because it's easier and for legal and workplace safety reasons. The movie takes place in 2009 during the economic aftermath of the 'Great Recession', a boom time for his industry.If you've ever had the misfortune to live through one of these layoff events, you'd recognize that the movie gets a lot of the details correct. The carefully orchestrated image of calm professionalism, the coolly empathetic attitude calibrated to make it clear that they understand what individuals are going through while still making it clear that it isn't a negotiation or debate, the standard scripts dictating the flow of the conversation and acceptable euphemisms, the absurd insistence that they will assist you in ""transitioning"". You get the idea.It would, frankly, be extremely easy to make you hate the people who do this for a living. Performing that kind of work requires people with muted empathy; they can't afford to care too much about the people they fire or the emotional weight would crush them. As the characters allude to in conversations amongst themselves, getting fired is, emotionally, akin to a death in the family. It's serious trauma, and they simply can't afford to feel it.Which makes portraying Ryan, a man uniquely suited to his job, a difficult task, even for someone with as much charisma as George Clooney. Ryan prefers a life without the burdens of things and people; he even gives seminars that extol the virtues of caring about only what you can carry in a backpack. He views the road as his home and despises returning to his apartment even for forty days a year. His preference is for the sanitized comfort of the corporate world: hotel rooms, airline and car rental loyalty clubs, credit cards and points. All of his life goals and ambitions are built around those things.Ryan's comfortable world is turned upside down when his employer hires a young ingénue named Natalie Keener who has proposed making the industry more efficient by doing their work via video conferencing instead of in-person. Thinking of the money to be saved, Ryan's boss insists Natalie's vision is the future of the business, but Ryan convinces him to at least have her accompany him to several job sites so she can get a feel for how the process works in real life. Along the way, Natalie's infectious humanity gradually begins to make Ryan question some of the rules by which he leads his life.What's particularly interesting about the movie are the ways in which it subverts expectations. Traditional storytelling would suggest that a man who neither wants nor needs deep human connections and enjoys his job firing people should be shown the error of his ways, ala 'A Christmas Carol'. But Ryan is actually very good at his job, to the point where others routinely steal his lines and approaches. He's good at reading people and knowing when they need to re-contextualize what's happening to them, when they need to just vent, and when they need to have their shattered egos rebuilt. And his lack of human connection isn't complete; we see eventually that he does in fact care about others in meaningful ways. He just prefers to do it from a distance.Which isn't to say that there aren't tragic aspects to Ryan's character, as detailed beautifully when he achieves a long-standing goal of his and is asked during a celebration in his honor where he's from. But the sense isn't that he's a tragic figure so much as a new type of creature uniquely adapted to an environment most of us would see as inhospitable. We see him and shiver at the thought of his life, but also come to realize that he would do the same thinking of ours.The movie ends on this note, almost abruptly. Ryan has visited humanity and observed their ways, even tried living as one of them, but ultimately found their world confusing and distressing, and returns to his natural habitat. Though he bears us no ill will, we will not see him again save for the occasional postcard and by the taillight of his home in the night sky.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incisive Look at Life's Emotional Baggage Through the Journeys of a Corporate Hatchet Man,"As someone who has both laid off staff and a year later, became the victim of a layoff after twelve years with the same company, I had a personal interest in seeing how director/co-screenwriter Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"", ""Juno"") was going to adapt Walter Kirn's smart, unsettling 2001 novel. Even though eight years have elapsed since the book's publication, the filmmaker - along with co-writer Sheldon Turner - manages to deepen Kirn's themes in this wry, emotionally resonant 2009 dramedy and make them even more relevant with the pervasive downsizing of corporate America. The movie also manages to surprise even when certain plot turns seem evident before they occur. Initially, there is a veneer of cynicism that makes you think the story will be an abject lesson in the impermanence of life, but instead, it evolves into one man's journey into the heart of the emotional turbulence he had been careful to avoid. Toward that end, Reitman seems to be inspired by Alexander Payne's equally perceptive road movies, ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"", films that reflect a similar storytelling style.The plot focuses on laser-sharp corporate layoff consultant Ryan Bingham, a man who regales in the impermanence of life by traveling 322 days on the road, informing targeted employees that they are about to lose their jobs. There is a necessary callousness in his approach, but he knows it's necessary to be present and honest when it comes to conveying the unpleasant news. Bingham is also a motivational speaker who espouses unburdening one's life of possessions and fitting everything essential within the confines of a backpack. Proving his case, he lives in hotels, airplanes, and airport terminals with his one life goal being the seventh person to collect ten million frequent-flier miles. If you can get past the Spartan one-bedroom apartment he keeps in Omaha for the 43 days he is forced to be at home, the hatchet man appears to lead a charmed if rather solitary life. Complications, however, ensue on both personal and professional fronts.Bingham meets a fellow transient traveler named Alex Goran in an airport lounge and assesses that he may have found his soul-mate, so much so that he invites her to come to his estranged sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Bingham's boss wants to introduce a new strategy proposed by a fresh-faced, post-grad school upstart. New hire Natalie Keener suggests using remote teleconferencing to perform the layoff notifications. Since the new technology is the antithesis of Bingham's one-on-one method, he brings Natalie along on the road to show her how it can't possibly work. In a role that feels custom-tailored to all his strengths, George Clooney plays Bingham with an emotional precision that complements his charismatic persona which pivots between swaggering and self-effacing. On one hand, it's his most definitive movie-star role, and yet Clooney has never revealed as much about himself on screen.The always watchable Vera Farmiga (""The Departed"", ""Down to the Bone"") is sexy and confident as the woman who seems perfect for Bingham, even though their adroit compatibility could not possibly sustain an actual commitment. Their interplay is fun to watch because there is a Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell-level rapport that keeps both on their toes. Anna Kendrick (""Twilight"") is winning as Natalie even if her character's naiveté feels a bit manufactured at times. Jason Bateman (""Juno"") has a field day playing Bingham's smarmy boss, while Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey (""Heavenly Creatures""), and Danny McBride (""Pineapple Express"") plays their accustomed types with aplomb as members of Bingham's immediate family. In cameos, J.K. Simmons (""Juno"") and Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover"") sharply play two of the victimized employees, but for the rest, Reitman uses non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off. As usual with Reitman's films, it boasts an eclectic soundtrack that works really well with the storyline.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
lost decade,"Jason Reitman (""Ghostbusters"" director Ivan Reitman's son) made his directorial debut two years ago with the satirical comedy ""Thank You for Smoking"", about a tobacco industry spin doctor. Reitman focuses on similar subject matter in ""Up in the Air"", including similar dialog. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who has the job of going around the country firing people when their bosses don't have the guts to do it to their faces. Spending most of his time in airplanes, Ryan has no family, and his apartment is the most pathetic place that you ever saw. But Ryan has a surprise waiting for him.The tanking economy and massive job losses in the past few years make this film all the more relevant. Many of the ""firees"" are people who actually got fired from jobs responding as they would to the person firing them. While feeling disgusted at what Ryan does, I couldn't help but admire his gumption (or is it his lack of ethics?).This movie and ""Thank You for Smoking"" (I haven't seen ""Juno"") have shown Jason Reitman to be a very good director. It certainly deserves its Oscar nominations, although I haven't decided for certain which movie I want to win. But either way, I wholeheartedly recommend ""Up in the Air"". It's the perfect look at what our society has become.Also starring Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey (of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""The Informant!""), J.K. Simmons (of the Spider-Man movies and ""Thank You for Smoking"") and Sam Elliott.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Romantic comedy? Drama? Either way, it's good.","Usually if I see Vera Farmiga's name in a movie's cast list, I'll invariably sit down and tune right in. As a rule of thumb, it's worked out pretty well so far; her presence always imbues a scene with warmth. And it's no different with ""Up in the Air"" - and the nice thing here is that she's apart of a greater whole. Everything about this movie is spot-on; the writing, direction and especially the cast. It all hangs together very well. Clooney's somewhat against type here, playing a fairly unlikable character, but hell if he's not charming nonetheless. And he shares a brilliant chemistry with Farmiga. This is a story about relationships, both the lack and need thereof. There are twists and turns, and I needed a little bit to absorb and reconcile the ending . . . but the movie's a winner, plain and simple.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up in the Air Hits Cloud Nine ****,"Something very different has hit the movie screen and it's ""Up in the Air.""What an appropriate film to deal with how people are directly affected when they lose their jobs.This is about the best movie role that George Clooney has ever had. In a part that would have been Cary Grant's years ago, Clooney plays a suave guy who goes around telling people that they've lost their jobs. After doing this for so long, he has become immune to their responses, and frankly, he couldn't care less.When his life-style is threatened by a newcomer to the firm, he brings her along to show her how he does his job.Of course, the best part of the job is the rude awakening that he faces by the woman he has chosen to play around with.Clooney's vulnerability and indifference to others is extraordinarily done. To say that he is callous earlier in the film, that's putting it mildly. Some would say that he got what he deserved by acting in the way he does.This picture is destined to become a part of Americana, especially if the economy doesn't turn around soon. It definitely serves as a wake-up call.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's entertaining enough,"(2009) Up In The Air
DRAMAGeorge Clooney stars as Ryan whose job it is to fire people until his own job becomes in jeopardy in itself, because of computer technology. Although, the film was based on a book by Walter Kim, and has also been rewritten for the screenplay by Jason Rietman, there's also remnants or influences from ""The Accidental Tourist"" by Anne Tyler. Upon the first viewing and as a realist, I couldn't decide whether it was supposed to be funny or to feel empathy for seeing people fired or let go without cause, especially from some stranger, in this case happens to be George Clooney, is I have to say one of the worst feelings to be in. Therefore, after tried to see this film once and then turning it off, and after a bunch of films later, it was easier to watch this film on it's second attempt, since I had already was well aware what to expect. And although the film is well made, it's also quite self-indulgent because the story centers solely on one person and not others around him, making the other characters seem artificial and one-sided! And as a realist, I'm for the working poor since I know exactly how it feels to be 'let go' from a job that pays well with a little severance to go with it. While management call it reconstructuring, the workers call it cutting costs so that more money can be put into their own pockets, which is why on some ""high paying"" jobs, a union is necessary and this film makes some attempts to somehow justify it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clooney was the draw?,"What a depressing, unspeakably rotten piece of idiocy. So, the script was hatched in a Malibu palace and everyone present thought it was killer? There were about 10 couples in the theater at the 5:05 feature when I saw the film. And it got A's and B's from the establishment critics? Oh, I forgot. They were in the palace, too. I went home and watched David Zelnick DVD just to wash my brain clean of the residue. The issues of immersion in one's career to the exclusion of everything else, the abysmal sadness of being fired, the callousness of corporate America, using people solely for one's own sexual gratification, the complexity of modern telecommunications/credit card gymnastics--all of this was an accurate reflection of reality. That said, the hollow-man syndrome so ubiquitous in the corporate realm should have had a denouement other than the hollow-ending one.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) shows some powerlessness as Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) come into his life in two completely different ways.,"George Clooney plays the role of Ryan Bingham, who is a blunt, career-obsessed, uncommitted, single guy. He meets Alex Goran who is played by Vera Farmiga, at a hotel lounge and they begin noticing all of their similarities. She impacts Ryan's life and eventually helps him change his way of thinking. Then, Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick, comes along. Natalie is hired in at the same company Ryan's works for to make some changes. These changes are the last thing Ryan wants to deal with.The theme to this movie is whether or not a person can be truly happy with themselves and their life without having interaction or commitments with loved ones and friends. The film proves that people get carried away with their career and sometimes do not even notice how it can be affecting their life. The main character, Ryan, was so used to traveling for his career that he learned to love it. He didn't think he would ever want it any other way. It was all he was used to. His way of thinking started to change as he was faced with many new obstacles in a short period of time.There are special lighting effects used for brief moments in the film. The scenes in the hotel have a dark background. The main focus is the looks on Ryan and Alex's faces. We are reading their minds a little by watching their facial expressions when the two talk in the lounge. Another example of when the lighting in dark is when Ryan is giving his so-called motivational speeches. The moods in these scenes are set by the way the lighting is.Another technique in this film is angle. I noticed right away that Ryan looked so small walking through the airports. These are not home for him although he says he might as well call them his home. The camera was always facing down on Ryan to make him look small. When Ryan is firing people or giving his speeches, the camera angle made him seem taller and bigger. He was in charge in these scenes.Being able to make changes and take chances in life are very important. Making commitments in life are also necessary; whether it be with family, relationships, or with a career. Unlike Ryan's motivational speeches in the film, the more commitments a person has, the more their life is fulfilled. Humans need other human interaction. This theory was proved to be true in this film.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Timing, Timing, Timing","It's not often that I watch a movie and I really do not want it to end. When I was watching UP IN THE AIR, it felt like a long movie, but I loved every minute of it. I could've watched it all day. They say, ""Location, Location, Location"" about selling things, but for movies, it is ""Timing, Timing, Timing"". Slumdog Millionaire was successful because it came at a time when we needed to see that underdog story and we needed to know about the poverty in India. Although ""City of God"" is the superior film, it's timing was poor and meant that it wasn't as well received and most people have never heard of it. Up in the Air could not have been more aptly timed. It tells the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who makes his profession by flying around the country and personally laying off employees in the masses. He loves it – he's excellent at it, he has been doing it for so long he is incredibly efficient. At that cost, he has no ties to anyone, spending all his time on the road and not communicating with most of his family. His whole life shakes up when a young college grad Natalie (Anna Kendrick) enters the workplace offering to start doing the job via video chat, thus reducing the cost of flight, as well as shaking up Bingham's lifestyle that he has mastered. Their boss (Jason Batemen) instructs Bingham to show her the ropes and take her on his next trip. Jason Reitman has been 3 for 3 now with his movies. Thank You For Smoking was an excellent satire of consumerism, Juno was a fantastic comedy that reminded us that good dialogue alone can make a movie hilarious, and now comes Up in the Air, a much more mainstream and much more ambitious project. His direction isn't noticeable, but he certainly knows how to pick the right projects to work on. I talk a lot about how Do The Right Thing excels because of its perfect balance of comedy and drama. Up in the Air nails this, matching every scene with comedic excellence as well as emotional story. It can't really be described as either; instead it feels much more real. The characters aren't always sad, nor are the situations always funny. It feels like real life. All of the lead characters in the film feel like people we know, our friends, and we enjoy watching them do their thing. Real life is boring, but there is enough color added to it via the writing that makes you enjoy this movie and to not want it to end. It's a movie you will love watching, without necessarily rolling on the floor laughing or crying your eyes out in. The acting from the three leads (Clooney, Kendrick, and Vera Faramiga) is good and all of them carry their own weight. It helps that the script they are working with seems flawless. All of them have memorable moments. Nominations for all three is a near guarantee, but I don't think Up in the Air will be winning any acting awards. Up in the Air is just perfect in so many ways. It's layered with many ironies, as well as some great messages about life, and more importantly, whom we spend it with. I am left slightly speechless at the genuine quality of the film. It's the kind of movie I love, and it's perfect. So far, this is the best we've seen in 2009. My Rating: 10/10reelscenes.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A brilliant take on the grounded realities of life,"Anything George Clooney (and that dreamy smile), and I lower my requirements from a movie immediately.I had been eagerly anticipating it's release and made sure that I caught the movie the very first day that it hit my Virginia multiplex. This is one of those movies that is so multi-faceted and multi-dimensioned, that it becomes very challenging to write a review that will do it justice.The director : Jason Rietman (who also directed the much applauded ""Juno"") builds the movie around Ryan Bingham. To the director's biggest credit, Clooney is Bingham, and not the other way around. Bingham works for an agency that helps employers fire their employees, and escape the messy situation of having to do it themselves. His job keeps him on the road, rather ""up in the air"" for more than four-fifths of a year (I think).Bingham is a loyal American Airlines traveler who flies cross-country to help corporations ""terminate"" their employees. He leaves them with a package that has a road map for their future unemployed days. Bingham's agency hires a recent Cornell grad, Natalie Keener (played by Anna Kendrick). Ms Keener proposes the money saving, highly efficient, zero travel requiring idea of firing people over the internet. Bingham pooh-poohs this idea, citing how inhuman and mechanized this process would be. His boss makes him take Keener along for his last firing spree. Some of the most satirical moments of the movie occur here. Bingham's efficient and seasoned traveler ways are comically juxtaposed with Keener's over-packed and inexperienced ways. One brilliant scene is where Bingham shows Keener the stereotypical ways of other air travelers: ""Never get behind old people. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left. Bingo, Asians. They pack light, travel efficiently, and they have a thing for slip on shoes. Gotta love 'em"".Kendrick does tremendous justice to Keener's role. She brings out the hardheadedness, confident and yet highly vulnerable characteristics of Keener's role to a T. Bingham's casual, and initially endearing relationship with another frequent traveler- Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides some sweet romantic relief to the movie. Another few sets of brilliant scenes are when the trio crashes a tech company celebration at their hotel. Keener's well planned time line for her life is wonderfully contrasted with the older duos nonchalant and non-committal ways. Bingham's public speaking episodes that ask ""How much does you life weigh?"" are extremely well constructed and poignant. I will not write too much about the plot, as I want you to get your bang for the buck when you watch this movie yourself. Every single character in the plot: Bingham's boss (played by Jason Bateman of the Arrested Development fame), his sisters, his cold feet-ed on the wedding day brother-in-law does beyond ample justice to his/her role. Every character that Bingham and Keener are brought in to fire is amazingly directed and brings out the hurt, scare, numbness and confusion of a just fired employee to realistic perfection. Stereotypically, the Indian nerd firing scene is my personal favorite!Don't confuse this for a feel good movie or an easy breezy air- travel satire. The emotional landscape of each character is wonderfully layered. The story flows with ease, slides and glides with an array of complex feelings, it provides some easy laughs, some subtle smiles and ends the way that most life stories do. No candy floss romance, no everything fixed hunky dory life. In a very subtle way, the movie does send across a message. Life is not worth living as a cynic. When one door shuts.....a floodgate of new possibilities can open, as long as you don't close your mind to it.I can not praise this wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted movie enough. I loved the aerial views of different US cities, the well selected soundtrack. I can also easily see this gem of a movie win Academy nominations for the best actor, direction, cinematography and soundtrack (if only my opinion counted...)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Art of Firing,"Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) had an interesting job. He worked for a company that sent people out to fire people when the boss didn't have the guts to do so himself. His job keeps him on the road. It sorta reminds me of ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"" starring Jeremy Pivens. In that movie he was a contract car salesman for struggling dealerships who was always on the road.When Ryan (Clooney) wasn't firing people he was a guest speaker. His topic of specialty was convincing people that they didn't have to be committed to anything or anyone. Things and people, he reasoned, were just excess baggage. Of course, you can see where the movie is going with such a cynical message. People need people.There was an underlying message to the movie as well about technology and how it's coming for all of us. Ryan found out that his company, Goalquest, was doing away with in-person firings. They hired a new sharp woman named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who was streamlining the business so that all firings would be done via Zoom (O. K. it wasn't Zoom back then, it was probably Skype, but you get the idea). Some of you may recall that such a thing happened recently when the Better dot com CEO laid off more than 900 employees on a Zoom call. Life imitates art.This new method of doing business was really going to cramp Ryan's style. He loved being on the road and he hated being home. With this new procedure Ryan would be anchored at home in a small apartment surrounded by family he'd alienated. But before the boss, Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), went full distance-firing, he would allow Natalie to shadow Ryan on his in-person terminations.""Up in the Air"" is a light movie about interpersonal relationships. On one extreme was Ryan who shunned any real closeness even when he met a wonderful woman in Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), and on the other extreme was Natalie who couldn't envision herself at any point without a significant other. ""Up in the Air"" gave the audience something to think about and it even fooled us a bit. I was going out on a limb a bit with a movie of this kind. I normally stay away from movies that lean towards touchy feely stuff, but I'm glad I watched this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another gem from the director of Juno & Thank You for Smoking...,"Here is a fine example of movie-making: no dazzling special effects, no breath-taking locales and yet... you have a contender for the Picture of the Year. Director Jason Reitman presents a well-timed study of a corporate downsizer and consummate frequent traveler, finely portrayed by George Clooney in top form.Ryan Bingham loves to fly and has a rather disagreeable job: he fires people on behalf of corporations that are downsizing. He is a decent, charming and sharp man who has embraced whole-heartedly a world of material perks. He carries with him his badges of honor: elite frequent flyer cards, exclusive frequent guest cards with hotels, special privilege cards with car rentals and so on. He has spent 322 days in the last year traveling and 43 ""miserable"" days at home in Omaha, Nebraska. His only goal in life is to be the seventh person in the world to log 10 million frequent flyer miles. While being pampered by every travel loyalty program on the road, he has nothing real to hold on to. In fact, his empty one-bedroom apartment is quite symbolic of his personal life: clean, cold and bare.We meet up with Ryan (George Clooney) when he is encountering 3 significant changes in his life. His boss (Jason Bateman) has hired a young upstart protégé Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who wants to improve efficiency via teleconferencing and threatens to permanently ground Ryan and his counterparts. Ryan has met a simpatico traveler, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who seems to offer a meaningful connection to Ryan, one that he has never experienced before. Finally, Ryan's sister is getting married and wants him to attend the wedding in northern Wisconsin with the siblings that he barely knows.At his boss's insistence, Ryan begins a road-trip with Natalie to show her why his job is a little more personal than a scripted workflow for firing employees, oops, letting them go. Along the way, Alex intersects itineraries with Ryan to spend time together. We follow Ryan as he reluctantly acknowledges the loneliness and emptiness of his life while Natalie discovers that there is a lot more to business transactions than she knows from her education. All the places in the film are familiar. Most of these are office buildings and hotels. There is no effort made to hide the hotel locations. For example, the signs for the Columbus Hampton Inn is clearly visible. These are places we have been to and we cannot help but relate to the events.Clooney is nothing short of excellent as he embodies his character and manages to be funny, confident yet vulnerable and deserving of sympathy. The two female characters are presented as a brilliant study in contrast. Vera Farmiga displays excellent chemistry with Clooney as she presents a very assertive yet smooth business woman who has learned a lot from her experiences and is comfortable with her recalibrated expectations. Anna Kendrick as Natalie is a revelation. She presents Natalie as a bright, naive young manager who has a lot to learn but has an undeniably bright future. Reitman avoids the trap of making this character a stereotype and allows her to hold her own against the other two, more formidable leads.This cannot be pegged as a comedy even though it has many funny moments. Reitman has captured the sad bitter truth about layoffs and the timing of this release could not be more appropriate. It is important to note that with a couple of exceptions of known actors, every person being fired in the film is someone recently laid off in real life. The excerpts in the film are a portion of hours of footage acquired by film-makers by getting reactions to job losses by real people. Some of these are heart-wrenching.Having attended some networking group meetings with people looking for jobs, the phrase ""up in the air"" strikes a chord. In corporate-speak, a job-seeker is referred to as ""having landed"" when they find a job. In perspective, I suppose anyone looking for a job is still up in the air. If you stay through the credits, it is revealed that the title song is written by a recent job-seeker and offered to Reitman for use in his film. Reitman has become one of my favorite directors with this follow-up to Juno and Thank You for Smoking.This is an masterful character study of a familiar corporate executive who is easy to relate to primarily because he doesn't belong to any one place. When asked, more than 30,000 feet off the ground, where he is from, Ryan's response is insightful: ""I'm from here.""

"Few movie fans will be ""up in the air"" about this one, its a truly great film","Ryan (George Clooney) is an ace at what he does. He works for a company, under boss Craig (Jason Bateman), which sends him all over the country to corporations who are downsizing. Its Ryan's job to give those being ""axed"" the bad news. As distasteful as this might seem, Ryan does it with care and consideration, giving the newly fired advice on how to overcome this temporary setback. But, what Ryan loves MOST about his job is that he gets to travel everywhere and is never in one place very long. Unmarried and disliking commitments and family ties, he is rarely at his tiny apartment in Omaha. One day, however, a sort of reckoning occurs. The new business hotshot at Ryan's firm, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has convinced Craig that video conferencing is the best way to go. No more flying here and there and wasting money. They can do their ""dirty work"" from their headquarters in Omaha. Ryan is upset, to say the least. He makes some sharp observations about why it won't work and he insists that Craig let him take the biz whiz on some trips to get a clearer picture of the operations. Craig agrees. Meanwhile, Ryan has met a fellow frequent flyer businesswoman, Alex (Vera Farmiga) in a hotel lobby and they are starting to ""arrange"" their schedules to meet time and again. Is this the beginning of something? Not likely. As Ryan and Natalie travel to Wichita, Detroit and many other places, Natalie does learn what a difficult job it is to let someone go gracefully, even in person. She also flounders when HER perfect boyfriend calls it quits. Will the video-termination idea fall apart permanently? This is a great film, tackling many difficult issues with courage. For example, what is most important in life, our work or our family connections? Don't laugh, for our jobs sustain our families, making it difficult for everyone when positions are lost. Also, should we open our hearts, only to have them broken? As the players in this drama, the cast is truly great. Clooney is terrific as the flying ""loner"", who isn't happy with the changes to his present life. At critical times, his marvelous facial expressions say it all. Farmiga, Kendrick, and Bateman also do superb work, as do the lesser cast members. Costumes, sets, and cinematography are very fine. Especially noteworthy are the aerial views of cities just as Ryan's plane is landing. But, it is the script and rock-solid direction of Jason Reitman that take top honors. Here is a story with so much substance that it belies the feeling of ""air"". Therefore, if you never want to miss the ""heavyweights"" of American film, race over to the nearest cinema and buy a ticket for this one. It is a classic stand-out in the cinematic world.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Good,"Not a huge fan of George Clooney but this was a perfect role for him, and the entire cast was very underrated and were great. I found the story to be fun, unique, and interesting with a massive surprise at the end that literally made me say ""omg""! Directing wasn't that special, but some of the score was perfect for the emotional environment. I'm not sure if I would consider this a rom-com or even a comedy but there were some funny parts, and really a little bit of everything which is ultimately why I enjoy this movie. An easy watch, nothing incredible but a solid movie that you will enjoy. 7.4 is a perfect rating.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Portrayal of current American culture?,"It was good until the wedding part. Before this I wasn't really thinking about the movie, because til that point it was straightforward entertainment, a comedy with maybe a slight romantic twist and a touch of drama.Then came this fairly drastic change of tone and my mind started wandering. I began to really think about the movie, scenario, characters and the fact that once again comes a highly praised Hollywood movie where I can't seem to connect with anyone.I started wondering if the movie itself turned sour, or is it just me who doesn't understand what's going on. Then I had a piffany with Clooney when he was giving his pep talk to a guy having doubts about his future as a married man.It struck me that the movie seems to take for granted that you are not happy with your life and that most people are craving for something that they don't have. It assumes that you need to have some kind of an adventure or danger all the time to feel alive. If you are happy or content with your life, you are probably a cheater or otherwise senseless. To me it's pretty depressing.But.. there would be nothing wrong if the movie actually made a point about any of these things. We have movies like American Beauty which really are social commentary, while on the other hand we have movies like this which are disguised as feel good entertainment. You cannot be 100 % sure if it's a big commercial for, well, a couple of hotels, airlines and car rentals, but also the American way of life.Actually this whole movie and it's success (best movie of the year nomination, really?) got me really confused. I've felt the same with a lot of Hollywood movies lately. Most of the characters actions and thoughts were well beyond me. Were they meant to be jokes, social criticism or thoughts that people can connect with, I truly don't know.The movie is not all bad, it's well made (altho some characters seem to come and go pretty arbitrarily), well performed, funny and hits a few thoughts here and there. It's propably the context as a whole that I have difficulties swallowing.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent film with very true to life characters,"Up in the Air has been one of the most acclaimed movies of the past year and I'm going to go with the critics and say that this is a terrific movie. George Clooney is outstanding as Ryan Bingham, a man whose job is to fire people. Because his job involves a lot of travel he has almost no personal attachments and that's just the way he likes it. Unfortunately for him, his world is about to be shaken up by changes in his working life as well as the arrival into his life of two very different women: a love interest named Alex (played by Vera Farminigia) as well as a younger colleague/protégé named Natalie (played by Anna Kendrick). Eventually, Ryan is forced to question his priorities and what he truly wants out of life.This is not a movie filled with heavy duty action scenes or incredibly dramatic events. Rather, it's a movie based on very realistic characters, the choices they make, how they deal with setbacks and how they decide what's important to them. The final answers for these questions aren't cut and dry, which, to me, makes it very true to life. I haven't seen all of the Best Picture nominated movies yet, but of the ones I've seen, this would get my pick.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"Brilliant film: funny, moving, engaging, clever, thought-provoking, relatable, balanced.Written and directed by Jason Reitman, who also directed ""Juno"" and wrote and directed ""Thank You For Smoking"", both excellent movies. As with those two movies he shows a deft and subtle touch to his direction.Excellent performances from George Clooney and Vera Farmiga.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Class Cynical Comedy!,"Directed by Jason Reitman (the director of Thank You for Smoking), this movie is pretty much in the same genre as Thank You for Smoking. The name of the game here is Cynicism! Over the last few years, George Clooney has done movies that have been supreme in content and entertainment, but also provoking in terms of their ideology and political stand. Be it Syriana, or Michael Clayton or even Up In The Air - he seems to be giving audiences food for thought! In all the 2 of the above-mentioned movies, there's one string that stands out - Corporate Malfeasance! While Syriana spoke about the games the corporates and lobbyists play at the power stage to control the oil economy; Michael Clayton showed the ruthless face of selfish corporates! Up In The Air takes a lighter look at yet another corporate game and it couldn't have gotten more timely... It talks about mass-layoffs during the economically-vulnerable United States.Clooney works for a third-party downsizing company, whose help is sought by spineless corporate ""giants"" for firing their employees. He, though enjoys his job as he is the one who believes that all the relationships are nothing but baggages that makes one's life heavy! He enjoys this job because it accords him the opportunity to get philosophical with the fired employees and make them see the light at the end of the tunnel. He also loves this job also because this allows him to fly relentlessly and get some ""frequent flier points"". However, he is in for a major shock when he learns that he and his fellow employees are on the verge of being ""grounded"" thanks to a new plan of ""online firing via VC"" which is being considered as a ""cost-cutting initiative"".It is at this time, that he throws up the challenge to his new ""I-wanna-revolutionize"" colleague. He throws her an open challenge by saying ""She Doesn't Understand My Business"" and takes it upon himself to show her around and train her and make her aware of the complexities that lay in firing people.A rather simple story, would you think! Not really! There are a couple of characters who shape Clooney's professional and personal characters arcs and beliefs... Vera Farmiga (The Departed) plays a gorgeous middle-aged woman to perfection. She plays the character who seeks a casual ""relationship"" with Clooney to find an escape from her boring life. Though what begins as an emotionally-detached relationship, slowly warms its way into the heart of George Clooney and leaves him at a stage where he just can't deliver ""relationships are an unnecessary baggage"" speech.The other character is played by the young-cocky Anna who is Clooney's trainee. She provides a more complex and a more humane side to the entire proceedings. She is the perfect foil for Clooney's Ryan Bingham! Where he is steely and cold and methodical; she is restless, all-over-the-place and towards the end also moved by the results of her job! The movie, though stays funny throughout its stay, also plays beautifully with the fear of being fired from the job! The fear is a constant factor that is understated.Another poetic aspect is the ""Loyalty"" factor. Where we see employees being fired for nothing in spite of staying loyal the company for years; George Clooney gets 10,00,000 free air miles as a reward for being a loyal flier.Performances are outstanding and beautifully understated by all the players. George Clooney defines elegance and methodical perfection! He drops cynicism in every frame that he visits! Vera Farmiga is sexy and independent! Watch her striking a conversation with Clooney after their first sexual encounter - you'll know what I mean! Anna conveys her entire character trajectory in the scene at the airport where she pulls a heavy baggage for the travel! Fabulous is the word! The dialogues - true to what you expect from a Clooney movie. Top class and some of the finest one-liners! The dialogues are a jab at the capitalist structure of the U.S. Witness this line...""These are worst times for America! This is our moment"" Camera-work is constantly hand held and providing the movie with a certain unpredictability! Editing is fabulous... Jump cuts are methodical and at the same time a little unsettling! All in all - A Great Movie! My pick for the Oscars!",,Anonymous,Romance

"How do you sleep at night, man?","George Clooney was made for movies like this, or it that the other way around? Either way, he is perfect for the role, and deadpans his way through the film with incredible lines.He is very capably assisted in this effort by Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.There are even some of my favorite actors in here: J.K. Simmons and Sam Elliott.It was a great story with a really depressing ending. His great goal was finally reached, but at what cost? He just didn't have anything connecting him to other people. No wonder he can do his job so well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the decade's best movies.,"George Clooney unlocks himself here as a versatile actor, not afraid of showing his age, and becoming afraid of it. Here we see him as a man who lives life to the fullest, all alone and isolated from his close ones and society, in order to get a seemingly meaningless goal as he drifts along life. His job is to fire people throughout the country and it's VERY personal. On the other hand, we see the people that he fires, full of anger and sorrow. What will they tell their family? How are they gonna survive for tomorrow?Rather than forcing us to accept the truth, ""Up In The Air"" shows us both sides without choosing any and allows us to make our own choice. Director Jason Reitman directs this film with a subtle edge that gives the film a sort of steady pace, not frenetic but not too slow either. Add to that a sexually charged performance by Vera Farmiga and a very lively/cute and sensitive performance by Anna Kendrick (hope she gets a better agent after this, she's WAY more talented to be starring in tween-crap like ""Twilight""). Add to that some memorable appearances by Jason Bateman, Zach Galifianakis and J. K. Simmons, you've got yourself a near-flawless dramedy.What makes ""Up In The Air"" works is how relevant it is to society today. It's hard economic times like these that we understand the characters on the movie, we feel for them, but as the movie points out, life goes on. And the ones who are suffering will be comforted by their families back home. That one point really brought home the movie for me.Overall rating: 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great current themed drama,"Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is employed to fire people from other companies and he travels to different places in America and when a promising but naïve business woman joins the firm his outlook on life starts to change.Despite the relevance to modern day global financial issues this Oscar promising picture is based on Walter Kin's novel, now almost 8 years old that from this adapted screenplay makes a striking resemblance to our modern day situation.Director and part screenplay writer Jason Reitman, better known for his work for Juno and Thank you for smoking, again delivers an articulate view on worldwide issues only this time hitting the nail perfectly on the head.This story uses an ideology of a young arrogant woman coming in and implanting a business idea to which would save their business a heap of credit, it does not save the worker's jobs, and there in lies the core of this wonderful story.The idea for Anna Kendrick's Oscar potential character is to initialise and test a system which would allow Clooney and company to fire employees from their own office, via webcam. This impersonal concept from an apparent emotionless protagonist engages us into the harsh nature of today's reality when all we believe is that we are being made redundant with no valid explanation.The film starts with such instance. Encoded are a collection of actors telling stories of real life redundancies, all of which are lavishing their frustration upon George Clooney's character.Clooney himself is a fine example of a middle aged businessman. It is quite a performance to note no physical emotions but deep down we can tell he really does care about life. The whole backpack talks is a perfect example of his character's perception of the real world, which gets a gradual building during the two hours. Oscar potential? Very high but it is Anna Kendrick who deserves the full praise for her cold hearted performance that, after a break up, sees her dive into a warmer more upsetting state of mind.Reitman has certainly developed since Juno. The usage of plane shots are very good, encoded with some delicious music. This land is your land song is a warm setup. The quick fire airport montages are well used, especially when Clooney adds some stereotyping. Whilst there is a slight formula to the last third this is certainly a well handed picture.This is a wonderful test of the drama genre, adding flickers of comedy and more so romance. When you think you have the setup acknowledged it changes course and dives into a more appreciative recollection of real life. The whole fling business is a perfect example of how to tackle various genres.Up in the air is a joyous creation of a drama that adds deft touches of comedy, juxtaposes a promising actress with an established a lister and with Reitman defying his critics this is worth a viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most relevant movie of the year,"For such a new director, Jason Reitman certainly had the string of hits. Starting with corporate-sleazeball-with-a-heart gem Thank You for Smoking, and continuing with Oscar-nominated hipster fuel Juno, his third film, Up in the Air certainly had a lot to live up to. While skewing more towards his first film than his more popular second, Up in the Air is still a moving, funny and, most impressively, relevant drama.The film focuses on Ryan Bingam, a man whose job it is to fly around the country firing people. Ostensibly, he helps them find new jobs (relocation services), but for the most part, its to help supervisors too cowardly to fire their own employees. Due to his job, he lives in airports, spending at least 300 days of the year in the air. He's saving up for record-high air miles, he has gold cards to all major hotels and car rental services. He gives motivational talks on how baggage such as family, friends and any commitments in general.Of course, whenever we are introduced to a character like this, we immediately know that something or someone will change him over the course of the film. In this case, there are two. The first is Alex, a woman Ryan meets in a hotel bar and proceeds to wildly forrnicate with. Like him, she spends much of her time in the air. She has gold cards, texts dirty and refers to herself as Ryan, ""but with a vagina"".The second is Natalie Keener, a new and fresh employee at Ryan's company. She has the bright idea of cutting air travel costs by doing all firings over webcam, which Ryan opposes due both to concerns of the quality of job decreasing plus (mainly) how it would ruin his lifestyle. To show her the ropes, Natalie is forced to shadow Ryan on his trips in order to learn the ropes, during which time she learns the harsh reality and Ryan learns the follies of his ways.It sounds cliché, I know, but honestly it goes in some unexpected directions. I highly doubt anyone would have expected the ending to be the way it is based solely on trailers. It does stretch a bit at the end, and perhaps is a bit too vague in the ending, but it usually has a good pace to it and is overall quite clever, and often funny.The movie also happens to be incredibly relevant given the current economy, as a major focus is the moral decay inherent in making a living taking away the jobs of others. The fired employees are all played realistically (even Zach Galifinakis) and never too over the top. JK Simmons in a cameo is particularly effective. The little documentary-style compilation at the end is a bit much, but this may be the movie to sum up the year 2009 perfectly.The cast is by all means excellent. Clooney plays Ryan as very confident and self-centered, yet rarely does he come across as selfish. Its the kind of role Clooney specialises in, and he's damn good at it. Farmiga basically plays a female Clooney, and manages to keep up with him somehow. Jason Bateman is unfortunately underused as Ryan's lazy boss. The true standout is Anna Kendrick as the naive Natalie who, despite an annoying crying scene, steals the show.Up in the Air is by all means an excellent film and one of the most relevant of the year. In ten years, if someone asks me for one movie to sum up 2009, this will be that film. Maybe not the hipster breed some Juno fans might expect, but for a trip into the lives of the busy, look no further.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Up in the Air""","The problem with films hyped as award vehicles is that you watch them differently. I didn't have the opportunity to see Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" on the festival circuit, so my interpretation comes pre-masticated by critics who heralded it as the film to beat come Oscar season. Those accounts peeled back the layers of genuine surprise I might have felt in the theater, warping the profound into the expected, and left me with the pit. Forgive me if I'm playing catch-up.It's not that Reitman's third film, following ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno,"" is outright disappointing. On the contrary, ""Up in the Air"" has vivid characters, fine performances, and a timely, good-humored recession-oriented story. In short, I agree with most of the praise the film has garnered, so why do I have this inclination to shrug it off as merely 'good?' I think because it simply failed to surprise me. So in the interest of salvaging the opinions of future viewers, I intend to part with as few hard details as can be spared in the following paragraphs. I hope for this analysis to be the perfect mediation between your expectations and what is often a frank and charming, if formulaic, comedy.The pieces are all in place. You know what to expect from a George Clooney performance, and with ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" still playing theatrically, you needn't look far if not. He plays Ryan Bingham, a jet-setting corporate lay-off guru whose cherished lifestyle is threatened when an overeager young businesswoman (Anna Kendrick) devises a revolutionary video-conferencing system that will allow Bingham to work from the last place he would ever want to--home. The screenplay presents a straightforward, nearly transparent story, which is fortunately vitalized by the likes of Clooney and his love interest (Vera Farmiga), under the amiable sway of Reitman's direction. The narrative rigidity jiggers with the pacing later on the film, however, with false endings and climaxes that betray the structure of the rest of it. But unlike the Coens' ""A Serious Man,"" which easily shoulders a jackknife narrative that keeps its audience entertained and guessing, ""Up in the Air"" doesn't feel like a deliberate build, it feels, maybe appropriately, lost.Regardless, to harp only on its structural shortcomings is to ignore the film's most important aspect: its timeliness. As a cinematic snapshot of 2009, nothing else really comes close, and that's a big reason why it's a front-runner on so many best-of lists, my own (probably) included. What does it mean to lose your job? What does it mean when the guy who told you that you lost your job might lose his job? These are the themes scratching below the surface of ""Up in the Air,"" but which unfortunately never penetrate in any immediately meaningful way. Rather, they render the film a shorthand for our recession, our attitudes, and our relationships now.Ironically, it gets to a point where I have to agree that this is the film to beat come Oscar season. I'd like to say that slathering it with superlatives on the merits of cultural relevance alone would be like giving ""Crash"" an Oscar just for addressing racism. But oh, wait.It isn't just social context that makes ""Up in the Air"" look like a best picture to-be. Like 2007's ""No Country for Old Men,"" or 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" Oscar will love Jason Reitman's latest because it's a safe, inoffensive choice. I'm gonna go ahead and call it. It's not as violent as ""Inglourious Basterds"" or as contentedly anti-commercial as ""A Serious Man,"" and though I would not be so pretentious as to suggest any of the above winners are unworthy of consideration in a discussion of great film (except ""Crash""), the important, polarizing masterpieces that challenge convention are rarely, if ever, afforded cinema's highest honor. It's the broad strokes of vague emotion and unanimous praise, however reserved, that means pay dirt.""Up in the Air"" is a perfectly fine film, well above average, smartly cast, and consistently enjoyable. It never sticks more than a trembling finger outside of the box, but does well with an established formula in painting a postcard of America at its least assured.I wouldn't call it a great film, but it's a significant one, and one I fully expect to hear read aloud this coming March 7th. But then again, it has one last chance to surprise me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Good Dramedy,"George Clooney is a man who likes to star in light-hearted films, such as From Dusk till Dawn, the Ocean Series, Burn After Reading and The Men Who Stare at Goats. With his latest film Up in the Air he has possibly made his best comic film and Jason Reitman is showing himself to be a director who outshine his father's success.Up in the Air tells the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man whom job is sack large numbers of people for companies who are too scared to do it. He enjoys his job, allowing him to flight all over America. He is such a regular user of American Airways and Hilton Hotels that he has rewards schemes that most people can't access. He aims to be the seventh ever person to gain 10 Million Airmiles. He also acts as a motivational speaker, and believes that most people don't need many belongings. On his travels he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga), a follow traveller and the two form a friendship and causal relationship. But Ryan's livelihood as he knows it is under threat when a recent graduate of Cornell University Natalie (Anna Kendrick). Natalie notes the high cost of sending people across the country to sack people, and suggests using video conferencing technology and do the firing from the head office. Ryan obviously doesn't want to loose the jet-setting live style, but he also believes that his job needs a personal touch, and needed people with tough characters and experience. Their boss (Jason Bateman) pair the two off. Both try and show that their way is better and Natalie soon see that Ryan's live is really quite lonely, but he is happy with it.The film has a simple theme, that a jet-setting lifestyle can be very lonely. Ryan doesn't have an real friends, he is distance from his family and his home in Omaha is somewhere he hates. All he lives for is travelling and his job. He doesn't even see the sights. He only has causal relationships, but Alex could be his way out. The other is the film has a lot to say about the recession, with a lot of people loosing their jobs across America, and company either going out of business and downsizing. Cities live Detriot are really suffering because of the downturn in the manufacturing. As well, many people who are sack have been are often older and finding a new career path will be difficult.What makes this film what is that it has a very witty script, with good natural lines and jokes, making this a more low key comedy. This is the type of comedy films Hollywood should be making more of. It appeals to a clever audience, who listen to the film and not watching for something visual. Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner write a fine script and I am sure their was some ad-libbing that helped. There is also real heart and emotion, allowing the characters to grow and see into each other's worlds. Ryan does grow into a more likable character. Reitman offer a very even handed approach of directing, mixing the humour and serious effectively. He has some stylist moments, but those are few and fair between. Despite the airborne nature of the film, Reitman direction is grounded.The cast is great in this film. Clooney offers one of his best comedic performances, and brings real depth to his character. He has wonderful comedic timing and is also able to show the serious nature of his character. The talented Vera Farmiga was also very good, bringing in a down-to-earth humour to her character. Anna Kendrick, best known for her role in the Twilight films, shows that she is a woman to lookout for in the future: she too shows herself an fine comedic performer. There is also an excellent support cast, such as comedic veterans like Jason Bateman and Melanie Lynskey, even some big actors who have cameos.An excellent, witty little film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Corporate World,"George Clooney gives a great performance (right up there with ""Good Night and Good Luck"") as a driven Type A personality corporate type with no personal life. He plays the part of an outsourced downsizer, Ryan Bingham, who is contracted to fire people across the country, 24/7. A timely movie in these economic times.Ryan can't abide the few days a year he spends at home and only feels threatened when a new hot shot employee in his company threatens to knock him from his pedestal of constant travel by creating a technique of firing people on the internet.George has one goal in an otherwise meaningless existence: he wants to achieve a stratospheric level of total airmiles which few others have reached.Natalie, the go-getter new employee played by Anna Kendrick, and Ryan don't go the Hollywood route in their relationship, which is refreshing. Instead they get to lean emotionally on each other outside of the job. A friendship rather than a romance, which I found appealing. And real.Ryan plays a detached Casanova, with random meetings in hotel rooms that are quickly forgotten. His life is thrown out of kilter by the announcement of his baby sister's wedding and a series of silly photos she wishes him to take.Vera Farmiga plays Alex with sublety and confidence, in a great line she says of herself:""just think of me as you with a vagina"". And she is bang on.Nuance and emotion exist side by side in the movie with comedy and heartbreak. I've often thought that George channels Clark Gable, both physically and the wonderful facets of comedy he is able to portray. the roles he chooses are a challenge as George doesn't often get the girl. His roles are more complex than that as he plumbs ever deeper into roles that on the surface can appear light.This is a movie I would like to see again as there are many threads and many little stories along the way leading to George's denouement which I won't spoil here. Suffice to say is that the normal 2X4s are missing. The whole drama is understated rather than overstated and ultimately very satisfying.The real life people faced with job loss portrayed in the film are heartbreaking. Some wrote their own scripts or reiterated their own exit dramas from real life jobs.Watch till the last credit rolls as the movie doesn't 'end' when it 'ends'.8 out of 10 from me and yes, I would see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The complexity of life,"Career vs. Family, or Freedom vs. Bonding. These dichotomies has been very popular so long as a theme of films, novels and so on.Why are they so popular? A cynicism about successful people, or a consolation for them (because sacrifice sometimes looks beautiful)?Unfortunately (or fortunately) I've been off the track of climbing a successful career ladder, my point of view has a bit distance from the characters in the film. I feel I want to be a Ryan unconsciously, but I cannot. Therefore, I can easily understand this film as a kind of cynicism.What I felt mainly, however, is the complexity of human life, and humans themselves. Any lifestyle can be justified by some logic, but there is always lack of something, any choice is trade-off. The dichotomies mentioned above might be a good way to show the complexity and suggest the possibility of embracing both of them, that might be why they are very popular theme in the modern society.http://creativatorblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/up-in-air.html",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
""" ""He  knows the secret of life,  is being alone, but never being lonely ""","In America, with corporations losing their ability to believe in tomorrow, they have discovered, that it is much easier to discharge employees, then to keep them. In this movie called "" Up in the Air "" we have Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) a corporate executive who's job it is to fire people whom their employer has decided they don't need. Ryan has become so skilled, he has lost most of his ability to sympathize with the people he puts on the unemployment line. His position is nearly tenured, until he meets up with Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who convinces the top executive, that she has discovered a more efficient and impersonal way of doing it. However, she lacks the necessary ambivalent, detachment and is therefore in need of further training which thereafter become Ryan's role.

"Excellently bright and effervescent, excellently executed","As far as movies go, I find that few would find something so light yet so effortlessly engaging as Jason Reitmans Up In The Air. Up in the air is light and bubbly, filled with endearing, likeable characters acted wonderfully by a superb cast. George Clooney plays the suave, handsome, and charming Ryan Bingham, a man who has a philosophy of eschewing responsibility and enjoying life and travel. Vera Farminga is also good as his partner in crime, though she is a woman more complicated than Ryan would see. Then there is Anna Kendrick who is excellent as Natalie- she provides a good foil to Bingham, with the sort of puppy dog energy that the older Bingham lacks. Indeed Part of why this movie is good is because it features well written characters that are unique and with distinct personalities and depth, all acted brilliantly by the cast. Part of why the movie succeeds is also because of its excellent screenplay. The dialogue is peppered with enjoyable witticisms and the screenplay is also lean and pared down such that there is no excess fat- the movie retains its taut pace throughout. The film is also rich with thematic detail. It does not follow the traditional formula for the romantic comedy, and as it result it feels fresh and exciting. Instead the film explores the idea of being a ""free spirit"", whether there is value in avoiding commitment and being capricious. Bingham entire life philosophy is based in exactly that, and he appears to find a woman who shared these ideas. Just as he might maybe settle down and marry this woman, he finds out she is married- an ironic twist of fate. The film also makes prescient insights into the art of conveying bad news. It recognises that despite how far technology may bring us, it is never ever a good idea to convey bad news through a computer. These clever insights and smart writing helps elevate Up In The Air immensely. Honestly I do not have anything bad to say about this film, and I definitely recommend it. But i struggle to rate it more highly because perhaps there is a lack of memorable moments in this film. The film is all very slyly funny, low key in a clever sort of way. But it also means this film is not particularly memorable. I really cannot pinpoint why but it is maybe just too unobtrusive, too easy to like, but not love. Maybe I am too difficult to impress. In which case I should imagine that for those who enjoy effervescent, witty comedies, Up In The Air is a delightfully airy watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Clooney,"Saw it last night by chance.
I truly enjoyed Clooney and Kendrick's performance. It's a nice, warm, witty story about lifestyle choices.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Much more than the ""film of the moment"".","I really eat up focused character dramas and this is an excellent one that stands strong through multiple viewings. Ryan Bingham is flat out a great character and George Clooney gives a superb, understated performance. He gets a lot of flak for ""playing himself"", but I feel like that couldn't be less true. He takes all of his characters and makes them his own, yes, but I don't think he's repeated himself, which shows his power as an actor. Here he takes this guy who, on paper, is a smug prick and makes him someone that you can relate to and genuinely feel for. That in itself is a remarkable achievement. The character himself is a unique one, a guy who has built his entire life around not having any attachments and then has to watch everything he believes in fall apart.A lot of films find it necessary to have huge moments of evolution for characters, but I admire the ability here to have him gradually change without even realizing it. I love movies that have you look back at the end and realize that the character you started off with has drastically evolved and you don't even realize it. I always find it hard to believe when someone makes this huge transition, but here there's this much more natural flow that stays entirely true to the character while still giving him a lot of growth. I feel like so many movies, especially ones that are pretty strict character dramas without a lot of action like this, always end up having to do things with their characters that ring so false just to make things interesting. But this one is so intelligently written and stays so true to it's characters all the way, it's really admirable.Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga both more than deserved their Oscar nominations as the women who come along and change Ryan's perspective on things. Farmiga is fun, interesting and gets you to understand why Ryan wants her to be the one girl he has stick around for a change. It's a hard role to play; she has to leave an impression without making the story be all about this character's relationship with Ryan, but she balances out all aspects of her character quite well. Kendrick is the complete opposite, this precocious young girl who dominates the screen whenever she's on it. She's strong and independent and almost steals the show. I love her character; this girl who was raised in a world where you're taught to shut yourself off from everyone else and is then thrust into being an adult and has to come out the other side with herself in tact. The scene with her first solo firing is devastating and she plays it so subtly; it's very admirable.The film got a lot of praise for being ""of the moment"" and while this rings true, I think it's a lot more than that. It did a tremendous job of putting a human face on the economic crisis our country is facing, without having the film be all about this message. It creates a genuine character drama and then builds this commentary on our current time around it. The film is very of the moment, but it can also stand on it's own ten or twenty years from now as a strong character drama.There are definitely some things that I don't care for in the film, though. I have mixed feelings on everything with the wedding in the final act; it does have some nice emotional moments and it brings necessary development for Ryan, but I feel like it doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the film and it's a little too conveniently timed. Aside from that, I think the whole thing is a little cookie-cutter and I wish it had gone to darker places. But these are things that have only popped up after a few viewings of the film and ultimately don't really stick in my mind for long afterwards. I think it's a great character drama with some tremendous performances and it's an important one for our time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
very witty and original,"Delicate and original movie, never run-of-the-mill and greatly acted movie. The story, populated with real workers who've really been fired, makes laugh, think and eventually leaves sadness in the viewer. George Clooney's performance is truly impressive in my opinion, Farmiga is a classy delight but on the whole the story sounds good, the overall tone of the film matching a topic (people being laid off) that is very serious. The final verdict is in my view that ""Up in the Air"" is witty, moving and pertinent. This director who gets better and better with every film but it's George Clooney getting it to ""soar"" with one of his most accomplished performances (maybe the best one by far).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Overrated Mess,"I'd really love to see a ""professional"" critic, give a good film a good review. Up In The Air is a...mess. In every definition of the word.The story is borderline pointless, the acting is terrible, and the direction is amateur.I'll stick with the acting. George Clooney literally is sleepwalking in this movie. Does he even bother to change his accent or mannerisms for a role, or does he think we'll believe anything his horrible self does? Vera Famiga is doing the only good acting in the film. But, her role is pretty worthless, and she gets forgettable in the black hole that is this movie.And finally, Anna Kendrick. She is HORRIBLE. Her performance is so BAAD, she deserves a Razzie this year. Her accent is uneven (one scene she sounds like she's from Canada), when she cries she looks ridiculous, and finally she doesn't even seem smart enough to play something like this.Just please, do yourself a favor and don't believe the hype that is this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of George Clooney's Best!,"Up in the Air is a sweet, memorable film that features charismatic performances from the leads, a clever script, and a plot that people can relate to whether positively or negatively. This film has a great mixture of comedy and romance and that adds to the pleasure of watching this movie.This film is about a guy whose job is travel around the states to fire people. Reluctantly, he must train a new, young girl to do the same thing. Despite not be very willing about it, the life of this guy is about to change.The acting is extremely good. George Clooney gives one of his best, if not his best performance ever. Vera Farmiga is very good as Clooney's lover. But, Anna Kendrick really nails down her role. She comes into her own and out of the Twilight shadow with this film.Overall, this is a great followup by Jason Reitman after 2007's Juno. He really knows how to make these kind of quirky comedies. This film definitely deserved the 6 Academy Awards it got nominated for. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Clooney Clash,"Clooney is without a doubt in my mind one of the best actors of his generation. He may be undermined for the fact he chooses (or chose) roles molded exactly for his limitations: a man of easy virtue normally, thoughtful, aware and unaware of his environment in a complex- puzzled looking face, without explosive furious needs, or crying parts, or anger blasts.Since ""Michael Clayton"" he flipped degrees with his performance. He has a very noticeable emotional undercurrent. We know that at the time he is acting he is internally lubricating every inch of his voice, his stare, and his posture. To watch him is to watch a real person, and he lets the character do ""osmosis"" through his persona. ""Up in the Air"" is basically about a man that we can relate to, given in perfect accordance to George Clooney. He is trailed by a beautiful and shivering Anna Kendrick and correct stars, obviously pushed with a masterful script that knocks well on today's crisis time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Up in the Air"" is High in Quality!","We're in a recession and many are losing their jobs everyday. It's a dark time in American history...except for companies that specialize in corporate downsizing. One of its employees is Ryan Bingham (George Clooney). He's nomadic by nature, so he doesn't mind traveling the country and firing people. In fact, he's about to become the 7th person to reach ten million frequent flyer miles and he's proud of it. Then one day, a 23-year-old college grad named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is hired to save costs by making the company more electronic. Her idea is to fire people through webcams. Bingham doesn't like that. It has to be done in person...or at least that's the excuse he's using so he can remain on the road. So, he takes the young lady under his wing and shows her how it's done. In the meantime, he meets a fellow frequent flyer named Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and the webcam idea doesn't sound bad anymore.Overall, it's another well-done and quirky film from director Jason Reitman whose credits include Thank You For Smoking and Juno. However, I don't think it's the year's best as the National Board of Review claimed yesterday. The highlight is mostly the performances. Clooney is his usual charming self, but the stand-out is Kendrick. You might remember her as Jessica in the Twilight series. She's very spunky and adds a lot of humor to the film. I can see her being nominated at the Oscars for best supporting actress.",,Anonymous,Romance
Tie Me Up,"It's back. After seven long years in the wilderness I can now look back and shudder at those devil may care, bohemian Vodafone days. The tie is back! Who says? Well me initially, then the God-like George Clooney, who I thought was going to appear in a new tie for every scene of this film, (not quite), seemed right on message. But when Vera Farmiga endorsed the trend by wearing one as her entire ensemble, (double Windsor around the waist, the rest coquettishly draped over her backside), it was back where it belonged.Do I digress? This was a fabulous jolly, several in fact, with George Clooney charming the pants of everyone. Isn't it strange to see GC playing someone you actually want to be? Was there a moral? Who cares.

Off the leash,"This is one of the best things Clooney has been in. And he is really exceptional. It's not just a fluke, that all the three main actors were nominated for the Academy Award. It is funny at moments, but also very deep and dramatic most of the time. It is also a stroke of genius to let real people be ""interviewed"" during a pivotal scene and therefor make it more authentic.One of the best movies to have come out in 2009, this really is a showcase for the actors (as mentioned), with a story to back them up. And you still cannot mention Clooney enough, especially because this seems to be as close to the real man or some of his real dilemmas that he has. And he still didn't back down from that challenge. A really good movie, with a great ending then.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A comedic look at certain philosophies of life,"Up in the Air is the latest effort from Jason Reitman, it's a simple story following the seemingly empty everyday life of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), providing insight into choices of life style and the importance of human connection.Ryan Bingham with a strange job; when a business has to lose a few employees they contact the company Ryan works for, who in turn send people out to do it for them. Ryan's life is a series of flights and airports as he travels America to fire people (sorry, I mean 'let them go'). It's no surprise that such a nomadic lifestyle has led Ryan to become a man with no connections to people, where most people would aim to build a family and own a home, Ryans greatest ambition is to clock up 10 million air miles for classy airport pass and his name on the side of a plane. The first real encounter we see him have is with Alex (Vera Farmiga), but their chemistry isn't built around the usual romantic notions we see in cinema, instead it is very businesses like. Two people who have similar tastes and desires and accept their situations dictate that the relationship can never be anything more. One great scene with the two of them whipping out their laptops to arrange their next sexual encounter based around their flight schedule sums it up perfectly.Ryans life takes a turn when new employee Natalie Keener (Anna Hendrick) proposes an idea to the boss of Ryans company to change their approach. Instead of flying around America the company will do the firing via webcam and a laptop. The drastic effect this will have on the lifestyle of Ryan leaves him very opposed to the idea, with matters made more awkward when he is told to take Natalie around America to show her the ropes when it comes to delivering the news. As Ryan travels with Natalie, she challenges his philosophies and forces him to take a close look at the life he has chosen, with the prospect of being grounded and his growing affection for Alex he soon finds himself toying with the idea of changing his approach to the world.The supporting cast do their jobs well, but George Clooney takes the centre stage, he is his usual suave self here, oozing confidence and coolness. Being one of the few single men his age in Hollywood and with only one distant marriage to his name, maybe he is bringing a bit of himself to the film with his anti-commitment philosophies. He also brings a nice subtle brand of comedy, he can deliver lines with deadpan or sarcasm with such little effort that will still make you laugh out loud.The script is clever and witty but also insightful. The first half has a lighter whimsical feel to it, as we are getting to know Ryans character we are treated to some great throwaway lines and funny interactions (mostly with what appear to be semi-improvised snippets of people being fired), one of my favourite gags was the observations on different people in airport ques. As the film progresses the change in tone shifts a little. The humour is still there but the script focuses more on the seriousness of Ryans situation, to be a man without a home or a family, how can someone live without the prospect of building these things? Is it even feasible? The soundtrack provides a nice mix of folk and soft rock, which is a suitable choice for the films slow meandering pace.The subject of living a life without roots versus building a family and a home is something we have all thought about before, and after watching it I was left considering Ryans views on life, and having that lingering thought process after a film always mean you've watched something worth seeing. It's slightly let down by the pacing towards the end, but the tight script and the comedic take on philosophies on life make for a strong effort that is most definitely worth watching.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

About 35 years too late,"I just wish that I had seen this marvelous movie about 35 years before I did. I think I might have lived my life much differently had I heard the life philosophy that George Clooney's character (Ryan Bingham) espouses near the beginning of the movie. It makes perfect sense. Too late for me now, that's for sure but for all of you unattached 20-somethings out there, play close attention. The writing is excellent in this movie and all of the actors are quite good as well. I particularly enjoyed Vera Farmiga's character of Alex Goran. She moves from one world to another seamlessly and I could almost place myself in her shoes as she works her magic. George Clooney is great as usual, quite a bit lighter than he was in Michael Clayton most of the time. Anna Kendrick's character is a little too predictable but that was the way the part was written so I don't blame her. Surprise ending I doubt anyone can see coming.

"Sharp/witty, relevant, excels in all areas","Having flown >55k/yr for 4+yrs, I personally understand Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) world: Blackberry in hand, efficiently filling grey TSA bins, hotel key cards as home key, snatching a boarding pass from a kiosk while by-passing non-Elite, living a week from rolling luggage, laptop on hotel WiFi, hotel shuttle as one's commute, and satellite offices as one's ""home"" office. These images of what people hate about travel are truly fond reminders of a frequent flyer's home. His Omaha office's and corporate apartment's sparseness both prove his fear of not being on the move. The camera carefully but quickly frames each fleeting postcard from the frequent flyer's world. Their world is not just a dream but a daily reality briefly hinted to some and lived by only a few.Warning: frequent fliers expecting a rehash of their lives and loves will be disappointed. The movie must venture into emotional drama thus is not a documentary about high mileage.Stereotypes of men as emotionally unavailable simpletons fall under Ryan's admissions of growing loneliness and desire to see someone more than once: his casual hotel fling, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan's purposefully designed world of emotional isolation, as many mature male knows, is unsustainable. Attending his sister's wedding pangs his conscience. His loyal partner/fling saves Ryan from a potentially lonely event. Life is a tease: we just want to be loved and to love.New hire Natalie Keener's (Anna Kendrick) proposal of firing via videoconferencing grounds Ryan's high-flying ambitions. Her Ivy League psychology degree belies her chilly exterior, each glance able to efficiently e-fire an anonymous worker bee. Ryan's boss charges him with tour guiding Natalie through in-person firings on the road. Beyond the comedy of Natalie's new-to-flying hiccups is the familiar notion that coworkers become adopted families. Work experiences become unexpected opportunities to share personal revelations not told to even (or especially) family members. Personal, private turmoils burst into one's professional life. Work and life blur as working hours lengthen, as business travel forces ad hoc families.The movie's purposeful shift to a ponderous ending comes after a series of unexpected turns. Emotional isolation becomes impossible. A family crisis undoes his intentional emotional distance from them. Each firing brings Ryan closer to his own firing. The trainee becomes the trainer. The unfamiliar world of frequent flying becomes too familiar. The theme song ""Help Yourself"" sarcastically toasts the new economy. This movie has its pulse on our lives. Widespread acclaim of the movie is thanks to its balancing a fun lifestyle which is based on true stories which relate to our lives: emotionally isolating 1-night stands, unforgivingly impersonal corporate climate, travel as general burden, and family rifts growing and healing. The movie covers much ground without ever leaving home ... pun intended.",,Anonymous,Romance
New found respect for Clooney,"I think that this may well be Clooneys best performance to date. I didn't know a lot about the film before i went to see it, only what the adverts were giving. The story itself is very powerful and direct. It will pull audiences in and not let go. Clooney was given the perfect role and in return he delivered the perfect performance. The supporting cast all gave solid performances and their were some fantastic cameos from some very well known actors, one in particular from the man that made the Hangover so enjoyable! The story was so relevant and I think it will succeed due to its brutal honesty. Given the current global recession the writers saw an opportunity to really get inside the viewers heads.

"Very well done, engaging film","Up in the Air (2009) is a film that really does engage its audience. The acting from George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick is all great, they all deserved their academy award nominations. This film revolves around George Clooney's character and his journey through a time of change in his life. Farmiga plays a woman that Clooney sees occasionally in between flights, they usually talk some and have sex, they establish a fairly casual relationship, no real commitments. And Anna Kendrick plays a just out of college newbie that Clooney is showing the ropes to. I was very impressed with how well these talented actors commanded the screen and how they had good chemistry too. I cannot reveal very much more about the plot without giving away spoilers and I don't wanna do that.

The real tragedy?,"And yes. Up in the Air is one of the finest crafted motion picture of year 2009. If you have any interest in it, go check out Clooney, his big-time young apprentice and Vera Farmiga in this movie.No matter how much you try to take it as a comedy, it's essentially very sad in the undertone. And, after you know better and better how to write a proper satire, you'd know there's something fishy about Farmiga's character the moment you see her naked back. So, Up in the Air is not about revolutionary story structure, instead it's a good look at our daily miseries as we are more comfortable in calling them ""daily lives"".Clooney's character Ryan Bingham reminds me of his performances in Coen brothers' comedies as well as in more serious dramas like Michael Clayton. It's a magically charming character with very deep sense of exhaustion and sadness restrained, but with robotic professional attitude embedded. This mixed feeling of reality and its funny side is even deepened when his young apprentice/competitor Natalie(with a surprising performance from young actress Anna Kendrick) interacts with him. ""The man who's ready to make a connection"" the tag-line will be realized as an ultimate irony once you finished the movie. That's because everyone Clooney met and made friends with in the movie eventually would be ""send off"" by him(willingly or unwillingly). He makes emotional connections with people only because he's part of a mechanic that cuts undesirable ties when companies decided to do some laying off.If we try to double the irony and sadness in Juno and Thank You for Smoking, we would finally get something like Up in the Air. Except this one gives you more chills when you walk out of the theater. ""Do I deserve to be treated like a machine, a used one?"" You may ask. Well, that's the question I often ask myself, but if you, like me, always have treat yourself as a dedicated working machine, then the answer is undoubtedly yes. The movie showed different mindsets of people dealing with families, goals in the life, etc......One scene that caught me was when Clooney attached the ""gnome pictures"" he shot for his little sister to the USA map. That's when he realized there's something more valuable in the life he missed. While Ryan Bingham the 10-million-miles loyal flight passenger haven't got an option but had to fly on, I prayed for myself to have an option not to be like him.

Thank you for the wonderful flight,"There is always a solid difference between the terms 'cinema' and 'movie'. Let me explain it in a simple manner. A cinema is a motion picture that not just entertains the viewers but also makes them think about it especially, the story and the characters. Makes them realize that the story, if not realistic is at least understandable, clear and appreciate it whole heartedly. Whereas a movie is also a motion picture which tries to entertain the audience mostly by unrealistic portrayal and innumerable scenes involving a lot of action, sex and cheesy dialogues. It absolutely lacks in a proper storyline or a storyline which can be too complicated to be understood by the viewers. Well to make things clearer with respect to the present aspect, Up in the air, directed by Jason Reitman and starring George Clooney, comes definitely under the category, cinema. Director Reitman has provided us with yet another sensible and realistic work following his Oscar nominated Juno. Easily one of the best pictures produced in 2009, Up in the air revolves around the life and happenings of a single man named Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who works as an executive agent in a firm that is primarily called upon by other major companies to fire their employees. Ryan is one of the most experienced people in his field of work i.e. firing other people of their jobs. As the title suggests most of the story or at least the basis of the story lies up in the air or simply because Ryan travels a lot across America to tend to his clients. The last time I saw Vera Farmiga in 'the departed', she did not quite catch my attention, but in this case, where she plays the beautiful Alex Goran is definitely commendable and proves to be of worthy note. Natalie Keener depicts her character in a wonderful style as the inexperienced colleague of Ryan Bingham (Clooney). The film consists of a simple storyline which primarily concerns human emotion and relationships. It portrays beautifully the relationships between a brother and a sister, between two colleagues, between a man and a woman etc. George Clooney plays the style and suave executive and gives a memorable performance and so do Vera Farmiga and Jason Beitman. A simple story, excellent screenplay, great editing, appreciable music, wonderful acting and a seamless direction makes Up in the air always remain Up in my heart and mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A powerful and rich film. One of the best of 2009,"Up In The Air is a rich film. It is one of those rare films that manages to entertain, make you laugh, make you sad, and one that stays with you after it is over. I say it is that rare film, because although there might be a lot that try to be similar in a way, Up In The Air is the one-of-a- kind film of 2009, and probably the most satisfying experience you will have from 2009.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man that goes all around the country firing people from different countries. He meets Alex (played by Vera Farmgia) and both believe they have the same desires for their relationship, and nothing mutual. Ryan is forced to teach Natalie (played by Anna Kendrick) the ropes of the company, after she endangers his chance of achieving a certain number of flier miles. All three of these characters go through circumstances that reveal their true nature and true life. I have never been a big fan of Clooney, I have always thought he plays the same types of characters in all of his films. But in this film, I finally recognize how great of an actor he is. He achieves everything that is required from him, and his subtle expressions and thoughts are perfectly portrayed. I fully appreciate his character transformations now, and how subtle and realistic they are. Vera Farmiga is a natural actress, and she reveals her character to be mysterious and not what we expect her to be. Anna Kendrick is a charmer, and I believe that all three actors deserve to be nominated for Academy Awards. I have only seen one other Jason Reitman film, and that is Juno. While that was a good film, a very good film at times, I found Up In The Air a lot better- more charming, more real. He has incredible writing skill and his direction was very well balanced, and he never over- directs anything or allows it to feel unauthentic.At the end of the day, Up In The Air makes you think about your own life, and about everyone and everything involved with your experiences. It is one of the best films of 2009",,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best movies of the year? It's up there,"If you think ""Up in the Air"" is about laying people off, you're only half-right. It's really about learning how to connect with people and the even tougher goal of learning to care about people. It's a feel-good movie about dealing with feel-bad stuff, and not to mention a solid charmer with lots of laughs, heartbreaking poignancy, and terrific performances.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a hired gun for companies too spineless to fire their own employees. He enjoys his solitary life and considers planes and hotel rooms home, but a new business plan thought up by 20-something new-hire Natalie (Anna Kendrick) and meeting a fellow frequent flier, Alex (Vera Farmiga), both leave him putting his theories of life and love into question.Director-writer Jason Reitman offers unique ideas and funny lines about everything from the internet age, new view of feminism, the modern-day version of love, and traveling (one terrific scene has Clooney and Farmiga showing off gold-club cards). Clooney gives a smooth talking, confident, and comforting performance. He's also a romantic lead in the mold of a Cary Grant-type. If he doesn't get the Oscar, he should at least get some thank you notes from HR departments around the country. Farmiga has a very sexy chemistry with him (and not to mention a perfect ass) but sadly doesn't get much to do besides being the love interest. Still, this is many steps above ""Orphan."" And Kendrick's youthful innocence and naiveté is well played, proving to be a voice of reason and someone in-over-her-head at different points. Jason Bateman also shows up (as Clooney's boss) sporting a really horrible beard. It looks like someone smeared Nutella all over his face. Minor quibbles aside though, this is Reitman's best movie yet. It finds humor, heart, and inspiration when dealing with times of uncertainty, while always keeping it real with some nice twists. It's the best romantic comedy this year by far. So suck-it every other romantic comedy this year!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

George Clooney is outstanding!,"This is an excellent film and it is not a wonder it received so many awards.It portrays modern American life and it connection and dependency on air travel. Well, it was made in 2010, few years after the USA recovered from the 911 attacks.Plot is very interesting and crisp. Scriptwriters spend good amount time and they really are smart people doing this script. It is not found that often that script is so well done and dialogue is smart, a little bit above the average.What can you say about acting? Except George Clooney others look so bland.

A rather genteel movie,"I definitely enjoy the Jason Reitman touch, though I have to say of the three movies that he's directed and I've seen, I prefer Thank You for Smoking, which was a dark comedy. Juno was comparatively too... light. This movie is kinda fluffy too, and I think that I'm disappointed that it's not more subversive.At the onset, I thought I would love it, since it began with witty banter between two people who are essentially homeless because they are travelling constantly for work. Their flirtation composes of comparing frequent flyer and car rental clubs elite statuses. Hot. But I soon realized that the focus was on George Clooney's character soon being grounded and his life being ironically up in the air while he has to adjust to redeveloping social and familial relationships.There's also social commentary to be found as Clooney works as a professional firer, so to speak. Big companies hire him to retrench their staff when they don't want to do their own dirty work. Hence, it's pretty relevant in the current economic climate. It also adds some spice to an otherwise genteel movie.George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, as the two frequent flyers, give radiant yet understated performances. Anna Kendrick, the uptight young upstart, is fun to watch, especially when she has her little breakdown.I don't know; I liked this movie well enough but it doesn't feel like a Best Picture to me. I think it's more likely to just net Reitman a screenplay win, as with Sofia Coppola and Lost in Translation.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
George Clooney shows his talent again,"Oh my god... what this guy George Clooney is? i mean look at his performance. He can justify any role he is being offered. What a Marvelous performance. All that i can say is, the concept of the movie, Star cast, Picturisation, Timing (during Recession in US), Locations (offices mostly) are outstanding which, undoubtedly, enough to make this movie the hit one. i like the way Clooney used to work for his company. his suits, dedication to his work is nicely framed in this movie.Seemingly not playing with a full deck is Natalie, played most beautifully by Anna Kendrick, who portrays brains don't equal smart choices.Must watch movie for those people who are dealing with corporate offices. For a typical film, Up In the Air is perfectly satisfactory and an enjoyable enough distraction for anyone that gets pleasure watching Clooney do what he does best. But ignore the hype, ignore the awards, and lower your expectations. There's nothings shocking or particularly moving here, unless of course you're one of the unemployed. In that case, it's better to just go see something like ""Avatar"" and escape for a few hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Skip This; Watch ""The  Apartment"" Instead","Skip ""Up in the Air,"" and watch Billy Wilder's 1960, black-and-white, Academy-Award-winner ""The Apartment"" instead.""Up in the Air"" is an okay movie, but it never gels. George Clooney is gorgeous and suave, but you already knew that. Vera Farmiga is as sharp as a samurai sword; it breaks your heart that we don't have scriptwriters or audiences able to take full advantage of her skills. It's a bit awkward, because Farmiga's performance is more powerful and intelligent than the script itself. She's a shark in a guppy pool. I could never get past the feeling that Anna Kendrick was in the Amy Adams part that Amy Adams didn't take.Jason Reitman, the director, has made a big thing of including real people who have really lost their jobs in ""Up in the Air."" Their appearances in the film remind you why acting is a profession. Real actors probably would have conveyed desperation, rage, and despair better than these real people trying to recreate, for the camera, their own reaction to having been fired.The film is a mishmash of vignettes interspersed with awkward silences. Some are completely unbelievable. Some are clichés. The scene where the tightly-wound woman who keeps her hair pulled back finally loses it and bursts into tears is both, as is the scene where the motivational speaker has a moment of truth at the podium and Just Can't Go On Any More.There's a sequence where Ryan (Clooney) travels to an unglamorous, family wedding in suburban Wisconsin. Clooney and Farmiga dance. Mealy-mouthed, acoustic, singer-songwriter music plays on the soundtrack. This sequence is so out-of-place, and such an obvious set-up for the movie's one plot twist, that I wanted to phone Amnesty International and report myself as a torture victim. Actually, there really isn't enough of a plot to twist, and you'll see this twist coming a mile away. The ""surprise"" scene is just a cheap attempt to jolt some life into the audience and make us feel bad for ever having felt good during a Hollywood ending.Reitman struggles hard to make a funny, acerbic, astute, timely film about work, family, ambition, the economy, and America's soul. He fails. Watch ""The Apartment"" instead. Though almost fifty years old, and created when America was at the pinnacle of its power, it still says more in its every frame, its every character, about the punishments and rewards of capitalism and the merchandising of human integrity and the human heart than any film made since.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A unique film, unlike any I've seen before.","Jason Reitman is on his way to become one of the greatest film directors of our time. Of an ostensibly young age, and with only three films under his belt, he has already proved himself as a visionary young director who refreshes the film industry and gives his movies the necessary combination of electricity and art that appeals to both mainstream audiences and art lovers. ""Thank You for Smoking"", his directorial debut, was an astoundingly hilarious dark comedy with deep and poignant reflections; ""Juno"" was a miracle comedy which revolutionized the teen comedy genre and which found its way into every household viewing experience. Now his latest film, ""Up in the Air"", is yet another dose of genius, a dramedy that entertains as it ponders the precarious balance between work and family, dealing with every scene a jolting blow to our consciences and a permanent life lesson to be learned.The film introduces us to Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a highly successful man who lives for his one-of-a-kind job: firing people. He's the best at a highbrow company where experts at firing people are hired by other companies to do the dirty work for them. Ryan is forced to fire countless people he's never met before, day after day, and he's really good at remaining emotionless and calm through their reactions- ranging from openly crying, to pleading for their family's well-being, to violently throwing a fit, to threatening with suicide. And yet, after each grueling meeting, he emerges with a smile, ready to take the next plane wherever he's needed next.Ryan is a happy man, happy in his loneliness. He's comfortable up in the air, away from human connections, and thrives by earning wads of money, living in airports and keeping safely distant relationships with the few acquaintances he has. His friends are airport and store clerks who greet him happily as their patron, his girlfriends are casual women he meets at airport bars for a one-night stand, his family is the company he works for. What amazes audiences about this Ryan character is how coldly focused and intelligent he is- so much so that he acknowledges his loneliness, recognizes how isolated he's becoming, accepts the fact it may be detrimental to his well-being...and yet he relishes it. He lives for a fast-paced life traveling and earning frequent flyer miles.One day, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) comes along; a sensual, intelligent, successful woman he meets at an airport bar. Naturally, they hit it off right away, but through time and through many meetings with her, he begins to understand the sudden and unforeseen need for company. And with the arrival of Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young girl with fresh ideas and dating issues who challenges his working techniques and whom he has to show the ropes around the 'firing people' business, he begins to earn valuable life lessons and he begins to discover the deep complexities of the human condition...and how they're a deliciously bittersweet experience he can no longer live without.Naturally, the film deals with highly complex topics, and they really ARE complex. These are topics authors have devoted heavy volumes to, and they've been thoroughly explored and cross-section in endless psychology textbooks. In a two-hour film, and through a fascinatingly original illustrative story, Jason Reitman has managed to probe into the topics and wrench their guts out to be exposed to an awestruck audience. The sheer force and poignant situations in the film are sure to make the audience both gag with heartbreak and sigh after laughing. Like another critic said, 'it's a searing and delicious slice of life', and every second of the film rings with truth and comic drama that we can all identify with. Clooney is down-to-earth and believable, the two supporting actresses are a joy to watch; the extras hired to play the fired employees have actually been fired at some point in their lives, and they were asked to improvise their emotions based on past experiences...so you can imagine the raw emotional power of their short performances.It's an effective story driven by its pitch-perfect screenplay and its flawless performances. Notice how the drama and emotion happen by themselves, as naturally and as realistically as a film can convey. Rolfe Kent's score is quiet and creeps under the action to the point where you KNOW the music has become part of the feeling and not an enhancer; Eric Steelberg's cinematography deals no fantastic camera shots or dramatic camera effects, but includes every detail of the scene and makes us feel like actual witnesses of the action; it's us in that room, and Ryan is firing us. Basically, we're forced to take in the film as a whole and every technical aspect contributes to this wonderfully-crafted story.As with his previous films, Reitman pays close attention to every word of the dialogue. It's fast-paced, witty, but every syllable down to every pause is important and is rendered to perfection. This is surely the best screenplay I've seen all year (adapted from the novel by Walter Kirn). It's a film to meditate with, to reflect upon...but above all, to bask in and to marvel at. And it's a hell of a good time too! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Clooney doing what he does best,"I don't think there is anybody around in 2010 that makes acting look as easy as George Clooney. He oozes charm and it seems any role he takes , he makes it his own. And there lies my problem. Despite the fact that films like Up in the Air , Burn after reading and Michael Clayton are all very good films in their own right , Clooney seems to be the same guy in all of them. There seems to be attempt to change the character in any way , and although some people like Clooney to be the way he is , i for one would love to see him trying something a little different.Ryan has long been contented with his unencumbered lifestyle lived out across America in airports, hotels and rental cars. He can carry all he needs in one wheel-away case; he's a pampered, elite member of every travel loyalty program in existence; and he's close to attaining his lifetime goal of 10 million frequent flier miles-- and yet...Ryan has nothing real to hold onto. When he falls for a simpatico fellow traveler , Ryan's boss , inspired by a young, upstart efficiency expert , threatens to permanently call him in from the road. Faced with the prospect, at once terrifying and exhilarating, of being grounded, Ryan begins to contemplate what it might actually mean to have a home.Up in The Air is an enjoyable movie . I love the way that Ryan's goal in life was to get as many air miles while he dodged any form of commitment and stable lifestyle . I'm friends with a couple of people who are commitmentphobes so it made me laugh to see someone in a movie with the same problem. I enjoyed the performances of the two leading ladies Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick and there is one scene in particular involving Vera Farmiga that will stick in the mind for a while ( Guys , it's 15 minutes into the film!) Over the last couple of months this movie has been banded around as potentially Oscar winning material and although it's a perfectly good film, in my opinion , it's no ""Best Movie"" winner .",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A blast of welcome cold air,"This is a chilly comedy, and that's not just because the location filming was conducted mostly in the American mid-west in February 2009. Being sacked is seldom funny and Jason Reitman's use of real victims of the layoff process (along with some adroit actors) reveals some of the real pain of ""outplacement"". George Clooney's character Ryan Bingham is a master of the process. His company is hired by others all over the US ""too cowardly to do their own sacking"" though given the ultra-litigious American scene there is a lot to be said for employing an expert to do the dirty work. Ryan's task as he sees it is to shepherd the victims on to the next phase of their lives (and cut down the litigation). It helps that he is a man without family commitments of his own who lives out of his suitcase ""up in the air"" in the world of airports, hotels and rental cars, his only serious life goal being the attainment of ten million passenger miles with one of the better bits of product placement seen recently, the trusty American Airlines (did anyone notice the billboard at one airport with a photo of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, hero of the Hudson River ditching on it?) The tension here is provided by Ryan being forced to show the ropes to Natalie (Anna Kendrick) an eager young beaver straight out of business school who has given Ryan's smarmy boss Craig (Jason Bateman) the idea of replacing road warriors with the internet. The romantic sparks are not provided by her, but by Alex (Vera Farmiga), an older woman Ryan meets in his travels, a road warrior like him, who seemingly has no attachments either. Their affair blossoms, but, sorry folks, this isn't that sort of comedy.Rather, this is about as an intelligent piece of film-making Hollywood is capable of producing. Reitman's earlier movies, ""Thank You For Not Smoking"" and ""Juno"" were equally intelligent but here he has been able to create some depth of feeling, aided enormously by George Clooney's charm. He is exactly right for the part, and meshes perfectly with the beautiful Vera Famiga. I am at the stage of life where I find the likes of Natalie (a rollerblader, capable of going very fast in one direction) just plain annoying but I must admit Anna Kendrick does a good job to the extent that I almost feel sorry for her.Reitman was lucky with his timing here – as he filmed the US went into a financial crisis and slipped into recession. Millions have lost their jobs. As it happened, I watched the movie with my boss sitting just behind me. It was salutary to observe he was laughing at several points where I was not, but then again, I laughed at several points when there was silence from behind. Remember salary-men, their interests are not always yours.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Lukewarm, Lacking In Substance","The title of my review says it all. This movie is, on the whole, bland, uninteresting, and unexciting.Let me sum up the plot, bland and uninteresting as it is. George Clooney plays a professional axe-man, someone who works for what used to be known as an outplacement firm and makes his living by firing people as well as giving motivational speeches on the side. He does a couple of things to make himself look good and then continues as if nothing happened. The end. I just saved you the time and trouble of having to see it.And that's one of the things that's wrong with the movie. His character doesn't change.He's proud of what he does to the point of smugness, but he's an empty shell. His only real joy in life is being able to accumulate traveller points so that he can get priority service in fancy hotels as well as being a member of the elite club of credit card holders. But he has no soul, emotion, or, it would seem, conscience. He cold-bloodedly tells people that they're sacked and then makes some insultingly cloying statements about them having a bright shiny future because they were canned. The fact that he's helped destroy their lives has absolutely no effect on him.But the other main characters are equally as unlikable.He meets someone else who's also away from home a lot on business eventually becoming attracted to her. But she turns out to be not what he thinks she is.His junior colleague is an immature, inexperienced millennial snowflake. She doesn't appreciate that what she does affects people, though she finally gets a hint. The audience is told that second-hand; the movie would have been better if it showed her reaction.His boss isn't any different, having the personality of a frozen kipper.It's a mystery to me how this movie managed to earn several Oscar nominations. There's nothing of substance in it. The actors seem to be bored with their roles and their performances appear to have been mailed in. Many of the scenes are redundant and could easily have been cut because they don't show anything new. In addition, the musical soundtrack is annoying.This movie is a complete waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Breath of fresh Air,"In A Nutshell....Ryan Bingham (Clooney), frequent flyer and corporate downsizer, has his life just how he likes it: no emotional ties, plenty of in-flight perks. That is, until he falls for the enigmatic Alex (Farmiga), and is saddled with work-partner Natalie (Kendrick)Review:Jason Reitman has done it again, first with the perky teen comedy with heart (Juno) now the likely Oscar Front Runner (Up In The Air). He is quickly establishing himself as a major player in Hollywood. Reitman, who recently won a Golden Globe for His Up In The Air Screenplay, is receiving awards left, right and centre, but what is all the fuss about ? And what makes the film Stand out above the rest.Let me introduce Ryan Bingham (Clooney) a workaholic, corporate downsizer who enjoys the luxury of flying, and the perks along the way. To him an airport lounge is home, being comforted with the delights of a high ranking member's status, and the familiar joys that entail. Obsessively collecting the flyer miles as he travels from airport to airport (10 million is the goal). Bingham is content with his life out of a suitcase, little to his knowledge that everything is about to change. Clooney Shines as Bingham, Bringing soul and personality to the movie, he is the anchor and drives the film forward, in turn brings an emotional and Oscar worthy performance.There are two female supporters in the film, the enigmatic Alex (Farmiga) and love interest of Ryan's. She describes herself as ""just think of me as you with a vagina"" constantly working, flying from place to place, looking for a bit of harmless fun(but nothing serious) along the way. The second is Natalie (Kendrick) The enthusiastic and harmless employee who threatens Bingham's way of life, trying to prove, that you can fire the poor folk over the internet, instead of face to face. Naturally Bingham refuses the idea, and stating that Natalie doesn't have the right experience, He is sent out with her to ""show her the ropes"" by the boss (Bateman).Along the way, Ryan gives Natalie mentoring on how to fire people the right way, try not get to personal and encourage them about pursuing their real dreams, with the help of a trusty Pamphlet and a pat on the back. Bingham's constantly trying to prove that firing someone over the internet will not work, and requires a more sentimental approach. Occasionally meeting Alex along the way, something starts to change, as he finally starts to realise that he is lonely.The films pace is masterful; it leads from one enjoyable scene to next, It's beautifully shot with quick editing and some quite funny narration by Clooney. It's full of enjoyable performances and it's emotional as hell. You rarely find yourself bored and it leaves you guessing until the end. The only criticism I have is that the film doesn't know what it wants to be, at times it's a romantic comedy and at others it's a serious drama full of heartbreak. It manages to win you back towards the end of the film, anyone who complains about the ending is truly misguided, it's one of the most satisfying I have seen in a long time.Final thoughts: The film is a delight, with a strong plot and colourful characters; it is defiantly an Oscar favourite and should win for screenplay and actor for Clooney, whether it will snag the big two is yet to be seen. The scene transition is fast and smooth; you will rarely find yourself bored. It's an amazing film, that has a deep message engraved into it, how you perceive that message, is up to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love, Actually""Up in the Air"" is a 2009 romance-drama tragicomedy. It is a story of a man named Ryan (George Clooney), who flies around the US in the midst of the 2007 recession. If any company wants to fire a large number of people, but the CEO doesn't have the guts to face what could be the most difficult talk in their employee's life, they hire Ryan to deliver the news. Since 2007 is the hottest year for that kind of business, Ryan spends half of his life in the air, traveling from one state to another. As a side gig, he gives speeches about how disadvantageous and silly it is to have any sort of attachments - family, kids, permanent residence etc. He himself really doesn't have any of those, he barely even answers the phone when his only relative-sister desperately tries to invite him to her wedding. ""Rage against conformity, embrace freedom"" - that sort of deal. However, as Ryan perhaps knows deep in his heart, this lifestyle of a ""pathological bachelor"" is a painfully lonely one.He invents various ""tasks"" to keep himself busy at all times, and we start to get a feeling that this isn't because he enjoys it, but rather because he can't afford to pause and think about his life for a second because it will drive him into insanity. We start to get a feeling that this ""freedom"" is a façade, and a more appropriate term would be ""abdication of responsibility"". And then, as a potential love interest appears, Ryan may have to consider rethinking his whole philosophy.The emotional connotations of this movie are hard to describe. For the most part, despite the depressive atmosphere of the historical timeframe and clips of real people getting fired (more in the comments), it is actually a light, feel-good comedy. But the tides can dramatically turn any second, jumping all the way down into depression and then rushing back up into the realm of comedy. A spicy mix, the definition of an emotional rollercoaster this film is a lot more serious than it first seems and will most certainly leave each and every viewer thinking about their own lives.

The movie is mature, not a stereotypical cliché, with well thought up situations and believable characters. No one is totally white or totally black, which is the first step in making a good movie in my book. Or a good book, that is :)In this film he is a hypersailor. I know, I made that up, but it's the perfect metaphor as he flies from place to place doing his job and ending up spending more time in the air than in any other place. He doesn't even own a home or even rent and his greatest pleasure is to make a presentation of how the things you own and the people you know are nothing but dead weights.Now, this could have been a total screwup, by placing some wide eyed female star to steal his heart and make him realize his mistake of not being a star-crossed lover, not wanting kids or to settle.

Vera Farmiga is sexier than hell as his lover. Their chemistry matches the kind that Clooney had with J-Lo in OUT OF TIME (?). And Anna Kendrick is as much of a discovery as Jeremy Renner was from THE HURT LOCKER. She is an electric bundle of ambition, vulnerability & cuteness. All 3 are memorable.This film takes some unexpected turns & gets very murky in an emotional sense but they all add to the depth of what goes on in it.

I loved the monologue that George Clooney performed, and that basically sums up what I liked about this movie. The script was written extremely well with many catch-phrases that I'm sure will soon be popping up in preppy classrooms everywhere, and it had an awesome cast with some no-faces. I certainly do not have to dive into the storyline much, because it is pretty straightforward, but I will say that the movie has some well played MAJOR TWISTS, and I haven't enjoyed one of those in a long time.The reason I gave this film a 10 is because I cannot find any reason not to. It has good, original writing, an underdog but fantastic cast, and I liked the use of real people who went through similar episodes. This movie is lovely, that is the best way I can describe it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is not a movie. This is a wakeup call.,"I enjoyed this film very much. But when I started to think about it, this was not just a film. It is a reflection of the society we live in today. Most people go to the movies to escape life. They would much rather see a WWII fairy tale, or blue people fight against humans for their planet. I did enjoy both of those movies, but what I felt about this one was different. I watched this overall depressing tale about a man with no life and a world where people can lose their jobs at any second and the boss doesn't even care. I walked out of the theater to the blazing cold night only to realize that I was looking at the same world. This is not a film. This is a wakeup call for the people who continue to look away and that are in denial that we are in a recession. And I must say, with stellar performances by George Clooney and Anna Kendrick, this is a darn good wakeup call.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Predictable romcom with boring one-liners,"George Cloney plays the middle-aged loner Ryan who feels most at home while traveling by flight all over the world. One day a young promising female employee, Natalie, starts working at the firm where Ryan works. The firm is specialized in helping other companies telling workers that they have been let go. The young naive Natalie presents a different approach towards the technique in firing people. Her revolutionary idea is to use the internet when letting people go. This is something Ryan is not approving. He is old school and likes to meet the people getting fired in person when giving them the sad news.Naturally the head chief of the firm introduces the idea that Natalie should accompany Ryan on one of his firing trips.While traveling Ryan learns from Natalie and other people in his surrounding that his way of life in solitude are not the way people are meant to live their lives. People are meant to live in heterosexual togetherness and share the wonders of life in partnership. Natalie learns that downsizing is not a clinical issue that can be handled over the internet. The movie is therefor lecturing moral and Christian values in absurd-um.The movie also follows a traditional romcom framework with no surprises and the depth of the movie are as deep as dried up pond.The movie's script are filled with pointless one-liners that aren't even funny.This is a traditional American Hollywood production that have been made so many times before and this is really a pointless film.

The meaning of life on the road,"George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man detached from all commitments and relationships in Jason Reitman's brilliant film Up in the Air, based on the novel of the same name by Walter Kim.Bingham is a man hired by other companies who are too afraid or lazy to fire their own employees. Bingham is trained to handle those employees who may be disgruntled, emotionally unstable, or just plain let down. In this harsh economic climate, Bingham and the company he works for is booming. Bingham spends on average about nine months of the year in the air and away from ""home"" or Omaha, Nebraska. Life is good for the man who has more frequent flyer miles than one could even think of having.Everything seems to be going great until he is called back to the office and is introduced to Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, Ivy leaguer who proposes that using video conferencing instead of face-to-face confrontation to fire people will save the company a large chunk of change. Bingham sees that his livelihood is being threatened, demands that he be left on the road. His boss, played by Jason Bateman, sees this as an opportunity to show Natalie the ways of the business and tells Ryan that he needs to have her tag along. Seeing as this is his only way of staying on the road, he reluctantly agrees.Bingham shows Natalie a fast paced world of concierge service, minibars, and how to manage people. What Bingham didn't expect was to see what his life has become and how he is going live out the rest of his days; alone. Unless he changes it.Clooney and Kendrick are fantastic together. Clooney's smooth talking and confident screen presence is balanced nicely by Kendrick's emotional and slightly neurotic tendencies. Along with these two is Vera Farmiga, whose relationship with Clooney's character blossoms out of their love for the road. They are an unconventional couple, but they would never admit that they're together.This is a truly remarkable story. This film has been described as 'the film of the moment,' and it is just that. There are many films coming out about the Iraq war and the impact it has on the soldiers as well as at home, but here we have one of the first films other than Michael Moore's documentary Capitalism: A Love Story, to show the economic downfall that this country has faced. It's a startling look at what is going on out there across the country. It's a poignant reminder that there are a lot of people out there suffering and have little to comfort them.Reitman does an excellent job not just selling the characters and their story but the time and space that this takes place in. We are shown office buildings void of workers, yet here comes Clooney and Kendrick to lay off even more from a business that has already been hit hard. Each lay off we witness is almost like a real testimonial. We see the sadness, the despair, and the anger that people exude when they realize their lives have been turned upside down by someone they don't ever know.There are a lot of powerful images in this film, especially where we can see how alone these characters really are. Each airport terminal starts to blend together to form this artificial, sterile, and uninviting environment that no person could truly ever love. As we delve into the life of Ryan Bingham, we see how truly alone he really is, and how he is a truly remarkable person to be able to deal with a life like this. His story is unlike any other.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ideal blend of sharp comedy and heartfelt drama with an enduring message,"Jason Reitman has been the creative force behind two of the warmest, funniest, modern- savvy and thought-provoking comedies in the last five years (""Thank You For Smoking"" and ""Juno""). He continues this tradition with ""Up in the Air,"" one of if not the best film of 2009, which looks at life with a view from the top, the perspective of a man who lives out of his suitcase -- and packs light. Devoid of commitment and responsibility in everything down to relationships, the story of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is cleverly smooth and will make filmgoers everywhere appreciate their own baggage.Ryan Bingham fires people for a living. Gutless bosses outsource their layoffs to the company he works for, so he travels the country dropping traumatic news on countless people. As a frequent flyer, he has a secret goal of reaching 10 million miles on American Airlines. To him, the airport is home; he has no committed relationships or friendships and he gives lectures on how those are the things that weigh our lives down. Who better to play a free-wheeling middle-aged bachelor with a soulless job than Clooney? His suave looks and comic delivery make him an enviable and intriguing character despite that we'd never want to spend all that time in an airport let alone make people miserable every day.Bingham's life of traveling bliss gets an upgrade when he hooks up with fellow businesswoman Alex (Vera Farmiga), who shares his same passion for traveling nuance and sexually charged witticism. At the same time, a young up-and-comer in his company (Anna Kendrick) threatens his way of life when she proposes online video conference firing. In an effort to prove that would be a bad idea (and save his lifestyle), Bingham convinces his boss (Jason Bateman) to let him take her on his next set of trips so she can see what this work is really about.Loosely adapted from a novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman and Sheldon Turner whip up a script that's smart and hip yet familiar and easy to follow. It's somewhat predictable, but in a good way -- never cliché and all in the spirit of the story's message. Bingham's unique and isolated lifestyle serves as an ideal example for jump-starting a discussion of what's most important in life -- ultimately whether happiness can be achieved if life isn't shared. The other characters provide other perspectives on this same essential question and further complicate Bingham's own emotional journey as he questions his long-held beliefs.Reitman's genius as a director is in guiding us along fluidly through this contemplation. Being his third very good film, ""Up in the Air"" is now proof that no director takes his audience from comedy to heartfelt drama as seamlessly and gracefully as Reitman. The script is naturally funny, playing off our familiarity with airport travel for a variety of jokes, yet the next scene will be when Bingham's firing someone and suddenly all this tension builds and sympathy and pity pours out of the audience for these poor people losing their jobs whom Reitman handles with such sensitivity given the tough economic context this film is being released in.Other impressive elements of the film include Anna Kendrick's performance as Natalie, a recent college grad who is a hard-nosed efficient type on the outside with an emotionally sensitive interior. Her trip with Ryan reveals to her that not everything in life can be planned for nor should it be. Kendrick handles one of those potentially cliché young person roles with class. She's multi-dimensional including throwing her own bit of humor in with the many emotional highs and lows her character experiences. Farmiga also proves no marquee name was necessary. She's sweet, a bit sassy and holds her own against the magnetic Clooney.""Up in the Air"" could fall into a rut of being all about travel humor and how always being on the go affects a person -- or it could be about what it's like having to fire people day in an day out, but all these elements are instead tied beautifully together to remind us how valuable relationships can be, no matter how big or how small. Reitman and this wonderful cast not only entertain us but also deliver that message as well as it's ever been delivered.~Steven CVisit my site at moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic notwithstanding current relevance of the subject,"Make no mistake, Clooney makes this film what it is. I can think of very few with the talent and charisma to get it done in this complex role. The brilliance lies in the fact that it seems so effortless and probably overlooked because if I try to substitute any other contemporary superstar it just doesn't hold up as good! I felt that every other main cast in the movie was replaceable .Bingham's character provides the fabric to weave the intricate design and complexities of the script and story. It also feels like Reitman let the characters evolve in the script in due course providing the subtle nuances and ultimately we get a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterwork of maturity and true artistry for Reitman and Clooney,"There is so much I want to say about Up in the Air that it has taken me days to even attempt to sit and write out my thoughts on it. It is the rare movie that is every bit as good as the critics and awards groups are making it out to be, and maybe even a little better. While it is not quite the best movie of the year, it is still a movie very much of its time, and one that will not soon be forgotten.The film follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who crisscrosses across the United States firing the people major companies cannot. He leads a very secluded lifestyle, rarely spending any time at home or with his family, and finds the joys in life come from collecting plastic loyalty club cards. He even works as a motivational speaker, giving people advice on how to live their lives more like his. But he enjoys the life, and thrives in it. When young up-and-comer Natalie (Anna Kendrick) comes up with a plan for his company to save costs across the board, he is at first flabbergasted at the very thought of his lifestyle coming to an end. But then his boss sends him out to teach Natalie more about what he does, and Ryan begins to see things a little different.Jason Reitman belongs to a very exclusive group of young filmmakers who are getting better with each film they make. With Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and now Up in the Air, he has demonstrated an unparallelled consistency that is unlike almost all of his peers, including his own father Ivan (who acts as a producer here). Even though this is his third major film (and almost certainly his second Best Director Oscar nomination), he simply works like he is already a master filmmaker. The film knows what turns to take, what moves to make; everything is just so highly crafted and near perfect that you may wonder if this really is his third major film. There is so much creative output on display here that the film is simply a marvel to look at from the mindset of a filmmaker. The slapdash editing style of his previous two films is even stronger here than before as well.If Reitman is at fault anywhere, it is in the jumping tones. It works very well for this film (whereas it nearly sank the obscenely hilarious satire in Smoking), but it has not been quite honed to perfection quite yet. Earlier this year, the animated emotional roller coaster of adventure found in the ironically titled Up managed to find its footing jumping around from being devastatingly sad to hilariously funny in a moment's notice. But that film had the benefit of being much more simplistic than Up in the Air (even with its unmatched character depth and balance). The film does strike a good balance, but as Ryan grows as a character, the film's tone does not necessarily follow with it. There were more than a few scenes that should have been funny but were sad, and others that were sad but came off hilarious. It is all about balance, and not every scene feels like it is as balanced as the next. The biting satire Reitman crafted in Smoking is here, as are the hilariously poignant moments he helped extend through Diablo Cody's script for Juno, and even a bit extra that comes from the maturity Reitman has gained as a filmmaker. But if there is a small flaw in the film, this is where it lies.If Reitman has matured as a filmmaker here, than Clooney has matured even more so as a leading man. While his one-two punch of Syriana and Good Night, and Good Luck gave Clooney an excellent range as a star, it is this film that cements his status as a leading man. He commands the screen every second he shows up, and never once do we question the legitimacy of his portrayal. Reitman may have given Ryan Bingham his voice, but Clooney gives him the breath of life. This character is a flawed hack of a man, living the dream that is at once everything we could ever want and a nightmare of everything we never want to even think of. As the tone flip flops, Clooney stays on the straight and narrow, never backing away from any challenges, and never once sacrificing the quality and dimensionality of the role. In a year of surprisingly great performances, this one is a clear standout. It is not the kind of ballsy role that Syriana's Bob Barnes was, but it is a stronger performance and one that may make us forget Batman and Robin ever existed (well, at least the Batman portion of the film).While J.K. Simmons, Sam Elliot, 2009 wonderkid Zach Galifianakis and Danny McBride all deliver great, small performances, and Jason Bateman helps ground the film in his surprisingly unfunny yet tragically serious role, it is Kendrick and Vera Farmiga that light up the screen in the few sections where Clooney is not chewing the scenery and just about everything else up. While Farmiga nearly ruined The Departed, she works as the yin to Clooney's yang. She delivers a brutally honest performance here, one that perfects Clooney's portrayal far greater than it ever could be. I was impressed with her work in every instance. Kendrick acts as the relative newcomer that she is, but it works for her rough around the edges character. I hope for more creative output outside of the Twilight franchise from her.Up in the Air is a flawed film, but the flaws can easily be looked past. It is an incredible feat for everyone involved, and one that stands out as honest and heartbreaking at the same time. It is likely the one to beat come March.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Up in the Air"" is grounded in humor, intelligence and pathos","Amid the jumble of sequels, remakes and senseless blockbusters, Up in the Air, a witty, classy and lighthearted drama, feels like a breath of fresh air. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes this movie so great, but perhaps that's what's appealing about it - it simply has the right amount of everything. Without a doubt, Up in the Air is one of the year's best and most memorable films.Because Up in the Air is a character-driven film, it is important that the actors deliver and fortunately, they do. Perhaps it shouldn't be much of a surprise, since Jason Reitman, who directed and wrote the screenplay, apparently wrote all of the three major characters for their corresponding actors. As Ryan Bingham, George Clooney brings charisma, confusion and a certain amount of weariness. There is a hint of Danny Ocean-like suaveness to Ryan, as when he is giving motivational speeches or smoothly convincing a just-fired employee to look on the bright side, but he is nevertheless a person the audience can relate to; at some point, everyone feels the same sense of aimlessness that Bingham experiences, and this not only makes him sympathetic, but also heightens the film's emotional impact. Equally impressive are Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, who play Bingham's love interest Alex and colleague Natalie, respectively. Both of them manage to make what could have been two-dimensional roles into characters that feel as real as anyone in real life; you can easily imagine passing them in the airport or seeing them sitting on the other side of your office. They also have great chemistry with Clooney: Ryan and Alex's romance sizzles, and the off-kilter, occasionally tense relationship between Bingham and Natalie is completely believable.Perhaps what gives the movie its extra oomph is the phenomenal script written by Jason Reitman. The dialogue is witty yet convincing and the story's various elements are perfectly balanced. It avoids the trap that many comedies or even light-hearted dramas fall into in the third act, which is the tendency to let heavy themes or sentimentality overwhelm the movie and extinguish any previous cheer. The theme of unemployment and economic uncertainty is played with, yet the film never takes it too seriously or too lightly, and up to the end, the characters are given the front stage; after all, the movie is not about the economy, but how the characters, especially Bingham, grow and how they deal with life's obstacles.All this is enhanced by Rolfe Kent's wistful, moving score and rest of the film's sensational soundtrack, which includes the song ""Up in the Air"", written by Kevin Renick who sent his composition to Reitman after being fired from his job, making it all the more poignant.At its core, Up in the Air is about relationships: their burdens, the compromises required to maintain one and, most of all, that, without them, life would lose its purpose and meaning. It traces the way they ebb and flow and change over time, but also how they can remain constant, something to rely on in an increasingly uncertain world. As Ryan Bingham slowly discovers, no accomplishment is truly satisfying or enriching unless it is shared with another human being.The movie's atmosphere feels oddly novel, almost magical, and in many ways, it reminds me of Jerry Maguire. Though it has now become parodied multiple times, that 1996 movie still stands out as a romantic-comedy that truly warmed the heart in an era when few rom-coms manage to transcend the sappy or trite clichés of the genre. Like Jerry Maguire, Up in the Air relies on sharp writing and soulful performances in order to do what few films are able to achieve: they tell complex, engaging stories about people the audience wants to cheer for. We build a relationship with the characters and, through the highs and lows, we're with them all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Peak of Clooney's Career,"There is something about George Clooney that it's charming that even in the most boring roles he can captivate the audience like nobody else. Definitely the movie Up in The Air is not an epic saga from our times but it's a simple charming movie that can make a date something fun and enjoyable because it's a movie made for couples that so far is on the buzz for Oscar Nominations because of the incredible acting (maybe the Academy is going on roles that are more realistic and less glamorous Sandra Bullock is also on the spotlight for an Oscar Nomination for her movie The Blind Side) Many critics as it was said previously are predicting Oscar Noms for George Clooney and they are speculating that new comer Anna Kendric is slowly but steady positioning herself in the A-list of Hollywood because her roles in successful movies like Up in the Air and the Twilight franchise.In the movie George Clooney plays a transition specialist whose jobs it's to fire people for corporation executives who don't have the nerves to fire people themselves; after acting like the servant to many executives Ryan Bingham starts to feel some happiness doing that but as soon he finds that the company he works for hired a new person to play on Ryan's role without even leave her office Ryan starts to feel anguished that his days on the company are counted. Critics are calling this movie the peak of Clooney's career and maybe they are right because at his age and success it's hard to see George on other types of roles specially after many years being typecast as the Romantic Comedy Lead (I guess he suffered the Meg Ryan Syndrome) it's going to be difficult to see him on action or horror roles, but he always can go on the director seat and do something amazing because he has consolidated his name to be a money making machine worldwide. Maybe it's true that George has moved on since his Fact of Life days to become an household name.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is fantastic!  8.5/10,"This movie is really a fun time. George Clooney is great, and the young girl character from Cornell is a really big hoot. It's a good feel-good movie at times, and then other times it really makes you reexamine your life and your priorities. Above all though I just thought it was a good commentary on the modernized technological lives that most of us are all now leading. A little bit of a sex scene with Clooney if you're looking for a sexy-type film, but overall just a good comedy. I'd recommend this one for a slow night or a good time with friends. I can't give it a 10/10 for only a few reasons-mainly that I wish the movie tied up all the loose ends with some of the character's relationships (although that's not possible in real life most of the time, so I can't say why I assume it would be here), and because it felt a little long towards the end. But truly, this movie is hilarious most of the time, I'd strongly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Up in the Air"" --  a great, and sometimes brutal, film!","Director Jason Reitman's new film ""Up in the Air"" is a favorite for Oscars, and it is great film.It stars George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, who works for a business firm where he is sent around the country to fire people from their jobs. His job is his life. He spends almost all the days of the year constantly travelling by plane. He has become so comfortable with traveling that he hates to be home at his apartment. His real home is up in the air in an airplane.Bingham's job certainly is not for the faint of heart. He sits face to face with people he has never met and tells them that they no longer have a job. Bingham's job is not to provide sympathy for the person, but to provide some kind of hope so their process of leaving the company goes smoothly. Bingham is a master at his art, staying calm and smooth even when the people he is firing become hostile.However, Bingham's own job becomes at stake when a young, vibrant Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a recent Cornell graduate, starts at the firm and introduces a new technology which would enable people like Bingham to fire people over the computer, making the already brutal job more impersonal but also more cost efficient. This now threaten's Bingham's life-style of travelling the country almost every day of the year. The thought of living at home makes him sick and uneasy. But before this new system is put into place, Bingham is forced to travel with Keener across the country, showing her the ropes of how to fire people.It is a very funny, although also at times a very brutal film. Filled with cruel irony -- some funny, some sad. Reitman's film works not only as a character study, but also as a satire of America's poor economic state.But the success of the film really does rely on George Clooney's wonderful, vulnerable performance playing the lonely, empty character of Bingham. Bingham discovers how truly empty and devoid of value his life really is. His job requires him to be emotionally cold, and with his constant travel and lack of any real relationships, his life is now emotionally cold and empty as well.Along the way, Bingham also develops a relationship with a middle-aged, frequently travelling business woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga), both sharing the life of constant travel away from home. With Alex, Bingham finally starts to open up emotionally, as he seeks some kind of relationship that his life has been lacking.Ultimately, ""Up in the Air"" is about finding value and strength through the relationships we form with people. It is a brutal world out there, and we need people with us to get through it sometimes.Furthermore, I truly am a fan of Reitman now. ""Thank You For Smoking"" was a fantastic, hilarious satire and ""Juno"" was a very fun, sweet coming of age film. Neither quite reached greatness, but I think now with ""Up in the Air"" Reitman has made his first truly great film.Now is this quite a masterpiece? No, not quite. I did have some problems with the ending and there were a few moments that I completely predicted near the end. In addition, some moments felt a little clichéd. However, overall this is a great film and should not be missed. It is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Your usual 2000s American dramedy.,"This movie is nothing special. It was just made back when socially aware movies were popular. And the indie flick approach was raging. It's a road movie in the air. It has the tone, camera work, storytelling and indie folk soundtrack. Clooney is being himself, as usual. Which makes his acting bland. Like it always is since he became a « big movie star ». And the rest of the cast do the best they can, to make this rehash of a formula, interesting again. You see coming every mini- twists a mile away, and all this movie does is making you want to find out more about its music.

Sugar-coated nastiness,"Jason Reitman has brought to the screen a new zeitgeist class, for whom I confess a certain envy: those who live in airplanes, airports and hotels, who live everywhere and nowhere. Are these the new seafarers, the new range riders? Are they paladins or pirates? They seem unfettered, but are they truly free?""We've hired this professional hit man to ruin your life, and if you don't like it, we'll call security."" Companies are gangsters with lawyers instead of guns, severance packages instead of cement buckets. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, gentleman job assassin, immaculately attired and groomed, professionally smiling, mouthing canned reassurances as he gently plunges the knife into his victims -- the Dilberts whose terminations he's been outsourced to announce. His young protégée, played by Anna Kendrick, is a true believer who has invented a new way of firing, via teleconference.The cast is perfect, including scene-stealers Kendrick and Vera Fermiga as Alex Goran, Bingham's kindred spirit-in-the-air who deliver's him his comeuppance. Jason Bateman plays Bingham's amoral boss flawlessly. Reitman even casts some authentic terminees to play themselves. Other victims are played by professionals, who blend in perfectly, except for J.K. Simmons, who's impossible not to recognize, in a delicious bit.This would be a perfect movie except for the episode of Bingham with his family. I think we're meant to loathe the life Bingham leads, yet ""back home"" we are met with lives as flat the cardboard cutouts of Bingham's sister and fiancé he schleps around to fulfill a feckless wedding assignment. There's an ambiguity here I'm not sure Reitman meant to introduce.A word about George Clooney. He's this generation's Robert Redford. A little darker in his look, sound and roles, but the same in many ways. Do you remember Redford in his Twilight Zone episode, also playing a ""transition specialist""? He could have been Ryan Bingham. I predict an Oscar nomination for Clooney, and possibly for Kendrick and Fermiga.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's in your Backpack?,"Greetings again from the darkness. With Juno and Thank You for Not Smoking, writer/director Jason Reitman had proved himself to be not just a terrific filmmaker, but also one with real insight into people and society. His commentary is based on putting people in real situations and having us recognize these moments for what they truly mean.Full disclosure - I am not a George Clooney fan. While I recognize his appeal to the masses, I usually only appreciate him when he steps out of the Clooney role and into something messy (Syriana). In this film, he does a pretty good job of removing his tongue from his cheek and playing the role with the necessary head-on approach it requires. His scenes with Vera Farmiga are extremely well written and acted; but it's his scenes with Anna Kendrick that make this film something special.Clooney seems to be getting all the pub for this, but Ms. Kendrick delivers a turn that provides the emotional depth and link to the audience. My favorite scene is with the three leads discussing their ever-changing life dreams. As they say, youth is wasted on the young.So many insightful moments about everything from loneliness to independence to loyalty to belonging ... all mixed with the harsh realities of the business world at a time when everyone lives in fear of losing their job. Watching these people talk about the pain and humiliation of losing a job that is so intertwined with their person is just excruciating. This really plays out in the scene with J.K. Simmons.Gotta mention the great Sam Elliott in his brief moment as he chats it up with his airline's most loyal customer. Mr. Elliott never disappoints, even if on screen for just a couple of minutes.

made for TV movie,"How this movie ever made it to the big screen is beyond me . It's just a run of the mill movie with a lackluster story . The characters are not interesting at all , I didn't read the book but it had to be better than this .This is a movie about Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)and his job which entails flying around the country firing people for other companies.Jason Bateman plays the part of Ryans boss and he hires someone to rethink the whole company by firing people online thus saving money that was being spent on travel.Most of the story is based on George taking the new girl on the road with him to learn how to fire people and at the same time come to grips with his own issues.

Filled with WOW moments!,"I didn't want Up In the Air to finish. I never knew that a film under 2 hours could provide viewers with countless astonishing moments. Up in the Air is filled with Oscar scene, after Oscar scene in the acting and screenplay departments.I won't bore you of a summary of the movie as I believe you can get countless summaries from various reviews. Instead, I will outline why this movie is perfectly, fantastically, phenomenally and outstandingly excellent (without giving any spoilers).The thing about Up in the Air is that is it both sad and uplifting at the same time. It has so much inspirational, but equally important, honest dialogue which is delivered with utmost geniality from all the actors in the film.So much happens in this film. I was very surprised how this film was not even 2 hours long. It seems like it has everything in it.Up in the Air is a very complex film if careful attention is given to each specific word uttered by the characters. It would require more than one viewing in order to appreciate the true and full 'gist' of the movie.In my opinion, Reitman did a fantastic 'job' of juggling the topics of unemployment and relationships so wonderfully in one beautifully woven script.I can go on and on about Up in the Air forever. It has so many intense moments due to the dialogue and the manner of delivery of the dialogue. It is definitely as original as a movie is going to get nowadays. It has a bit of this and a bit of that, but ultimately, Reitman delivers something we have never seen before.This movie touches on real life issues and really goes 'up in the air' in terms of realism. There is so much everybody can relate to in this film. Loneliness, companionship, unemployment, security, and meaning are all issues which are given decent thought throughout the film.Some people may urge that Up in the Air doesn't have the potential to be a masterpiece because it doesn't really have something 'special' to offer and is simply a normal, decent movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. However, Up in the Air is much more than that. It is very simple, yet complex due to the varying views it offers on so many real life issues. I would certainly put this movie up in my favorites list and number 1 for 2009. I have seen every other movie in the Best Picture categories under the Golden Globes and Up in the Air is a home run for me.Finally, I have to say I had the highest expectations going into this film. Vera Farmiga (well known from Departed) is my recent favourite actress and the reviews I was reading about Up in the Air really sky rocketed my expectations. I usually don't enjoy the idea of having such high expectations. Some movies I would have enjoyed more if I expected less. However, Up in the Air was an exception. I enjoyed this movie even more due to my high expectations. Every time I viewed a scene which touched me so deeply, I thought to myself, 'Thank God for watching this movie the first chance I got. This movie is so wonderful that I don't care what happens next, I don't care how it wraps up, I just don't want it to finish.' Of course, it finished. However, you can be sure that I will watch this move in the theaters countless times and purchase it on DVD for even more viewings. I can't get enough of it.On a side note, J.K Simmons made a very minor appearance in this movie. I must declare that I am shocked that Simmons has never received an Oscar nomination. His supporting roles are immaculate. Juno, Burn After Reading and Up in the Air are some examples. His acting ability is phenomenal, but I also think he only suits supporting roles. Nevertheless, no minimum screen time is required for an Oscar nomination. He seriously deserves one!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"George Clooney's Best Performance, Academy-Caliber, About the Heartlessness of Corporate America--the Innocents Who Get the Ax Deserve Honorable Mention","Ryan Bingham is happiest when he's traveling, either when he's at an airport contemplating his next flight, aboard a plane where he can meditate on the world from 30,000 feet, or flopping on the bed of a hotel room where he's treated like royalty. On the road, Ryan Bingham is somebody, a VIP customer who has racked up more flying miles than the equivalent of several trips to the moon. He gets the best hotel rooms, he cuts through long lines, and he can jump into rental cars faster than a speeding bullet without having his life-story entered into a computer terminal. He is one of thousands of frequent-flyer business travelers to whom hotels and rental car companies genuflect; they kiss his ring by offering the best rates, the best rooms, and loads of freebies. His one-bedroom apartment even resembles an hotel room, although from the get-go, we learn he doesn't like being at home. The road is his home and the people at American Airlines are his family. And occasionally he meets a similar bird-of-a-feather, a business traveler of the opposite sex, for a quick fling.He has an unusual job: to fly to certain corporate American locales and lower the proverbial lay-off ax onto the necks of unsuspecting employees because the company doesn't have the guts to do it themselves. In an age of outsourcing, it shouldn't be surprising that even the dirty job of laying people off can and has been outsourced. Ryan Bingham is the ax men of ax men, firing hundreds of people at a single bound for a plethora of American companies. His own company has come up with a pamphlet that is supposed to ease the blow and convince the poor victim that this is the beginning of a new life. Bingham does his job well (but of course he knows the stupid pamphlet is meaningless), and the upside is he doesn't have to be at home. He does the dirty deed like an assassin-for-hire before heading back to the airport and beginning the cycle all over again. And in between these hits, other companies engage him as a motivational speaker where he likens people and possessions to luggage that drags you down. Of course he advocates traveling light, and not just in terms of what he takes on his business trips.But then his neat and tidy world comes under threat when a new upstart less than half his age, Natalie Keener played by Anna Kendrick, propagates a more efficient way of doing the dirty work. Instead of paying for all those planes and hotels, the company could simply do the job from a virtual terminal back at the corporate office. Firing can now be done with the efficiency of a skype network video-conference style. The ax can be wielded in a setting that wouldn't be much different from ordering something through a Sears online catalog with a live agent on-screen. Complete virtual outsourcing. (You wonder if their next step would be to outsource the outsourcing to India!) The proposal however would mean no more frequent-flyer miles for Bingham. To add insult to injury, his company instructs Bingham to take the young upstart crow through the process. Now we have two reluctant bedfellows, as it were, traveling all over corporate America.This was a pleasant surprise of a movie, maybe not for all tastes, but an incredible storyline with an absolutely tour-de-force performance by Clooney who moves from his usual Steve McQueen cool and eventually shows a more vulnerable side. Simultaneously, I wish there existed an Academy Award for honorable mention. One of the best aspects of the film were a few dozen short clips of the people being fired. According to an interview with Terri Gross, the filmmaker Jason Reitman used people who were not actors, but whose only prerequisite to being in the film was that they had recently lost their jobs. They were instructed to remember how they felt when they were fired and react impromptu on camera, something you don't see very often in films outside of reality television. Also high marks for Reitman who finds the appropriate tone and atmosphere for his story. I hope Clooney is nominated for best actor, but I also wish some of the people ""receiving the ax"" could be honored as well. These were not performances exactly but reenactments.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is grounding possible for a flake?,"Most of the comments on IMDb contain the story line. I don't think it is necessary or advisable. But sharing your personal experience and analyzing it from the vantage point of your subjective reality could be enriching potentials of perception and preparing the one who didn't see the film yet. Equally it may give the confirmation of their own feelings, or a totally different angle to the one they had. Naming who is playing whom is not necessary either - it's all on the title page.I would have given this film 10, but still can't figure out whether the predictability of the most dramatic moment in this film was necessary or not. On the one hand it gives the viewer a sense of bitter satisfaction (""I knew it!""), but creates a feeling of double disappointment and sadness on the other.The film is about and soaked in the existential essence of life commitments vs. self-absorption and detachment. The cruel process of severing people from their lifeline - firing someone from their job, depriving them of their livelihood - coats the sometimes literal executioner in an almost sadistic aura of impotent or inevitable omnipotence. The skillful HR consultant type who specializes in terminating people's employment flies around in business class comfort as a utilitarian Angel of Death personifying the vampire-like nature of his source of wellbeing through the process of taking it away from others. Isn't it a circular conspiracy of the ""everybody against everybody"" nature of our culture? The earthiness of the texture of life, family, partnership, sharing, empathy and consistency (the grounding of a human being) is too real for this individual, who can't afford it - otherwise he can't do his job. Imagine the surgeon feeling the pain, fear,and anguish of the patient. How long will he last?The film is full of the paradoxes of life - fake vs. real; commitment vs. separation, abandonment and betrayal; discovery vs. loss.Good and timely for the contemporary society masterpiece enhancing our appreciation of life process. I wonder if, at least for some while,the rate of the weddings will rise and the divorces - diminish.Hilarious comedy/drama too.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
UP IN THE AIR Soars High,"Up in the Air is a timely story about the frontline, corporate downsizers who terminate workers across the country. It's an unpleasant job with emotional backlash, and George Clooney's performance as a top gun terminator is exemplary. Abetted by assured direction by Jason Reitman (Juno), this is a film for our times.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is very good at what he does, and he has the mileage to prove it. You see, corporations hire him to fly across the country to fire their employees. So good is Bingham that he has a perfect response for every possible reaction or objection. It is an art, and he has honed his skills over the years while living an insulated life of perks and frequent flier miles without any emotional attachments or long term plans for the future. He is even distant from his family. He has his routine down and lectures as a motivational speaker. Ah, what a life.During a layover, he meets another frequent flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga), who, like him, jets cross country and lives on her corporate credit cards and comps. So begins their jet setting affair and multi-city rendezvous. When Ryan's employer decides to streamline expenses, a new hired gun, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), brings big changes including cutting down travel expenses and relying more on a telemarketer setup to conduct the corporate firings. This is a direct threat to Ryan's lifestyle and he proposes to show her the ropes and what it is like to personally fire someone. It is a sobering, learning experience for Natalie as Ryan mentors her and espouses his words of wisdom and his hands on approach compared to her more empirical, scientific methods. It becomes apparent that they have differing values and philosophies on life. When Natalie tries to do a firing, it becomes a game changing event with severe ramifications for all. She is the young, wide eyed idealist, who learns about life the hard way.At the same time, Ryan's sister calls about a wedding that he is reluctant to attend. While most people go home for the holidays, he feels the opposite. He grudgingly takes pictures of cardboard replicas of his sister and fiancé in his travels since they can't afford the trips. He even uses his powers of persuasion on his sister's fiancé who has second thoughts about marriage. It is in this moment that Ryan has an epiphany and learns about himself and what's important in life. As Ryan begins to have feelings for Alex and sets about to make his future, he discovers some startling, harsh truths that will alter his outlook on life forever.Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman has created a smart, engaging film whose subject of corporate firings amid an economic downturn is quite timely. It is those scenes that are fascinating as they are heartbreaking, and Clooney's Ryan is a master at finessing verbal interplay. This film puts faces and souls on the nameless whose lives are destroyed. A scene where a fired employee (J. K. Simmons is excellent) is inspired by Ryan to try something else is masterfully written.Clooney's Ryan is a distant cousin of sorts to his recent standout job in Michael Clayton. Rarely has he been more charming! His character lives in airport terminals and judges his success by his independence and frequent flyer miles. When Natalie, Alex and his own family converge on his life, we see him change, and that is what makes the film so special. To see someone whose outlook on life is changed forever is a rewarding, enriching feeling. When Ryan and Alex talk about life from their experiences, it is in stark contrast to the neophyte Natalie. What is refreshing is to see how Ryan becomes genuinely affected and how in the end he does the right things to correct an injustice.Farmiga (The Departed) registers strongly as the mysterious lover, and Kendrick (Twilight) shines as the naïve Natalie. Jason Bateman (Juno) re-ups with Reitman and scores as a corporate manager. A note of interest is that many of the fired workers are played by actual, laid off employees so that their scenes do take on a sense of immediacy and realism.This is one of those films that makes all the best lists of the year because it's smartly written, well acted, and leaves you with that aftertaste of time well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Up in the Air (2009) Creative and fun,"Comedy and romance have always been genres that end up coming together all the time in cinema. Up in the Air is another one of these cases, but this time without that typical American comedy in the greatest Adam Sandler style. The bet is on a more acidic humor that works very well. The humor is nothing so revolutionary or with genius jokes. However, the jokes work well and make the film very entertaining. Meanwhile, the drama is very well used, developing the three main characters and their evolution throughout the plot very well. The script is good and manages to mix comedy, drama and romance in a very effective way.

Life's about-face moments,"""Up in the Air"" gives us a look at the switchtracks of our lives: those small occurrences that can get us thinking and cause us to alter our direction. They simply add up over time and one day it all comes together. We watch Ryan Bingham go through this process. And even before the change, when he's still a man who seems cold and heartless in his job, he somehow manages to do the impossible of actually leaving some of the people he fires feeling hopeful and encouraged about their future.

"Like my Income to Debt ratio...""Up in the Air"" is a High Priority","""Up in the Air""Ryan Bingham is a 40 something with not a thing to tie him down, except his job and the travel that comes with it that he loves sooo much. It's a pretty cool job, when companies need to downsize a workforce, they hire Bingham's company led by Owner Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) to come in and fire people.Clooney's Bingham has the whole traveling thing down to a fine art- even the line to get into for the least amount of wait time( follow the Asians). Accumulating mass amounts of frequent flier miles( he's trying to get to 10mil, only 6 other people have done it) reward points and women that are into that type~ Namely, Alex (Vera Farmiga, loved her in the Departed). Who is also a frequent flier type. After a extensive comparison of their rewards cards and a few cocktails later, Alex finds herself burrito'd in the couch cushion. They seem quite content with their new relationship, only to part ways until the flight patterns cross again.Bingham is called back to the home office in Omaha for a new announcement of budget cuts. The new direction of the company led by Natalie (Anna Kendrick) to fire people via live web cam chat. Cutting travel expenses for the company by 85%. Ryan, not happy about his oh so precious traveling lifestyle being slammed to a screeching halt professes to Craig(Bateman) that the new plan could never work due to the personality of the job nature. He is accorded a final hurah to show Natalie how it was meant to be done, thing is, Natalie has to go along for the ride.Along their journey Bingham's life that should have been comes in to the picture, via his sister Kara Bingham ( Amy Morton) and the ever continuing drama that is Alex.The Direction that is this movie captained by Jason Reitman is magnificent, he constructs the onion that is Ryan Bingham, then starts to masterfully uncover the layers of love, family, humanity and potential change that make Clooney's Bingham is a character that you really begin to feel for.

The story of a man ready to make a connection.,"Ryan Bingham's job is to fire people from theirs. The anguish, hostility, and despair of his ""clients"" has left him falsely compassionate, living out of a suitcase, and loving every second of it. When his boss hires arrogant young Natalie, she develops a method of video conferencing that will allow termination without ever leaving the office - essentially threatening the existence Ryan so cherishes. Determined to show the naive girl the error of her logic, Ryan takes her on one of his cross country firing expeditions, but as she starts to realize the disheartening realities of her profession, he begins to see the downfalls to his way of life.UP IN THE AIR is a realistic outlook on life, something we don't see in films very often, and I'm not saying this because the film is about the firing of workers due to the downturn of the economy. However, that certain aspect does make the film very relevant to these days than if the film were to be released a few years prior. And ultimately, this realism that runs throughout the film is what makes it so good.I would only assume the film will get nominated for however many Oscars because it deserves so many but one I'm certain it'll get nominated for is the Best Adapted Screenplay category. I usually never talk about screenplays in my reviews much because films I watch usually have a sufficient screenplay, which is nothing to scream about. However, UP IN THE AIR is a well written screenplay, filled with some great dialogue and not the ones you've heard from JUNO. This is what I call a good screenplay.And there is nobody better than to say those lines from the screenplay other than George Clooney himself, who is slowly growing to be one of the more well respected actors out there because of the certain great films he chooses to star in. Clooney is very good in this film and I stress the words ""very"" and ""good."" Not only is he charismatic and funny like we usually see him in many of his films, but he branches out his performance in scenes with isolation and sadness. Here, Vera Farmiga plays an entirely different character than she did with her role in another film that was released in the same year, ORPHAN, but she is just as good or even better maybe getting her nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category.Anna Kendrick starred in last year's highly successful NEW MOON but it's apparent that she'll most likely be remembered for her role in this film. Here, she plays the naive but successful young graduate but plays it off really well that makes one think, ""Why is she even spending her time in the Twilight movies?"" Even other actors who spend probably one or two scenes in the entire film altogether, including Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Danny McBride, and Zach Galifianakis, pull off some very good performances.UP IN THE AIR is not a comedy. It is, at times, dark, although there are many scenes of great humor that balances the film quite nicely. But overall, it's authentic in the way the film observes a man's lonely and isolated life who fires people for a living. I must give credit to director Jason Reitman because he is still strong after three films. Who knows what he'll do next. Funny, dark, witty, and poignant, UP IN THE AIR is one of the best films of 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Slick Amusing But Gets Carried Away,"Up in the Air is a fast paced, snappy movie that tries hard to charm much, which is embodied by George Clooney's character in it on whom the film is centered. It's not too different than any other George Clooney performance but it's still some of his better work because he's so well suited for the role. The characters job in the movie is totally unique and one most people aren't even aware exists, but because it's so different it serves as the ground floor for the plot. When it tries to be funny the film is most succesful and falters when it gets too wrapped up in it's own philosophy or going for something deeper. However, that's the direction it ends up taking. As George Clooney faces his personal life crises in the third act so does the entire movie and ultimately meanders it's way into mediocrity because of it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Reitman did something in this movie that I thought was amazing. In the movie there was examples of types of relationships reflected through the characters: New love, love lost and nonexistent love. Now after you see this movie you can decide which characters fit into which category. Love and family were also used in this movie as coping devices, for that even though these people lost their jobs, they knew everything was going to be OK with the help of their family.

Vera Farmiga shines as his dream woman or as she likes to put it ""Just think of me as yourself with a vagina"" so as you can imagine it isn't hard to see why he likes her.Anna Kendrick also proves to have great potential as supporting actress, she is almost as strong willed and witty as Clooney but it is Reitman's fantastic direction that makes the pace and conversation of the film so enjoyable to watch; proving his Juno phenomenon(though Diablo Cody got most the credit)wasn't mere luck.

"A Brave, Compassionate, Brilliant Film: Examining the Now","Jason Reitman (director and co-writer with Sheldon Turner based on Walter Kirn's novel of the same name) is a bright light among the new directors of important stature. He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman). UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more. It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well. This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed. Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities - both being traveling business people.Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company. Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype. The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other. Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together. Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult. At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women. Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs.Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also). The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film). And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman. This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009. Highly recommended.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wish there was sequel!,"Loved this movie start to finish, one of my favorite movies. Clooney great as usual, just something about this film I absolutely love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
rather pointless movie without any redeeming qualities,"I watched the entire movie. At the end when the credits started rolling, I couldn't understand what the point of the movie was. None of the main characters were likable in any way.. nor had any redeeming qualities. As a viewer I did not really care for any of the protagonists. Vera Farmiga was sexy and likable most of the movie... till an unexpected reveal at the end. Anna Kendrick did not really impress. George Clooney was his usual likable self, but did not bring anything special to the character. If it was not a George Clooney movie, I doubt I would even have heard about it. To conclude, I wish, I had gone to bed instead. While I did not hate this movie, I would not recommend it either. It just seemed like a pointless waste of time . Thumbs down.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
He's a sad and lonely man... but the movie is great!,"It is great! I could say that it is brilliant even. I just saw it recently, but lately (since ""Avatar"" :D) it is the best I've seen. George Clooney is a great actor. I do love him not just because I'm a girl (Let's face it! Women love him because he is what he is.), but because he gives great performances one after another. A movie with his name in the titles guarantees a good time. So, yeah! I'm a fan. But let's speak about the movie... I loved it. I loved its fresh humor, the sadness of the story and how it was blended to make a perfect, refreshing cocktail. This is a movie about a man who has lived all his life in a certain manner, is used to certain things and ways, is committed to a life of a bachelor (Even more than that! He doesn't even have an address that he would call his home, and basically lives out of a suitcase by choice.). He denies family and marriage. All the interaction he needs he gets from flight attendants (That's an overstatement, but it basically explains his level of need for other people.) One day this man realizes that the philosophy, he has been living by, might be flawed and he just might want to try out some of that regular stuff that all of us are dreaming off since we were 5 years old, or so. He just might commit to another person. And guess what!!! It all blows up in his face! It seams so unfair... so sad. He was ready to change his life for another person, but it turned out, nobody needed him different. I felt so sorry for this man. He has shut himself off from the world and now, that he wants to rejoin, it doesn't let him. Is it too late at some point to change your stars??? I guess that the lesson is: be careful what you wish for - you might just get it. SO, the actors were great. George of course! I love Vera Farmiga. She is great and charming as always. I must point out Anna Kendrick's performance. She has something. I must agree with the many comments out there who all claim that she has a great potential. I truly enjoyed her performance. It is nothing like the Twilight saga. Good luck to her! But all these wonderful actors were brought together to tell an interesting and fresh story. Not everyone will like it, but it's a smart movie. It's not for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Jason Reitman is a stellar director, no doubt about it.","Mr. Clooney, you have finally convinced me of your charm and acting talent. They both are on full display in Up in the Air, and I find myself throughly convinced. I can't picture a single other actor in this role, and that's about as big of a compliment as I can give.Mr. Reitman, you are now 3 for 3, and that's quite a feat. I'm the biggest Juno fan in the world, and while Up in the Air doesn't eclipse that particular favorite of mine, I still enjoyed it for many of the same reasons. The story is starkly modern, yet I think it will stand the test of time very well. It's melancholy (I do so love melancholy), occasionally uncomfortably honest, and it flows perfectly. Never a dull moment, no glaring flaws, and a cast that brings the best out of the characters. The music is a perfect companion to each scene, enhancing them while never becoming a distraction. Up in the Air is a great movie, and one that I hope to see again very, very soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing ... true American Society,"Very powerful and strong plots  it's the true story of American corporate society today. Director Jason Reitman is always trying to show and portray hidden but we are seen in everyday life of American society. Juno was about life of 16 years old pregnant high school girl and Up in the Air was about a corporate down-sizer Ryan (George Clooney). The film released on perfect timing because today many Americans are facing exactly same problems occurred in the film. Last couple years many big corporate are downsizing their employees, but they rather hire an outsourcing and they would handle their firing situations easier. Ryan was one of those guys whom portrayed in the film. He travels around America from state to state; company to corporate and so on. Then he meets a new and ambitious Natalie and then they travel together to fire more people in different places. Furthermore, he met these frequent flier woman named Alex and later on he fell in love with her; but at the end of the movie he found out that she was married and had a child. In conclusion, the point of the movie was Ryan has no place to home because he travels around America all the time. At the end of the movie; when his travel miles approached to 10 million, airplane pilot asked, where he was from. He didn't have answer because he spent most of his life up in the air.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great comedy-drama,l think that movie is a great example of less comedy and more drama. But it is kind of different.

It must have watch before dying.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did not enjoy the plot,"This movie shows the generational gap that exist between older working Americans and American youth concerning relationships, work ethics, and confrontation. It also shows the vulnerability of a traveling single man who falls for another traveling woman, who is honest in her relationship. I do not recommend this movie because it glamorizes adultery, unfaithfulness in marriage, youthful intemperance, and lack of morality among Americans at the expense of a single white male. Moreover, it dehumanizes the firing process of employees by using interactive networks to inform employees that they are no longer required (i.e. fired). I do not recommend this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Settling...,"In ""Up in the Air"" George Clooney as corporate downsizing specialist Ryan Bingham asks laid off employee Bob (reliably great J.K. Simmons), ""Why do kids like professional athletes?"" Indignant Bob replies it's because they get to have sex with Victoria Secret models. Ryan reminds him that is why ""we"" like athletes. Ryan tells Bob, ""Kids like athletes, because they follow their dreams."" Ryan points out to Bob, that he sold out his dream of being a chef, to take his job. Now he has a chance to follow his dreams, and inspire his kids. Clooney is amazing. He possesses deadly deft charm that always underlies a sense of humanity. His Ryan Bingham is a self-sentenced loner in pursuit of the elite 10 million mile frequent flier status—more at home on the plane, than at home. Training in tow is idealistic Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who envisions revolutionizing Ryan's business by terminating employees over the internet and teleconferencing. Thus, eliminating Ryan's need for travel and dashing his 10 million miles dreams. Solid Jason Bateman is boss Craig, who forces the road trip training jaunt.Anna Kendrick is awesome, and like Clooney is Oscar worthy. Her Natalie is exceedingly bright, void of experience, and strung way too tight. As she unravels Kendrick is funny, and very human. In a great scene Kendrick silently sits outside after she fires an employee that has unexpected consequences. Clooney walks over and consoles her, saying that it is their job to make the horrendous ""tolerable"". That compelling chemistry in concert with Writer/ Director Jason Reitman's (""Juno"") narrative mastery make ""Up in the Air"" one of the best movies of the year. Reitman with Sheldon Turner wrote the screenplay from the novel by Walter Kirn. Kirn's story has been updated to the current economic upheaval and the personal turmoil in the widespread unemployment in the U.S. Reitman filmed real people, who have been laid off and must contend with paying a mortgage and feeding their families. He never dismisses the gravity of it all.Reitman balances paradoxical humor and the tragedy and impact of being laid off. This is revealed in the narrative thread for Clooney's Ryan himself. Self exiled loner Ryan is captivated by fellow business traveler Alex (smart and smoldering Vera Farmiga). Alex reminds Ryan that she is like him only with a vagina. Ryan actually considers altering his status, also at the urging of Natalie, who points out that he is so full of it. He even asks Alex to come to his estranged niece's wedding in Omaha. Perhaps, there may be more to life than just flying solo? However, Ryan's karma may dictate a particular outcome.""Up in the Air"" concludes not perfunctorily, but eloquently. However, particularly with Ryan and Natalie it is about following your dreams in the context of them sometimes being dashed; rather it is just that life happens. Touching Farmiga's Alex tells Kendrick, after Natalie describes the man she wants to marry: it is not about settling. As one gets older, our dreams themselves evolve, and we all have to make peace with that. ""Up in the Air"" really gets it right in one of the year's best movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Picture Perfect!!,"I love George Clooney, and i would say i Loved Ryan Bingham more, he stays close to my heart coz he resembles me and others who feel are solitary and isolated in their lives. And there are certain things which are true to itself as shown in the movie. You don't always get to watch a happy ending where a Lady who gets stuck somewhere in our life be there forever, neither are we gonna change our life style to be someone else!Ryan Bingham, a downsizer & motivational speaker - motivational stuff as to how to avoid commitments and stay single and lively - subtly shows how men have been more to being negative and having the dark shades of life, i mean firing others and abstaining from relations is a common plight with guys around, who doesn't find the meaning of life and just lives on somehow. Ryan Bingham is even referred as a ""cocoon of self banishment"" to which he replies its simply a life choice. The way the story winds up was so beautiful, the climax scene in which George Clooney stands alone watching the schedule in the airport would be my favorite.George Clooney was suave, neat and perfect as Ryan Bingham. I still believe he deserved more than an academy nomination. The supporting cast were all good, anna kendricks so perfect as the newbie, Vera Farmiga and Jason Bateman doing their parts so well. The soundtrack was good and drove the movie in good tone. The snaps from the air were all beautiful. Wonder why The movie didn't win a single Oscar!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life is... bitter sweet,"What a movie. You actually travel through the story; you are on a journey through emotions, while the main character travels through the states. There are no stunts in this movie, everyone is portrayed, and people that appear even for 5 seconds will touch you.The director is taking us on a walk through the genres of drama, romance and comedy masterfully, without a single flaw, like a child in a store for candies, and He gave us the right amount of what we want and what we need. Some viewers will cry for that sweet candy and why does He gave us as much as the bitter candy... but that's life. Bitter-Sweet.Everyone of the cast was perfect, but I feel I need to mention the outstanding performance by George Clooney and the cult scene in the Airplane where He receives His long awaited recognition card, and how He played that scene is beyond words.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do Not Expect Too Much Out of This,"I watched this movie because it was cited in all of the major award giving lists as a contender for Best Picture. All its stars, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick, have been nominated for acting awards. Therefore I watched with high expectations. And once again, the hype left me disappointed.The story is simple enough. And somehow, I think I just saw a variation of this same story recently in ""The Messenger."" It involves a man Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) with the unpleasant job of firing people from their jobs in different cities around the US. A new upstart colleague Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has come up with the idea of firing people through the internet, instead of in person. So Ryan brings her along with him on his job to let her experience the human drama involved firsthand. Along for the ride is Alex (Vera Farmiga) who is essentially Ryan's kindred spirit in a commitment-less affair. Events unfold that cause Ryan to question the very lifestyle which he had been used to for so many years.OK, it was fine, mildly entertaining, with some pithy dialogs. But for me, it was just alright. Nothing that special as a whole. George Clooney is good, but I felt he was better in ""Michael Clayton"" than here. His movie star aura really gets in the way of his role as a lonely person, making it difficult to gain the audience's empathy. Anna and Vera are proficient, but nothing spectacular in their acting.So, you may want to catch this if you like wordy movies about loneliness, rejection, and emptiness. But do not bring too much high expectations when you do decide to watch, because frankly, I did not really see what the big Best Picture fuss was all about.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
it flies & delivers,"""Up in the Air"" is special because it's solidly good in (what used to be) an ordinary way. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most films today (especially American ones) open strong, continue adequately and then make a very long march to the credits, because they don't know how to stop.One of the nicest things about ""Up in the Air"" is that it knows how, where and when to leave you--so you leave the theater solidly satisfied.The other thing that cries out for admiration is the artfulness of the script. The film's logic is rooted, where it should be, in a fine screenplay. The actors get neat things to say, neat situations to convey, and they do a neat job with them.For me, the standout performance belongs to Kendricks. Her character is sincere, complex and consistent. At the same time she's coiled, intense and unpredictable. Clooney & Farmiga, to an extent, are hampered by having to depict people who are not quite believable--although Clooney compensates with (what I see as) his trademark, dogged humanity.And danged if I know why, but I always love seeing Sam Elliott.This film deserves the highest rating--because, in our day, the solidly good has become heroic--and because, at its end, ""Up in the Air"" is so roundly satisfying.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing Cast and Direction,"I watched Up in the Air because I'm a big fan of Anna Kendrick and wanted to see the role she has earned the most praise for in her whole career. I must admit that it did not disappoint. Apart from the great performances by our 3 leads, one of the things I loved about this movie was the directing. Jason Reitman, who also co-wrote the script, has a really great way to capture intimate and tender moments between characters. The story is all about connection, and the directing of the movie captured that. There is particularly one sequence at the end, the wedding (for those who've seen it), that was shot beautifully. That whole sequence wasn't about getting those cinematic artistic shots, but about capturing the emotion the actors are showing. The only problem I have with this movie was that I believe the ending could have been fleshed out a little bit more. The resolution to the arc of our main character wasn't really there for me. Nonetheless this was a movie I deeply enjoyed and want to see again to try and analyze the story and performances better.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Frightfully depressing movie,"Just short of ""Hated it"". Clooney In fact, the acting as a whole) was very good, but the movie in general was one of the most depressing I've ever watched. From dealing with incredible shallowness to having a plot (Idiot's guide to How to Fire Employees) that maximizes depression in the holidays, amidst an unbearable job market, this was an unpleasant 2 hours right before Christmas. Artistically well done, but the blatant commercialism brings ""product placement"" to a new level...Hilton, Hertz and American Airline must have paid big bucks, poor Luxor Hotel in Vegas (""that dump"") obviously didn't. And Hollywood liberals rant against blatant corporate commercialism??? Go figure!If you go in happy, you'll leave sad. If you go in sad, bring someone with you, you won't want to be alone.

We are organized to produce and to survive, but there is something wrong with this organization. This is a story of a back pack that represents an order forcing us to become more fluid.

So everyone who has ever been dumped painfully and ruthlessly can identify with the characters of Ryan (George Clooney) & Natalie (Anna Kendrick). A very good and compact movie. I wonder why IMDb categorized the movie as a 'Comedy' because there is hardly any, except a few sexual innuendos. Like most Hollywood movies, even this one comes with a few good surprises. Excellent performances by all the characters.The movie depicts the emotional upheavals that one goes through when he/she faces a sudden shocking change in his/her professional life. It's a story about the importance of relationships in one's life; about self discovery; about the emptiness that one feels within when certain incidents in life question our beliefs and assumptions.It absolutely deserves each of the 6 Oscar nominations.

A breeze of fresh air...,"UP IN THE AIR comes with a breeze of fresh air. It tells a story about a guy that basically lives on the airplanes travelling around the US and telling people they're fired.

It's an intelligent, original and fresh (finally!)

wow!!!,"George Clooney finally won me over two years ago with Michael Clayton, but Ryan Bingham from Up in the Air may well be his performance of a lifetime (let's hope there's more where this one came from) and certainly represents his best work as an actor yet. BA nomination is secured, and who knows, he may even finally get it this year.Up in the Air is a fantastic film that serves up all the clichés only to shatter your expectations and turn the aforementioned clichés upside down. In the process the excellent screenplay brings the grim reality of life and how it *really* plays out most of the time to the screen, from where the actors' work projects it back onto the viewer in a wonderfully poignant way. The saddest thing of course is that Up in the Air is not going to win the Best Picture. The reason for that is the Academy will once again as it usually does (note: not always, but in most cases) vote something that is considered an *important* film instead, i.e. something that is not a Sideways_esque portrayal of regular people in their lives, more bombastic, pretentious, and preferably directed by a big-name icon. Inevitably dwarfed in the shadow of that big Oscar juggernaut will end up Up in the Air, a film that can be compared to Sideways and Juno as far as its relatively unpretentious approach to film-making is concerned.Yet here is a motion picture that is thousands upon thousands times more profound. And as far as being pretentious, the layers of depth are so many, there will be much to ponder as you think back to the misleadingly simple story's intricate texture. Anyone who has ever... stopped and given some thought to the backbone of most of our lives - things like love, and marriage, and kids, and the endless running around until one gets old, is going to have an emotional response to this film, it is rather impossible not to. The amazing thing is that these responses will come in many ways as opposed to just one. The film accomplishes an amazing treat of discussing different philosophies and somehow reconciling them in the end... in the process of doing so, the screenplay uses the recurring (but by no means suffocatingly predominant, The Terminal this is not) airport setting as a means of situating the story, and its characters, against the backdrop of an environment that symbolizes diversity, portraying life as it is... that is, as anything but black and white.All of the cast must be credited with what simply is a phenomenal job. I had admired Vera Farmiga's work for a while, and Anna Kendrick is a revelation (no, I have not seen the Twilight films and have no intention to, so this is my first acquaintance with her work). You have to look for the cameos. The humor is excellent and the scary parts... well, I will spoil nothing for you, but anyone who has ever been in a very dark place as far as losing faith in humankind is concerned is going to find something here. I can't think of a single dull or throwaway scene, and even the soundtrack is spot on. In the center of it all, however, towers George Clooney's performance. Subtle, to the point where some critics will without a doubt still attempt to confuse it with bleak, Clooney's work here is loaded with wonderful shades of depth. Yes, he plays a stereotype, but in the process of doing so, as all the greats have at one point or another, Clooney enables the viewer to recognize parts of that stereotype, if not the whole of it, in themselves.So far, my pick for the Best Picture and it's not even close. A marvelous surprise and an absolute must-see. Bring on the nominations!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fascinating character study and so much more; the best film of 2009,"A major part of what makes this film so successful and effective is its simplicity – and watching it, one is surprised at just how incredible simple it really is. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Reitman does not employ fancy cinematography, visual flair, eccentric music, gimmicky storytelling, or any particularly noteworthy or conspicuous elements to tell his story. It is a very simple and straightforward film – what makes it remarkable is the extraordinary depth and richness that simplicity conceals. First and foremost, the film serves as a resonant and fascinating character study. In the vein of the greatest character studies, Reitman portrays and explores every nook and cranny of the man that is Ryan Bingham: and he is quite a fascinating character indeed. We are introduced to him as a man who lives what can be described as a life of complete freedom: he calls no place home except the skies; he finds such purely joyous pleasure in the details of hotel rooms, car rental services, airport security procedures, efficient packing and travel, membership cards and loyal customer clubs and frequent flier miles. We glimpse his closet at one point and see that he has at most three or four shirts. His apartment, which he spends less than a few days at a time in, is completely bare. Most importantly though, Ryan has no major human connection in his life: not with a romantic partner, not with his co-workers, and not even with his own family. But while most of us would look at such a life as quite miserable, Ryan couldn't be happier or more content with his choice.But Ryan is thrown off balance when technological advances threaten to ground him for life, and when he meets two women who enter his life: the first is a young, fresh-out-of-college employee who is partnered with him on the road so that he can ""show her the ropes""; the second is a free-wheeling woman whom he meets on the road and sees as his counterpart: free from responsibility, reveling in her success and her ""exclusivity"" in the form of various membership cards which the two excitedly compare. Most importantly, though, she seems interested in only the most fleeting and casual of human connections, but as their relationship develops, Ryan seems more and more interested in something serious and seems to think that their relationship is headed in that direction. If Reitman treats Ryan's character and the events in his life with utmost maturity and profundity, he manages to find an even more reflective and meaningful resolution: he avoids simple and one-dimensional solutions and provides us with one that is far more thought-provoking and multi-faceted, in which some aspects of Ryan's life and his relationship with his friends and family change, while others end up being too late to change. It is a fascinating, resonant and really significant study of the human condition, what is important in our lives, what abstract terms such as relationships, family, love, freedom, and all these other ideas mean to us as individuals, and so much more.With Up in the Air, Reitman proves that a truly great movie can be made with nothing more than great performances and good writing. Reitman does not employ visual gimmicks, untraditional storytelling techniques, or any other such prominent elements that make some of the best movies ever made as good as they are. Watching Up in the Air, I didn't get the feeling that I was watching something really groundbreaking like I did when watching There Will Be Blood two years ago, which shook me to the core. Up in the Air didn't feel like something revolutionary or important as I was watching it; the cinematography is good but not particularly showy, as is the editing. The design and look of the movie are all pretty standard, rooted in reality and not flashy. The musical score is effective as are the song choices; but again, the soundtrack doesn't particularly stand out – which is why the fact that this movie is so resonant and deep and meaningful is all the more impressive. Three elements in the film do particularly stand out, though. The first is the performances which, like I mentioned, are career highs for all involved, and just totally full-fledged and fascinating and incredible pieces of work. The second is the screenplay that, while fairly straightforward, conceals so much multi-layered depth and significance and is written so well, the dialogue simply jumping off the screen with such vitality and exuberance. It is a film that works on so many levels; it is at once hilarious and genuinely funny and intelligent while at the same time genuinely and poignantly emotional and dramatic. It is at once a multi-faceted character study and an important testament to the current economic climate of our world. It is enjoyable, charming, funny, touching, thought-provoking, poignant, moving and all in all just one of the most full-fledged and genuine cinematic experiences of the year. The third is what brings it all together, what takes a fairly simple premise that could be so easily underplayed by any other director but that brings out everything that makes the movie as good as it is, and that is the director, Jason Reitman. Building up a strong reputation with his past two films, in his third effort, Reitman brings everything together, and directs the film with such focus and maturity and confidence, completely devoid of irony or preciousness and serves to create what is, in my opinion, the best film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated & Predictable,"After seeing the trailer,and read a few critics I thought to rent this movie. The intro and storyline at the first glimpse was interesting to view the life & job that Clooney has in this movie. Then comes the interesting woman,confident and beautiful making the film turn into some sort of romance.As the new co-worker is introduced the movie changes pace,and becomes a dramatic story describing hundreds of people who got or will get fired. The young inexperienced Natalie does well in that part,as a quirky stuck up girl.Then comes the family part,wedding,forgotten sister,fear of loneliness. Turning the film again into a drama.All these shifts make the movie seem like 3 movies in one. Scenes are often predictable,leaving no shock or WoW factor to the audience.As for the acting and performances,Vera Farmiga did a very good job displaying the strong career woman with a sense of letting loose. Anna Kendrick wasn't bad,but wasn't neither good. George Clooney is a different story,I'm not sure why he is always in every movie the center of attention.This wasn't a good performance by him,he just didn't fit the role.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Restraint,"There was plenty of potential to turn this into either an overly sentimental story, or a cheap laugh attempt. But the makers did not fall into those traps.One may say that George Clooney often plays some variation of himself frequently. Be that as it may, the natural way he came across, including conveying genuine sadness when necessary, yet in keeping with the restraint of the character he played, was very impressive.The characters went through satisfying and believable arcs, faced relatable dilemmas, and the actors weren't afraid to give fully of themselves.Jason Bateman was perfection as the smarmy boss with a heart.But the scene that made the picture for me, was when Clooney's character is called upon to convince someone else that a life of commitment and connection is worthwhile. Despite the choices he personally has made.The female love interest played by Vera Farmiga annoyed me. But that means that the actress did her job well. Because she portrayed her character as detached from morality in such a convincing way.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An easy choice, if you're trying to figure out what to see this weekend.","As a fan of movie theatres and of the going to of them to see awesome movies, the holidays should, If I buy into the enormous marketing budgets of all the big distribution companies, be my favourite time of year. They seem to hold back all the cool movies for the days when the snow starts to fall. Why? Why now? Well, as it's been in the past and as it always shall be, the movies released during the last chunk of the year in North America that don't have ghosts or explosions in them might just be gunning for an Oscar. That's how it is, and being that it's well after TIFF, the Oscar buzz is flying free and easy, which means PR people everywhere get carried away and I start to roll my eyes. Previous to yesterday, everything I'd heard about Up in the Air seemed to confirm that it was a sure 'front-funner' in this big race that hasn't even officially started, which, for me (a cynical bastard who can't help but want in on the conversation) meant that I had to see it for myself. Prove it, Jason Reitman, director of Thank You For Smoking and Juno. Prove to me that Up in the Air is all that and a golden statuette, an important movie for smart, sophisticated folk, winter movie folk, folk who'd cross the street to avoid a summer blockbuster movie lovin' jerk. I dare you.So anyway, as if you didn't know where this was going already, I am now definitely 100% convinced of Up in the Air's worthiness as Oscar-bait. My Oscar sense is tingling, big time, which didn't even happen after I saw A Serious Man(which was my previous favourite for 2009, but now, who knows?). I know, I know, I'm just throwing more Oscar-buzz logs onto the Oscars fire (editor's note: good one, Rajo), but this movie seems to have all the right moves: good-looking, talented actors, up-and-coming, sensitive, 2nd generation Hollywood director who knows what he's doing, a story very much set right here, right now. It's even nice to look at. But what makes it extra-super Oscar worthy is that Up in the Air doesn't even feel like it's trying that hard, which, especially at this time of year, is remarkable and refreshing. The planets just seem to have aligned for Reitman, and as a result, we movie-goers get what is basically just a great little movie, pure and simple.Besides being beautifully crafted, fun and easy to watch, Up in the Air poses some meaningful questions about western human interaction at this exact moment in time in the universe, what with technology and isolation, and the internet and the facebook and the iPhone. It does so without going too far off the 'dated reference' deep end (with the exception of some slightly on-the-nose deux ex machina stuff - webcam technology threatens the livelihood of Clooney's character). It features maybe a few too many musical montages, but they don't do anything to diminish the well thought-out, thoroughly entertaining and sophisticated storytelling at play here. In Up in the Air George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a compassionate loner whose job it is to fire you when your boss is too much of a coward to do it him/herself. He flies across the country for 80% of the year, which he prefers to staying grounded, as he also happens to believe in a philosophy that paints deep relationships with other human beings as a burden. Naturally, because this is a movie, he bumps into other characters along the way that cause him to start questioning exactly what he wants, and where he's going. But interestingly, the film manages to handle this kind of relatively high-concept characterization and metaphor-laden story of human growth as if it's no big deal. Almost as if these people, all travelling through life in completely different directions, some with lots of baggage, some with little-to-none could actually exist, maybe. Which only endears them and their wacky little story to us even more.Reitman, a huge fan of the ritualistic necessities of flying, poured a lot of himself into Ryan Bingham and it shows; the old saying, 'write what you know' strikes again. And besides getting the many, many details right, and casting some great actors (Clooney is charming and handsome, again, and Vera Farmiga is surprisingly good), the movie has some great music, the year's best title design and it's edited superbly well, allowing the twisty-turny story to seamlessly flow towards its satisfying if unconventional end. It basically has everything, which is why critics are going absolutely freaking nuts over it. I now have to count myself among the believers. I would gladly go see it again, and I highly recommend it to anybody who doesn't know which Oscar contenders to back, or who might just want a great night out at the movie house. It is exactly the kind of movie that is worth waiting all year for: subtle, smart and funny and sure, sophisticated. I'll just go ahead and say it: with the Best Picture nominees doubling this coming Oscar ceremony, it will not be a surprise to see Up in the Air counted among them. Deservedly so. It's that good. 8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lost in Translation With More,"19 March 2010. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) meets Lost in Translation (2003). Take actress Anna Kendrick playing the role of Natalie Keener, a more serious and uptight Ann Hathaway playing the role of Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada and actor George Clooney playing the role of Ryan Bingham, a more involved and confident Bill Murray playing the role of Bob Harris in Lost in Translation and you get a fusion of mostly drama with a light dose of humor that focuses on dramatically different lifestyles, attitudes towards relations, momentary changes of wants and needs in this human growth movie. The photography is wonderful with unique aerial shots, the cinematography captures a naturalness and gorgeous, authentic looking reality-movie experience that doesn't usually seemed staged. Oddly enough, this surprisingly predictable movie doesn't require sharply new material, only the fresh approach to real life that most audience members can relate to.The fascinating question here is whether or not this timely and period relevant movie in this era of the Great Recession would resonate as mightily during periods of prosperity. Perhaps the lingering memory of this era might permit the emotional empathetic and visceral connection to continue for several decades to come. Whether this movie could stand the test of time over a century is another matter. Nevertheless, this movie released in 2009 depicted the intensity, misery, and depth of emotional turmoil of the times with compassion and dispassion. It also focused further relationships and searched for questions of life's meaning. This is a substantive movie with heart and soul. A great movie for our times.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Timeless Portrait of Corporate America's Soul,"Edit: October 2024After revisiting 'Up in the Air' three times over the past decade (2014-2024), I can say that its brilliance continues to shine brighter than ever. The director has crafted a real timeless masterpiece that grows more relevant with each viewing. At the same time, Clooney delivers his best charming performance as a corporate downsizer, perfectly capturing the American Dream's duality.The film's magic lies in its mix of elements: Clooney's captivating vulnerability, Farmiga's sophisticated charm, and Kendrick's transformative journey from rigid idealist to disillusioned professional. The heartfelt testimonials from laid-off workers add a nice touch that grounds the story in reality.I can't get enough of the soundtrack, which is so in line with the emotional highs and lows of the film. Reitman's direction brilliantly juggles comedy and social commentary, while cinematography turns those often anonymous airports and hotels into stunning 'characters'.What I love most is the film's refusal to offer easy answers, which elevates it to a delightful level of depth. Like a fine wine, it has aged exceptionally well (from 2009), and its themes, such as isolation, corporate culture, and the myth of success, remain painfully relevant (in 2024).This movie is a shining example of Hollywood filmmaking at its very best, where entertainment joyfully blends with artistic brilliance and social insight.Verdict: 9 out of 10. Each viewing for me revealed a new layer of meaning and joy (every single time)!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Makes you think in unexpected ways,"There are hundreds of other reviews that state the obvious and true aspects of the film including the insights into frequent flier business travel, the life of young and aging professionals, the emotions felt by people laid off and those worried about their job changing around them, and the fantastic acting in the film.What I found interesting about the film were the hidden insights into the directors, writers, and actors thinking as well as subtle cultural cues that the audience laughed at but may not have thought about at a conscious level.On the surface, the film is very leftist/Hollywood. Heartless corporate bosses can't fire their own workers so they hire an outside firm to do it for them. Haha! I googled the concept and couldn't find such a firm. In my own corporate experience, the heartless, gutless managers don't bother to pay someone like Ryan to fly in business class to layoff the workers. They simply take the day off and have their HR representatives do it. I unfortunately know this from personal experience. That's part of why I enjoyed the film.What was worth the price of admission was the dialogue between Ryan and the two generations of professional career women at a hotel lobby. All three of them are unapologetic selfish human beings. Ryan fires people for a living because it provides him with the lifestyle to run up frequent flier miles. This character also has a lot to do with Clooney's Hollywood alter ego. But the other two characters hit closer to home to the audience even if they didn't catch it. The young woman expressed post-feminist angst that while she loved earning lots of money and being able to pursue her career dreams, she worried about being able to land the perfect man. The older, attractive, and successful professional woman represented what the younger woman aspired to have (and in more ways than one, but I won't reveal how) but the older woman was more savvy about setting the ""have-it-all"" expectations of the younger woman more, down to earth.So here the film features people getting laid off amid a bunch of professional bourgeois jetsetting around with their own selfish, shallow problems by comparison and they just don't ""get it"" that they're part of the problem. It's a nice allegory for the writers of the film and even many of the viewers.When the film comes to an end, it doesn't leave the viewer's emotions all wrapped up in a neat bow but rather hanging where you don't know where the three characters' lives are leading. Indeed, the more successful, stable characters of the film are the ones who seem to have the most uncertainty.Many of the best one liners are also the most politically incorrect and totally not the kind of thing that George Clooney would say at an Oscars presentation but probably the kind of things he thinks in his daily life. The scene where he lectures the girl at the airport at how to ""save time"" especially comes to mind. So much for him protecting minorities from sitting in the back of the theater! In the end, we're all ""up in the air"", whether we know it or not, with the biggest baggage not being our relationships, at least with each other, but rather with our expectations of the world and our cherished beliefs.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adequate,"First: the good news.Sound: good. Cinematography: good. Direction: good. Acting: good.However.....A reasonable idea for a plot - quite unlike anything else I've seen (which has to be a plus point, as so many films now are merely reheated yesterdays' dinners.) But the idea doesn't really *go* anywhere, at least not for the majority of the 109 minutes. Now, some movies can take this - and may in fact have the ennui as part of the atmosphere - but I don't think this is one of them.Two possible endings were signposted loud and clear within the first fifteen minutes. Either Ryan was going to get the heave-ho himself (probably by his young trainee) or he was going to ""find"" himself and his lack of a real life, and realise that he was more comfortable chasing air miles.So the only thing that kept this viewer in the cinema was wondering which ending was going to eventuate, or whether there was going to be a subtle twist at the end. It's not a spoiler to disclose that no, there *was* no subtle twist at the end! Having got all that off my chest I have to admit that I found ""Up in the air"" reasonably watchable in an inoffensive sort of way. As another reviewer has said, there are really two or three different stories here: however they are not woven together as sub-plots which is how a great movie, or book, maintains a hold on the audience. They are merely different strands of the story.5/10 for me: easy enough, wouldn't see it a second time, wouldn't buy the DVD and, if asked, wouldn't put my vote in the Oscar box",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding Performances for an Original Story,"I was impressed with Anna Kendrick's display of emotions and sense of identification with the character of an ambitious, workaholic, young business counselor who is trying to demonstrate her new proposed methods to fire people in a specialized company of labor contract's terminations. And the professional and emotional confrontation with the experienced field man who doesn't agree with her ideas but who will have to teach her if he wants to remain in his position and not end on ""the other side of the desk"". The opposed perspectives to life and values from both characters enriches the story with delightful dialogs and situations.George Clooney evolves from his ever-played role of successful- rich guy, providing this time a thoughtful performance that reminds me in a way, the sadness expressed by actor Will Smith in the 'Seven Pounds' drama from some time ago. You can feel the emptiness of his existence when he smiles to acknowledge his fortunate up-in-the-air life which has also caused the coldness from his closest family members. Also memorable are the scenes of disappointment after finding out the status of his new like-alike lover or the conversation he had with his soon to be brother in law.As per Vera Farmiga's adaptation to a similar character of the one played by Clooney, we have to agree on the fact that the acting is the most valuable part of this film along with the originality and prevalence of the topic. Not only fixes well under the current economics' circumstances but delivers a positive message as well, where the attitude towards negative events can help us to find out ways to overcome and strengthen our weaknesses. There were some less interesting shoots and maybe the script concluded a little way too loose from the original point of start, but seeing the complete work, we must admit that was good movie material treated masterfully by its crew.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clooney Flies High,"It only runs for 105 minutes, but Up In The Air feels even shorter. This is a fine piece of entertainment .. with more messages here than in 20 mobile phones. George Clooney is great in his rather ""Oliver Cromwell"" type role of--sacking people.(giving people the chop!!) He flies all over America doing the dirty work for corporations that are too queasy for that kind of thing. He virtually lives in the air. He likes his work, and he is also a motivational speaker.

"An unconventional, but remarkable movie. An instant classic!","Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a Road Warrior. No, this does NOT mean he's going to be replacing Mel Gibson in the next Mad Max movie, also titled Road Warrior. No, it simply means he's payed to fire people, or as he puts it ""I work for a company run by a bunch of Pussies who don't have the balls to sack their own employees."" Unlike his family, Bingham doesn't believe that he is secluding himself from the world, but rather, surrounding himself with people.When a recent college graduate named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), persuades Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman), Bingham's employer, as well as all the other people who work with him, to do all the firing via computer, all the Hatchetmen, including Bingham, are grounded. Because she has eventually ruined his way of life, Bingham takes an instant dislike to Keener, but when Craig gives him the job of showing her the ropes, Bingham must learn to cope.After Keener's boyfriend dumps her via text message while they're on the road, Bingham decides to be a bit nicer to Keener, eventually becoming one of her closer friends.While Bingham is adjusting to having a traveling companion, he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga). Alex, who is also a hatchetman, and Ryan begin a strange relationship which comes crashing down in the film's conclusion.While Ryan Bingham isn't the kind of guy that you'd normally like, you find yourself rooting for him, and the rest of the characters in the humanly real, and darkly funny film that plays almost like a documentary than a drama.The film's conclusion isn't predictable, to say the least, but that's just how director Jason Rietman, who adapted the screenplay from Walter Kern's novel of the same name, wants it. And, while it isn't for everyone, if you like George Clooney, offbeat film, or Reitman's last directorial success Juno, this film is Definitely worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ryan Bingham is not Juno MacGuff.,"Ryan Bingham is not Juno MacGuff. Don't see this movie just because the guy who did Juno did this too. If you have that mindset, it will disappoint. Juno is a character who starts out aimless and finds a more defined path for her life. Ryan starts out with a defined path for his life but winds up aimless by the end. The effect is unsettling and even unsatisfying if you're looking for a more traditional comedy.What is great about Jason Reitman is that he shoots for the edit in this film. Every shot is carefully planned for both comedic and dramatic purposes. One scene in particular could be used to study directing and editing. It simply has Bingham going through a security check at an airport, but every little step involved with that procedure is shot and cut in rapid, harmonious succession with sound effects that make those blunt gray containers seem like weapons. Bingham is a warrior.Several scenes include large American Airline posters in the background that read: ""We Value your Loyalty."" This underlines the defining concept of the film. Loyalty is a limited resource. Everyone has it invested in something, but what's going to provide the most return? There is much to be said about relationships, with characters that are loyal, disloyal and even indifferent, and the need ""to make a connection"" (as the tagline so cleverly tells us). This is a timeless story centered around the American Dream but yet is a snapshot of our time and the result of the current economy. People need to see this. It will reach out to them.It is clear that ""Juno"" was what it was because of Reitman. He brings a certain level of humanity to everything he does. Up in the Air deserves the title of Best Picture. It's the most all-around complete film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Turning Things Downside Up,"Up In The Air is a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking drama starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. Clooney's corporate 'hit-man' is gloriously uncaring, but still exudes charisma in a way that is difficult to take one's eyes off. Clooney's chemistry with Anna Kendrick's character is very entertaining, and the corporate (and personal) carnage that they wreak, while wince-inducing, is inventively captured by Jason Reitman through the device of talking heads. This is a superb follow-up by Reitman to the excellent 'Juno' , almost looking at the opposite end of the human condition for its inspiration, it should send you off to look for Reitman's other films 'Thank You For Smoking' and 'Young Adult'. There are clever and thoughtful twists in the third act; it is ultimately a very satisfying and enjoyable film that should leave you with something to think about if you are on a professional career path.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the smartest films to emerge from post-recession America,"Up in the Air focuses on Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who has worked for the Career Transitions Corporation (CTC) for several years and has made his living a traveling downsizer, flying all across the United States to lay off white collar workers. He believes in traveling lightly, a philosophy he expands on in the speeches he delivers during his downtime, and resorts to animalistic ideas of walking alone and refusing to bear the baggage relationships, possessions, and other trivial things bring to his structured and meticulously-managed life. His sole goal is to obtain ten million frequent flyer miles, a feat that will grant him not only a personalized flyer card but his name alongside various airplanes, a trait shared by few other individuals.One day, he is called into his office by his boss (Jason Bateman) where he meets Natale Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, newly-hired idealist who believes she has created a response to the costly operations of the CTC, which currently has numerous men flying around the United States at all times and staying at lavish hotels, compensated by the company they work for. Natalie foresees a future for the company that has the same sort of traveling downsizers operating over the internet, interacting with souls about to be laid off from their jobs through a webchat program, which will prove to be more economically efficient. Ryan is disgusted about this idea, seeing Natalie's innovation as an impersonal way to communicate with people in one of their most emotionally fragile and unstable times of their lives. To show her that this job requires compassion, quick-wittedness, and one-on-one humanity, he takes her along to be his assistant on various jobs in the United States, showing her what the process is like in the flesh. Along the way, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Faminga), a thirty-four-year-old, traveling saleswoman who could be called Ryan's female counterpart, as she operates with the same sort of suave, confident characteristics as him and embraces the fun and freedom that comes with frequent travel. Ryan relishes the fact that he can maintain a casual, friendly relationship with a woman while still ""traveling lightly,"" so to speak.Writers Sheldon Turner and director Jason Reitman constantly maintain a human focus and do not get too wrapped up in economical themes or subtext. They center the film entirely on Ryan's life, which is one of the only and most profound depictions of content loneliness I have ever seen. While the film would've been interesting to see Ryan as a quietly-depressed and openly lonely man, entering his later years and realizing he has little to show for it, the suave and confident Ryan we are presented with here works just as well, if not better. Clooney is the ideal actor for Ryan, as he practically oozes these characteristics, and is assisted by the likes of Kendrick and Faminga, who are written with equal attention given to their characters and are not shortchanged as empty female characters.Up in the Air comes just a year after the crippling financial crisis in America, which left the futures of banks, car dealerships, and the entire American economy uncertain and unstable. Interestingly enough, the film offers a fantastic parallel to one of the features the new American economy will have, which is incredible, technological influence from younger people. The film creates an interesting juxtaposition to what you see occurring in the workforce right now, which is younger people slowly weening out the baby-boomer generation and initiating sweeping technological changes to businesses and industries. In the film, we see Ryan's disgust and disbelief at Natalie's innovation as an underlying theme of the young taking over for the old, and seeing Ryan become beaten at his own game; how long before he finds himself eying himself in the mirror and telling him that he's the one who is fired?Up in the Air is one of the smartest and strongest films to emerge from post-recession America, focusing intently on a character who is more than content with leading a life of functional loneliness from a writer/director who knows how to usher in meaty, contemplative themes while retaining a pleasant, human focus to the material.Starring: George Clooney, Anna Kendrick, and Vera Faminga.

A Thoughtful Exploration of Modern Life and Human Connection,"""Up in the Air"" (2009), directed by Jason Reitman, is a poignant drama that delves into themes of isolation, career, and the search for meaningful connections in an increasingly transient world. Starring George Clooney as Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who travels extensively for work, the film offers a reflective look at the personal and emotional costs of modern life.The narrative follows Ryan as he navigates his job, which involves firing employees across the country, all while he maintains a lifestyle free of commitment and emotional ties. Clooney delivers a captivating performance, balancing charisma and vulnerability as he confronts the realities of his choices. The supporting cast, including Vera Farmiga as a fellow traveler and Anna Kendrick as an ambitious new hire, brings depth to the story, highlighting the contrasting perspectives on work and relationships.Visually, the film is well-crafted, with a keen sense of place that captures the loneliness of airport lounges and hotel rooms, reinforcing Ryan's sense of disconnection. The screenplay is sharp and insightful, offering moments of humor while tackling serious issues related to job loss and the impact of corporate culture on individuals.While the film's pacing is generally strong, some viewers may find certain plot developments predictable. Additionally, the ending leaves room for interpretation, which may not satisfy everyone. However, the film's ability to provoke thought and reflection on the nature of human connection ultimately outweighs these minor flaws.In conclusion, ""Up in the Air"" is a thought-provoking film that resonates in today's fast-paced world, exploring the balance between career ambitions and personal relationships. I would rate it an 8/10 for its strong performances, insightful commentary, and emotional depth. It's a film that lingers in the mind, inviting viewers to consider what truly matters in life.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Choose Your Attachments Wisely,"A deeply philosophical film. Everything worked, but I didn't like the stark message that love and attachments are empty promises--that ultimately we die alone. There was a coldness and cynicism and to the entire film, but we are left with the idea that the main character, played effectively by George Clooney, may be ready for a change. This is not a feel-good film, but it will make you think.The casting was superb, particularly the character Natalie, a know-it-all-but-clueless Cornell MBA, who goes on the road with Clooney's character and gets an education about the real world.This film is highly relevant in these times of traumatic corporate downsizing and economic stress--people losing not just their livelihoods, but their homes and even their their lives.The film is a study in the Buddhist principle that suffering arisings from desire and attachment. This is driven home, without ever mentioning religion. The more attached you become to someone or to an object, the greater you suffer when it is taken away. That's intuitive, but the film questions these attachments and desires and shows how empty life can be lived without them. Choose your attachments carefully, the film infers, and a goal of airline mileage credits seems to be the one attachment Clooney's character allows himself--something attainable, that he has complete control over.But the film isn't entirely cynical about losing your job. The point is made in several places that it can be the opportunity to change your life to something better.The sets were perfectly rendered--airport lobbies, check-in gates, hotels, airliners... .In so many great films, the music feels intrusive. When I notice the sound track, it pulls me out of the story. The music here was just right.The cinematography was great, magical. I was captivated from beginning to end, made to forget that I was in a theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"the Story is ""pointless""","The story is about Byran Bingham who works as an outside consultant who fires people for a living because their own bosses don't like firing them.

This causes Bryan's own zone of comfort outside down and faced being grounded and thinks that Natalie doesn't know the details of what it is like to fire people. Also along the way, Bryan meets a women Alex, who has the same personality of traveling as he does. Unfortunately I won't mention how the story ends, but it has a couple of loose ends, for instance, during the marriage of one of his sisters, the groom asked him about his own married life, and ask him ""what's the point?"" to which he responds that he needs a ""co-pilot"" and his life is about getting rid of excess baggage in his life. The story I believes ends being ""pointless"". It would have improved the plane have crashed, got fired, and had sister to support him that he realized that there is more to life then just flying and firing and people are simply not excess baggage and can be as important to you as your hands and feet. At least this story I prefer to end as less then pointless. There's no spoilers here, just my own alternative ending. I feel the story is somewhat empty.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Up in the Air,"Review:Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" has been described as a story for today, a meditation on loneliness, and a dissertation on how globalization has at once made the world smaller and much larger. My dad thought the movie was about rejection. I thought the movie was about settling for less. Some see it as a film about careers; others see it as a film about opportunity. All these assessments are true and work in accord with one another, making a surprisingly potent film. Such is the wonder of Reitman's third feature picture.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a self described ""Termination Facilitator."" Companies hire him to come and lay off their employees in a time of downsizing. Bingham spends a vast majority of his year flying from city to city, staying in a new hotel each night. Along the way he meets the sexy Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), another professional traveler who also shares a love for life on the road. They hook up and soon after whip out their computers to find when they'll be in the same town again.Matters are complicated when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a recent college graduate, comes to Bingham's company and introduces the practice of firing people over the web. Feeling his road warrior lifestyle is threatened Bingham takes Keener on the road to show her the ropes of their field. Anna Kendrick, most notably having played Jessica in the ""Twilight Saga"" shines like a true star in this film. She has a meltdown in a hotel lobby that is comedic gold.As can be expected, George Clooney plays Bingham with that confidence so customary to a George Clooney role - and yet, this time his confidence is severely challenged. He plays a man that must face times that are changing faster than he is willing to change himself.""Up in the Air"" is all inclusive concerning the facets of how we live today. It ranges in topic from our post 9/11 insecurities to the inner depths of unemployment and ultimately to the incontrovertible fact that we die alone. This film is not a comedy, though it has several laughs. It is a consideration of what we need to live happily and how hard those things are to obtain.Rating:On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Fargo"" (1996).Rationalization:I entered the movie theater expecting to have an uplifting comedy that would reassure me everything would be OK. As it turns out, ""Up in the Air"" is not that movie, and consequently, I left the theater feeling sucker punched in the jaw. Not a hard sucker punch, but one I wasn't expecting. In fact, I would go so far as to say I was feeling blue after seeing this movie for the first time. ""Up in the Air"" resonated with me. It made me feel something and made me feel deeply.

"A great film, that resonates with both generation-X and Y","Up in the Air is a film that resonates perfectly with the current times. Not only does it involve a terminating company (a company that gets hired to fire people), and women in a position of power to put forth the stand that mentality of gender equality in the 21st century, but the main character, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) represents the rolling stone mentality of so many business people in the 21st century. When asked, on an airplane, where he lives, he responds: ""right here"". Ryan ultimate goal in life differs from the typical American dream of building a family in a picket fence house – he wants to be the 7th person to reach the 10 million mile mark. He does not have a family, or even the intention to do so, he just wants to life his Up in the Air and do his job wherever it takes him. His ultimate dream is to be the ultimate rolling stone, an independent man who doesn't need anyone, because companionship means you can't life by yourself. He starts a relationship with Alex (Vera Farmiga) because they both, as she puts it, are turned-on by elite status and money. Their relationship might seem superficial, but what saves it from being just that, is that they both find themselves in the other person. She is Ryan's female counterpart, and they foil each other in a very unique way, bringing the best and the worst out of each other. Yet what makes this film magnificent is Anna Kendrick (who plays Natalie, Ryan's protégée in the termination company). She is a Cornell graduate who thinks she has live figured out by 23, and presents innovative ideas to the company that seem to make sense, but don't. If Ryan represents the intrepid entrepreneur who forgets his family because of wealth, and Alex his female counterpart, then Natalie is the Generation-Y equivalent of that. She is not interested in money or wealth in the same way Ryan and Alex are, but she is interested in having it all: the American dream, and the rolling stone dream of being independent. Being a generation-Y myself I know that the American dream doesn't work, but I can also tell that the wealthy independent entrepreneur doesn't either. Where does that live us then? Up in the Air tries to answer this question, while presenting character arcs that are both surprising and emotionally resonant, The three performances deserve the Oscar nominations they are going to get, and I can say that Anna Kendrick deserves the Oscar for best supporting actress. I haven't seen Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart yet (so I don't know if Clooney deserves the Oscar for best actor), but I have seen Precious, and although Mo'nique was extraordinary, it takes a different level of actress to sublimely act with such perfection. Their characters are people who mask their true identity in elegance and class, and when the mask melts away, that's when you see the true performance value of the actors. They don't only carry the movie along, but also make it a heartfelt comedy/drama (dramedy if you will) that resonates with everyone. It is the ultimate anti-capitalist film that is not really anti-capitalist, it's just capitalist. Jason Reitman also has the ability to mix music and dialogue to make it seem as realistic as these characters can be. He delivers his signature witty and sarcastic remarks to most of the character's interactions, and if you liked Juno or Thank you for Smoking, you will definitely like this film. Yet this film resonates more with a film like Sideways because of tone and themes, and it is no wonder the director pronounced Alexander Payne as one of his influences. Jason Reitman has established himself as one of the wittiest and realistic director's working in Hollywood, and this film proves it.What makes this film a 9/10 instead of a 10/10? Some scenes are too long and some are out of nowhere. This may be in regards to the theme of life just shaking your life around, but Reitman could have handled the timing of these scenes differently, and all of the scenes that are a little off are either in the first 20 minutes, or in the last. They seem to come out of nowhere, and more explanation to the characters actions before or after could have sufficed, but that is just my opinion. In the end, it's both an entertaining film that delivers comedy, romance and the drama we all need and speaks tons to both older and younger audiences. It is a film whose demographic is people 35+ but can talk wonders to people younger who think they have the world figured out and everything is in their hands. A great film with a magnificent cast that I recommend to everyone.http://mariofas.wordpress.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the year's best!,"My Take: An intelligent, down-to-earth dramedy with strong lovable performances and an intelligent script. One of the year's Best movies.Although it was his screenwriter Diablo Cody who got all the praise (and the eventual backlash) for his hit JUNO, director Jason Reitman deserves just as much praise for bringing that lovable quirky hit to life. Following the success of JUNO and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, his latest film UP IN THE AIR is yet another likable and clever story with a perfect balance of quirky humor and some relevant issues and real down-to-earth humanity. It's also one of the year's very best films and probably the year's wittiest comedy.I love a little mindless escapism as much as the next guy, but sometimes I just want to see a movie where a couple of down-to-earth human beings sit around ad talk to each other in the wittiest ways possible. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, whose job is to travel around the United States of America to fire people. Since his boss (Jason Bateman) and the company he works for is, as he described it, too cowardly to do it themselves. He enjoys the life on the open road anyway, and he's already used to living his life on his suitcase (he gives speeches regarding the subject). But just when he is about to reach 10 billion Frequent Flyer miles, his life takes a turn. He meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) he might possibly like intimately and his company finds a possible way to fire people via internet and therefore grounding him on Omaha for good.UP IN THE AIR is not just a another quirky comedy with a Capra-esquire premise and where the lead character is some guy whose been missing out on what's important in life, the characters here are real and relatable, and it's also a movie that is made at the right time where the issues and current events are still relevant. Released at the time America plummeted into economic recession, the issues in UP IN THE AIR are still hot and topical and the movie deals with it realistically instead of giving it the typical Hollywood dumbing-down. Reitman didn't just make a great film, he's made a great film on the right time.After being the first Oscar favorite upon release, I wonder why it couldn't have won at least one of the six Oscars it was nominated for. A win for Best Adapted Screenplay would have been deserving. Reitman's script (co-written by Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kirn) is loaded with wit as well as serious drama and some situations that feel like a reality slap. His movies, UP IN THE AIR among others, aren't just quirky comedies; they have this reality in them. Clooney gives one of his best performances (as is the talented Vera Farmiga, here at her spunkiest and most refreshing) while Anna Kendrick gives a career-making one as the newly-hired Natalie Keener. She's not in a lot of movies these days (she was in TWILIGHT), but after UP IN THE AIR, she's should expect a lot of them lining up. If JUNO acknowledged his presence in the movie-going public, his later films like UP IN THE AIR might just put his name on the map. Funny, quirky, but grounded in reality, UP IN THE AIR is another future minor classic alongside Reitman's successful ""little"" movie. By all means do not miss one of 2009 very best and smartest movies.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great drama with an equally great finale,"After getting a new and innovative colleague, a man whose job was to fire people is about to be grounded. As he spent most of the year traveling from company to company, the new situation was simply unacceptable, so he sets to show her how important his perspective is. Thus, a journey of self discovery begins, one which will put them into unexpected situations which might end up changing their perspective over their own life.It's a movie which brings an interesting plot, complex and pretty much unpredictable. Even if at its core it might seem simplistic, I can assure you that overall it's not. Although slow paced, it manages to bring fresh information into the equation most of the time, not leaving the viewer any chance to get bored. As we follow the main character's quest, multiple diverse and also interesting characters join the action, each of them influencing the protagonists one way or another.It features plenty of well thought dialog which brings sense to each sequence and also adds depth to everything that happens. It also manages to generate much drama through this simple mean of expression, making the experience one of a kind. Besides drama, the main focus turns to romance which is also pretty well thought, spicing things up from time to time. You also can expect some irony and even humor along the way; nothing impressive but its still worth mentioning. The artistic direction bring an important contribution by itslef, as it shows some unique angles and ways of presenting its events. The actors have managed to do a very good job, from the main cast to the supporting roles. Their involvement proves to be decisive in the outcome of this movie, bringing a plus to their characters with almost every occasion they get.There isn't much to say when talking about a very good movie like this one. It has a great story with excellent characters, very good dialog and also an unpredictable finale. It is by far the most impressive part of the movie, the one that shows how it manages to avoid stereotypes and go along its own way. It's a movie which you have to see in order to understand its message and also its value.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent stuff... Clooney is very good indeed!...,"I remember this film being critically acclaimed earlier this year, even winning some important nominations and picking up one or two awards. I hadn't realised that the director, Jason Reitman, also directed Juno, a favourite of mine from 2007. With all these coincidences, I had to give it a viewing when it came up on TV. I wasn't disappointed, it's pretty good but more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please wait in the VIP Executive Lounge while I write the next paragraph).Ryan Bingham has a job that means he is on the road a lot, well, when I say 'on the road' I mean up in the air, of course. He spends most of the year travelling from place to place terminating people's employment. Not the nicest job, I know, but one that he is very competent at. On the side, he also gives motivational lectures. During one of his trips he meets Alex Goran, an attractive woman who also has a job that entails a lot of air travel. Having compared notes, they get together and find there is some attraction there. Later, Ryan is called into the office and is told that the company he works for is looking at taking everyone off the road and replacing them with an impersonal internet-linked screen. He argues against it and ends up taking the inventor of the system, Natalie Keener, on the road so she can experience exactly how it works. The pair don't exactly hit it off at first, but soon develop a respect for each other. Ryan and Alex meet at various places across America and eventually Ryan asks her to accompany him to his sister's wedding. Will she go, and, more importantly, will this bring them closer? Well, I'm not going to tell you here I'm afraid, can't give too much away.This is a really well made gentle comedy that I found both endearing and quite engrossing to watch. All three of the main characters were very good, but I must pick out George Clooney, as Ryan Bingham, for particular praise. I thought he fitted the role perfectly! Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran and Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener were also both excellent.I really enjoyed this film, it made a nice change to see a modern film with characters that are so easy to relate to. I love the style that Jason Reitman uses; I find it quite relaxing with some great visuals and a tremendous script. Over all, it's one I will watch again and so, definitely recommended.My score: 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very Dramatic and Depressing,","Up in the Air is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is a pure drama that feels very real,which makes it very depressing,I know people who look at life the way these characters do which is mainly why I found it so upsetting.George Clooney delivers a brilliant performance,nothing like anything he's done before,he's certainly never played a character that was as vulnerable and open to their personality as this character was,I also really appreciated the performances of Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga.The movie also has a surprising twist at the end,it's not the kind of movie that I would expect there to be an unlikely plot twist,which really made me appreciate it more.Up in the Air is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama.When a man who makes a living firing people meets a pretty businesswoman,his philosophy on life falters.Best Performance: George Clooney",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This brilliant movie is social satire and screwball comedy in one,"""Up in the air"" was made in 2009, just after the financial crisis. I saw the film in 2020 amidst the Corona crisis. It is therefore no surprise that the film is still very topical.The film is a social satire on one side and a screwball comedy on the other. Director Jason Reitman has done both sides of the film brilliantly.The satire is embedded in the profession of main character Ryan Bingham (George Clooney). Company's can hire him to do their dismissal conversations. He calls himself a ""career transition consulatant"", and to be honest he is very good in his job, but you can also call him a ""social hitman"". He does not have a very high opinion about his clients (too afraid to bring the bad news themselves) but what is his opinion about himself? After all he does their dirty work. The brilliant thing is that the extra's playing the ""victims"" of Ryan are in part people who had really been fired not so long before the shooting of the movie.For his work Ryan is flying an awfull lot and effectively he is living in airplanes and business hotels. This does not bother him much because Ryan has a fear of commitment. This is were the screwball comedy comes in. A screwball comedy is a battle between the sexes and Ryan has to deal with no less than three women.His young colleague Natalie (Anna Kendrick) threatens his life on airports with her proposal to fire people in conference calls (Corona time avant la lettre). To prove that face to face contact is essential in their ""business"" he takes her on tour and there grows a relationship between the young colleague with theoretical knowledge and the more experienced colleague that you regularly see in detective movies.His sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) is going to marry, and (the preparations for) the wedding introduces Ryan to family life once again. The hotel in which he stays for the wedding is totally different from the sterile and interchangeable busines hotels he is usually staying in.Last but not least his fellow road warrior Alex (Vera Farmiga), with whom he falls in love, makes him longing for the family life he has just rediscovered.Director Jason Reitman omits the expected happy end, and rightly so. Ryan stays a working nomad, but if he is still happy about it remains the question.At the beginning of this review I noticed that ""Up in the air"" is still topical in Corona time. In 2020 Chloé Zhao with ""Nomandland"" also made a film about a working nomad, although this one is more at the bottom of the labor market.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exactly What Watching a Movie Should Feel Like,"It's late, really late; I just finished the movie and I simply couldn't sleep without writing a review for it. That's how good this is.We are introduced to Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who would be just another typical business man, except for the fact that this one works firing people. Traveling became his life, and to do so, he had to put family and relationships in second place. But that's all good for him, that's the life he always wanted. Then, we meet Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a young but wise woman who brings new ideas to the whole firing business. As expected, soon the two have to pair up and work together, and that's when the real fun begins.Their moments together are just great, and not only can make you laugh, but also make your heart beat faster. Not in a romantic kind of way, obviously, but with emotion. That's the whole point. She has to admit to herself that he has much more experience that she could ever have, and has to sit and listen, even though it's hard for her to do so, but for Ryan, a successful noble man, to do that exactly same thing can be even harder, and to watch him realize that there actually are a bunch of things that a young girl can teach him is a beautiful, touching journey.Also, Vera Farmiga's character couldn't be greater. She can make anyone who's watching look at women from another point of view, a strong one. Fierce. Add that with a little bit of plot twist and there you have it: a great persona.Not too slow. Not too long. Not tiring or pointless. This movie takes its time, and makes you feel. Not like most of the movies nowadays, this one can really make you think (and think again, and then one more time) about your whole life and who do you really want to be, what you really want to do. And I feel like that's the purpose of this story. Moreover, perfect dialogues, great acting.If you're looking for a movie with meaning, real meaning, you have it.""Do you want the can, sir?""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unbelievably horrible.,"This is a film full of characters that I absolutely despise in real life. I still watched it though, as I currently have no life and was reeeeeeally bored. Yes, I see the irony in that, as it is about people without a life laying other people off. This film is a self-fulfilling prophecy that way, as watching it will make its purpose come full circle. If George Clooney would have come up to me and said any line which he says in the movie, I would have punched him square in the face. You probably would have to out of reflex, if you have any dignity. Anna Kendrick's character acts like nothing but a helpless strumpet in this film, and Vera Farmiga's character is just bitter, uninteresting, hollow and miserable. There is nothing likable about any of these characters or even any of the environments they lay about in. Even the parties they go to in this film are miserable. I mean, the entertainment for the party is named Young MC. Who in the name of holy f*** would ever applaud anything called Young MC? They all talk like people I hate, they all look like people I hate and they all act like people other more consistent people usually would f*** in prison. There is nothing successful about these elitist misguided people. If I ever end up like one of them, I honestly pray to God that someone will throw me off a bridge. What in the lord's name is the point of this movie? Is it a warning? Is it the wake-up call George Clooney is referring to?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film has a realistic feel with idealistic tones,"Up in the Air deals with complicated emotions, relationships and people, yet still manages to keep a semi-lighthearted attitude. George Clooney plays the charming lead quite well (as usual) and Anna Kendrick's performance is right up there with the best of them. This film has a realistic feel with idealistic tones - I liked it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fresh, not Stale","Clooney tones it down for this exceptionally well-made film geared towards an issue many of us have experienced or soon will. Putting to the side the nature of the main character's work, he's taken on a whirlwind ride with a equally vivacious female (the wonderful Vera Farmiga). What matures from that is a slew of emotions, revelations, and finally head-on heartache. The film flows effortlessly, and with something interesting on screen at all times, it's never dull. I'll also give kudos to Ashley Greene playing a rookie exec who's quite confident, but she soons learns that work-life balance takes it's toll. Interesting characters and a modern plot spearhead one of the best movies of last year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two Big Thumbs Up In The Air!!,"Jason Reitmen creates History in 'Up In The Air', if this doesn't make up in the 'All-Time Best Of Hollywood', than I am ashamed to be a Cinema Fan.An adaptation of the 2001 novel by the same name, by Walter Kim, Reitmen and fellow- writer Sheldon Turners adapt it like wow! 'Up In The Air' is a film I enjoyed and as a die-hard Cinema-Fan, I am more than happy. It's a simple story told in the neatest manner ever! A film where words like 'Hiccups' or 'Minuses' don't exist. An Outstandingly Outstanding Film in all respects!Reitmen's direction is as good as it can be. He's a genius & his legendary body of work proves that. He's amongst the Best Storytellers today. Cinematography by Eric Steelburg is excellent. The music is amazing, 'Help Yourself' is an enlightening song!Acting wise, George Clooney is fantastic as Ryan Bingham. Playing a off-beat character with rare ease and understanding. Clooney is one of the few Star-Actors of Hollywood. Vera Farmiga is fabulous as usual. She's so so natural in all her films, she'll surely win an Academy Award soon. Anna Kendrick springs a surprise, she's flawless. Watch her in the sequence when starts to sob in a hotel reception, it's exemplary. Jason Bateman is good. Zach Galifianakis is mind-blowing in a cameo appearance. Sam Elliot does his usual bit in a that lone scene he gets.

One of the best of the year.,"Up In The Air My Rating: 10/10.Up In The Air is a film that celebrates life, the joys it brings and the happiness that can be achieved at the oddest times from the oddest of events. A rare film that evaluates life from different view points and the struggles it brings. George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham a man, no one with a career, wants to ever meet. His job? He works for a company that hires him out to other companies to fire their employees. No ones dream job except maybe for Ryan Bingham himself. He is on road, so the speak, two hundred and fifty days a year. He enjoys his non-committal life. No strings attached for Mr. Bingham. That is until he encounters a woman, Vera Farmiga, who travels just as much as he and could possibly be the woman of his dreams. He experiences feelings and times with her that he hasn't in quite some time. Along the way he also meets a new employee of his company, Anna Kendrick, who is looking to revolutionize the way his business works.Anna Kendrick plays Natalie Keener with the elegance of a veteran actress. It is nothing less than a star making performance which steps her out from her Twilight shadow, and shows that she can in fact play the game. Her stern, hard nosed and focused portrayal of Natalie is highlight of the supporting cast. There will be great things in this actresses future provided she makes the right choices.Vera Farmiga shows through her character, Alex Goran, what a true talent she is as well. She shines in her scenes and has chemistry to die for with Clooney. She is perhaps the most mysterious character of all leaving everything about her to the imagination, and leaving the viewer always wanting more of her. It isn't until the third act that we find out who she truly is and why she lives the same kind of life as Clooney's Bingham.Which brings us to Ryan Bingham. Clooney's range of emotions and depth is something yet seen in his illustrious career. Make no mistake about it, this is the highlight of his career thus far. His eyes tell the story of a lost man who has no clue how lost he really is. In the end it is his journey we don't want to see end. He is the reason we keep watching and hoping for a running time that never ceases.Jason Reitman's direction shows his true promise and the maturity he is developing as an artist. He never comes in too close nor does he stray too far back. His lens is always at just the right angle. His visual style is really coming into it's own here. I wait, excitedly, at what his future endeavors hold.Up In The Air is a film that can not be missed by anyone. A bright star in a wonderful year for film. Everything about it excels with brilliance. The entire supporting cast is spot on and it shows to be one of the best ensembles of the decade. A fitting film in this years Oscar race that deserves every bit of acclaim and all the accolades it is sure to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overrated,"I'm still trying to figure out what some reviewers think is ""great"" or ""masterful"" about this film. Literally, my first reaction after the film credits started to roll at the end was ""That sucked."" Sorry, there is no way this film deserves anywhere near an 8. I think I was being generous with my 4. I think as time goes on, the rating will correct itself and come down to a more accurate level that reflects this mediocre or below-mediocre film.In sum, the film is ""nothingness."" You keep thinking it's leading you somewhere, but...thud. Nothing. There is no depth, only disappointment. There is nothing to hold onto. Not even the ill-advised and out-of-place twist in the end can save this film. The acting is okay, but not superb, or at least not enough to save the film.I think the Academy or whoever chooses Golden Globe nominations and whatnot must just be enthralled with Clooney to award this film so many nominations, more than any other film. No way. It's not better than Avatar or Precious or the others. It's just not.Some reviewers seem to be endeared to the film because it reminds them of their own life or something. I think that skews their views. They purport this great ""depth"" that is just not there.Save your money. You WILL be disappointed with this film. No matter what you've heard.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two Thumbs Up (in the Air),"Jason Reitman's ""Up in the Air"" is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2009, if not the very best. That's something that took me by surprise since I was unimpressed by Reitman's last effort (""Juno"") and I find that George Clooney is an actor whose work I don't always care for. Nevertheless, this so-called 'recession-era' drama hits its mark with a sharp script and solid performances.The story revolves around corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a man who lives for the road and has built his life around the concept of eschewing close personal relationships. However, when he sparks a casual relationship with another frequent flyer (Vera Farmiga) he begins to consider whether or not he's chosen the right path. The other main thread of the story deals with a cost-cutting plan to haul the downsizers off the road, much to Bingham's chagrin. As a result, the plan's initiator, an eager graduate (Anna Kendrick), hits the road with Bingham in order to experience the sorts of things that can't be encapsulated in flow charts and slide shows.Clooney, Farmiga & Kendrick all landed Oscar nominations for their performances and I think that any one of them would have been a deserving winner. Clooney is perfectly suited to his role and Vera Farmiga makes a great match. Anna Kendrick also has wonderful interplay with Clooney in a completely different way. The supporting cast is pretty good as well, with a number of notable names showing up, including Jason Bateman straying a little from his usual comedic persona.Reitman's direction is routinely lively and attractive but it's his adapted screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner) that steals the show. It really should have won the Oscar but I guess the Academy felt otherwise. I should also note that the score/soundtrack is pretty good, too.Overall, ""Up in the Air"" is a fine film that makes me look forward to Reitman's next project. See it for the unique, engaging script and the trio of wonderful performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A touching and unique perspective,A very touching and uniquely different account of downsizing.

A Nutshell Review: Up in the Air,"Once in a long while comes a film that you'll tremendously enjoy because it engages on many levels through an extremely smart story, with wonderfully designed characters, and themes that you can easily identify with straightaway. Jason Reitman seems to be on a roll here, with Juno and Thank You For Smoking being great films that I've come to enjoy (particularly the satirical latter) and he delivers yet again with Up in the Sky.From time to time I dwell on the what-ifs of having being told to walk. Given the jittery economic climate the last few years, anything's really possible, and yes I've got to admit I've got a plan B set up, a dream that would be put into execution in the event I'm sitting across someone who's reading me the marching orders. Then again, why wait for something to happen before pursuing what one really wants to do? I guess it's what they call it as the comfort zone.George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man with an interesting job yet one which most people loathe - telling people that they're given the pink slips, and essentially that they're considered surplus and no longer required by their companies. He's a corporate down-sizer for hire, where companies with pussy managers hire his company's expertise, to do the marching orders on their behalf. Which means his type gets to travel frequently to where they are required, and in which case chalk up frequent flier miles by the thousands. In my opinion, not the bad job scope given being on the road most of the time (those who hate to live out of the suitcase need not apply), though one that has to come with plenty of EQ and sensitivity, since you're the harbinger of bad news, and have to face the brunt of mostly surprised employees being told their worthless.Which of course through the years Ryan would have formulated his game strategy to deliver the message softly, sugar-coating it all, and as an occupational hazard develops this fetish for plastic cards for convenience, miles and a major one being unable to hold down a stable relationship because of his nature of not always being around friends and family. And I actually share his attitude towards expectations that stem from relationships, preferring to be winging it alone rather than to surrender that sense of freedom, although time and again one might just feel the need to belong to somebody else. But of course we're not identifying with Ryan just because of his single status, but also because of the comical, quirky mantras he lives by in his jet setting career, offering some keen insights to the very rote manner in which he travels from plane to hotel and back again.Things are set for some change when his boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) gets smitten by some textbook cost cutting measures (which manager wouldn't?) presented by Ivy Leaguer Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), and hires her to execute her plan, involving the use of technology to remotely fire someone on the other end of the webcam. Of course this means the total disruption to Ryan's comfortable lifestyle, with a hint that it'll make them all redundant in due course, when the need for face to face interaction ceases, in what would be a totally impersonal, not to mention the lack of moral decency and respect for the staff one is about to let go.But because with any technological plans come the need to understand the process and the business in which technology will be employed, so Natalie gets attached to Ryan since she has zero real world experience being fresh out of college and all, and in showing her the ropes come more opportunity for comedy, as well as to dig deeper into the characterization. The best scenes of course come from their interaction, and the three way conversation that they have with Ryan's new found fleeting girlfriend, Alex (Vera Farmiga). when they touch upon the decisions one makes on relationships, whether it be willing to commit, or prefer to be free from the shackles of relationships and emotional routine.Ultimately, the film talks about the moral courage for changes to be made in one's life. We all get complacent in our zones of comfort, and can become quite the creature of habit, seeking solace in routine and things we're familiar with. Branching out isn't easy and comes with innate fear which we must overcome, sort of like the backpack motivational talks Ryan gives, where we tend to pile our life with so much junk that it's always hard to let go of things, to lighten our load, and find new meaning and adventure. And on the relationship front, one character finds himself falling into a relationship, while another finds herself getting out of one but not by choice, offering a nice little opposing parallel when put side by side.Up in the Air deserves every single accolade that it has won thus far, and surely this flies up into my initial shortlist of favourite films of the year. No prizes for guessing which movie I'm rooting for in this season's Oscar race for Best Adapted Screenplay for its incredibly well crafted story. Highly recommended, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you miss this on the big screen!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A work of art displayed,"You won't expect anything lesser from George Clooney. EVER! This movie is such a great mix up of inspiration as well as equally amazing layout. It depicts people at a stage of life that usually doesn't have any up-point. The period where you are 'Let go' off your duties in your firm, instating you to nothing but a despair of what could you have done to avoid it. Here comes 'Ryan Bingham', the expert in firing people for people, helping you transient through this stage. Another great piece of art displayed, was with Ryan's extraordinary speech sessions. 'Whats in the back pack?' elaborates what we need to do on daily basis to ensure that we move on, prospering. He puts our daily problems to be like weight, added into our backpack, ensuring we don't move. Now you know what the problem is, hence what you could do, is look out for how to let it go. ANNA KENDRICK is one of the cutest, and exceptional actress in Hollywood, and indeed the one with a bright future as well. She and Vera had put such a good show in this that made the film, fill out all the loop holes it could have. Vera being a free bird, was like an open relationship woman to Ryan. While Anna helped Ryan transient into the new generation of Firing people. Both had so extraordinary impact on Ryan, such that both being out of his life, made him suffer.A MUST WATCH!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nearly as good as you've heard,"VAGUE TONAL SPOILERS AHEAD.... ""Up in the Air"" is a terrific movie about a man who has gilded his fear of committing to others as a philosophy of remaining unencumbered. Two women in his life challenge him in very different ways, and the way his story plays out is surprisingly realistic and not at all what one usually gets from from films. Well acted, nicely directed (Reitman even lifts the junkie riffs of ""Requiem for a Dream"" for the main character's pack-one-bag fetish), superbly written. the film sags only in a couple of moments, and -- ironically -- its commitment to supporting characters could have been stronger, but this is still a fine piece of work and leaps and bounds ahead of Reitman's last film.

If you haven't.. you are missing out!,"There's a reason this was nominated so much, and won a lot of awards.George Clooney is, overall, one of the best actors at delivering the lines he is given. And when you give him good dialogue, and put him in an interesting setting.. he is going to deliver and elevate the whole thing.This is one of my favorite kind of movies, where you are introduced to a ""world"" or lifestyle you don't even know exists. Having a leading person show the ropes with their accumulated experience, advice and tidbits of how to traverse their familiar landscape.. which would be invaluable to someone that would otherwise be just thrown in to fend for themselves. Add to that already good foundation some food for thought, an interesting and even memorable message, and you have a good movie!It's very admirable to see a person live a life that's alien to most people. We can really do it all, although context usually forces us to anyway. Is it really freedom to have a lack of the usual suspects? Are we really missing out when we see someone do something we think would be ""cool"" to have a chance to do? As I said, food for thought.

More Than Expected,"Up in the Air is a romantic comedy at the core, and I'm the first guy to pass off a movie just because of this fact, but there is much more to this beautiful film. There are subtle comedic elements and in my opinion, very strong dramatic moments. All of the roles in this movie were very well played, including, if not especially, the characters who received one or two minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat predictable but the dialog and story make up for this slight flaw. Romance between Ryan and Alex is complex, depressing, and at times quite beautiful. George Clooney makes Ryan Bingham radiate with loneliness and his performance hit me right in the gut, as though I was staring at the dark side of my reflection. Though Up in the Air may seem like Hollywood crap, due to the overproduced looking cinematography and the romantic comedy feel, it is anything but. Please, go rent this movie, you'll be doing yourself a HUGE favor.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This girl is gonna go places.Jason Reitman does a fine job with his directing, it was fluid and clear between scenes.My only gripe is the final act, it suddenly became a ""romantic comedy"" ending and while it was done well, I was expecting a somewhat different outcome or a different way in handling the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Reminds me of books I was forced to read in high school; would read a couple of pages, then couldn't (for the life of me) remember what I just read...just like this movie. Very disappointed, considering the good reviews. I only know this: a good movie captures your attention, makes you think, makes you laugh, etc. A great movie, all the same, except you are also willing to watch it over and over again, no mater how many times you've seen it. With this movie, a Root Canal would have been more productive and, based on my insurance co-pay, cheaper too!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm not surprised Natalie and George nominated for Oscar..,"There are some kind of movies where is not a very important and vital problems of the society and people relationships showed. For example, Avatar, Transformers, Spiderman, Batman etc. Up In The Air of course is not from the line of such movies. Maybe, you could think that Batman is a fantasy and Up In The Air is a drama and their comparison is not right, but let's talk about a movie-not about the genres. Being a man who thinks that every movie, even if movie couldn't give to people as much as books, must make people a little happier and more experienced. Doesn't matter it's not your own experience. So let's talk about this particular movie with George Clooney. I liked his acting always, but he shouldn't play in movies like BURN AFTER READING. Because when he acts in movies like Up In The Air we all can how perfect actor he is. Movie is nice, easy and has a very deep meaning. I like such movies. Wish it'll get Oscar. Another few words is for Anna Kendrick whose performance unquestionably deserved Oscar nomination. I don't know whether she'll get or she's too young yet for it, but she deserved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ice Water For Blood,"Ryan Bingham is a corporate ax man (that is to say,he has the thankless job of firing people for various bosses that lack the nerve to do it themselves). Ryan really enjoys his job, all because he is a heartless bastard with ice water for blood (as the above mentioned),as well as the high class perks that his job supplies him with (he spends most of his time in planes,flying from job to job--hence,the title). Ryan is also something of a ""user"" of women,with no regard for settling down for a lifetime (he also has little use for his own family). Ryan seems to have it all down,pat. He is having a fling with a woman met on a connecting flight. He is also training a young novice in the wily ways of firing people,cold (""how do you sleep at night?"",asks one of his victims). Does a humbling experience,involving family members cause a (paradigm)shift in his realm of thinking? George Clooney takes the part he was obviously born to play,in this smart & well written drama, with some nice touches of comedy to lighten things up. Vera Farmiga is Alex Goran,the woman he is carrying on with. Anna Kendrick is Natalie Keener,a young,up & coming ax person,who is learning the ropes from Ryan (but obviously doesn't like Ryan much as a person,'tho does respect his position on firing some genuinely hard working people). Jason Reitman (director of such toothsome film fare such as 'Thank You For Smoking' & Juno',and son of director,Ivan Reitman,who also acts as one of the executive producers of this film)directs & co-writes the screenplay with Sheldon Turner,in a film with a touch of savvy. Other cast members include Jason Bateman (who's obviously redeemed himself from appearing in such fare as 'Teen Wolf 2')plays Ryan's boss,Craig Gregory,and if you don't blink,you'll spot Sam Elliot (several notches up from the sorry mess he last appeared in ['Did You Hear About The Morgans?]),as an airline pilot,patterned after Capt.""Sully"" Sullenberger,who saved the passengers & crew by crash landing that flight in the Hudson River last year.

George Clooney Flying Sky High!,"George Clooney gives the performance of his career. Stepping aside from smooth, suave characters he always portrays, he delivers a much more down-to-earth and very believable, and very human, performance as Ryan Bingham. The supporting cast, particularly Oscar nominees Vera Farminga and Twilight's Anna Kendrick, provide superb back-up and contribute to making this movie such a pleasurable experience very nicely indeed. Jason Reitman does a superb job behind the camera and brings this movie the class and attitudes it needs. The characters are very engaging and you do sympathise with Clooney's Bingham from all the loneliness he goes through. Without a doubt, this is best movie of the year, and most likely will be for the rest of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""How much does your life weigh?""","When I first mentioned my interest in seeing Jason Reitman's latest film, a friend swiftly dismissed it as ""one of those intellectual movies."" It isn't really. 'Up in the Air (2009)' is an affable, unpretentious look at life in today's fast-moving society, lighthearted for the most part, but pointedly dramatic when it counts. I must confess that I haven't seen 'Thank You for Smoking (2005)' or 'Juno (2007),' so I can't offer an auteurist perspective. However, the film's pleasantly- wistful approach reminded me of another good recent comedy/drama, 'Dan in Real Life (2007).' Both films explore the yearnings of an older man for an emotional connection in his life, though the screen personas of Steve Carell and George Clooney could hardly be farther apart. 'Up in the Air' displays Clooney at his most suave, gliding through a gleaming world of spotless airport terminals and glossy credit cards, a disconnected lifestyle of sterility and emotional emptiness.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) has spent most of his life in the air. His daily routine involves flying endlessly across the United States, firing people who he's never met, and will never meet again. He thrives on single-serve friendships (if I may borrow from 'Fight Club (1999)'), and feels empty if he's grounded for more than a few days. Ryan is estranged from his family, and never engages in romantic relationships beyond the occasional sexual fling with fellow frequent-flyers like Alex (Vera Farmiga). We expect Reitman to thoroughly condemn this lifestyle, but his approach is double-edged. In modern society, particularly given Ryan's difficult occupation, there's something sincere about the city- hopping lifestyle. Even among those like Natalie (Anna Kendrick), who would prefer to remain permanently grounded, technology acts as a barrier to genuine human interaction: partners break up via SMS, employees are fired over the internet (even when sitting in the next room).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Reitman is back, but this time he's pointing the camera at grown-ups","Jason Reitman's tale of corporate downsizing is bound to strike a chord with moviegoers in our modern recession and was released at the perfect time. However, unlike most topical films, which tend to slide into obscurity after their time in the limelight, I feel 'Up in the Air' will be remembered as a timeless classic which can really reach out to anyone. All three leads (George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick) are breathtaking in their character roles, each carrying a sense of enigma affixed with their own goals and expectations for love and life, and as always each is compromised along the way. The relationship between Clooney and Farmiga has incredible chemistry, and Kendrick's conjunction of professionalism and idealism was handled perfectly.Though most of the dialogue is infused with that quick wit you can always expect from Reitman films, this movie really proves to be one of the most devastating and heavy films of the year. It perfectly embodies the journey of middle-age angst just as 'Juno' represented the indifference of smart-ass teenagers. Just like 'Juno', though, it is more likely appeal more to the age group it is depicting.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
'Up in the Air' Captures America,"Up in the Air is a throwback of sorts to the classic Hollywood films of yesteryear. The dynamic banter between Ryan and Alex is reminiscent of classics like It Happened One Night. And of course like the old Hollywood pictures Up in the Air is a star vehicle led by the last real movie star in George Clooney.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends 95% of his life sucking recycled oxygen 10,000 feet above the ground surrounded, yet entirely alone. He is a corporate assassin leased out to cowards that cannot let go of their own employees. Ryan's life is in a suspended state of animation much like all of the travelers stuck in airports this past week. That is until he meets his equivalent in Alex (Vera Farmiga) they recognize they're essentially the same souls almost instantly with Alex even teasing him with, ""think of yourself, with a vagina."" Ryan Bingham is an oddity in film. He is only at home swiping cards, earning mileage points, and avoiding his one bedroom apartment in Omaha. All of his connections are only surface deep and he seems better off for it. He knows what he has and appreciates the freeness from baggage.Jason Reitman's latest effort feels like a spiritual sequel to Thank You for Smoking with both films being reflective satires on the present state of America. In 2005 Smoking focused on advertising and spin-control, at that point a burgeoning evil quickly becoming acceptable to America. Up in the Air turns it gaze to Natalie (the charming Anna Kendrick, who debuts incredibly in her non-Twilight career), a newly attached sidekick to Ryan by his douche boss Craig (Jason Bateman), and her revolutionary web-chat firing system that allows you to fire someone at will without the mess of dealing with them afterward.A funny, yet serious look at the way corporations justify immoral behavior and then apply their rationalizations with sub-par logic. But more importantly the effects and culture of a recession. Bingham is not the one to be sympathized with, we are.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Movie,"Rating: 9.0
Overall, a well written movie that has a very memorable performance from George Clooney as we get to see him navigate the subject matter in a very captivating way in order to show how striving for success and unattainable goals can lead to loneliness, though it does feel restricted by the tone and storytelling as it makes the movie feel a bit dated from the time.Very Good Direction (Really gets the most out of his scenes and uses his actors well to help drive the plot forward, though it is a bit safe in its storytelling (just a nature of the type of movie he was making)), Pretty Good Acting (Great from George Clooney (Really commands all the scenes he is in and uses his natural suave and charm to play the character (which was probably written for him)), Very Good from Vera Farmiga (Acts as the real match for Clooney's character (as a somewhat foil) to show how lonely his lifestyle is as he is chasing his goal), Good from Anna Kendrick (Plays the smart, yet naive character well as her scenes with Clooney build chemistry throughout the movie), Pretty Good from Jason Bateman, Pretty Good from Danny McBride, Pretty Good from J. K. Simmons, Pretty Bad to Decent from the rest of the cast (The characters with higher billing were fine but the more minor/extra characters (like those being fired) were very inexperienced and unnatural)), Very Good Story (The story was laid out nicely with overall concept being very interesting, though the movie does kinda drag a bit in the end with its plot and dealing with the main conflict of love and purpose), Great Screenplay (The dialog flowed very naturally and was very clever and whity (with the jokes being funny despite it being very feel-good); the symbolism is very present and shows a lot about how chasing success can lead to loneliness and loss of purpose; the foreshadowing was good and helps tie ends together at the end), Pretty Good Score/ Decent Soundtrack (Very feel-good and tied to rom-com movies of the time (which shows its age)), Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Good Editing (Though a bit simplistic), Plot Structure was laid out decently well with the the rising action really being a great part of the movie as we see how Clooney's character interacts/sees the world (as he masks his own problems); the 20 minutes up to the climax (the wedding part of the movie) does drag a bit and could have been cut a little (though it is necessary to show the relationship he has was Farmiga's character; ending is a bit abrupt), Pacing was a good steady pace up until the last 40 minutes where it gets very slow and then very fast (the runtime could have been kept the same but maybe redistribute this part out a bit to make it more balanced), Climax was good as it has many twists and turns to show the true nature of Clooney's character's life (and the direction he wants to now go), Tone was very feel-good/Rom-Com which was very good for the time and suited the movie well (but just causes it to be restricted in what it can portray and makes it feel very dated to similar movies of the time)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Personal Touch Matters...,"In a year that has been filled with anticipation surrounding 3D epics and generic disaster movies such as '2012' and 'Avatar', it was refreshing change to see an honest film which tells the story of one dysfunctional man and his rather alternative and shallow take on life. George Clooney's performance was the best I have seen from him in a while, and whilst his character was not always the most likable I found it very easy to engage with him. A particular highlight for me was his narration in the beginning of the film and his lectures which feature throughout. The most important aspect of the performance is that we see the characters love for the life that he leads and the pride that he takes in the work that he does.Granted this movie may not make its way into history, but in the current global economic climate the subject matter is very close to the heart of all of us. One particular highlight is the use of real people who have lost their jobs in this recession being used as actors and talking about their experiences at the end of the film. This gives the film that you have watched a whole new depth of meaning and is a credit to Reitman's personal touch that are familiar with from 'Juno'.Relationships are also a key feature in this film, particularly the one between Clooney and Anna Kendrick. The dynamic and chemistry between the two is always intriguing and for much of the film I was not sure who was teaching who, but Clooney eventually shows her that the personal touch is what is important. It was almost as if Reitman was sending a message to other directors such as Roland Emmerich, and showing them the quiet dignity of the smaller things in life.Overall the film is well directed and the screenplay is good enough to keep you gripped without demanding too much from the cast, despite a great performance from Clooney himself. Other than that there is a small but solid performance from 'Jason Bateman' of 'Arrested Development' fame, I still eagerly await a good leading man role from him.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Air Reitman scores high!,"I will try to downsize this review of a downsize flick in less than 500 words. I am up for that even though I probably will not be able to pilot that task. Writer-Director Jason Reitman's ""Up In The Air"" is already airing it out as probably the best reviewed film of the year. Hope Reitman still stays grounded with all the Award accolades he will be receiving very soon. I am sure he will; because of his humbleness and mindset is one of the main reasons why ""Up In The Air"" is extrairdonaire! George Clooney stars in ""Up In The Air"" as a certified airhead who is always daydreaming throughout his day. Kidding! OK, to pilot this plot properly: Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who spends most of his time traveling from city to city firing away downsizing bullets by informing employees of corporations that ""their services will no longer be needed"". Bingham has an innate talent in his corporate executions in a way that it does not demean the employee, even through all the grief & anger they go through when they hear the news. Bingham does not seek comfort in completing such a task, but that is what he specializes in. He does seek comfort in living the solitary jet-set life of business travel. He also obsesses on obtaining an ultimate frequent-flyer mileage zenith goal, not for the perks but for the experience. Bingham's ""one man is an island"" life has left him still single at middle-aged with no children, but Mr. Bing would not have it any other way. Not to say he is shy and reserved, because he does possess the gift of gab. Example: On occasion, he is hired as an independent contractor to conduct ""What is in my backpack?' presentations in business seminars on prioritizing what & who is important in one's life. Other Example: He also does air out the lothario muela by meeting and bedding beautiful & intelligent women during his city stops; which by the way this is a good segue to introduce the character of Alex to all of you. Alex becomes ""Ryan's Hope"" of meeting the female version of him. She shares many of the same qualities & preferences as Ryan and also strives on living a corporate traveler lifestyle. Their connecting banter at the hotel bar where they first meet is of screenplay supremacy. Let me now stopover to Natalie. No, she is not another Bingham bang. Natalie is a novice employee of the Omaha ""downsizing services"" corporation where Ryan works. She is chatty, motivated, and straight out of college. She convinces the corporate boss Craig Gregory to consider making some technological revolutionary ""downsizing"" moves to cut cost corners. That would be for all the employees to do the axing over teleconferencing instead of city-to-city travel. Of course, Ryan loathes the idea and puts his two-cents why that would be disastrous, not to mention will also entirely change his life and keep him grounded in the republic of Non-Mutual to Omaha. In order for Natalie to obtain more hands-on and personal experience, Gregory decides to have sex with Natalie. Oops, wrong review, that was from my 1994 film review of ""Disclosure"". What I meant to say that Gregory decides for Natalie to shadow Ryan during a tour-of-axing duty in order to obtain that experience. And that becomes the lesson learning plight for both Ryan & Natalie in ""Up In The Air"". Juno that with his masterful directorial piloting of ""Up In The Air"", Jason Reitman has heightened himself to ""up in the list"" as one of the most sought out directors in the industry. His timely depiction of the downsizing humane horror was upsized with precision and authenticity in ""Up In The Air"". Also, his ""non-crash landing"" of the film's ending was unpredictable by cinematic nature. Reitman and co-writer Sheldon Turner also developed a sky-high clever screenplay. The last act of my ""Up In The Air"" review before landing is on its stellar acting. I could not visualize anyone else than Clooney to fit the Bingham bill. By George, could it be another Oscar for George? Could someone already give Vera Farmiga the kudos she deserves? The veritas is that Vera continues to excel with her acting but most average moviegoers have never heard of her. Farmiga was pitch perfect as Alex, and I will ""farmiga"" those Academy voters' offices if they do not give her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Anna Kendrick was a nice revelation as Natalie, but not yet in the ""calling the shots"" acting category. However, Kendrick is one little actress with a big future. Jason Bateman took command of his role as honcho Gregory. I am glad that Reitman did not ax and still had room to include commendable brief supporting roles by Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons as downsizing victims. Hey, I even enjoyed Danny McBride's performance as Ryan's sister's fiancée ""cold feet"" groom. ""Up In The Air"" is a first-class film, that is worthy of some frequent viewer mileage. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was a real delight,"Up in the Air follows the life of Ryan Bingham, a corporate hatchet who loves his life on the road.

It is like a mix of road movie with comedy and drama with a story that captivates, a plot perfectly developed, various locations with beautiful landscapes and a soundtrack you really enjoy throughout the movie. The movie has a slow paced rhythm but that doesn't mean it turns out to be a boring movie, in fact it keeps you interested for almost 2 hours.

Meticulous Film-Craft,"Up in the Air is a hard movie to classify. I think the best I can do is say that this it is a drama with comedic elements, but not what we would call these days a ""dramedy."" Be careful calling this a romance of any kind. George Clooney (Batman: The Worst One) brings his charismatic A-Game to Jason Reitman's film and gets help with brilliant supporting turns from Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga (whom I raved about in Orphan).Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, an elite business-class frequent flier who also dabbles in motivational speaking. Bingham's full-time employment is as a for-hire executioner that companies come to to do their dirty work during these hard economic times. Bingham travels away from ""home"" 300 days a year due to this job and logs over a quarter of a million frequent flier miles annually.Due his on-the-go lifestyle, Bingham has developed a personal philosophy about life, relationships, etc. that is something like a mash-up between Buddhist non-attachment and the juvenile Ayn Rand superman. Bingham's life is a stop-over of one night stands; carry-on luggage; hotel and airline executive privileges; and avoiding everyone that is not himself — including his family. Probably only George Clooney could pull off playing such a jerk and still come across as likable. This approach to life is also the one that Bingham pimps during his side job of motivational speaking.Ann Kendrick is fresh from college upstart Natalie Keener who is hired by Bingham's company to revolutionize the axe-for-hire business. In short she wants to take the terminators out of the air and put them in a seat to do the deed by video conferencing. Bingham disagrees with the change and brings up enough points that his boss (Jason Bateman) decides to send Keener to the skies with Bingham to learn how to tweak her program pursuant to real life experience.The last ingredient in this would-be-Oscar recipe is Vera Farmiga as Alex Goran. I have only seen Farmiga previously in the sleeper hit horror movie, Orphan, this past summer. I was stunned by how excellent she was in that movie playing the distressed and maligned mother. I made a note to myself to keep an eye out for her in this film. I did and she did not disappoint. Alex is Bingham's foil. What he does – she does; from non-attachment selfishness and one night stands to valuing airline and hotel rewards as priceless commodities. The two engage in amusing banter the first time they share the screen and the potent chemistry never lets up from that point on.The movie is built around several layers of character interactions: Bingham and Natalie as he shows her the ropes and, as unlikely as it would initially appear, the human side to what he does; Bingham and Alex as they explore a completely casual relationship amidst constant plane-hopping that may be growing, against Bingham's will, into something else; Natalie and her growth from young gun for hire to an actual human; each of the character's respective relationships with their family; and the lives of all three against the back drop of the corporate world in times of fiscal turmoil.There is more to Up in the Air than just that, but I would be ruining some of the nice work with character arcs and the subtly of some of the allegorical moments if I went into it much deeper. I will say that scenes at Bingham's sister's wedding and when Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick share the screen are sublime*.*This includes an awesome cameo and performance by (not so) Young MC. Bust a move.I personally delighted in the complete deconstructing of the third act of the film and its opposition to derivative formula. The end result is what makes Up in the Air such a hard movie to label. It's not what you think.I also found it interesting that Clooney's Ryan Bingham is not the biggest jerk in the film. The fact that he is not — and who actually is — is a stunner.Up in the Air is a meticulously crafted film with few or no flaws. However, though it reaches to a slightly deeper level than one may expect, it still lacks resounding profundity. That simply means that Up in the Air is the best film it can be, but it is not the best film of the year. Each of the main three performances, however, do merit some discussion come awards time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Whatever your place in life, this will have you dreaming & wondering if you're living the life you wanted or is there something else to take you on a different track?

Finding Levity,"With only 3 feature films under his belt, Jason Reitman has developed a unique cinematic language for his own interesting voice; unlike his father (Ivan Reitman, most renowned for the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise), he is less interested in big-budget blockbuster film-making, and more passionate about intimate tales that turn their characters inside-out. His Awards-hungry ""Juno""--while not a perfect film by far--established a teenager who was by turns arrogant, callous, and clearly unaware of the grownup responsibility that came with her pregnancy; by the end of the film, however, it was clear that she had undergone a series of epiphanies and personal discoveries that not only forced her to confront the reality of her situation, but transformed her character into something heart-wrenchingly believable. The same finely nuanced character development occurs in ""Up in the Air"": George Clooney (who comes across as a close cousin to Aaron Eckhart's character in Reitman's debut, ""Thank You for Smoking"") plays a corporate shark/motivational speaker, who, by his own admission, spends only 40 days at his Omaha apartment out of the year; the rest of the time, he is boarding endless flights around the country, firing workers on behalf of companies who don't have the brass to do it themselves. Initially, Clooney's character comes across as an arrogant gloss on Michael Clayton, and is very hard to like (there is a palpable coldness to the way he and fellow jet-setter Vera Farmiga ""bond"" over frequent-flyer miles and online itineraries); it is only after meeting plucky-yet-emotionally-fragile Anna Kendrick (the brainchild behind an depersonalized online method of firing workers en masse) that Clooney undergoes a change in attitude, going from a man who loves to be surrounded by people without actually connecting to anyone, to a man who realizes that he might be missing out. Reitman, who co-wrote the script with Sheldon Turner, lets the image speak for itself: while the characters are clearly works of fiction (and contrived in their own ways to meet the script's needs), the snap of their dialog and shared experiences seldom rings less than true. By its ambiguous close, ""Up in the Air"" has gone from a study of alienated (and alienating) people to a near-revelation in how we, as human beings, disconnect from one another without even knowing it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

During most of the movie he flys from town to town with this girl and tries to show her THE ROPES. There is a great scene toward THE END with Sam Elliot where he is some kind of CAPTAIN. It was a strange scene because GEORGE reached 10 million miles. As a reward, the captain of the airplane left the COCKPIT and sat down next to George. That CAPTAIN was played by SAM. He had a huge mustache and the conversation he was making with GEORGE seemed strange and forced. It was very strange to see him. In fact, he looked like he was made out of plastic.

Sure there is a romantic element to the story and it plays a vital role in the film but it isn't a smothering love story full of such clichés as long walks on the beach and romantic candlelight dinners. Up In the Air is a story about a man who thinks he has it all figured out, until he realizes that perhaps he does not, or maybe he did after all.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) fires people. When companies want to outsource the unpleasantness of terminating large numbers of employees they call his boss and he is on a plane to the next city to dish out the bad news. Bingham loves his life on the road, in a different city every night, no ties to hold him back, just him, his carry on, and his miles. He even makes it a point to occasionally give motivational speeches to groups about the virtues of his spartan lifestyle. With nothing to weigh him down he is totally free. Everything is fine until a new hire at his firm, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), proposes a bold plan to utilize video conferencing to fire people instead of doing it in person. Bingham detests the idea as it will completely turn his life upside down so in a desperate attempt to sabotage the plan he convinces his boss to send young Alex out with him into the field to learn about the business she is about to destroy.What follows is a wonderful example of a character driven movie. With each scene we get so see a little bit more of Ryan Bingham and how his relationships, or lack thereof, have shaped his life and molded him into the man he is. Clooney is determined and confident but not ruthless or arrogant, he is likable, competent, and he has sort of a zen thing going on with his life philosophy. Later in the film he starts to perhaps have some second thoughts about his take on things and watching the character grow on screen is a real pleasure. I won't give away the ending but I will say that it is not all sunshine and lollipops like so many Hollywood films are. Up In the Air is a serious film that is presented in a manner that makes it light, funny, and enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Story Well-Told,"Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, BURN AFTER READING), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga, THE DEPARTED) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. ""Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships."" But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated. Even though he's been a complete butthead most of his life.This is a story with no special effects. No tricks. And it pulls no punches. It's just a great story well-told. I loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thin Air,"I fail to get enthusiastic about 'Up in the Air'. It may be because corporate life is no strange thing to me, it may be because romantic comedies or professional dramas are not my piece of cake, it may be because I was starting to develop so high expectations about George Clooney that seeing a film where he is just good, and not better than in a previous one comes as a disappointment.Or maybe it is the subject. Firing people from their jobs ('terminating' them as the euphemism goes in this film) is no laughing matter and even if it was unavoidable that it becomes subject to a major movie some day, the intermingling of this theme with a few other (like life of the big corporate travelers addicted to their frequent fliers programs, or the romantic theme of the eternal bachelor facing mid-life crisis and catching the opportunity to make a change towards the conventional track) did not really work to me. The story of corporate job terminator Bingham (Clooney) facing the termination or at least radical change of his own job because of the appearance in his own company of rookie Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who tries to revolutionize the business endangering his jet style of life while his personal life seems to be at pick when he meets his female mirrored image in Alex (Vera Famiga) combines several conventional threads, and cannot make out of the combination an original movie.I do not have anything special to say about what director Jason Reitman does for most of the time - he does a fair job but having Clooney in the lead role is like coaching a soccer team with Messi in the opening squad. Actually Clooney although well cast does not do anything special, he just plays his own role - enough for a good performance, disappointing if we consider how well he changed skins in most of his films lately. Famiga is OK, and only Anna Kendrick succeeds to break the ranks and to bring to skin an emotional ingénue which crosses the screen in a sincere interpretation.The best part of the film are the one shot scenes of people being fired. It is here that Reitman had his touch of genius. He put an add in a St. Louis newspaper and gather real people who lost their jobs recently, and enacted their feelings and emotions in the moments when they received the hit for the camera. These are the moments when we feel the true life, these are the scenes when we can understand the dramas that take place at the personal level, part of the bigger picture drama of the economic crisis that engulfed America. This is actually the best cinema in this film, the rest is just Hollywood wrapping.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"While my backpack is light, this film certainly has plenty of weight behind it...","In a world where everybody is looking to hook up and 'not die alone', Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his flyaway fling Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) are the exception to this life-long rule. However when Bingham must show the young and naive Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) how his no-strings philosophy on life has improved his relationship with his job at CTC – we hire, you fire – he begins a journey which takes him - the man who has flown endlessly almost everywhere - into unknown airspace. Oh and then there's the business of reaching a select number of air-miles... Jason Reitman's (Thank You For Not Smoking, Juno) 'Up In The Air' takes a long-hard look at a life which thrives on loneliness and how this affects the relationships around him. It's mildly amusing, touching at times, and a definite Awards contender thanks to the fantastic performances from the three main lead characters.Ryan Bingham has worked for years at CTC, a company which makes its money straight from the mouth of corporate greed. When a company management official hasn't got the spine to release an employee, they draft in CTC who send over somebody that can. But they do simply more than tell the employee that they have ten minutes to vacate the property, they attempt to ferry them across to a new avenue in the most fragile moment of their lives. (Beautifully appropriate, considering the recent devastating economic recession throughout the world and the rise in unemployment). Bingham lives for, and in, the air. He travels city-to-city firing employees while also hoping to give them a nudge down the right path. The only human connection he develops is with Alex, a fellow flight-hopper, who is the female equivalent of Bingham. She's strong, sexual woman who has plenty of air-miles. Yet, his idyllic life is put under the microscope when he must show the young, vivacious and ruthless CTC member Natalie Keener how to live your life constantly on the move. Curiously, and with a hint of pity Natalie asks Bingham as they walk through to the airport security station; ""Don't you ever get lonely?"" To which he replies, ""Lonely? I'm surrounded by people everywhere I go.""George Clooney's central performance as Ryan Bingham, the man who lives his life avoiding commitment as a philosophy, is simply sublime. He lives his life on a schedule, just like the airlines he flies with, and this schedule leaves no time for others. Bingham is a man who is afraid of commitment and by flying for almost three-hundred and twenty days every year this allows himself to leave as little time as possible for social interaction. Social interaction, friendships, mortgages and even marriage are just another pointless blockade for this man who believes that the best way to live the ride of life itself is by carrying around an empty backpack – as this cannot weigh you down. Following Clooney, both Anna Kendrick (Natalie) and Vera Farmiga (Alex) both give equally engrossing performances as the two strongest female influences in this lonely high flyer's life. Alex is Ryan's match and the closest thing he has to a potential 'love-interest' – not that he believes in the notion of love. While Natalie becomes Bingham's closest connection to humanity, despite putting up a strong front, she is built like the majority of other human beings; with a soft, sticky, fragile centre.Coupled with the great on-screen performances, Reitman also hits the right note with both his direction and his adapted screenplay (which he began writing in 2002) of Walter Kirn's original novel. Reitman employs the combination quick cuts and close-up shots of the menial aspects of Bingham's life, such as the movement from his apartment to the check-in desk at the airport. These activities may be appreciated by those that have never flown before, or have only done so a few times before, but for a man that has clocked up 350,000 air-miles in the previous year; they are nothing but a minor inconvenience to a man who loathes an establishment without a queue for priority members. While the adapted screenplay script provides a concentrated balance of amusing comedic moments, and clever, entertaining drama which in turn creates a very enjoyable film. Quirky, funny, emotional, and thought-provoking dramas certainly seem to be Jason Reitman's forte at this moment in time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
shows the increasing personal detachment of our modern society,"Very slick film satire that tells a lot more about increasing personal detachment and heartlessness in the modern workplace than how companies do anything possible to avoid any unpleasantness associated with firing workers, although it did show the latter to nearly the most disgusting level possible. I did not like the movie's subject at all, but that huge negative alone should alert any critic to be very careful to make sure the story negative does not taint an honest review of the total film. This is a crummy topic told and shown well in this film and should be seen as much for its satire of craven human heartlessness and shallowness as much as for its entertainment value. My hope is that the former will teach you more than the latter.George Clooney, that smiling charmer, did a wonderful job as Ryan the star terminator, contract-firing everyone in sight while showing that selfish, facile, shallow and a big smile do the best work in a dirty and dully repetitive job(involving lots of full airports)that most people would avoid like the plague, and one that would quickly emotionally execute anyone with real human feelings. Anyone like Ryan who would say that firing is a prerequisite for possible world fame and power later is surely unclear on the emotional concept at least, but for Ryan it made it almost a plus to get fired as now the really big things in a person's life could begin! The old switcheroo gets them every time! Huh, what?But, when Ryan finds that his company plans to initiate video-termination(hey, a new video game?)instead of flying contracted people around to do that dirty job in person, he gets angry(maybe for the first time in his life? Remember, he's shallow)and expresses his disapproval but also his willingness to show them it won't work which he does with a vengeance. Along the way he gets to give a smarty-pants and uppity company newbie her comeuppance, find a hot but morally vacant female counterpart to play with for a while, and in the end get to continue what he does for a living as if nothing ever happened. From what I've seen of life, nothing really does happen in life to change shallow and emotionally bankrupt people like Ryan. And, we have all known some, and more's the pity for that unpleasantness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great story,"An excellent dramedy with unexpected ending. George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick they're all awesome",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jason Reitman Is Becoming One Of My Favourite Directors,"George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a guy who has distant himself from family and friends. So much that he is a motivational speaker about only caring about things that really matter, or that can fit in your back pack. His job requires him to fly around the country firing people. Once this young hot shot girl comes along, she brings with her technology, a computer that makes it easier to fire people from the comfort of your own office. No more expensive flights for those guys like Bingham flying around firing people, this obviously causes a problem for him.I always thought that the success of Juno was more because of Reitman than Cody, yet she was the one who got all the accolades. Both Juno and Thank You For Smoking are hilarious films with heart and are competently directed from Reitman. Both contain dark humour and themes (smoking/teen pregnancy) and yet they never cross that line of bad taste. Up In The Air is a welcomed addition and it follows the success and hilarity of Reitman's previous two films. Up In The Air is not my favourite Reitman film, that would be Thank You For Smoking, but it's his most mature work and it shows us that if he is this good now, what he has to deliver in the future will be marvelous.Clooney is the lead, he has numerous plastic cards in his wallet for just about everything. Airlines, rental cars, hotel suits - he never throws them away, which comes back to hurt him when he has to try 3 or 4 of them before finding the right hotel room key. He meets Alex, played by Vera Farmiga, she is exactly like Ryan, the only difference between them, according to her, is that she has a vagina. Clooney belittles the new girl Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, who brings in new technology, but is inexperienced in the 'art' of firing people. Or in their words, letting people go so they can make an easier transition to another stage in their lives. Jason Bateman, who is Clooney's boss, forces him to take the new girl under his wing on some firing trips, before they install these new computers. It's not a sexual relationship at all, it's more of a mentor and student relationship. Clooney and Farmiga have a purely sexual relationship, until Clooney starts to fall for her and must re-evaluate his life.Along the way he must take a cardboard cutout of his sister and her fiancé, you know ""like that French gnome movie"", funny Amélie reference. Natalie begins challenging all of Ryan's beliefs in life. The chemistry between the two is not only funny, but it feels real. A father figure, for her when she needs to learn about life, in her job and relationships. The romance between Clooney and Farmiga is genuine and depressing. I was able to predict some things from the film, but the way it unfolds mixes the reality of the character's lonely life into the comedic elements of the film. The film balances both of these pretty well and it never weighs one over the other.As mentioned before Bateman is Clooney's boss, his role is not as funny as some would expect from him, given his resume, but he does well. As does everyone else, Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons have bit parts as two employees who lose their jobs. Clooney falls into the role perfectly, he's a normal guy with elite status. He thinks he's better than others, but he doesn't have to think it. He by passes people in lines waiting to buy their tickets, argues the best place to rent a car for luxury and he has a number in mind that he wants to reach in regards of miles flown. If he gets that number, he gets another card to add to his wallet.Up In The Air is funny in subtle ways and respectable in others. It's story is depressing, especially for these times, but Reitman and Co. manage make it lighthearted. This is probably one of my favourite Clooney performances, he's sly and cool and makes people like him when we should despise such a character. The film is enjoyable and will be recognized come Oscar time. I expect to see the performances being rewarded with nominations and I hope to see Reitman get another one. As I said earlier, if his first three films give any indication as to what his future career will be like, then I'm going to be enjoying all of his films.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
