I don't understand the disdain for this.,"Other than Crowe's singing (which isn't terrible), the musical absurdities (which is just a wavelength thing), & its extreme sincerity (which I consider a strength), it's pretty unimpeachable. There are so many powerful moments: Do You Hear?, Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, the battle on the garbage barricade, etc...and, of course, I Dreamed a Dream. Say what you will about Hathaway being a bit much at times; she was put on this earth to perform that scene.",8.0,Anonymous,History
They sung it live...,"I could listen to the sound track all day, everyday. And this is my favorite cinematic production.Tom Hooper did a great job as director of a powerful star studded cast and Danny Cohen as cinematographer.This production carry's me to Victor Hugo's epic imagination based on the reality of life during his lifetime, imprinted on our extraordinary literary accomplishment-a timeless classic surviving over 150 years... as well all the previous theatrical and cinematic productions since 1984.The optics are an enthralling cinematic accomplishment capturing the sung live scenes... and the actors all out effort to make this as true to the emotional turmoil of a horrendous life in early 18th century Paris; all the begotten injustices on the very fabric of humanity's birth right for freedom- known later as The Birth of Enlightenment.Anne Hathaway sings ""I DREAMED A DREAM"" with a definitive voice of a dying woman elevated to divine presence. Kudos!!!Jackman and Crowe compliment each other's roles to perfection. Spellbinding.Eddie Reymane and Amanda Seyfried as well make it all the more real. They brought me to tears.I could go on, but in light of the negative, rather jaded reviews of this production, it goes without my saying that some people just have to be negative about anything that's actually well performed.Sad because Hugo's timeless message is lost to them who focus on the actors themselves instead of seeing the Fourth Wall in front them.As a theatrical producer, playwright, musical performer and director, the efficacy it takes to bring a production of this genre is in and of itself in a category of an epic artistic ideal to be met.I've seen the theatrical production as well. Both revenues are complimentary at best. Neither can be compared as one being better than the other. That's a mistake to be made when reviewing Hugo's legacy. Here we have poetry, drama and prose that rise to the heavenly heights of cinematic theater.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Well-Executed And Powerful Musical,"A well-executed and powerful musical from Tom Hooper, 'Les Mis√©rables' stood alongside 'Skyfall' as Britain's two main entries at the 2013 Academy Awards and left with 3 Oscars. Featuring some bravura performances from an all-star cast including Anne Hathaway (Oscar winner), Hugh Jackman (Oscar nominated), Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Set against the sweeping backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' tells an enthralling and emotional story of passion, love and redemption, accompanied by some stunning cinematography, uplifting musical numbers and flawless direction. While it does drag on at parts, 'Les Mis' is generally an impeccably crafted musical to be enjoyed by all.",,Anonymous,History
Breathtaking - A Musical with Heart,"I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes, art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the heartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!), who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe and Aaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief from Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A great watch, sure to win some major awards this year! 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Must See,"This is a must see film if you loved the Broadway version. The actors gave incredible performances, especially, Anne Hathaway and her singing in I Dreamed a Dream. Hathaway's performance made this film work.Tom Hopper directed this film just like the Broadway version. I can't praise this film enough!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A BRILLIANT Adaptation of the Play and Novel,"A near three-hour epic that one wishes was longer. The songs and emotions will be stuck with you long after you watch this film. A brilliant adaptation of the play.The instant I started watching this film, I knew I would love it.From the beginning, one can tell that the scale of this movie will be massive. From the overarching boats and the rich bass. Les Miserable is rich and vivid in color and song. One can tell that this is a story of redemption in a gritty world.And does it get gritty. Anna Lynch-Robinson's clever set design makes 19th century France a world of contrasts. We see the extreme wealth and refinement of the bourgeois to the lowest depths of poverty. 19th century France is society ready to boil over.The performances of everyone in this film is powerful and emotional. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean giving us a sense of life on the run. Russell Crowe is the unforgiving Javert. Though most people hated Crowe's performance, I enjoyed it. Anne Hathaway as Fantine, a loving mother who would do anything to give her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), a better life. The stunning performance of Samantha Barks as Eponine stole the screen away. Not to mention Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter's performances as the comic relief Thenardier and Madame. The entire cast is star-studded and gives a performance unmatched.Then the excitement comes once the revolution happens. The unmatched enthusiasm of the young yearning for a better France. The fight between the establishment and the rebellious. Scores of actors, action, and scenery that gives chills. Beautifully well done and artfully crafted.I normally don't watch musicals, but the screen adaptation of the play/novel is phenomenal. There is no pause and the audience feels the events rolling as the film progresses. Les Miserables is a massive story that's told and retold time and time again. You can't watch this film without crying or tearing up.5/5. Tom Hooper's masterpiece of a film. One of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very Well Done Stage-to-Screen Adaptation,"An all star cast, a classic musical, and new innovations make for an astounding rendition of Les Miserables. Unlike most musical films, all the singing was filmed and recorded live, and it made a difference. There was a passion and emotion present that I have felt so deeply and personally only a few times before. Crowe and Jackman were both fantastic throughout the film, and Anne Hathaway performed the most moving version of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" that I have heard. Overall, the acting was well done and I only had a few issues with characters. Sacha Baron Cohen brings a sense of raunchy humor and disrespect to a serious and emotional film. I am disappointed in him being cast, as he ruined some potentially moving scenes. The cinematography was not traditional, and there were moments where it distracted from the story. Many shots and scenes were very well done though, and besides a few shots, the cinematography was intriguing. I don't know how to sum it up, so I'll just say this: if you are a fan of Broadway, or past Les Mis films and soundtracks, this film is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent Adaptation,"This film is amazing. Absolutely incredible. I don't understand what people are saying about pacing issues, I thought it flowed beautifully. The changes made worked very well. And I didn't think there was any weak link in the cast. I honestly loved Russell as Javert. He wasn't traditional by any means, but what he did worked.The cgi was not the best, but it kind of created this fantastical other world while still being realistic and grounded.So many of the acting choices were brilliant and subtle. For example Jackman ever so slightly altered his voice with his characters aging, which I thought was brilliant.There is no negative thing to say about this movie. However, I do see why a critic may not like it. It's not a critic movie. There isn't a lot of impressive violence, crazy camera shots, etc. the things critics seem to love. It's more grounded in the performances and the story, which it tells extremely well.The only thing I can point out (because I saw it with my boyfriend who knows nothing about the story) there are two or three slightly confusing plots for those who aren't familiar with Les Mis. But they are either explained later on or not important enough to dwell on.Anyways, that's my rant. Needless to say I will be seeing it many many times and cannot wait for the DVD so I can own it and watch it even more.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sing Talking gets Tiring,"Sing Song Talking gets real tiring. I thought I could take it, but after an hour of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing talking, it really got on my nerves.Anne Hathaway does one of the most impressive and showiest singing performance. Her Oscar win is well deserved. If only the rest of the movie would stop singing, scenes like Anne's could shine more.The story is a rambling meandering melodrama. Director Tom Hooper really embraced it and took the chance to go all out. I applaud the effort but it's not my kind of movie. Other than the one scene with Anne Hathaway, there isn't anything that is a must see.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I Cried in the Parking Lot,"As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this film through its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers to sneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From the very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I was hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.Singing: Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but was excellent in ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Soliloquy"". Hugh Jackman, too, had his weak moments...but really wowed during ""Who am I?"" and ""Bring Him Home"". Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance, followed closely by Samantha Barks.Acting: A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again, Anne Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen were the much needed (and absolutely hilarious) comedic relief.Production: One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming, makeup, hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people weren't made to be ""pretty"" as Hollywood often does; thankfully, the actors' teeth were not left movie-star white.Overall, one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times through the whole film, and the finale completely RUINED me. I was sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended, walking through the theatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Even if you don't like musicals, you really should see this one","As a massive film fan, my tastes are very wide-ranging, but I do have a problem with musicals. Nevertheless I was happy to take the opportunity of a private viewing of ""Les Mis√©rables"" at the London office of distributors Universal - the day after the London premi√®re and a month before the UK release - because of the outstanding success of the original stage show (a run of 27 years with a total audience of over 60 million) and the surprising and impressive cast list (Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne).The showing was introduced by producer Eric Fellner of Working Title who underlined the commercial challenge of making a film in which all the dialogue is sung and the themes are so political and praised director Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech"") for his insistence that every take was sung live.The two main characters are presented in the opening seconds of a sweeping introductory sequence: the police inspector Javert (Crowe) and the prisoner 24601 Jean Valjean (Jackman) in post-revolutionary France. There follows over two and half hours with barely a spoken word which will not appeal to all cinema-goers, but the production is a triumph with Cameron Mackintosh's musical opened up by dramatic shooting on Pinewood's brand new Richard Attenborough stage and some historic English locations.If Crowe and especially Jackman are excellent, Hathaway - who lost 25 pounds and most of her hair for the role - is outstanding as the destitute Fantine and Cohen and Carter almost steal the show as the comical Th√©nardier innkeepers.I'm not sure how long it will take for ""Les Mis√©rables"" to recoup its investment cash- wise, but it's going to win award after award and rightly so.",,Anonymous,History
Magnificent Live-Production Captured On Film!,"What an innovative film!Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the movie from the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (by someone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theater productions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been to any), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of one the world's great musicals for the cinema screens!The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of every performer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! This movie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goers who never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all!

You need to know the history and context - Les Mis the novel and Les Mis the musical before attempting this. Then you can appreciate what they were trying to do.,"This is a really tricky one to talk about. Its place in the Les Mis repertoire is confusing to newcomers and the reviews are polarised which is also confusing, but I understand why.This is a film version of a the musical adaptation of a novel. Therefore, I think that attempting to watch this without any prior knowledge of Les Mis is going to leave you confused or feeling incomplete. Les Mis is such a huge epic vast story that features many characters and covers many years and has many important grand themes. All of these cannot be crammed into a 2.5 hour movie, never mind a 2.5 movie version of a musical version of the story. Les Mis is absolutely fantastic, but I recommend to people that they understand the story in its entirety before seeing the musical. The 2018 BBC series a a great 6-hour in-depth version if you don't want to read the 1500 page novel. Then, I think you can appreciate the musical in its totality because it brings the themes and emotions of the story alive through music and musical theatre. Then, once you are familiar with the musical (there are 3 famous recordings of it available) , then you can understand the movie remake of the musical and what it was trying to achieve.So I totally understand why fans of the musical would be disappointed in this because it features actors rather than singers, so the singing is nowhere near as good as in the musical. I also understand why newcomers to Les Mis might be disappointed in this, because on its own it is an incomplete rendering of Les Mis, there is so much depth and context that I feel you need in order to piece it all together and truly appreciate the tragedy and the themes within it. But for those who have an understanding of what came before, I think this is a really bold and commendable attempt at converting the musical to a movie format. However, ultimately, it is not as emotionally affecting as the musical because (despite some great acting) you can't get a way from the fact that it is largely through the music that the emotional heart is portrayed. And the music here is nowhere near as good as the stage versions.I think its very important to know what the intentions for this movie were. The actors all sang live, with the intention of being able to sing as if they acting, i.e. They could slow down and speed up where they need for a more realistic portrayal of the words than a song which runs to a consistent tempo. And also not be held back by needing to hit all of the notes perfectly, a lot of lines Hugh Jackman almost speaks rather than truly sings, because he is trying to do the songs in a more realistic acting fashion. This should have been made really clear in all the promo for the film because when you know this you can appreciate more what they were attempting to do, and not just simply compare them to Colm Wilkinson or Ruthie Henshall or any of the vocal greats from Les Mis on stage. Where this works the best as it was intended is in Anne Hathaway's I Dreamed a Dream. Her raw emotional ropey speak-singing works absolutely perfectly for one of the most devastatingly human portrayals of Fantine we have. She won an Oscar for this alone, and though I'm not a huge fan of the Academy's choices I have to agree with this.The production is beautiful and great to look at. And the casting outside of Hathaway is mostly good. Jackman I think is an excellent Valjean, as vulnerable as he is strong. And in a non-musical version of Les Mis i think he would be one of the greats. But despite his acting abilities, next to Colm Wilkinson or Alfie Boe, he is just not going to compete in fans memories.It is a must-see, but not as your introduction to Les Mis.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Why We Pay to Watch Others Suffer,"Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath?If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you. The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matin√©e ‚Äì the theater was packed ‚Äì applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater, even as the closing credits rolled.Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering on screen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse, starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage. I did have to repeat to myself, ""This is only a movie"" even as tears streamed down my cheeks.Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing, ""You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave."" They are the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World laborers. They are Ilya Repin's ""Barge Haulers on the Volga."" Valjean's nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and falls and rises ¬Ö you get the idea.A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself. Jackman is the heart and soul of ""Les Miserables."" I loved him. Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen ‚Äì they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not arrive.I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst. Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's Biblical example. ""Les Miserable"" is leftist in that it depicts the poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order, is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine liberal's fantasy.I think ""Les Miserables"" is as popular as it is for the same reason that Cinderella is so popular. When ""Les Miserable"" was a stage play, tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege? Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean Valjean can go on, I can, too!I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good ones, ""I dreamed a dream"" and ""Do you hear the people sing?"" All the actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially well.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The definitive Les Miserables movie experience!,"As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.As far as the acting and music is concerned, I can find very little to fault. Russel Crowe was the weakest of the lot as I just didn't find his voice to be up to the task of singing some of Javert's songs (Stars immediately springs to mind). Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Samantha Barks were all especially good. The intense emotions their characters experience throughout the story are perfectly performed.This naturally leads to a critique of the music. Anyone familiar with the Broadway show will undoubtedly find themselves joyously mouthing along to the familiar lyrics and might be surprised at a couple of brand new songs written specifically for the movie. Just as in the show, the music is brilliant and meshes wonderfully with the story.One of the biggest treats, however, were the sets and special effects. The beauty and squalor of 19th century Paris was showcased magnificently and it really allowed you to become engrossed in story.This is a movie that both fans of the novel as well as fans of the musical can both fall in love with, since even though there are some deviations from the novel this is still the closest a film version has ever come to being completely faithful to the book. Additionally, this movie is a perfect chance for those who have never read the book or haven't heard of or had a chance to see the Broadway show. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. My only warning is to limit your fluid intake, since at 2.5+ hours your chance of encountering an overflowing bladder is a very real danger.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Big actors, not big voices","I have been a big fan of Les Miserables since I was very young. I remember watching the 10th Anniversary concert on PBS as a kid and just being blown away by the singing, the music, and the story. I became so transfixed by it that I had my mom buy me the unabridged version of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo and read the whole thing .... twice.With all that being said, I was really excited to see this movie. The previews made it look great. I had seen the last version of Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and had been thoroughly disappointed afterwards, especially with the ending. I was really hoping that this one would take the ending further, like the concert does. On that aspect - I was not disappointed at all. The production, the visuals, the costumes, it was all very good. I loved the ending, and I loved the cameo by Colm Wilkenson at the beginning (who played Valjean in the musical). What I did not like was the singing. Yes, they inserted some great big actors to get interest ... but they can't sing worth anything. They can sing better than I can, but when you watch the concert and then you watch this, the songs feel somewhat ... emptier. I was highly disappointed that the casting decision had been aimed more at big names than actual musical talent. Songs that are supposed to be overwhelmingly powerful have been reduced so much that almost none of the emotion you want to feel can possibly be expressed, due to the lack of both the vocal range and the vocal power of the actors.It was a good try .... I suppose for those that never watched the concert it would be very enjoyable. For us life-long fans ... not so much. I am going to stick with the 10th anniversary concert.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A great bridge between Hollywood and Broadway.,"This is less of a review and more of a reply to the negativity surrounding this film.May I just start by saying that I saw this production on Broadway when I was about ten years old and maybe because of my age, it was never something that appealed to me but now at the tender age of 31, I find myself a lot more open minded. Not remembering the story, I was completely in the dark with what to expect from this movie. Quite honestly I was blown away and found it to be mesmerising.Some reviewers have complained that it's nowhere near as good as the live stage production but I think that these very same people are missing the point. This is an on screen adaptation of the very well known musical and there has to be some sort of bridge here. I'm sure those who live for the theatre would rather have the full Broadway crew cast for the film but for this to work on a more commercial level, you must have some well known actors. Okay, so they can't carry out the songs with the power and intensity of stage performers but you've got to say they did reasonably well considering.The way I see it, for someone like myself who doesn't read books and just thoroughly enjoys film, it's really opened my mind and has given me more motivation now to go to the theatre, more than I ever would before. Like I say it's a bridge between Hollywood and Broadway that I feel works very well. Hats off to the cast who really made this film what it is. Although it may look a bit of an outcast compared to the rest of my collection, this will be one Blu ray I'll be buying very soon.PS. To the reviewer who said that it's ridiculous to get 19 years for stealing bread, had you have been paying attention, you'd know that he was given 5 years for stealing and the rest of his time given was for trying to escape. Please get your facts right before submitting your nonsense. You just end up looking daft.",10.0,Anonymous,History

an amazing masterpiece,"This film tells the story of a man who stole a piece of bread to feed his sister's child. He was in jail for almost twenty years. He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman.""Les Miserables"" is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it captures every viewer's hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. It is so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like a baby. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening and closing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just let my t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout. I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticket price, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I was dehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.It's amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is. From the relentless struggle for existence, the the uplifting revolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrity of Jean.

Perfect Movie..........A musical for those who don't like musical,"It is very rare that a movie makes you feel the way this film does. Also, I am not a big fan of musicals and have only seen a few film adaptations of musicals over the years. Therefore, it is fair to say that I went into this film with a fair deal of scepticism. However, as soon as this film began I knew I was in for a ride. By the time the credits rolled I was nearly in tears and I am sure most of you will be.To start with, the music and the actors singing the music are absolutely superb. The music is as emotional as it gets and ties in amazingly well with the film's themes. In addition, there is not one actor who doesn't pull his or her weight to make this the musical masterpiece which it is.Essentially, the main theme running throughout the film is oppression and this is conveyed in stunning fashion by Hugh Jackman who steals the show and leaves you breathless for the 2 1/2 hour running time. His voice and facial expressions depict a man who has endured endless suffering and pain and is still willing to sacrifice more to help those in need such as Ann Hathaway's character. However, he is not a perfect human being and makes mistakes which he tries to rectify and this is why we root for him. By the end of the film he feels more like a close friend than an actor.All other actors such as Ann Hathaway and Russell Crowe deliver near-perfect performances and are also amazingly talented in the singing department. You would struggle to hold back the tears once you hear Ann Hathaway singing, the now infamous song, 'I dreamed a dream'. Despite what other critics say, Russell Crowe's character is also portrayed in stunning fashion by the immensely talented actor who we all know.Lastly, the cinematography in this film is also remarkably stunning. The camera pans close to the face of each character whenever they sing to show you what they are feeling in that moment. The film is also able to warp you back to the 1800's and make you believe that you are in France during that time period due to excellent production values and this is not surprising considering the amount of money having been spent to produce the film.Tom Hooper the director has created an astonishing masterpiece which must be seen by the most casual of film fans.

Very musical,"I don't really like films where the actors behave normally then burst into song. Les Mis is not like this; they sing just about everything. All the actors sing very well, don't get the criticism of Russell Crowe, thought he sang well. For me the stand out actor was Aaron Tveit who i have now found out is a stage musical performer and you can tell-real presence and a super vocal-same for the boy who plays Gavroche -again a stage musical performer. I did think some sections were too short and others a bit long. Anne Hathaways story was a bit rushed i thought especially as she features highly in the trailer. The film on the whole was very good but about 15-20 minutes too long which could have been done with better pacing. Enjoy!!",6.0,Anonymous,History
It's a joy.,"Jean Valjean: ""I stole a loaf of bread. My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving."" Javert: ""And you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law!""Just as I stood at the end of the stage production of Les Miserables, I stood in my home after watching a screener copy. I was, however, concerned that I would have nothing ""critical' to say about director Tom Hooper's lush film version, filled with first-rate actors believable crowds, and singing befitting non-opera types in a people's opera.Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), mayor of Paris in the first part of the 19th century, promises dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). He has been eluding the tireless policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe), after breaking parole for the crime of stealing a loaf of bread, for which he served 19 years. It's not so much the melodrama that grabs me as the inspired music that has discernibly distinct and luscious melodies and a book that straightforwardly tells story and reveals character.Jackman, Hathaway, and Crowe are competent singers, and the better for not being opera stars, who would have compromised the Everyman feel of the musical. For an almost three hour show, Hooper and writer Claude-Michel Schonberg keep the action moving from Javert and Valjean in a battle of wits and the youths fomenting a revolution right outside the windows.For comic relief, Sacha Baron Cohen as Th√©nardier and Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Th√©nardier run a comical whore house and do quite well as pickpockets. At times, their antics are so opposite the grand action outside as to be almost irritating. Les Mis was a thrill on stage; it is a joy on screen as the 19th century comes alive with the poor struggling against the rich and the noble, poor or rich, miserable.",,Anonymous,History
The music touches my soul.,"I rarely cry but the storyline and music from this musical make me cry so much. I first saw this in London when I was 11. It made me cry then and still moves me to this day. I dreamed a dream breaks my heart everytime I hear it. Victor Hugo was so amazing. Wrote some incredible stories, two of which are my favourite of all time. I didn't think I would like the film adaptation. It took me to 2023 to watch it when it came out in 2012. I was scared they'd butcher it. Yet to my surprise it was excellent. Wish I'd watched it sooner now. It will never be as good as the west end show because hearing and seeing it all live is an experience like no other. However the film is brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Almost Perfect,"I had high expectations for this movie. I can't say that I was completely blown away, but I enjoyed it. In the end I thought it could have been better so I am giving it a 9.I thought the acting was pretty good. Especially Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. The one person I thought that could've done better was Russell Crowe. He acted well and his voice is good too. It's just when the two came together it was kind of fake. There was only one scene in the movie that I thought he pulled them both off. I really like Russell Crowe so I was pretty disappointed about that.The singing was really good. Unlike other movies, this movie's singing is recorded live and that made the performances more real. I thought all the actors had great voices and the song ""Suddenly"" which was written for this movie was very good. I also thought Amanda Seyfried's singing had really improved since ""Mamma Mia"". I really enjoyed her performances.I've heard people complaining about the horrible CG, but I honestly think it's not such a big deal. The CG was not the best, but it's the last thing that crosses your mind after you watch this wonderful movie. I enjoyed this film, even though I had expected more from it. It's one of those movie's that people will say was a turning point for musicals in the film industry. So I think it's a movie worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A 3D musical in 2D,"Honestly, I wanted to LOVE this movie. But I only liked. It is at most a 2D movie representation of live theatre first of all, so that is a strike against it. I found Hugh Jackman's singing in the first hour slightly sharp in parts and since he was not recorded with an orchestra, it almost makes me think he was recorded with an out-of- tune piano and then the orchestral version added back. And the high ranges of Amanda Seyfried's voice sounded distractingly screechy.I will say that listening to Anne Hathaway sing was refreshing after Hugh Jackman. And who knew Russell Crowe could sing in such a rich, clear (and in tune!) voice? He, Samantha Barks, and Eddie Redmayne were standouts for me.Anyway, everyone knows the music and the storyline, the set portrayals were good, and acting was believable. I can imagine producers saying do we hire singers or stars; they clearly decided on stars. I love musicals, and usually Hugh Jackman too, but maybe stronger true singers would have been better as Valjean and Cosette.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Quite boring and unbelievably bad sang,"I wanted to watch Les Miserables in a movie theater but somehow I did not manage to do it on time, so I bought the DVD.... Sorry for the money.I do not know if my expectations are too high (being myself a musician) but I sort of think that what a musical is all about is singing. Acting is important, costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takes are nice too. However, hence the word MUSICal, it's all about music, and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main two actors (Jackman and Craw) are undoubtedly very good actors but have no idea how to sing; They are incapable of singing a straight note and it is obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably at acting school (as usual with these cases a month's coaching before the shooting is not enough - all professional e.g. Broadway singers who suffer for years are not stupid, they do it for a reason). Had they not been famous, everyone would laugh.Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some proper cast (for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow).If one can tolerate the insufferable singing, I admit that the rest is excellent. The acting is superb, the takes breathtaking, the costumes and sets fantastic, and the emotions overwhelming. If....I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to the rest. However, music is in my opinion half the job, and in this case half a job very badly done.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Must see!!!!,"Amazing.... Les Mis√©rables is a powerful story of redemption, grace and love. I recommend the book (abridged... Hugo does go on) as well as the 1998 version (Liam Neeson is a great Valjean). I could not say enough good things about this production. The performers were excellent, the sets and effects were great and the direction kept things moving. If this were on the stage Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' would have stopped the show... I wanted to stand a cheer. Hugh Jackman deftly guided us through Valjeans anger, anguish, despair, love and honor. Tom Hoopers decision to have the actors sing on set instead of miming a recording made the experience more emotional.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent imagining of the world of Victor Hugo.,"I feel I should start by saying that this was never going to please everyone, there is too much detail in Hugo's text for a start. Also, a large number of viewers will, like me, have a well formed idea of the sets and visuals in their imagination.Does this film match my imagination? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes, thoroughly.The whole look of the film is perfect, with sets and locations setting a striking atmosphere. There plot moves fast, particularly in the first half hour, with much detail omitted (but a lot more than viewers of the stage show get). It is when we get to Paris that the film really takes to its stride.The cast is well chosen. I agree that Jackman 'ageing' his voice is a particularly fine touch. Crowe (apparently controversial) is an excellent choice for Javert IMO. His style suits the duty-bound inspector, making the transformation in his guiding principles even more marked and emotional. Indeed, some of the most emotional moments were added for him (particularly the giving of the medal). To avoid a simple list of all the principals, I will say that the rest were excellent, with a special mention for Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks. The Thenardiers provided a fresh take that was thoroughly enjoyable whilst staying true to the story.This of course brings me on to Hathaway as Fantine... Popular opinion seems to be a love/hate thing, so maybe it is unusual that I am in the middle. She was indeed moving but I do feel that the part was overacted. Before I am berated for forgetting how hard-done-by she is, I say this: in real life she wouldn't be singing. There's a balance between realism and honouring the flow and musical intention of the composers. Personally I think it erred slightly too far towards the former. Having said this, it is by no means a bad portrayal and it seems certain that she will bag an Oscar.The director has a fascination with close in shots of faces, which is overused throughout the film, becoming frustrating. In particular, this came to a head during 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' when I had had enough and found myself thinking ""You have a beautiful set full of empty chairs and empty tables - the visual imagery is too good to miss!""In summary the film starts strongly and when we arrive in Paris, becomes a game changer. Problems are merely small distractions and often a matter of personal taste. With this source material, this lavish treatment is well deserved!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not awful but not great,"I've read the other user reviews that have been written so far (as of Dec. 17) and I think some people don't really understand what they are reviewing. It's a film adaptation of a hugely successful stage musical. For those who don't like the pacing or the storyline or characters, they didn't develop them past how they are written in the stage version. Stage musicals don't have as much development as film, but that's not to say there's no development what-so-ever. It's just differently in musicals.That being said: Hugh Jackman does an amazing job as Jean ValJean. While I don't agree with all the vocal techniques he used, he makes the character his own; which is a huge undertaking considering the originator of the role, Colm Wilkinson, plays the Bishop of Digne.Russell Crowe grew on me as time went on, I personally prefer Philip Quast of the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast version of the show.Amanda Seyfried's voice is plain awful and she was used solely on the fact that she's somewhat of a name. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also give underwhelming performances and are cast based off of name recognition only.Anne Hathaway is way too dramatic for this role. Her voice is nice, but her physical emotion overpowers the emotion created by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. Same goes for Eddie Redmayne's rendition of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" The ones who nail their characters are Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks, which is no surprise since they come from theatre backgrounds. They truly understand what it takes to break down a song and truly emote through the music.As stated in my one line summary: it's not awful, but not great. If you go into this expecting just a film or expecting the stage version you'll be disappointed. It's an adaptation, a flawed one at that. However, it is nice to see that musicals are slowly starting to make it back into the mainstream.So thank you Tom Hooper for doing this project and having the cast sing live. It's just too bad that your cinematography kills the emotion that Schonberg and Boublil's stage version has mastered for the last 27 years.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Les Mis√©rables, C'est Magnifique","Note-I had not had my French press coffee and croissant yet when I wrote this, so eloquent it ain't. Enjoy my review! I saw it last night at a screening in Philly. Hundreds of people showed up and got turned away, many were furious. Complete chaos. A woman who thought I worked at the theater let out a string of cuss words at me.I don't really feel like giving a detailed, well-written review, but I thought it was marvelous and look forward to seeing it again.The pros-Eddie Remayne - passionate performance, and worthy of recognition. Amanda Seyfried really makes Cosette something special. The young Cosette was a perfect match for Seyfried, and that little girl gave a lot of great moments (especially in the Thenardier Waltz of Treachery). Cohen and Carter were wonderful and their final moment was the funniest part of the film. The scenes in Paris to the finale were the highlights. The kid who played Gavroche was fantastic and I finally like that character now. I would love to see that kid get some recognition. Javert's final moment was unexpected and frighting, very powerful. Also, loved the factory ladies. Anne Hathaway I actually enjoyed at the end more than the beginning. Honestly, I found the film to be straight-forward and relatively gimmick free. Many plot holes and wrinkles in the stage show were ironed out here, such as the students' complete isolation at the barricades, the business with Marius' ring, Valjean's superhuman strength as he drags Marius through the sewers etc. And finally, Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar nomination. A win would be great but I doubt that will happen, but you're nuts if you think he won't get a nod.The cons-Poor Russell Crowe. Where was that Gladiator? This guy is a great actor and has given some great performances, but he was just not even trying. I'm disappointed because I know he was capable of something much, much better. But he wasn't there. And Javert is so crucial, it just sinks the story a bit to not having him be a part of the story. The scenes up until Paris seemed to drag a bit for me (the heart and soul of Les Mis are always the barricade scenes). Master of the House was a great scene but a little restrained, not the showstopper it could have been. The freedom of the actors to dictate the underscoring is very jarring at first, but you get used to it and accept it and it works and makes the movie better.Overall, there was surprisingly too much restraint and realism for an epic film musical. I mean, Hopper could have made it a little more fun-you can't take a musical too deadly serious. I appreciate Hooper's desire to pull back, but there were moments he could have really packed a punch, but instead retreated.Overall, I thought it was marvelous. The movie is NOT better than the stage version, and the stage version is NOT better than the movie, if that makes sense. They both work well together as companion pieces. The tugging at the heartstrings that made the stage show so popular is still there tugging on your heartstrings in the movie theater. I haven't loved a film musical so much since Chicago - and honestly, I think although Chicago is a much, much better work of art than Les Mis, I was more frustrated with Chicago the film than Les Mis the film. Interestingly, Russell Crowe and Richard Gere were the weak links in both these movies.I don't know how this will fare with Oscar nominations or critics, but I will say that this movie is going to be a gigantic hit with repeated viewings. It makes you want to see it again because it is such a gigantic, detailed movie. Tween girls will fall in love with Marius and songs like ""On My Own"" all over again and Les Mis the musical is going to have an enjoyable second life.Ultimately, it's a story about Hope, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you miss that when you see Les Mis, you probably miss out on hope a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good Attempt,"To get a few things straight, I am a massive fan of this musical. It is one of my favourite musicals of all time. As I'd only previously saw a rendition of the musical at a small theater for $30, my first expectations were that the film would surpass the musical I had watched due to the worthy cast. I should've though gone into this film with low expectations as this would have made me much happier.I need to pinpoint 1 scene. Master of the House was absolutely dreadful. This has to be one of the highlights of the whole musical for me and Sasha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter ruined it - they weren't funny at all and could've done much more with the bright characters they had been given. They were obviously used for their name and not their performance skills.I commend Hugh Jackman as I grew to his character throughout the film but I felt that his voice lacked something. Anne Hathaway was good too, her voice quite magical.The only worthy performances were from Aaron Tveit and Samantha Barks who shined through their characters - this is understandable as they both have theater backgrounds. On My Own being the best scene for me.I feel as in transforming this musical to a film they could have done so much more to enhance the emotional experience.I cry from listening to the songs and the fact that a tear didn't fall tells me something. This movie lacks the emotional magic of the musical production.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great version of a great piece of work,"When I heard about this movie coming out, I was really excited. I play in a lot of community theater orchestra pits (I'm a cellist), and I was blessed with the opportunity to play this musical with a very good youth theater group a couple of years ago. Wow, what a great piece of work this musical is. It's an emotional roller coaster to play - parts of it make you tear up so much that it's hard to read the music - LOL. I tend to make kind of a personal bond with certain musicals I've played, and this is one of those (others being Cabaret, Brigadoon, Music Man, West Side Story, and Promises, Promises). This movie version of Les Miserables is really good. The performances are great, especially Hathaway, Jackman, and Daniel Huttlestone (the kid - he was GREAT - it made me cry when Javert pinned the medal on his body). Nods also go to Russell Crowe, who is ALWAYS very good, but had a surprisingly good voice in this film. I feel bad for not mentioning all of the leads - all of them are very good. The younger generation (Cosette and her friends) are all very good - I already knew of Amanda Syfried from other films, but hadn't seen Marius before (Eddie Redmayne) - he was great. I had seen Samantha Barks play Eponine before...her big song in this movie made me lose it. Wow. If you like musicals, this is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best musicals I have ever come across,"To enjoy while everyone sings out their joys, anger, sadness and the epiphany to attain while watching every single move of the person on stage. I could experience it only when I watched the theatrics, but here I get the complete orgasm of movie watching when I watch this one. Staying true to the book, the musical has done a great job in captivating me inch by inch. Tom Hooper has yet done an amazing job as a director.Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathwaway have blown me off, literally, while Russel Crowe rocked wherever he went. Though Amanda Seyfried was as lame as she always is, every other character in this movie have given life to this historic masterpiece from Victor Hugo.The cinematography is yet another factor be praised, and so is the art direction..

Beautiful Musical Turned into a Boring TV Special,"As I was a kid growing up in Italy, I remember when the national TV channels broadcast classical operas. Even as a kid, I could understand the efforts of the directors who had to work with what they had---editing in real time live stage actors. Obviously, movie directors do not have the limitation--- they can edit, dub, sync, use CGI, and move their cameras at will, in harmony or in counterpoint to the music. So, I was utterly disappointed when I saw that Tom Hooper did not achieve anything better than the old-timey Italian TV directors could do with staged opera.That is even more surprising because Hooper is working on Les Miserables---the longest-running, most beloved musical of all time. Les Mis contains some of the most beautiful, moving, and powerful pieces of music ever written. And its music is layered on one of the best and richest novel plots.With such a rich material available, Tom Hopper makes the odd decision in concentrating all of his efforts in beautifully rich scenarios and CGI reconstructions of Paris (one of which is bizarrely out of perspective), and filming every single solo as a more-or-less single shot of the close-up of the singer. With Anne Hathaway's performance, it kind of works, but it fails with everybody else. In fact, I found that this choice creates two kinds of problems. First, it creates an uncanny contrast between the intensity of the performance (strengthened by the close-ups) and the fact that, well, the characters are SINGING, even when dying. Somehow, forcing the intensity of the acting breaks the spell instead of strengthening it.Second, and most importantly, there is an unresolved tension between the music and the immobility of the camera. the music drives the feelings, and invites motion and changes. You want the camera to roll and open spaces, and, instead, you find yourself still staring at Hugh Jackman's wrinkles. One might say that this is some kind of ascetic directorial decision, but no---when the characters are not singing Tom Hooper abuses impossible camera work that zooms in and out at impossible distances, from the detail of a face to bird's eye views of Paris. So the reason for the poor filming of singing actors must lay somewhere else. Maybe the root of these problems is Hooper's much celebrated choice of having the actors sing in real-time. But, again, why was decision made in the first place? Since it causes problems in the final result, I see no point in recording the actors while singing live--- if not for bragging about it later on.So, in summary, the movie was disappointing. And good performances (or even great performances) cannot save a weak directorial work that fails to shape the richness of the story and the music. If the director was someone like the energetic Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge! and Ballroom), we could have had a real movie, if not a masterpiece. Instead, we got an expensive TV Christmas special.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A Grand Triumph,"In a Hollywood where nothing is new anymore, where nothing takes the leap to be called innovative or original, I have finally found a movie I am proud to call both innovative and original. Tom Hooper's Les Mis√©rables is based on the stage musical, which in turn is based on Victor Hugo's epic 19 century novel. As a critic who has had the privilege of reading this epic, I had high expectations for Hooper's film adaptation. This film takes a chance and decides to finally do something new.The movie was filmed with two major risks involved: first, the actors were to sing live on set, and second, Hooper did not use film transitions, rather he devised a new way of editing I have never seen before in which the cuts are not transitions, rather they follow the songs and the emotions of the characters. Both of the risks paid off triumphantly and the audience is treated to a version of Hugo's classic that could not have been told any other way. For the first time ever we get both the famous songs and the riveting emotions of the characters singing them. Hooper's major cinematic tool was the close-up, which he used flawlessly to capture every single eye twitch and half smile; powerful images that cannot be found from a nosebleed seat.With that in mind, the most powerful aspect of the film is its images. Some of these images will haunt your memories, while others will hold on to your heart. Each camera angle, each set piece is used to create a painting. Some brush strokes emulate misery, while others signify redemption. The entire cast paints a portrait of what we find in Hugo's classic.The singing is superb, from each cast member. Hugh Jackman sings a touching ""Bring Him Home,"" Russel Crowe sings a rousing ""Stars,"" and Anne Hathaway will break your heart with ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Even Samantha Barks in her film debut brings acting on par with that of the former when she flawlessly moves you with ""On My Own."" The emotions brought forth by the actors are often more powerful than the songs themselves. Each cast member is an actor first, singer second, which allows the film its significance and independence from the stage.From the first sequence to the final number, Hooper entices you with a poetic journey through Hugo's redemptive tale. This is easily the best film of the year and one of this critic's all time favorite films. It will stay with you, whether you want it to or not. You will cry, you will laugh, and I promise you, even if you do not know the songs when you enter the theater, you will sing.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Starts strong but doesn't stay as good,"It should be said that while I do enjoy the occasional musical, I'm not really one to seek them out as they tend not to be naturally my thing; indeed my favorite musical is the South Park film, mainly because it manages to have its genre cake and mock it at the same time. So it took me a few minutes to get into the big chorus, singing dialogue thing here but early on I did. To speak of the first hour I had characters I engaged with, songs that mostly are memorable (although the singing is variable) and generally plenty of spectacle and flair in the delivery. The first hour of the film is by far the strongest and it contains a lot of the most emotionally moving aspects.Much has been said about Hathaway and, sort of as a result I wasn't sure how much of it was hype for awards and how much of it was real, but she really is very good throughout her section. The highlight is of course I Dream a Dream, but her whole performance is emotionally charged but yet fragile at the same time. Problem is that with this and other strengths in the first hour, the rest of the film has a lot to live up to and, mostly, it doesn't really manage it. It runs to almost 3 hours and it really does feel long but weirdly at the same time it also feels rushed. It is hard to describe but the amount of story to be told seems too much to really fit in and do it well. As a result it never grabbed me quite as much as it had in that first hour; I still enjoyed it for its flair and spectacle but it felt like that is what I was watching, rather than characters or a story.Beyond Hathaway the cast are not quite as strong. Jackman does well but not amazing; Seyfried is okay while Redmanye, Barks, Tveit and others are solid. Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter both overplay it but are amusing. The only real weak link is Crowe and it is a shame because he actually fits his character very well, it is just the fact that his singing voice is strained that poses a problem ‚Äì but it is a big problem when you're making a musical. The production values are tremendously high, with great sets, great costumes and around these Hooper gives us some great set-pieces ‚Äì with the downside of this being that it all seems so surface that it highlights the increasingly lack of much else going on elsewhere.The film still is worth a look for this, but it is a shame that it peaks so early and only seems to slip away from there. It manages to feel overlong while also feeling rushed and needing more time; perhaps me not naturally being drawn to musicals was part of the issue, but it is a flawed but expensive film.",,Anonymous,History
Better than expected,"Les Miserables is not easily translated to film, as any fan of the novel or the musical knows. There are enough failed movie versions out there to attest to this. I think that this time, thankfully, they got it about as ""right"" as it's ever going to get.Don't get me wrong, it certainly has its flaws, but it rises well above all the other musicals-turned-movies I've seen with the possible exception of RENT. However, all things considered, I can only think of three substantial complaints and of those, only one is glaring enough to have a real impact on the movie's quality.Russel Crowe, who I am admittedly indifferent to in most movies, really managed to make the character of Javert unimaginably dull. He seems to be singing through an eternal yawn and although Javert is certainly not a character of high or fluctuating emotions, there are moments when something as simple as a facial expression would have made a world of difference. On the bright side, though, at least the man can carry a tune most of the time, unlike other stars cast in leading singing roles Gerard Butler...My other complaints are solely about some of my favorite lines that were omitted, so not even worth going into detail on, but it leads me to a commendable point: as long as the stage show is, this film did an amazing job keeping it intact! Not perfect, but so much better than I ever imagined. Very little was lost to time constraints, I am so impressed.The singing is appropriately unpolished, the cinematography is stunning, it was the best time I've had seeing a movie since I was a child. In many scenes, it feels like seeing the show for the first time no matter how many times you've seen the stage production. Anne Hathaway is my new favorite actress, she brought me to tears and I've never cried at a movie before. She really touches on a whole new depth to Fantine's despair, it seems almost impossible to see her performance and not leave the theater touched to the core.Hugh Jackman was an excellent Valjean, in my opinion. His Soliloquy portrayed the conflict of the character in ways I really didn't think could translate to film and the warmth of his character after his personal transformation comes across beautifully. The Thenardiers were laugh-out-loud hilarious, little Cosette was the sweetest child ever, the casting of little Eponine was surprisingly excellent, Gavroche was absolutely charming, this was so well done, I cannot sing it's praises enough. All of the students were excellent in their roles, I was particularly in love with Enjolras, but whether that's because the actor is excellent or because he's my favorite character in the story anyhow, I don't know for sure. He and Grantaire were so wonderfully suited to their roles, it was easy to forget that this wasn't a genuine stage production from time to time. I thought that Marius and Cosette, two characters who are pretty one-dimensional usually, were far more likable in the film than in any of the stage productions I've seen. Not the most outstanding performances of the movie, but the actors did a lot with characters who have so little content, so kudos to them.I live in a city full of pretty shallow people and not a single person I know around here had ever even heard of Les Mis unless I happened to drag them to the Twin Cities to catch a production when it passes through, musicals are NOT these people's thing, yet when the credits rolled, our theater erupted with applause. I was shocked! That alone speaks volumes to me of the quality of the movie and it's performances.On a side note now - look, I know how a lot of people feel, those who are longtime Les Mis fans and who have a hard time accepting some of this casting. In a perfect world, this movie would star Patti and Colm and Phillip Quast (all respect to Terrance Mann) and Frances and Michael, but this is one of those cases where we have to remind ourselves not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Or rather, don't let the ideal be the enemy of the excellent. If you want to listen to Les Mis, the 10th anniversary is a great DVD to grab, the casting is nearly perfect. But to watch Les Mis and to experience it, this movie isn't going to disappoint you. Happy viewing!",9.0,Anonymous,History

After experiencing the film earlier today, I can say it was a tremendous experience.I felt the first thirty minutes or so were the strongest of the entire film, plunging us into the despair and conflicts of various characters with adroit narrative thrust so that not a moment feels wasted or redundant. Two of the three (in my opinion) gut-wrenching musical numbers come in this section- Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" (which, if I recall correctly, was filmed largely in a single take) and Hugh Jackman's ""Who Am I?"". I can only speculate but, compared to the stage version, being able to take in every facial nuance in the film version seems to make the moments of crescendo and soaring strings pack so much more of an emotional punch. Both Hathaway and Jackman also deliver top-notch performances, and it's hard to imagine anyone else fitting the role of Valjean as well as Jackman.Thematically, the film also shines in this section. Here we are introduced to the major theme of forgiveness for the first time, through Fantine we tap into maternal bonds as well as disillusionment, and Valjean's struggles explore the conflict between not only public and private selves but also reconciling our own personal interests with what is morally correct.It seemed curious to me that the bleakest moments of the film (at least for me) came at the beginning, which made it impossible for the film to regain that same sense of gravitas as the story progressed. While the remainder of the film was certainly entertaining, it felt both less emotionally involving and less taut than the beginning.Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provided some much appreciated comic relief, but their antics seemed oddly out of place in this film at times, and often left me feeling as though I were watching Sweeney Todd again. Russell Crowe, while certainly no vocal powerhouse, did a fine job as Javert, although I found his final number to be oddly anti-climactic. The younger actors gave fine performances as well, with Samantha Barks demonstrating the most potential and Eddie Redmayne surprisingly delivering the final gut-wrenching number, ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" The thematic exploration of the rise and fall of idealism makes this sequence especially poignant.Artistically, Les Miserables is a feast. The production design is top-notch, with meticulously crafted sets and props. Makeup and costumes are definitely noteworthy as well. Many of the shots of Paris have an artificially beautiful aesthetic to them, and every crane shot adds a sense of beauty and scope to the piece. Editorially, the film makes takes advantage of cuts to characters in different locations or concurrent events which would not have been possible in the stage version of Les Mis.One minor complaint from a filmmaking perspective was cinematographer Danny Cohen's method of framing characters. Conventional cinematography typically frames actors so that their faces are demarcating either the left or right third of the screen, with the camera positioned so that their subjects are turned towards the remaining two thirds of the screen. In Les Miserables (though thankfully not to the same extent as in The King's Speech), a few times the characters are positioned so that they are facing the other direction- the edge of the screen. Though I imagine the filmmakers were attempting to add visual flourish to the film, I found this technique oddly jarring, drawing me out of the film and making me conscious I was watching a movie.The film does regain some levity in its rousing finale, which ties the film together in plot, theme, and song. Despite the minor issues I had with the film, I found it to be a hard-hitting and rousing work of art. I could probably sum it up best by noting that this is the first movie I've been to where even old men were wiping their teary eyes by the time the credits rolled.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good- but a little disappointing to a fan of the original.,"I think I was less impressed with this movie than most people, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's just...different.This movie chose to go with an ""acting first"" approach to the songs, meaning that they were sung on set, and the actors had the freedom to express the lyrics however they wanted, and how you feel about this decision will greatly affect how much you enjoy the movie.Personally, I think it was a neat idea, but hinders the enjoyment of the music and pokes holes in an otherwise tight musical score.This musical was written to be a stage show, and the songs written to be sung as if they are songs- not acting soliloquy. To miss melodies that belong in the song because the actor ""went a different direction with it"" felt like a bad trade. Most notably, Valjean's songs have a sort of rambling, unprovoked nature to them- and in many cases the ""acting"" style of performing them feels awkward or forced.What the director didn't quite count on, is that people don't naturally sing their feelings in real life. So trying to make a show ""more realistic"" by making the songs seem more extemporaneous doesn't work- it just makes the *songs* feel less structured, but it doesn't make the fact that they *are singing* more believable.It's still a cool idea, and it might have worked...for a different show. This musical doesn't give the actors motivation to sing rather than speak because it doesn't need to; it's always singing; that's the suspension of disbelief that we make going to see this show.The movie tries to add that motivation, and then gambles that it can do so if it makes the songs less ""song-like""- sort of like each song builds from emotional talking to full-blown signing. Some songs lend themselves well to this, but the musical already exploited that device for those songs. Forcing it to others just feels...well, forced.Another gripe I have is how they changed the words of many lines. A couple lines might be easier to understand now, but many of them feel overly simplified or dumbed-down. What also hurts here is that often the new words are less lyrical than the original- the words just sound wrong, or too casual.My last complaint is how they changed the musical score of the prose. Les mis is a musical that re-uses melodies a lot as is, but they take it even further in the movie. We become a bit over-saturated with some of the musicals best melodies- which is too bad.All that said, many of the best songs are faithfully recreated her on screen. Anne Hathaway is perfect (and I say that as someone who is not a fan of Anne Hathaway). All the women are wonderful, Enjoras is also wonderful, as are the supporting actors. Jackman and Crowe are great actors, and it shows. They both know how to sing, and that shows, but I miss the voices I'm used to for songs like Who Am I and Stars.Ultimately, I was disappointed because I wanted what I already had- the musical. The movie will definitely appeal to musical fans, though, and perhaps newcomers or people who are ready for something different will enjoy it more than I did. Just be warned- you are not getting the Broadway musical here- you're getting a ""hollywood gritty"" version of it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No Movie Will Top This In 2013,"My Mum took me to go and see this. I was not expecting such a powerful and beautiful movie with a perfect cast. Anne Hathaway gave a fantastic performance and you could really see the emotion and feeling in her voice and her face. I would name all the other actors and actresses on how well they did, but i would be typing for days As i left the cinemas i was a mess, and so was everyone else. i can honestly not explain how amazing this movie is, This has already hit the top of my favorites list and it will stay up there for many years to come, guaranteed. And those who say it was horrible because it was not like the musical, does that really matter?? This is a masterpiece on its own, and does not need to be spot on with the musical. The only problem i did have was that it is too good and did not give the other movies of 2013 a chance. please do yourself a favor and watch Les Miserables, but make sure you bring a few boxes of tissues.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing on every level.,"Tom Hooper is gonna get quite rewarded for this. Most people feel like directors and film companies keep re-hashing old ideas an stories and that original ideas are gone, but they're just few and far between. What makes this different from probably every musical before it is that Hooper changed the game by recording the acting and singing at the same time instead of recording the singing first. It's this new procedure that lets you feel every emotion the actors have and just takes musicals to a whole new level. The cast is perfect, too. Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Samantha Barks, Amanda Seyfried and the rest all do a wonderful job bringing life to a 150 year old book. (It might help to read a plot synopsis because it's a very intricate movie.) The only downside to me is that movies keep getting longer and nobody's ballsy enough to reintroduce intermissions. C'mon, Hollywood, give our bladders a break.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A story full of passion, revolutionary spirit, redemption and...music","The cast is incredible. You think you're watching a merely remake of the 1998 movie but as the film begins you realize that it has something different and innovative. From the first shots the song of the slaves is dominating and the scene is filmed in a majestic way (so as the whole movie). Sometimes some dialogues are sung by the characters when it is not necessary (and the viewer loses concentration). Apart from this, it seems to be at the theater. The songs remain impressed and the drama/revolution is appeased by the comedy of the two scammers. Tom Hooper has realized both a good remake and musical.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great performance. Not very good directing.,"A very well performance by the most of the cast member. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway deserve every award they have been nominated. Amanda Seyfried's voice is also surprisingly amazing. The set for the film is beautiful. Overall, a good entertaining for the price of a movie ticket.The problem of this film is the directing....Did the director have to shoot every solo scene in a close, only above-neck angle? Most of the vocal solos we can only see the head of the actor. You can actually imagine that Hugh Jackman holding his iphone in front of him when he was singing and the filming was done by skype or facetime. Especially in the last few scene his camera seems to be too small to fit in 2~4 characters. I don't get this. Probably he was trying to create some first-row experience for the audience, but when this fixed and focus angle was used through out the entire film it starts getting me annoying and make the movies very flat even it has a great storyline and awesome performances.I think it is a very well first-row entertaining experience. But this is not a very good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Jackman Doing What He Does Best,"From the costumes to the stage to the performances to the screenplay to the emotion in the singing and the story, there isn't anything the director or cast could've done to make it a better film. When you want more of a movie at the end of a long movie, I'd say everyone did their job. This is Jackman doing what he does best: being the MVP of an ensemble that no one could've done better.

Fantastic Movie!,"I thought Les Miserables was brilliant. The acting by the cast was superb! I never saw the play, but I really enjoyed the movie version. I plan to watch it again. I don't know why they don't more musicals.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A must see film,"After seeing the stage play several times I was apprehensive that the film would live up to the spectacle of the stage version. Not at all disappointed.You are gripped by the story line and characters from the offset, and quickly tune into the emotion of the lyrics and music.Putting a musical into a film was a risk, but it paid off because the story is the music. The sets are vast but simplistic, relating to the stage play.Hugh Jackman played a blinding role, as did Anne Hathaway and Amanda Siegfried. Russell Crowe played a great 'baddie' but his signing wasn't really the highlight of his role.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were both excellent for the roles they played of the innkeeper and his wife, the lightness in the darkness of the film, very funny.Without giving away and spoilers, its difficult to describe how truly emotionally charged the film is, but as soon as the haunting music and chilling lyrics start, you do get a rush of pure sadness in places. So moving.You know a film is good when the cinema audience give a round of applause at the end, and they did.A must see film, at the cinema, for the pure spectacle and sound track.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Believe the hype - this is a fantastique piece of cinema,"19th century France, after breaking parole Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is continuously hunted by policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) and when he meets Fantine (Anne Hathaway) Valjean agrees to find and care for her daughter.Based on Victor Hugo's novel, starring an all star A list cast and with promising praise from all over the world, I sat in a packed cinema to watch a film I knew absolutely nothing about, and like so many others, I was blown away.Opening with a bald Hugh Jackman struggling in his slavery and bursting into song, the scene for the time is set and the music is not dubbed. The live music crashing against the waves under the watchful eye of an obsessive Javert, the film is bound straight into passionate excitement.This is a wonderful story full of passion. There is slavery, poorness, love struck teenagers, scheming warriors, religious power, law and freedom, Les Miserables is an overwhelming mix of strong beliefs, portrayed with vigour by its collection of splendid actors.Hathaway is the standout with her rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"". Filmed in one shot this is the moment you will remember when you finish watching. A scene, uncut, sang live with Fantine in a deep emotional conflict in her life, struggling for money and worrying about her daughter this is heart wrenching and perfect acting from the Devil wears Prada star.My friends who have seen the musical have said as well as Jackman and Crowe were here, there voices pale compared to the actors they have heard in other renditions. Personally I believe their performances and acting said more about their characters than their singing, which made the film fit together nicely.At two and a half hours long, this is a very long film with scenes that are stretched. However these are often necessary for later scenes so we as the audience can be fully engrossed and appreciative of the environment and character dilemmas.Samantha Barks as Eponie is the surprise stand out. Her confession of love is fantastic, her solo filmed in pouring rain in an isolated street will knock you off your feet.Sweeney Todd co stars Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen are injected into the story to provide some wonderful humour, which in such a heavy drama was quite a nice surprise as there was many laughs all around the cinema.The story, packed with such heavy ideas is very dramatic, conveyed through endless wonderful songs. And as a story this works out very well being powerfully engaging but a very unique piece of artistic cinema as well.Director Tom Hooper combines wonderful French scenery and poverty into the story with feelings of isolated close ups and sweeping heart stopping battle sequences.Having gone into the cinema without any idea what all the fuss was about, myself and friends came out singing and praising a wonderful artistic piece of cinema, and hopefully you won't miss out!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bravo - had me bawling by the end,"For the first time, Hollywood has managed to get one of these operettas right.I have always wanted to see this on stage, but have never had the opportunity. I've listened to the recording so many times, and the 25th anniversary edition made me cry. But this was unexpected. It is simple and completely excellent.I do have to say though, I wish they had cast someone else as Cosette because her voice just didn't sound quite right.I had absolutely no idea that Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman could sing like this. Absolutely amazing. Hugh Jackman did Jean Val Jean very very well. The power and accuracy in these two men's voices was just beautiful.The whole thing was an incredibly emotional experience for me and I was crying hard by the end of it.This... this was just purely excellent.",,Anonymous,History
Glossy Cinema,"Les Miserables is the film adaptation of the Broadway Musical version of Victor Hugo's novel. It seems a real challenge to bring it on cinematic screen. The result is it's rich in production and magnificent by the performances, but the direction serves a shaky storytelling and some messy editing. Some mistakes can be forgiven but much affected goes to the direction. Well most people came here for the songs and the singing but it could have been much better if the film consistently deliver its story. It may have the looks of a grand overwhelming show but when you see beneath it, you'll realize it's a cinematic gloss. A really beautiful cinematic gloss.In general opinion, it's all about the performances. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway both genuinely carries the emotion and the pain of their characters. Russell Crowe gets a fascinating turn on his performance by singing. Aside the performances is how the film plays. Most of the film are closer shots of the actors singing out their emotions. It sounds like an interesting style for a musical as you contemplate on how they are performing but that is it. It's just a bunch of people singing in grueling two hours.It still follows the story but the way it is told is underwhelming compared to its magnificent performances. There is actually little care to its storytelling. They just throw away some details and then they let a character sing. It seems to rely too much on what it looks like. But they sure are beautiful. The staging and production values look excellent. The intro is so magnificent, it's easily one of the most amazing looking parts of the film. The actors also made the song there a lot more catchy. More spectacular sets are the French Revolution and the Barricade that keeps the scale so large. The shaky cam is a strange choice for this. The use ends up unfitting.The actors keeps it powerful and they are indeed natural. I'll say Les Miserables is one of the grandest and most beautiful looking films of the year, but looking inside it, it seems artificial and contrived. It's disappointing because there could have been some interesting style to the storytelling. They instead give endless closeup shots of the singers to tell the story but here it doesn't work. It's still pretty enjoyable if you are in for the songs that you've already heard in the theater show. Les Miserables is a dazzling film with remarkable performances but it doesn't make enough difference to the original musical.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Where were you Alfie?,"I am giving 6 stars because I have been a long time fan of Les Mis since attending the premier of the show in Sydney in 1987 starring Normie Rowe, Debbie Byrne and the memorable Philip Quast as Inspector Javert. And I am being generous because of the enormous effort all of the crew have obviously put into this film and for the actors' acting performances. BUT I believe the creators have made a gigantic fatal error in the whole concept of the production. Instead of being the ""not to be missed"", ""most brilliant film of the year"" it has turned out to be just ""worth seeing"" and a ""very commendable effort"".I am sure when the film was being conceived they must have first asked the question - Is the film a drama or a musical? Or is it a combination of both? To me what carries Les Mis is the wonderful heart rending MUSIC and SONGS. And great songs should be sung by great singers. Yes, I know there are commercial considerations and the star appeal of actors in various countries can make or break a movie. Was this the reason the producers have gone in the main for actors even if some have claims to be able to make a reasonable effort at tuning their vocal chords to lyrics? The answer to the question of drama or musical for Les Mis the film is evident in the screenplay as the spoken words versus the singing words could be counted on one hand. And Messrs and Madams producers, some of the songs in Les Mis are extremely demanding, even for trained opera singers and despite the fact that the actors tried their guts out, I am afraid they were given an impossible task.I recognize doing it live with actors was very courageous and sure the actors poured their hearts out, but how they did it in the days of ""South Pacific"", ""Kiss Me Kate"", ""Carousel"" and ""Oklahoma"" with Howard Keel, Gordon MacRae and Kathryn Grayson and co was much, much more effective. And they didn't need a camera stuck in their face to pick up the sound or visual cutaways to distract from the off tune notes. Don't get me wrong I love Hugh Jackman and his performance in his own version of Oklahoma was outstanding - but the challenging vocal range required for Jean Valjean!!! And Anne Hathaway deserves praise for a gut wrenching ""I dreamed a dream"" but I don't think it will get 115 million hits on YouTube.There was one notable exception to the rule of natural singers v actors trying to be singers and that was Samantha Barks who also played Eponine in the ""Les Mis√©rables in Concert the 25th Anniversary"" who demonstrated how a song could be sung by a singer with ""On My Own"" and what a startling contrast to the rest?But the greatest shame of all was that the real star of the 25th anniversary London show who made the Jean Valjean role his own and who raised rapturous applause to every song he sang, who could have made the film great, was missing in the film's casting.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables est  tres miserable,"I don't regret much in my life. I've done lots of things I would rather not have done but at least can say it was an experience and I've learned something.Last night I watched Les Miserables and it was a dire experience from opening ridiculously over the top scene to the drawn out (for god's sake just die!!) scene at the end. I came out thinking ""i've just lost two hours of my life that I'll never get back.If just one of the actors could sing it would have been some blessed relief but apart from he chorus there wasn't a single a single redeeming voice in the cast. Where is Susan Boyle when you need her ?From Hugh Jackmans wondering accents to the little boy on the barricades doing his artful dodger impression and Amanda Sefreid warbling like an anaemic canary this ""musical"" was a travesty.Surely when you are casting a musical the requisite should be for singers who can maybe act and not actors who think they have a bit of a singing voice in the shower.Les Mis is my favourite all time musical but no-one in there wildest dreams would consider buying the sound track to this hack job.To be fair my wife said it was OK but even she got bored towards the end and there were a few boxes of hankies being used around me but it wouldn't do if we were all the same , would it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly incredible and sentimental,"I confess that I got surprised in the first 15 minutes of the movie, when at no time did the actors stop singing for ""normal lines"", I had never seen a movie with that format.So I say that the feature film is surprisingly good, even if it seems strange at first.In at least three moments in the story I really was prone to crying (Anne Hathaway simply destroys her role, even though she appears a little bit lightly) and this is something that does not happen often when I watch movies.The plot brings a sad story that at the same time criticizes ancient times of humanity, but can also be understood as a parallel with the world today.The actors are all incredibly good in their roles, both in acting and singing. Maybe my only problem with the film is its duration, in several moments I stopped to look at how much time was left to finish, not enough to be annoying, but if I had a half hour more it could be more easily accessible.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: Les Miserables,"Director Tom Hooper charges ahead from his Oscar winner The King's Speech, with an ambitious adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, a story that has had countless of musical staging, with most people holding dear to their favourite interpretation of characters and scenes. Boasting a stellar star studded A-list ensemble, Hooper's version has ingredients that makes it Academy Awards contender, although the challenge may seem to be getting audiences to embrace this glossy version made for the screen, which is never easy for something that's been around for more than three decades.Set in 19th century France spanning decades, we follow the life story of the thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) through his time under duress serving hard labour under the watchful eyes of cop Javert (Russell Crowe), the latter adamant that the ol' leopard can never change its spots during the former's parole, only for Jean to be touched by religion when he was forgiven, and given a new lease of life to do good. And I guess you probably know the drill by now, that Jean goes on to be a successful businessman, still being pursued by Javert, encounters Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whom he saves, which the story going into the second chapter of saving Fantine's daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen), before making another quantum leap when Cosette, now played by Amanda Seyfried, discovers true romance with Marius (Eddie Redmayne), who is part of the student leaders on the cusp of launching another revolution.It's pretty much of an endurance marathon sitting through close to three hours, where unlike a musical or a stage play, you'd get an intermission. For starters it takes some getting used to, because every spoken word is sung (yes I know it's a musical) almost back to back, with the multitude of recognizable tunes from Work Song to Do You Hear The People Sing sung by the cast members, who have been put through singing lessons, otherwise one can guess how this would turn out if sounding less than professional. Hugh Jackman was fairly inconsistent in delivery, while Russell Crowe proved that he can't do this full time, since his Javert almost always came off quite one-note, and having a distinct lack of feel for the character. Anne Hathaway on the other hand, nailed it spot on with her I Dreamed a Dream, and is just about one of the best things in the film.Film as a medium to present musicals have always been a fascinating journey, because of the characteristics that come with the medium. With film, it allows for expansive sets to be constructed, taking on a more three dimensional feel to the story telling since it's not just being on stage in front of you. Camera movement helps to provide spatial content, with jump cuts also producing an equivalent effect if necessary to move the narrative from location to location in double quick time.But while the medium had opened up space, Hooper took on an intent to allow audiences a different experience, in putting us up close and personal with the performers. This is something one rarely gets in a staged musical because even the first row is a distance away. Hooper puts us just next to the characters with his plenty of close ups, that we probably get to see every facial expression and twitch as the characters express themselves through song. So once the actors open their mouths, we're put right there in the thick of the action, whether you'd like it or not. It makes for an engrossing watch, but for the quality art direction and lush production values to be appreciated, your eyes have to quickly dart around before the next musical number comes on.You'd have your own personal favourite scenes from the musical, and I have three - with the three way romance between Cosette, Marius and Eponine (Samantha Barks) which is ever so brief but no less making a tremendous impact, having Jean Valjean go up against Javert in every instance to allow one to determine whether Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe would fare better than the other when they sing, and the limited scenes in which Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter make their appearance as the thieving Thenardiers, providing comic relief for the very heavy themes and story line involving one man's redemption, rivalry, tragic romance, all against the backdrop of a student led armed revolt.Not having the luxury of sitting through a live stage performance of this musical, Tom Hooper has done enough to drum interest to a level high enough to want to do so when Les Miserables comes to town the next time round. Meanwhile, make do with this lavish production meant for the screen, and be immersed in a world and story as first envisioned by Victor Hugo, and adapted from the Cameron Mackintosh musical.

Les Mis√®rables,"The snobs with award show voting rights all said Russell Crowe wasn't right for the role. I think he did a killer job. He gives a tortured and brilliant performance as Javert, and deserves an Oscar nomination for it. We as viewers feel the demons battling it out in this guy's head. He's bewildered by Jean's (Hugh Jackman) compassion and forgiveness, that he begins to doubt himself. He wants to believe man can't change; that all men play different roles in life, and those are their roles to play until the day they die. So when ex-slave convict and changed man, Jean Valjean approaches Javert, who commanded him during his slave days and vowed to find him when he escaped, with compassion and understanding. Jean has a greater perspective on life, and Javert is perplexed by what he sees in him. In his mind, Javert remembers a convict, a greasy good-for-nothing criminal slave, but through his eyes he sees a great man, a man who is leader-like and strong willed, yet a man with love and understanding for the poor. Keep in mind, all these complex emotions are delivered through song. The film literally has very few lines that aren't to a tune, and many of those are battle cries/commands.Now that I've addressed the offensively underrated Russell Crowe performance, I'd like to move on to the Anne Hathaway performance which everyone recognizes as great. That's because it is. Though her character is only present for the first 45 minutes, Hathaway's heartwrenching, tearjerking performance leaves an impact that lasts for the film's massive two hour and forty minute duration, and then about another couple days after that. She plays Fantine, a factory worker trying to accumulate enough money to both feed herself and send some to her daughter, who is being raised by a hilariously dastardly couple played by Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) and Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club). When she loses her job at the factory, her life is reduced to ruins. She starts by selling her hair for ten franks, and then surrenders herself to a life as a prostitute. When Jean finds her, and realizes he's responsible for firing her and forcing her into the life she's living, he is struck with guilt and sorrow, and vows to take care of her daughter, Cosette.Hugh Jackman is also delivers a wonderful performance as Jean, who ages through a twenty year period with some very good makeup work. It is so intriguing, yet so heartwarming to see how Jean, though through parts of his life is very rich, and parts of his life he is dirt-poor, always stays the same in terms of character. When he is greeted by fortune, he doesn't become a nasty, greedy man. He in fact attempts to use his wealth to help others, especially Fantine, after he witnesses what he's accidentally done to her.But what are we left with other than the spectacular acting? Only careful direction, masterful production design, and the overwhelming grandeur of the passionate and striking music. It's a lot to claim for a musical that's already been made into a movie two or three times before, but despite a few scenes that felt stretched and unnecessary, and there were literally only two or three, I was completely captivated and marvelously astounded by Tom Hooper's Les Mis√®rables.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Bittersweet Destiny,"I'll level with you I'm not a fan of the musical genre, it's just not my genre. There are very few I like because they pertain to my interests, for me my fav is ""Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog"". But this is one of those rare exceptions because it really is one that has you going though the motions, it truly is both touching and downright heartbreaking at the same time. It's also one of the few films that I actually cry to which is rare for me.I really love the production value, the set pieces are great recreating a country in both it's glory and ruin in times long gone. The songs are great and memorable, it's almost hard to pick which are my favorites I'll just pick three of them. Number three, ""I Dream the Dream"" this is a sad but beautiful song because it's about optimism coming to an end. Number two it's ""One More Day"" as we see different characters, what their doing today and what their thinking about tomorrow. But of course my favorite is ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" it is just an epic and uplifting song almost makes you want to sing.However for me what really powered the film was both the characters and the story. The story I felt was great I like the fact that at times it almost kinda a Christan story. There were some Christ like parallels as well as some themes on existence, finding the right path, doing onto others, belief and hope.The characters on my list I really like each have a parallel with each other but one thing in common and that is all of them are struggling for existence in a unfair and unfit society.Anne Hathaway was great in her small role as Fantine whom just really has it bad, you really feel for her doing what she can to keep her daughter and even her dreams alive.Hugh Jackman whom is an actor I really like (yeah, I'm a fan of X-Men 1 and 2)I felt was really great as Jean Valjean. He's also a character you really feel pathos for because this guy just had it bad and didn't deserve it. I really love the fact that he not just was able to pick himself up in the world proving he's not a man defined by label. But really how selfless he is, he is never a person thinking about himself, he's always getting out of his way for the sake of the other.Marius played well by Eddie Redmayne he's a character I like. He's a good guy whom is rebellious and a little naive but in a good way. One thing I really like about his character is just like Jean doesn't let class or labels define him. Though his circumstances are different from the rest because he use to be a person that lived in the upper class. But life there wasn't roses and cream for him, his family was hardly warm or loving, and they cut him off all because he wanted to go his own way in life and the people he befriends are from the lower class most notably Eponine.Cosette played well by Amanda Seyfried is pretty and kinda cute. She's sweet has a slight naivety to her, she is a character of sympathy just like Jean before she had it good she had it really bad. You of course see her childhood, she's forced to live away from her mom and works for this rotten greedy family that gives her practically nothing not even a doll as you see she had only a mop strain doll so that really sucks. It makes me grateful that she now has grew up well, has a good life and the bad one behind her. I do like her chemistry with Marius both do click well and it feels right both deserve each other despite what I feel about Eponine which I'll get to latter.Though for me my favorite character is Eponine played flawlessly by Samamtha Barks whom I think is so fraking hot. Eponine was just a character I fell in love with. Just like with Jean and Corsette she grew up on the wrong side of the tracks with the lousy parents the Thenardiers, surprisingly she didn't grow up to be anything like them and it once more demonstrates my point. But she is just beautiful inside and out, she's sweet also but I like that she's a little feisty. I really love the chemistry between both Marius and her, both characters were childhood friends which makes the feel for both more genuine. And is also part of why I felt the most pathos for her because her character sees Marius as more than just a friend, she loves him. Don't get me wrong I do like both Marius and Corcet together but personally I felt Eponine and him would of been a better match. And that's what makes it all the more heartbreaking, you can just see her aching for him, having these feeling for him she want's to bring out but is unable to because she fears hurting him but worst of all he just doesn't feel the same way about her. This is something I can emphasize with because this is something that's happened to me a couple of times in my life, so yeah I understand it too well. There is one scene with her I won't say what it is but it made my heart shatter into pieces and actually break down and cry.Well I've said enough, dream of better days and surely they will come.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,History
Songs were beautiful,"The songs were beautiful. The performance of those songs was also beautiful. Musically, it's a 10. But I give it a 7 because I didn't feel a lot of emotional connection to the characters.

I mean, people don't generally break into song with backup dancers in real life. So there's that...",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Lacking some vocal power, but fantastic film nonetheless","As a man, I most certainly did NOT cry through the whole of Les Miserables because that would be weak and unmanly. Ahem. This is a film deserving every nomination and win it is receiving. It is a near perfect blend of the musical, and the book. I think its a blazing example of how to turn a musical into an emotionally charged film that delivers sterling performances from all the actors involved, without being limited by the strict confines of music. It goes beyond any musical I have seen as a movie, virtually creating a genre in itself. Hugh Jackman's voice strongly contrasts against the traditional Colm Wilkinson - but his acting is fantastic, and I got used to his voice. I thought that Russel Crowe did a far better job than critics have been attempting to persuade me. Naturally Anne Hathaway's performance is heart-rending, and equalled by Samantha Barks.I highly recommend seeing this - if you are a fan of the book or musical you will enjoy everything that film brings to an adaptation, and if you have never heard of either - then this an easily accessible way of seeing one of the greatest tales in literature, and in music.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"I love Les Miz, but this film makes me cry","Jackman as Valjean and Crowe as Javert totally ruin this film for me. They are simply not up to par vocally compared to any traveling show I've seen. And this is a musical, for crying out loud, so if your can't sing the part with conviction, it's just not going to work. Valjean bonus song in the carriage with Cosette is unlistenable as is any scene with Javert. The rest of the cast is passable.Overall, the cinematography is disturbingly dark (I get it, they are miserable after all), but the handheld cameras And constant closeup shots don't help.I love LES MIS√âRABLES-it's my favorite all time musical-but this film hurts me and makes me want to cry.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Grand Musical Made Dull,"Firstly, if Tom Hooper wanted to make the musical more like Victor Hugo's novel, then he should have just adapted the novel. The changes here from the musical work against the movie's favor because they turn the fantastical into the mundane.Secondly, recording all the songs live on the set is certainly impressive, but as an audience member it felt like it reduced the ability of the songs and the music to convey the emotion of the scene. In a musical, the emotions come from the songs, and when a song is sung in a slobbery whisper the emotions are muted, no matter how well or realistically the actor is crying.Thirdly, the on-set recording also constricted the camera's ability to capture wide shots. This created a claustrophobic feeling and for a musical with as grand a story as Les Miserables this was a huge problem. It also made each song look and feel the same, which is a real problem for a musical like this where every line of dialogue is sung. It gets tedious very quickly.Fourthly, I don't think Hugh Jackman can sing the part of Jean Valjean. ""Bring Him Home"" kind of falls off the mark from every other version I've seen. Acting-wise, sure, but this is a musical and I had a hard time buying him. Plus, that new song ""Suddenly"" is a bore and was certainly made and inserted solely for a chance at an Oscar.Fifthly, the stage actors, Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and Samantha Barks as Eponine, are terrific. They carry their songs with confidence and ease. They were a pleasure to watch and listen to. It's a shame their great parts were reduced for the more famous members of the cast.Lastly, I can't hate this. I love the stage show too much and despite this feeling completely different I still watch it from time to time.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Tom Hooper you wuz robbed,"I have one question about the film. How the hell was Tom Hooper overlooked at the Oscar nominations for best director? I've just seen the film. He had a monumental task on his hands, and he pulled it off with great aplomb. I think it's down to Hollywood politics, they want Spielberg to win for Lincoln and this could have upset the apple cart. Don't get me wrong I like Spielberg, he is one of the great directors of all time, but after seeing what Hooper did with this film, he deserved at least a shot.There were some great touches, especially with the barricade. Having a couple of coffins at the front was a nice touch of black humour, and when one of the main characters died, can't remember if it was Eponine or Gavroche, part of a banner was above their heads with a single word 'mort' which I believe is the french word for death.Overall the performances were all high quality and my father who saw it with me was a bit nervous about it being ruined being a fan of it, but he was blown away and he is a hard man to please with modern film.Go see it, and you'll probably agree about my main point.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Not done in the style of most musicals and an excellent movie.,"Just to warn people, there are two big criticisms you really shouldn't let bother you: 1.) It's not Broadway, because it's a movie. No matter what, it was never going to be the same thing as a good stage production of Les Miserables anyway. 2.) No movie should be expected to be completely faithful to a book. If somebody paints a painting about something, and later, somebody writes a song about the exact same thing, people don't expect the lyrics of the song to perfectly explain the painting, but this movie is fair and true enough to the original Victor Hugo novel and story. In the case of the original Les Miserables, Victor Hugo's novel from the 1800s is 1,900 pages long and it wasn't a musical anyway. You couldn't fit all of a book that size into 5 movies, but this movie is true enough to the original story. Plus it fits in almost all of the original Broadway production music.That being said, I'm not really a big fan of musicals, in fact I tend to not like them, Oklahoma-boring, South Pacific-who cares. About the only musicals I ever really liked include Pink Floyd The Wall and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.But this movie is excellent, as in everybody-in-the-theater-claps-at-the-end excellent.It's basically not done in song and dance style. Characters are moving around and in action the whole time. There is some spoken dialogue, but it is done very much in the style of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, a movie in which 100% of the dialogue is sung. These are basically the only two musicals of this type of style or technique. In The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, you quickly don't notice they are singing at all anymore, and you go through the whole movie as if you are just listening to people talking or arguing, but in this Les Miserables, sometimes you don't notice that they are singing, while other times, well, they are definitely belting it out, but still within the flow of dialogue, and the action of the movie keeps going. They don't interrupt the action to stop and do a big tap dance and singing number or anything like that. In fact, you don't even notice when they are going from straight spoken dialogue and back to singing, sometimes even mid-sentence, and sometimes a character is replying to singing with spoken dialogue, as the two get mixed right in together perfectly.It you just want the Les Miserables story in a movie but without the music, then watch the 1997 version directed by Bille August, as that is a really good movie. (And includes stars Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes and Geoffrey Rush.)But remember, the musical Les Miserables has been more to the stage than what movies like The Godfather or even Casablanca ever were to the silver screen. It's number one, with more people having seen a stage production of Les Miserables than Annie, Cats, South Pacific, The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, Rent, Miss Saigon, Evita, or anything else, and there is a reason for that and that reason is basically the music. Along with the story of course, but its music is really just that powerful.You could just watch a recording of some NYC or London stage production of Les Miserables on DVD. There are plenty of those, including ones that are hardly even stage productions but rather more so just opera singers on stage taking turns singing the music. But you aren't going to get a movie type story experience out of those. Just the same, no matter how well done, a good Broadway quality stage performance of Les Miserables is going to be 5 times better than even a perfect Les Miserables musical movie.This movie is produced like a movie and not as the filming of a stage production.A movie movie, as we expect it, sets its scenes wherever they need to be. When a character is hiking over the top of a mountain, they are actually there filming on the top of a mountain. That is how this movie usually is. When they are out on the streets of Paris, they are out on the streets of Paris. It's a movie. And it's the story well told. And it's the music. All in one.Putting all of those things together in one Les Miserables movie, well it's hard to imagine anybody doing it much better or even trying to. A few imperfections or weaknesses are there, but not enough for anybody to try to outdo it anytime soon. Some of the outdoor scenes could have been shot on a location in some French city or town, rather than having buildings or skylines look so much like stage sets or computer generated images. Next to none of the waterfront scenes looked like they were just shot on an actual location, with all sorts of ships and things looking like stage sets or computer generations. Some of the actors could have cut their cockney stage accents for just straight modern English occasionally touched with French accents or pronunciations as needed. (After all, they already weren't shooting in French, so why bother with any fake old timey stage accents that only make characters that much harder to understand?) They could have taken a page from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and seriously stuck to realism and naturalism, rather than appearing as stage performers performing on a stage so much. There were some mighty wobbly cameras in a few scenes.Even if you are not big fan of Victor Hugo or of musicals, this should still be enough of an action and adventure movie to keep you well entertained. It's long, but that was something unavoidable in order to fit in both enough of the story and the music.Overall, it's excellent. A rare 9 out of 10 stars for me.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Story, Great Movie","I've never been a big fan of musicals. I was recently introduced to this story via some earlier movie versions and began reading the book. Regardless of adaptation, the story is a great one. It is a critique of man's ways and a story of redemption(s).I found this adaptation to be very ""human"". Actors are shown with all flaws showing, and many added for the roles being played. The singing was great at times, flawed at others, but a good mix of the two. Again it was nice to keep the human aspect intact with the singing. It was easy to connect with the characters due to the visual and audible humanness about them.I found Eddie Redmayne's performance to be one of the best - he portrayed his characters emotion on his face and in his voice - and in his eyes - nicely. I'm surprised to not hear more about his performance.Most of all, Les Miserables is a great story! It is food for thought, a social commentary, and at the same time entertaining. If you are not familiar with it as i was until recently, i highly recommend checking it out - again, for the amazing story on it's own.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Mixed Bag--Not as Good as What You Would See on Broadway,"Les Mis is simply one of the greatest musicals ever put to stage. It's one of the longest running shows in Broadway history and is always getting revived on the Great White Way. This version.....ehhhhhOkay, okay, the good: *Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" sequence. I'm sure you've heard about this: it's all done in one take, the shot is kept close and intimate and Hathaway's performance just knocks it out of the park.*Samatha Barks--Her Eponine is pretty great. She has an amazing voice and you can see her theatrical training coming through.The Okay: *Hugh Jackman. I may getting plenty of dislikes for this but here it is. I love Jackman, he's a terrific Wolverine, he's fun, he throws himself into whatever he's working on. But ...he's just not the right choice for Valjean, I'm sorry, he's not. Valjean is a part clearly written for a legit tenor and Jackman is a baritone. You can hear it on Valjean's most famous number, ""Bring Him Home"". Jackman hits the notes but it's clearly a stretch and not where his voice wants to naturally sit.The Bad: *Russell Crowe. Yeah, you knew this was coming. Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. What the HELL were you doing in this movie? To his credit, he is in tune and he does know how to sing a musical phrase. But his STYLE of singing is so incredibly wrong, he's been the butt of a million jokes ever since the movie came out. Yeah, this just has to be one of the worst casting decisions made in cinema history.*Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne. This is another one I might catch flack for. So be it. Seyfried has an INCREDIBLY distracting vibrato and Redmayne sounds like Kermit the Frog. I'm sorry, he does. Plus, the latter's performance of ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""...it just swings and misses. This is one of the big emotional moments of the show, Marius dealing with just this massive amount of survivor's guilt. In the show, I've seen actors tear at their clothes and hair and throw themselves down on their knees as they rage, ""Oh my friends, my friends! Don't ask me what your sacrifice was for!!"" And then as the music plays its last soulful notes, break down into open sobbing. Here, Redmayne just sits in a chair and looks pouty. It just doesn't serve the show well at all.*The constant close-ups. In some scenes, like Hathaway's solo, they serve the movie well. But they are just way over used. The director looks very unimaginative in his choice of cinematography. The places you're taking us are fascinating--how about pulling the shot back so we can see some of them?*Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonhem Carter. I'm sorry, I'm just tired of their....let's call it ""Burton-ing"". We seen it before, we'll see it again. They're not the worse part of the movie, by far (that's probably Crowe) but it's just so distracting.So ....yeah, moments of the movie were good but as a whole, you can tell they just went with as many famous names as they could get and while some did an adequate job, you get the feeling there must have been better choices for a lot of the key roles (Javert, adult Cosette, Marius). If you get a chance to see it on Broadway, by all means, go and see it. You won't be disappointed. But this .....siiiiiggghhhh. You'll just have to take the good with the bad, I'm afraid.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Pleasant Surprise with Wonderful Performance,"This movie is a truly engaging, cinematic achievement, which will remain in hearts and minds for some time. The familiar lead characters: Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, and Anne Hathaway do a phenomenal job in their varied roles, providing a surprising and stimulating performance. An integration of various whimsical/funny elements are introduced, while offset and led by the dramatic.While this movie IS a musical throughout, which should be known and understood to a prospective viewer, the singing becomes second to the story, which is triumphant in its portrayal.For those who can can immerse themselves into the story, and not get distracted by the musical elements, they should find themselves caught off guard, inspired, and lifted up by this really wonderful production. It was certainly worth the time spend in viewing it and in the money paid to share in this grand experience. Based on its category, and up front understanding of Les Miserables, the whole of this movie is well deserving of its high ratings. I give it 10/10. To me, worthy score, leaving my nit-picking of small details off to the side, as they do not detract from the whole of it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A musical you will like even if you don't like musicals.,"It has been a long, long time since I watched a movie that made me feel things like this movie made me feel things.I didn't think I would like this because I usually don't like musicals, but this actually knocked me off my feet. I usually don't cry at movies but this movie brought me pretty damn close at least three times. I honestly didn't realise that the cast had such incredible voices, and in particular Redmayne's 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' and Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' had me absolutely floored. I haven't actually seen a movie that was almost entirely singing with no dialogue before this but I found it breathtaking. I've got to say that I have not read the original book nor seen the stage version so I have no way of comparing this, however I must admit that watching this film makes me want to read the book and see the play.I have heard people say that there are issues with pacing and the over-use of close ups, but I think that the film flowed beautifully and it really didn't even feel like it was two and a half hours. As for the close ups, I think that they brought a beautiful air of intimacy to the story.You will like this film regardless of your stand on musicals.-Sasha",7.0,Anonymous,History
Inconsistent but OK,"Thought parts of this film outstanding. I wasn't enamoured by all the casting. Some offered great marquee value, but mediocre vocal value. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and actress playing Epinome were brilliant. For a musical to be turned into a film, this was one of the better one's I've seen, but still prefer this one live. Nothing beats seeing the volume of live singers on stage singing One More Day and Do You Hear the People Sing. The film can't capture close to this. Aside from that stylistically, I disliked the number of close ups and found the fact that they went in and out of focus as the performer moved singing irritating. Really pulled me out of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Where Are Rogers and Hammerstein When You Need Them?,"Don't get me wrong: I do like musicals. But I only like musicals that have real music in them with songs that have something to do them. Musicals I do like for example are The Sound of Music, Oklahoma and West Side Story. They all have something this movie didn't - good songs. In this movie, the music was so terrible it ruined the movie. It would have been a half way decent movie if they eliminated the songs altogether and the actors just delivered their dialog without the singing the dialog to what I can only describe as droning the words. The lesson is this: If you don't have good songs and people like Rogers and Hammerstein with the wonderful ability to write good songs, don't even try to make a musical. I turned it off after a half hour. Victor Hugo's Les Miserables is a wonderful story. Too bad they chose to ruin it.",3.0,Anonymous,History

One of the best films in a long time.,"In my opinion,Les Miserables is a lot like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Both didn't live up to my full hype but I could see why there was such a hype. Les Miserables is a big movie adapted from a big musical adapted from a big book and it shows. Granted,it's not the best film that I have ever seen but it's definitely going to stick in my mind.The scale of it was amazing, the songs were really good,if not a bit tedious after a while and the casting was pretty much perfect. Some highlights include Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, Samantha Barks as Eponine and Sacha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenadiers. The Thenadiers make this movie, I don't think I have laughed that much at a movie in a long time and I would happily pay the price of admission and watch it again just to see them. As for the flaws that everyone else has complained of,they didn't bother me. The angles weren't that distracting and Russell Crowe actually has a decent singing voice on him, compared to the others in the cast,it does sound out of place but if he was in something like Jesus Christ Superstar,then it would sound a lot better. Overall, Les Miserables is a musical unlike the usual type and is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It rests on Jackman's shoulders,"The big screen adaptation of the musical version of Les Mis√©rables has Anne Hathaway knock it out of the park with an emotional version of 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Hugh Jackman shows that he can easily glide from action star to all round singing and dancing entertainer. Russell Crowe despite fronting his own band needs a few more singing lessons.Victor Hugo's epic tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) in 19th century France. Jailed for stealing a loaf of bread and running when chased. He spent years in jail and then more years hunted by the determined policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) for breaking his parole conditions.Valjean has become rich and successful and tried to do good for others. However he failed factory girl Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whose life descended in misery and prostitution. To make amends he takes care of her daughter Cosette. However Valjean cannot escape his past and France is heading for revolution.This is a big musical spectacle. Director Tom Hooper knows which big set pieces to stage for the cinema. Although the novel is long, the film is too long. Some of the songs are rather forgettable.

A very powerful movie,"It's kind of sad that we live in a world where critics give 63 to a movie like this, and a nonsensical comment backed up by a 8/10 mark given tops the comments.

There are not only Iron Man, and Joker, and Ghostbusters as powerful figures in this world's cinemas (not that I have anything against them) , but also Fantine, and Javert, and Jean Valjean and plenty of others; and also the artists who create an unimaginable atmosphere and the poetry that changes a genre forever. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes for half of the movie! The poetry of images and music is incredibly powerful!!I loved this movie because it had made me emotional for 2.5 hours continuously, and this did not happen but once in a decade. Maybe. ""The Stalker"" moved me in the same way, about 4 decades ago, and some others in between. Thank you to all those (actors, director, producers, everyone!!) who gave me this gift!

An Ambitious Adaptation: A Double-Edged Sword in Balancing Emotion and Execution,"This film adaptation excels in creating an emotionally immersive experience, bringing the audience up close and personal with its characters through innovative cinematography. The decision to use live singing is a bold move that both enhances emotional authenticity and occasionally compromises vocal quality. While visually engaging, the movie struggles with pacing, especially in the latter half, where momentum seems to falter. The attention to detail in set design and costumes successfully evokes the era, adding layers of authenticity. Despite these strong points, the film may not fully engage those unfamiliar with the original work, as it can feel weighed down by its own gravitas and lengthy runtime. Overall, it is an ambitious but uneven adaptation that will likely be a hit with fans of the source material but may leave newcomers less captivated.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A 3 Hour Root Canal would be less painful,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Interestingly, Russell Crowe has gotten canned which is a shame, because he actually did a good job. Listening to Wolverine, whom I like, sing for three hours was painful. Sorry, but Hugh Jackman was terribly miscast. Anne Hathaway was decent, but she cannot sing either. The ONLY really good performance in this movie was the child, who by the way comes from the London Stage production of Oliver. It showed. He could sing. He had talent. Otherwise this was an assembly of basically TV actors and a couple rock star types. The real tragedy of this movie is that the people who could have done it justice, those with musical stage capability, never got the chance to make the kind of money Hugh Jackman, et. al pulled down for this.The other terrible thing was the closeups. A few would have been artistically interesting. Filming this thing so you could look at the adams apples of all the stars was strange and not very pleasant.A bad filming of a great book and a great stage play.

Male leads aren't strong enough to carry musical adaptation.,"I have long been a fan of Les Miserables and appreciate that it is a long and heavy story to adapt into a screenplay. Most of the film versions I have seen haven't come close to the stage production or the book. But I was looking forward to a musical adaptation although was unsure how this would transfer to the big screen. Therefore I delayed watching it until I caught it on Sky the other night and concluded that my reservations were right.Whilst I applaud the director for insisting the actors sing live, I think the film fails from the moment Hollywood stars were cast. If you are going to adapt one of the most famous shows of all time then use trained singers. The choice of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were poor since neither of these actors can sing well enough to carry the film. Anne Hathaway, as everyone has said, is excellent, but she is only on screen for a short part of the film. This story rests on strength of the two male characters and, whilst they are both good actors in their own right, their vocal range are not. So either the director should have just adapted this as a straightforward film using Hollywood actors to do what they do best and act. Or he should have used existing members of the stage show who can then deliver the songs properly. I can't help but feel that the studio were more concerned about making money and so cast two famous Hollywood stars in the lead, without thinking that quality singing is expected. What a pity because the actual visuals and story telling were not bad. I give this a generous 6 out of 10 and would recommend people go and see the stage production or read the book instead.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The viewer will be enraptured by the lyrics of the songs in particular-many lines are often quoted in my household (""red, the blood of angry men,"" ""lovely ladies,"" etc). My favorite is ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" which is performed incredibly in this film twice. I have heard many complaints that the singing is not up to scratch, but personally found that the occasional faltering contributes to the weariness and raw emotion of the characters. Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne stand out for their acting performances, while Samantha Barks and Helena Bonham Carter shine with vocals. Overall, this movie performance is immersive, easy to follow, and well acted.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Too close to the stage musical?,"I do love the story and have watched most of the filmed versions that have appeared over the years with the Gerard Depardieu version being my own favourite. Financially this film has been a great success, I just wish they had worked harder to make the most of what a cinematic version might offer and it could have been another Oliver or West Side Story, but sadly it's not. So few musicals appear to work to fully utilise the medium of film and this one fails on many counts. 1. if your actors can't sing, don't force them to perfom long and avoidable solos! Poor Hugh Jackman did his best, but even an actor of his calibre can't compensate for such a long and unflattering spotlight. 2.Intersperse the songs with other stuff! 10 minutes of action does not mean the next 40 minuites can be overlooked. 3.Give people rousing choruses that they can sing along to. This film almost managed it, but felt the need to change track every time it got close. 4.You don't need to get your actors to sing every single bit of dialog. I think someone cottoned on to this about 3/4 of the way through, but then thought better of it. As it stands, this version is about an hour too long. i just hope its scale doesn't put anyone off from making another musical version some time in the future as it could be so much better than this.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Don't bother and go see the stage performance,"Review of the soundtrack of Les Mis√©rables film form iTunes Les Mis√©rables (Highlights From the Motion Picture Soundtrack)As I have not seen the film I thought I would buy the soundtrack that is now on sale as a taster of things to come. I was quite excited and rather looking forward to this sound track and the seeing the film that we had all awaited for so long. After listening to this soundtrack I have to report the following, sadly.Listening to the soundtrack is rather like spending a few hours at an all inclusive holiday at Auswitch concentration camp with all the joys that would bring one. It was simply dreadful.It must have taken a great deal of care and effort to seemingly ruin one of the worlds greatest musicals by simply casting people with weak and utterly uninteresting singing voices that are totally unsuitable for the parts that we all love and cherish.Hugh Jackman has a slightly pleasant singing voice in a smokey drunken karaoke way but possess a very weak voice that simply does not bring justice to the part of Jean Valjean and the stunning songs that he has throughout the story. Jackman does not it seem possess the power needed to pull of the songs we all know and love from the stage play. Just such a disappointment.Russell Crowe, which did seem to be good casting, does manage to impart the feeling of menace to some degree but that is probably just his own character coming though but again, while slightly better than Jackman, does fail in expectation to the stunning songs that his character of Javert has throughout the play. Sounds like PC Plod humming to himself as he happily fits you up for some crime or another.Anne Hathaway is dreadful in the extreme and manages to butcher every song she has performed and again is weak throughout. From listening to her I wold not care what happens to her just that it happened quickly so that it was over and done with.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter have managed to lose all the humor and warmth of their stage parts while managing to keep the dislike of their characters but for all the wrong reasons and their singing voices are utterly, utterly awful. Again powerful parts from the stage play ruined beyond all belief.The only person that was it seems was any good was Eddie Redmayne and does a good job at his role of Marius.With such expectation it was just so disappointing to hear the sound track and I would recommend that any one who wants to see Les Mis should see it in a theater where it seems this show belongs but not in a cinema where everything that this show had that made us all love it for so many years has been destroyed by Hollywood or who ever had the nerve to put this film out there.

Generosity and love always prevails,"The story of Valjean (his duo with Javert), the victory of Republic in France history over monarchy is the strong epitome of liberty, freedom's overwhelming power over selfishness and autocracy.

Musical and revolt,"""Les Mis√©rables"" is filled with intolerable sentimentality and some songs which are show-stoppers and I mean show-stoppers. It also has a social context, as Victor Hugo had, and this version focuses much on that. Which is good. Mainstream has for too long not wanted to worry audiences about such things.All actors sing themselves and Russell Crowe has some real talent for it. The film is colorful also for other reasons, although 2,5 hours is a little too long. In stage versions, there is an intermission.You can surely smell France in the early 1800s, although it maybe doesn't have much to do with the mood of Victor Hugo.

Of course, Victor Hugo, author of the book, Les Miserables, played an important role in beauty of the movie because the book is one of the best.

Never Watched Before,"I was told the film contained little to no dialogue and that the entire film would be sung which threw me off a little. I'm not oblivious to theatre, but I'm not exactly a die hard fan either. The actual acting is top notch, don't think they could have chosen a better cast, although Crowe is not the best singer. Hathaway plays a great part, for the time she has, and Baron-Cohen lights up the film along with Bonham-Carter. Samantha Barks was great, she has a lovely voice and is the perfect fit for Eponine. The story itself, this being the first time experiencing, was OK. Partially predictable and I'm not sure it belongs on movie screens, it seemed like one big play really.

Mostly good,"Based on the very popular stage musical and the French novel by Victor Hugo, this British film chronicles difficult lives among a dozen or so French citizens in the 1800s including an attempted student revolution.In the capable hands of director Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), this film is always beautiful to look at. The music is fine as well for the most part though not equal to the singing on the recording of the original stage version. Many songs are well sung but lack the belting-out moments so frequent on the stage version recording.This film would have had the same challenge as adapting ""Mamma Mia"" to the screen a few years ago. A film version needs 'famous' film actors who might not sing as well as lesser-known stage actors who are brilliant singers. Here, ""Les Mis"" does better than ""Mamma Mia"" though there remain challenges.Russell Crowe isn't a bad singer but doesn't have an inspiring voice either. Hugh Jackman gives a fine acting performance and also sings well. In the pivotal song ""Bring Him Home"", he causes many goosebump moments but it's hard not to compare his version with that of the great stage actor Colm Wilkinson (who has a small role in this film) and feel that Jackman's version is less powerful than Wilkinson's.Much fuss has been rightly made about Anne Hathaway's version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"". Not only does she sing it beautifully but she is able to powerfully act out the words of despair as well without interrupting the flow of the song. It's unfortunate that her performance is so brief. Also faring very well is newcomer Samantha Barks's version of ""On My Own"".Other grand moments include the songs with many singers such as ""One Day More"" and the grand finale ""When Tomorrow Comes"" which is heavenly in many ways. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent film adaptation of Hugo's work,"One day, having gathered a large company, we decided to go to the cinema. At that time, it was not possible to choose something suitable for everyone. But here everyone paid attention to a massive poster with the inscription: ""Les Miserables"", where famous Hollywood personalities flaunted: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried and others. I remembered the famous work of Victor Hugo, according to which the film was actually made. What do. We decided to go for it.None of us even knew it was a musical. The beginning and the brave song of the convicts discouraged. I still remember how my friends and I began to look at each other, suddenly realizing that we would have to listen to the songs of the whole movie. But you know, I don't regret at all that we saw this masterpiece that evening. By the end of the first piece of music, we, as the audience unprepared for the musical, accepted the rules of this narrative and completely immersed ourselves in the history of the characters.The project was created with special care and attention to detail. The narration is conducted at an excellent pace, the scale of the project and the coordinated work of all production departments are felt. There are charismatic characters in the frame, excellent scenery around, allowing you to really believe in the reality of the whole world of the past, well, costumes, makeup and props are beyond praise. No wonder the picture won an Oscar, Saturn and the British Academy Prize for makeup and hairstyles.There is no point in retelling the story. Probably everyone interested in Hugo's classics knows the interesting story of the Outcasts in the work of the same name. A non-standard film adaptation with a large number of songs only adds to the scale of the work and allows you to reveal the characters much deeper, which I did not see later in any of the other adaptations of Les Miserables.With all the colorfulness of the project, he personally impressed me with the performance of the actors. Each of the characters is represented on the screen by masterful actors and actresses. Everyone is beautiful in their role. Even if the film is quite tearful, but you take this approach, you are ready to feel the pain and bitterness of the characters, their motivation, a difficult fate, a different ending for everyone. Anne Hathaway is particularly impressive. Even a decade later, I remember her playing in this project and I can say with confidence that the girl received the Oscar rightfully for her role.The line of confrontation between the heroes of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe is fascinating. Their Jean Valjean and Javert seem to be playing a chess game throughout the whole picture. Each of the characters has his own clear beliefs, each is right in his own way, and you, as a spectator, fully accept the characters as such and empathize with each of them. Sometimes you just want to be there, between these men, stop them, explain how their confrontation looks from the outside, try to reconcile and explain that everything that is happening is a difficult combination of circumstances, and they should accept each other's positions and maybe even make friends. Naively, I agree. But it was these feelings that dominated me for most of the film.Another important line is the hard fate of Fantine. She is one of many whose life was very hard during the harsh years of the early 19th century. Scene by scene, frame by frame, you worry about the heroine Anne Hathaway. Her fate tears the soul of the viewer, and the actress gives her all 120 percent. You believe her, she merged with the character, did a great job.Eddie Ramaine and Amanda Seifred convey the spirit of the revolutionary young generation through their heroes Marius and Cosette, people who had their own ideas about justice for everyone and were ready to follow the call of their hearts and minds. Idealists, they did not spare themselves, entering into an unequal battle with the opposing force. It's dangerous, it's difficult, it can be fatal in the end. However, such actions teach them to be brave and true to their conscience.In the end, I want to say about the musical component. There are a lot of songs in the movie, and they are really good. A lot of melodies are remembered, the lyrics appear colorful and literally chopping, showing the cruel truth about the world in which the heroes of the work live.""Les Miserables"" is definitely memorable. The musical film is one of the few films that successfully combines all the best from cinema. You should definitely watch this film adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel in order to feel this story in a completely different way than before and remember the bright world that the team of the creators of the picture gave us.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Russell Crowe was bad casting decision,"They likely chose Russell Crowe because of his name, not what he would bring to the role. A million other actors would have been more suitable for the role of Inspector Javert.I don't just mean the horrible singing from Crowe, but just... he wasn't needed in this movie.

Brilliantly filmed, an amazing achievement. I just wish they'd found someone else for the Inspector.",8.0,Anonymous,History
For Fans and/or Novices,"Why you shouldn't see it:You probably heard that Les Miserables is a musical. For the uninitiated, in this case, ""musical"" means nary a line is spoken. All dialog, internal or otherwise, is conveyed to the audience via song (and occasional dance). So if that sort of thing bothers you, I can't imagine that you'll get much of a kick out of this. But really, you've been fairly warned. I may be alone in this, but I think having an entirely musical movie is dangerous territory to tread, because of the difficult balancing act between having catchy tunes and songs that actually advance the plot. It seems like being catchy requires a hook, and most hooks are repetitive, and repetitive things don't really progress. Aside from that, the occasional downside of the musical format is partly inaudible dialog, which in turn stunts the progression of the plot for your mind if you didn't prepare for your film/play-watching by reading the Wikipedia article.Speaking of which, if you do happen to peruse the Wikipedia article, you may surmise that this film is in fact based on a stage musical, which in turn was based on a novel. And not just any novel. A five part, 1500 page, 530,000 word novel that spans nearly 20 years and appears on Wikipedia's list of longest novels, right alongside the likes of War and Peace and Atlas Shrugged. In an industry that typically struggles to compress 150 page novels into two hour movies, I'm wondering what brilliant individual saw this piece that was ten times longer as a two and a half hour trip to the theater.Apologies in advance, as I'm well aware that Les Mis is a wildly popular stage production¬Ö I guess the above is more of a gripe with the original musical mind that saw the novel and decided to turn it into a play. From a story standpoint, the heavily downsized movie version seems disjointed to me, with the main culprits being the two times the screen just flashed the words ""Nine years later..."" How is this all one story? It isn't. It's five stories with common characters. Everything - namely the characters and their relations to one another - just comes across as abrupt when they change. I'm assuming these transitions are either more gradual or are presented in a manner more sensical in the novel, but in a shortened version, they only confused me. Really, I'm trying to figure out how the play became so popular, and I'm leaning toward the music being the key.Why you should see it:This is apparently a highly controversial point, but the main reason I would recommend anyone to see this movie is really just for the moments with Anne Hathaway, and, specifically, her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream."" This was an instance where the director's desire to have his actors act really paid off in my opinion, and I couldn't avoid getting goosebumps when I saw it. Some people will point to other performances of said song as much prettier renditions, but this is a woman in complete despair... Why would she sing beautifully in this moment? Anyway, I thought that one scene alone was fantastic and deserving of Hathaway's Oscar nod (and probable win).Some of the other casting is also well-done, with Hugh Jackman (nominated), Samantha Barks (nominated for other awards) and Eddie Redmayne (nominated for other awards) as obvious examples. Each was able to properly portray their character with appropriate enough musical inclination to also sing their pieces well.Those songs happen to be, as with many things about this movie, hit or miss. Some are fun and catchy, and others appear to be mostly expository and had a harder time sticking with me, a first time viewer/listener. I also understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the original music, editing and remixing it so that it is definitely a different interpretation of the material.Otherwise, the production value for this movie is great. When the opening number started, I got pretty excited about the scale of it all. I'm also pretty fond of the movie poster, which did a great job at capturing my imagination with Cosette's almost haunting eyes. The strange thing about this big budget, large scale production is that the director spends a lot of time showing the audience very little other than the face of the person who is presently singing.In Short:My main complaint about Les Miserables is actually kind of strange, considering the fact that my favorite movie of the year may very well have been Cloud Atlas, but it seems like simply has too much plot to be boiled down into 2.5 hours. The only real reasons I would consider to be must- see for this particular fare would be if you're either a musical fan not familiar with the original stage production or a super fan who needs all things Les Mis. In light of that, I give it my first take-it-or-leave-it recommendation, and rated it a 6 out of 10 mostly for the efforts of Hathaway and Jackman (on whom I have a slight man crush), and the fact that having exposure to a culturally significant work such as this can do a person some good.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Heartwrenching,"I am currently reading the book--I am through about 7% of it according to my Kindle, so the first 5 minutes covered what I had read already, and I was really not prepared for this epic story of redemption and loss.

The the music and lyrics really supported the story line, and deepened the pathos of the characters.In the opening scene the lyrics were a little hard to understand, but it got better, and for the most part solos were completely understandable, while the choruses were a little garbled at times. That was worth maybe a point of one rating star.The one real beef I have is that in the tavern scene, I just really did not think it was necessary to see a prostitute WITH ""Santa"" in a very graphic few seconds....and he would not have been called Santa at that point in history, and don't think he is called ""Santa"" in France.

Over two hours of mediocre singing,"Most people may not be good at spotting this but if your social circle includes actual singers you'll know what I'm referring to.

But if you're into ""mediocre singing"" this movie might be just what you're looking for (it sure made me cringe a couple of times when Russel Crowe opened his mouth).Final remark: sometimes more is more (especially when it comes to post-production editing in terms of the audio).p.s. not all vocal performances were equally bad.

This is a must see movie!,"Remember the lousy version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" a few years ago? Les Miz is nothing like that. It is an amazing adaptation to video and one of the best movies I have seen in years.Go see it. Bring enough tissues too, because you are going to need it.Why should you see it? First of all the story still rings a powerful message even after all these year since it was written. I saw the Broadway play several years ago and it was wonderful. I saw a local High School version of it and liked it even better, but this film version tops them all. A story of judgement, or redemption, of love, of treating people the way we should be treated to bring out the best in all of us. A powerful message we all can relate to.Next: the performances are astounding. I don't understand why they are criticizing some of the performances because for the first time ever, all the songs are recorded just as you see them. They are not lip-syncing anything and this presents a real treat, a raw and emotion laden touch to it all.Then there is the astounding photography to it all that is not all green-screened (although some it). Its one thing to read a book where the pictures are created in your mind and another one to watch someone else's creation of that same information. Because there have been so many versions of this over the years (including other movies) the use of the latest in technology really adds some amazing things to it all.Lastly, the music and the score. It is wonderfully done and never gets old.Go see this movie. It doesn't have a single comic book super hero or alien transformer in site! It has a powerful story that will change the way you see life.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It's good....the play is just better.,"The movie version of ""Les Mis√©rables"" is a hard sell to me, as I was simply blown away when I saw the play in London. I sat in the second row, center, and it just doesn't get any better than that. To this day, it's one of the best plays I have seen--and I have been to Broadway on quite a few occasions and seen many top plays. I am pretty sure that your reaction will depend, in part, on whether you've seen the play. It also didn't help with me that I've seen about a half dozen non-musical versions of the story--including the excellent 1930s French picture.Apart from it simply being better in person, this style musical (without traditional lyrics and choruses you will find yourself singing later), is a hard sell to the public in general. It just doesn't work as well on film, as it loses the spectacle and emotional impact. So am I saying the film is bad? Nah. It just isn't as good--despite some very good acting, decent singing (while some reported that Russell Crowe was weak, I thought his voice just fine), lovely sets and some eye-popping cinematography. It IS a good film. I particularly liked Sacha Baron Cohen's song and dance number (get a load of the cat's tail!) but everyone seemed to try quite hard to make this film well.While I could say more, I noticed that there are almost 700 reviews for this film, so I'll wrap it up and recommend the film mildly.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very good musical, but unnecessarily long.","Les Miserables is a movie set in 19th-century France about a man, Jean Valjean, who agrees to raise a factory worker's daughter. It's based on the musical of the same name which is in turn based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo. It stars an ensemble cast led by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter.All the actors deliver an excellent performance, both acting and singing, especially Hathaway. But the movie felt unnecessarily long, especially all the singed monologues. The diagonal camera angle and extreme close ups were a bit distracting.There were parts that didn't make sense. For example, why did Fantine bring an incriminating letter to work for no reason? Or how did Marius and Cosette fall in love so quickly? There's another one that I can't mention without spoiling the movie, but it's in the first act.It would've been nice to see the plot drive the movie instead of the music driving the whole movie. It felt more of an opera than a musical.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables is the one to see,Les MiserableThe movie was a remarkable performance for acting and vocal talents shown by all involved in the production of this musical. The sweetly and innocently touching role of young Cosette ‚Äì played by incredibly talented Isabelle Allen was nice break from the harshness of the world. Cosette's gentle character as a child or later as older deeply in love brought hope to the difficult life during those times. Amanda's Seyfried and Eddie's Redmayne love at the first sight was beautifully shown throughout the movie including their spectacular vocal gifts. Hugh Jackmen captivated the audience and embraced the changing role of Jean Valjean with an artistic and charismatic demeanor. Together with Anne Hathaway and Russell Crowe delivered an exceptional movie for audience young or old. Anne's Hathaway performance was mentioned on Rachel Ray show as of an actress that is very serious about acting but not much about herself ‚Äì which fits very well for both leading actors - seldom found in this industry. The talent of Andreane Neofitou as costume designer has shown throughout the movie to complete the overall effect.

That singing...,"""Les Mis√©rables"" is a classic movie that we have seen it in many ways and with many casts.

I dreamed a dream that this would be the definitive version of Les Mis...,"A strong cast, gorgeous original music, and a powerful performance by Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean makes Les Miserables a capable and confident re-imagining of the timeless classic. Despite what this new version succeeds in accomplishing, Les Miserable suffers from hackjob pacing and character development that makes the 2 hour and 40 minute runtime feel rushed and frantic. I had serious issues with this, because as important Jean Valjean is to the main story, there are other important characters too such as Inspector Javert, whose only character building came in the form of magically being where Jean was and being the anti-hero. The editing is terrible, and won't be receiving any awards. I was on the verge of contemplating tears at the end of the film, because as sad and incredibly bittersweet it is I was asking myself, ""why do I care?"" And in the end, because of the incredibly wacked out pacing, I didn't. This is as compressed of a Les Mis experience you can get, which is not a good thing.But after all of the above, there are things that Hooper and the gang totally nail. The sets are fantastic, giving Les Mis a much needed ""down to gritty earth"" feeling in this day of age of movies. Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed A Dream"" will send chills down you spine. The performances; Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Eddie Redmayne in particular, were powerful and confident. The original music has been re-orchestrated and it sounds beautiful. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, ESPECIALLY considering that this is a musical. The way they filmed it as well (by filming the drama and music at once, rather than recording the singing in a booth and the drama on screen and then splicing it together) is a big step for musical-to-film adaptations. And in this day of age of technical wizardry and big names and budgets it is impressive that we can have a musical film be incredibly successful (my theater was full).So in light of all of these positives, it ends up being the movie part of Les Mis I have the biggest problem with (which is probably a bad thing right?). The ""too fast"" pacing and character development, which really distracted my appreciation of the film, and the emotional force leading up to the last moments of the film were just warm feelings, not true emotion were my two biggest complaints.So Les Mis is still this: A fantastic and timeless story, filled with wonderful characters and incredible music all set within an incredible backdrop. I'll leave it at that, because I dreamed a dream that sort-of came true. I dreamed that Tom Hooper (who directed one of the best dramas I've ever seen, The King's Speech) was going to create the perfect film adaptation of Les Mis. He didn't, but he did a commendable job.",7.0,Anonymous,History
At the end of the day you get nothing but boredom!,"Truly awful, poorly paced, film adaptation of a musical. Bad direction, cinematography, sets, costumes. The miniatures of Paris looked horrible. The sets looked cheap. No wonder the entire thing was shot in a series of nauseating close-ups. I like Hugh Jackman but If this is the performance of a lifetime he may need a couple more lifetimes to make up for it. He suffered from frame one to the dismal end and so did the audience. Worse was Russell Crowe who managed to look constipated for the entire film. And newsflash: He can't sing! Anne Hathaway can sing but she can't act. Why did they bother hiring Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen? They did nothing but mug in ugly costumes and wigs. Maybe the director thought it was a remake of Sweeney Todd? Three perfumers stood out: Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. Poor Amanda Seyfried. She is the best part of two of the worst musicals of all time - this one and Mama Mia!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Just one word: EPIC,"I don't usually write reviews, but then again, I never really watch movies adhering to these two criteria: recent and EPIC. Yes, I haven no qualms in admitting outright and unabashedly that this has been one of the best movie going experiences for me. (And this is coming from someone who has seen most of the movies here on the IMDb top 250 list). Going into the movie I had no idea of what it was, but since the first scene (which was amazing, and when I realized that Russel Crowe, one of my favorite actors was in it) it had me hooked right up until the last and this is really something considering the GIGANTIC duration of the movie compared to what we get these days. And it even made me shed a few tears right in the end and it was around this time when I was completely sure that this movie was going down as one of the all time classics I'll ever see in my life. I've never really had much of a taste for musicals (having turned off half way through Sweeney Todd), but this was something else completely. Intelligent writing and epic settings and the entire story was brilliant. I'm not familiar with the original piece of literature but I am quite sure that it must have been a helluva of a creation by Victor Hugo if this is what it's celluloid representation looks like. I'm pretty sure whatever money went into the making of this movie (and it must have been a LOT considering on how it turned out) was well used. Hugh Jackman was inspirational in this. Russell Crowe, although I felt was somewhat of a disappointment (in that he (in my eyes) fell short in displaying the cruel, ruthless and duty bound leader Javert) still speaks volumes.. I mean, how can a movie be bad when it's weakest character is still ten times better and more identifiable than the strongest characters we get in your average run of the mill movies these days?. As for Anne Hathaway's character, she was a revelation... she completely justified her role and was absolutely perfect, I have no doubt that this was the best performance of her career. Also, I can't leave without speaking about another guy in the movie.... Imagine my surprise when halfway through it, one my favorite comedy artist turned up.. yeah, that's right... it's Sacha Baron Cohen, and boy did he live up to his expectations, he and Helena completely provided the comedic relief necessary in this EPIC venture. I really loved how all the other actors too played their parts. I have nothing but praise for the director and the producers, clearly it was a job well done on the part of the whole team, seeing as how this turned out. All in all I LOVED this movie and will definitely watch it again and again!. 10/10. Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Don't Miz Les Miz,"This film is highly recommended.Strange how our senses compensate for us. Sight can balance sound in mere seconds. ( A prime example: In the 60's, the winning candidate of the Nixon / Kennedy debates was considered a toss-up depending on your media choice of either radio versus television¬†as your direct means of communication.)¬†¬†Which brings me to the film adaptation of the musical, Les Mis√©rables, which is a toss-up for me also.¬†¬†This film adaptation remains very faithful to the theatrical show, but there are some missteps on its journey from stage to screen. Yet the film works very well and is effectively moving, just not as strong as the live stage performance.Before I go any further, I should state that Les Miz is one of my all-time favorite theatrical experiences.¬† Both the London and Broadway casts blended their powerful voices and harmonies to full emotional impact. Prior to seeing the film, I listened to the recording of Tom Hooper's film and found the singing to pall by comparison. The voices seemed raw and overworked, never hitting those high notes one expects from its complex score. In fact, the film tends to continually sacrifice the lyrical music score and soaring voices in favor of the melodramatics of the plot. But add the director's striking visuals into the mix which emphasize more of the dramatic elements of the Hugo novel, and the vocal effect are emotionally heightened too.Hooper's choices in using non-singers in major roles with a mix of professionally trained musical performers from the stage and his approach to encourage live singing¬†to the standard prerecorded variety has mixed results, depending on the individual actor's vocal limitations. ( The ""high notes"": Possible Oscar nominees Hugh Jackman as the heroic Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway as the ill-fated Fantine, a terrific Eddie Redmayne as the lovelorn Marius. This trio of actors meld their acting and singing seamlessly. Also giving strong support are Samantha Barks as languishing √âponine, and Aaron Tveit as the rebellious Enjoiras. The low achievers: a miscast Russell Crowe as Javert and Amanda Seyfried as a bland Cosette. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, never convey the right comic tone as the Th√©nardiers and fall somewhere in between. )And while we are on the subject of highs and lows: It's true that one wants Les Miz to have the epic sweep of Victor Hugo's novel. However, the director literally sweeps the moviegoer into its spectacle with kinetic photography that annoys more that impresses. The film's movement never stops as the frenzied camera-work soars, pivots, and dives like a crazed bird of prey, zooming in on the actors as its hapless victims. ( All of this endless motion was all too reminiscent of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge, another stylish musical with French connections. Why, there even is a leftover elephant prop on display! ) With one too many close-ups, I began to worry that this film version of Les Miz could easily become Les Diz.But fortunately, the strengths outweigh the flaws. The film has top notch production values, letting the gritty realism show the ugliness and inequitable class hierarchy of 19th century Paris. Poverty and hardship are more pronounced in this version, although the film still has its romanticized operatic elements in place and that lovely score by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg and Alain Boubil to envelop any moviegoer.Les Mis√©rables remains a powerful piece of filmmaking. The devotion and passion to its source and the sensitive handling by all those involved should be commended. The film serves as a living testament to the art of the movie musical, a slowly dying genre that one hopes is finally resurrected by this exciting and riveting film experience. ( May I also caution moviegoers to bring some tissues. )So with apologies to the talented team of Sch√∂nberg and Boubil , I would like to end my film review of Les Miz with some revised lyrics, inspired by their song, I Dreamed a Dream:There was a time in Hollywood / When stars' voices would soar / And musicals were exciting / There was a time we understood / That films had dance and song / And the songs were inviting / There was a time / Then it all went wrong.I saw Les Miz and wondered why / Directors try / But fail to redo / Those stage successes often die / From stage to screen, one must still be true / Hooper's film can spin unsteady / His camera moves, it's never still / Some cast members seem unready / For their big close-up, Mr. DeMille! /But Hugh Jackman acts the part / As Valjean, his strength does tower / Dramatic, moving, from the start / Though his rich baritone needs more power. /Hathaway's so frail c'est magnifique / She owns the despair, life's rejection / Vocally strong, so tragique / Her Fantine is sheer perfection. /Barks and Redmayne remain thrilling / Dubbing others could have hid some flaws / Like Seyfried's sharp high-pitched trilling / And Crowe's low and raspy caws. /The film's production is detailed / Its score's romantic and lyrical / Les Miz does work where others failed / Le grand musical miracle.GRADE: B+Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Perfect Cinematic Version of a Broadway Musical,"This film faithfully follows the story flow of the musical theater hit by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. This musical had so many well-loved songs and they were all here. Director Tom Hooper employed a very striking close-up shots of most of these very dramatic, heart- rending musical performances. It is well-publicized that Hooper also required his stars to be actually singing live during the take, and this fact makes the performances all the more amazing. It was also very good that they had added certain details from the original novel by Victor Hugo (like Fantine selling her teeth or meeting Marius' grandfather) to further enhance this version.The trailer already showed us the haunting rendition of Anne Hathaway of Fantine's ""I Dreamed a Dream."" But what we see in the actual film, is Anne singing it in stark close-up, in one long single take, while tears were flowing down her cheeks. This was perfection! Her Golden Globe win, Oscar nomination and likely win is absolutely deserved.Hugh Jackman had a larger than life screen presence. I cannot imagine any other Hollywood star who has the physical and vocal attributes appropriate for the demanding role of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who spends his lifetime trying to make up for the sins of his past. Hugh is already an Tony-award winning musical theater star so his singing credentials cannot be questioned. His Golden Globe win and Oscar nomination for this film is also well-deserved. I would even go out on a limb and say that Hugh's performance as Valjean is more emotionally- stirring than Daniel Day-Lewis' was in ""Lincoln."" I want him to win that Oscar.The third member of the cast that I was most impressed with was Eddie Redmayne who played Marius. After watching and hearing him perform the shows most romantic and stirring songs like ""A Heart Full of Love"", ""A Little Fall of Rain"" and most especially, ""Empty Chairs and Empty Tables,"" I was really surprised that he did not receive any awards consideration at all. He was really very good as the young romantic lead. He had good chemistry with both the fair Cossette (Amanda Siefried) and the tragic Eponine (Samantha Barks).Many critics have been hard on Russell Crowe and his singing. It was not really that bad though, though his versions of ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Suicide"" were not exactly what we expect from stage performances. It is of course not fair to judge it this way since acting style would be different in stage and screen.The vibrant cinematography, the production design, the costumes all effectively capture the squalor and turmoil of Paris during the French Revolution, all fully deserving of awards as well. OK, being a theater geek, and I may be biased. But now that I have seen all nine nominees, in all fairness I can declare that ""Les Miserables"" is the most deserving movie for that Oscar Best Picture grand prize!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Flawed, But Enjoyable Adaptation Of Les Mis","For fans of the musical, it is spellbinding to watch Les Miserables finally come to life on the big screen. However, for the typical movie goer or even a fan in retrospect, it's clear that the movie doesn't know quite what it wants to be. It's a mess of gloomy, gritty sequences mixed with animated, silly, or downright ridiculous imagery. Although there are some great voices, the majority of the film consists of terrible singers, which feels so out of place with all of the great instrumental. Mix in some awkward, unbelievable CGI long shots and strange, uncomfortable camera angles, and now we have the Les Mis movie, and we aren't going to get a new one any time soon. However, the film is better than most of the movie musicals that we get. And, at the end of the day, Les Mis is like pizza. Even when it's done poorly, it's still pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The most provocative and dramatic musical movie that keeps you crying until the end,"Les Miserables is a very powerful and dramatic movie that depicts pain, grief, sacrifices, suffering, hate, and love. It is an excellent movie that it was nominated in 8 categories in the 85th Academy Awards.Watching Les Miserables in the cinema is a totally different experience. Once you step inside the movie house and the tapes started rolling, it's like you are transported back to the 1800's inside a French house while watching the events happening outside through your window. You see what the characters see. You feel what the characters feel. In fact, you have to have strong emotions when you go see this movie because it is so provocative you will be crying until the end. When I saw this movie there was one thing I had to battle with. Aside from the cold due to the air conditioner which was actually tolerable I didn't have any problem with it, I had to keep holding back my tears. It wasn't as easy as it sounded because there was never a moment in this movie where your emotions were not moved. Surely, the scene where Fantine sings ""I Dreamed A Dream"" must be one of the most memorable moments not only of this movie but in the history of all movies. However I was particularly struck when Jean Valjean sings to himself that Cosette is not his to keep and that he has to let go. At that moment, I pictured myself as a father and the time comes that I have to let go of my sweet girl I have treasured my whole life. This must be a very dramatic event in a person's life as much as the movie is.The characters all did an outstanding performance but I must give the highest credits obviously to Hugh Jackman who not only gave a realistic portrayal of the melancholic Jean Valjean but who carried the story very well to the end, and to of course Anne Hathaway who had a brief but very pivotal role as Fantine. Until I watched this film, I thought Hugh Jackman is not a strong contender for Best Actor in the Oscars. Now I will not be surprised if he beats 2-time Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis. This is by far Jackman's most powerful role yet. Hathaway will no doubt win the Best Supporting Actress award. Another underrated character is that of Russell Crowe's Javert. Although he was not my personal favorite for the role- I actually believe he is not perfect for the role, Crowe nevertheless played the villain so perfectly I was made to believe that he was a real-life villain. I almost wanted to go inside the screen and push him off the edge of the bridge myself to end his misery. There were comedic moments of the movie as well, thanks to the amusing Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter. Amanda Seyfried, Samantha Barks, and the rest of the cast all did an outstanding job. The actors' performances were one of the best and they brought life to and lived up to the title Les Miserables- The Miserable Ones.If other action-packed and thrilling movies keep you at the edge of your seat, this one will keep you crying until you have no more tears left. A piece of advise for moviegoers who haven't seen this movie yet: Bring an extra hanky.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Follows the Book Quite Faithfully,"With no money to buy food and his niece facing death by starvation, ""Jean Valjean"" (Hugh Jackman) decides to steal a loaf of bread from a nearby store. Unfortunately, he is caught and sentenced to 5 years at hard labor. During this time, he attempts to escape more than once and each time his sentence is lengthened. Eventually, after 19 years in prison he is finally released on parole. Unable to find a job he steals from a church but is once again caught. But this time fate smiles at him as the local priest gives him total absolution and he is allowed to depart with the stolen goods. Ashamed for his actions he decides to start a new life and tears up his parole papers as a sign of his determination. However, having done so he now becomes a wanted criminal and a certain law enforcement official named ""Javert"" (Russell Crowe) is determined to find him regardless of what it takes. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that it follows the book quite faithfully. That said it's rather long (158 minutes) and a large portion of it is performed in song. A very large portion. Even so, most of it was quite entertaining and I recommend it to those who enjoy musicals of this type. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Really Moving,"This movie was one of the best movies I've ever watched. Great Cast, Great Plot, Great Directing, everything was great. In fact I think I watched it like 20 times and now I've memorized it. Really moving and great. At first I didn't know It was a musical but when I saw it, I was like ""WOW""! I think this movie's way better than that Titanic Movie. It was great and moving but I think this movie deserved those Academy awards titanic won ,too. I think that this movie should be in the top rated ones, too I mean it really teaches you so many things, in fact it taught me so many things because well I'm 15 and it really makes a lot of sense to me and makes me realize so many things. I really liked the role of Javert played by Russell Crowe, one of the greatest actors ever. It was a moving character and I really wanted to read the novel and had in mind of watching the film and out of nowhere once I watched it and for 2 days I couldn't watch anything else. This happened to me with The Godfather, The Dark Knight and Gladiator and also A Beautiful mind and L.A. Confidential. I highly recommend people who haven't seen this movie yet to watch it.",,Anonymous,History
Fell flat,"I love the music of the original Broadway cast. I was largely disappointed by the movie as a whole, both it's acting and musicality felt sub par. Visual and make up was fantastic.Oddly I felt Russel Crowe did a good job as Javert, and really disliked Hugh Jackman as Valjean. I felt many of the actors, who I know to be fantastic singers, were understated due to poor design decisions.Overall I felt having many lines half spoken in an attempt to sound more emotional and genuine failed and is where the movie as a whole fell flat for me. Also the decision to have all the singing done on set as opposed to in studio was in my opinion a poor choice.In the end the movie does accurately portrait the story of Les Miserables, and is worth a watch. However, I would rather sit to watch the stage play any day over this.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bad on an epic scale....,"OK lets put this in context. I like a decent musical, whether mainstream or off the wall. I've enjoyed Rent (massively), The Fix, Miss Saigon, Nine and many others. However I don't do Lloyd-Webber. And now I don't do Schonberg/Boublil either.This film is truly, hideously awful.French TV is awash with programmes where earnest looking pseuds sit round a table for hour after endless hour, discussing the most arcane subject matter while an audience of bored people watch on, trying to look as if they are enjoying themselves. Well this film has that quality in spades. It drones on and on and on and on and on....relentlessly. I came out physically drained.Its interesting to note that many of the good reviews this has received are from Les Mis nutjobs, who stalk the production like emotional hobbits. Ignore them, they are lying through their teeth.""I cried all the way through""...""I cried in the car park""...are these the thoughts of a balanced grown-up I ask you?I would say, though, that I suspect it makes an OK stage show. I've seen excerpts and it gets by, just. But there are probably only two OK tunes in the whole piece; the rest are the stage equivalent of a whistling milkman...that is to say, tuneless and unidentifiable.Watching Crowe sing in this is worse than cringe-inducing; his voice is just awful. Jackman is far far worse. The girls get by vocally - just.And thats the sad thing, because its a talented cast and the acting element of it is actually extremely good. Had it been a film of Victor Hugo's book it would have been absolutely outstanding..........but they tried to sing and it all went down the toilet. I firmly believe that, had they used proper singers instead of these am-dram luvvies, it might have stood a chance. It is, after all, supposed to be a musical, not a film with actors trying and failing to carry a tune (although I use that term in the loosest sense here).You should go and see it, even if only to share my pain, but take a book to read because at nearly three hours, its two hours too long IMNVHO.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Magnifique and mesmerising,"Beautiful and bold; the setting envelopes you and pulls you in immediately, vividly recreating Paris in the 1800s in a time of trouble and poverty, but with scenes of hope and determination.Hugh Jackman is moody and loving in the most appropriate way; definitely a super performance from him. Anne Hathaway singing I dreamed a dream is spectacular and yes, believe the hype. Her acting is spot on and the emotion pours from her in a good way, even if she is not in the film for that long. Personally I think Russell Crowe is excellent, and I'm not a huge fan, and a great performance from Helen Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen; very funny and huge characters. The scenes in the barricades surge with passion, emotion and authenticity.Yes I'm a fan of musicals which helps I guess, but this is one to be seen on the big screen and definitely next on stage!

A dignified masterwork that offers a refreshing rebirth of musicals on the big screen,"The radical vitality of Les Mis√®rables is a provocative and commanding visceral experience that offers a refreshing rebirth of musicals on the big screen. Breaking away from the clinical constraints and pure sound of contemporary musicals (and music) that results in a music video rendition of dramatised music and songs, Les Mis√®rables is a rare and dignified masterwork that strips the genre of its pretension and deception. It gives audiences an experience that is raw and real, where the live singing of the performers is captured in all its vulnerable excellence - what more can one ask for than having Samantha Barks as √âponine singing On My Own in the rain, bringing the lyrics 'in the rain the pavements shine like silver' vividly to life. From its spectacular Wagnerian opening, with Valjean and other convicts hauling a massive ship in for repair, the extreme spectacle of the drama draws the audience into an authentic experience that allows for Hugh Jackman and the cast to bring Alain Boublil and Claude Michel Sch√∂nberg's creation to life, and revitalises the poetic lyrics of South African born Herbert Kretzmer, who co wrote the screenplay with William Nicholson, Boublil and Sch√∂nberg. Les Mis√®rables is ultimate storytelling in action and at its most compelling; it transcends the lasting impact of its stage history and signifies a renaissance in cinema that is exciting, invigorating and innovative. The King's Speech director Tom Hooper understands the mechanics of drama and is an actor's director; he thankfully never allows his meticulous direction to impose on the drama or interfere with the sensitive and intimate performances delivered by the ensemble. Hooper gives his audience a close and personal connection between the artist and the artistry of musical drama. Les Mis√®rables is an emotional journey that fittingly reflects the tragedy that befalls humans, and untainted love that saves us from damnation. Its powerful message 'To love another person is to see the face of God' is an anthem for the human race, fuelled with hope, astute awareness and meaningful intensity that is life changing. There is a serene spiritual meditation in the honesty and anguish of its fragile characters, allowing their helpless vulnerability to surface and resonate with the reality of our own lives; we see ourselves through their journey and in its mirror lay a profound revelation. Although it's a story that's 150-years old - a story of ultimate sacrifice and redemption - it's a story that reverberates with our own lives, illuminating the different and unique faces of society. Les Mis√®rables is a modern fairytale that not only allows us to experience who we are and reflects the human condition, but allows its powerful cast to reveal their creativity. Hugh Jackman miraculously transcends his superstar persona and crawls into the heart and soul of Valjean; the freedom that Hooper offers his cast allows Jackman to probe every intricate beat of a tormented soul. Russell Crowe is marvelous in his depiction of Javert; his emotionless and statuesque resilience is endearing and when he ultimately reveals his humanity, it is heartbreaking. In her role as the wounded heroine Fantine, Anne Hathaway delivers an astounding performance; there is sincerity in her anguish that is unforgettable. Eddie Redmayne is a revelation in his sensational rendering of Marius (in fact one of the best Marius' ever); the youthful aspirations and romantic soul of his angelic character are excellent. Equally brilliant and memorable are Amanda Syfried as the wholesome Cossette, Samantha Parks as the spirited √âponine, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous Th√©nardiers, Aaron Tveit, who plays the impassioned student revolutionary Enjolras, Daniel Huttlestone as the feisty Gavroche, Isabelle Allen as the young Cossette, and Colm Wilkinson in the pivotal role of the Bishop of Digne. What makes the singing of the cast unique and incomparable is that it is real; there is no dubious dubbing or filtering, but an intense dramatisation of the music. It's senseless to squabble about the tonality or pitching of the voices; these are singers who express the drama through passionate performances, not music rendered through mixing desks. Les Mis√®rables is a film you can wholeheartedly surrender to. Allow yourself this unique opportunity to escape into the epic grandeur of its splendor; the journey is enriching and revitalizing and guarantees to leave you with the realisation that sometimes it is better to listen, to really listen and allow our lives and the experiences of others to remind us of who we are and what our purpose in life is. It's not just a movie; it's an encounter with a spiritual realm that reflects the astounding and wondrous nature of humanity. It projects the desire and compassion of its heroes and heroines, the pain of our nemesis', and ultimately our unique ability to survive ourselves and those who dare to challenge our individuality. It's definitely not a film you can walk away from and forget without being enthused, but one that connects soulfully with humanity and humanness - the title after all means 'misery' and refers to utmost poverty, destitution and the outcasts, the underdogs, the rejected of society and the rebels against society. It's an experience that allows for countless revisits that grows stronger and more potent with each viewing (or watching the DVD's of the 10th and 25th stage productions, a stage production, or listening to recordings from the original French concept album to recent cast recordings). The hopeful refrain and 'One Day More' will become an everyday realisation that life is what we make of it, and how we overcome our obstacles and live our lives, will impact on our respective destinies. We are all children of Victor Hugo's epos and when we hear the music of Les Mis√®rables, and in particular the words 'when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drum', the echo of its refrain that celebrates the tragedy that befalls wounded souls, is a song you will want to sing forever.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed A Dream' will bring tears to your eyes and win her an Oscar,"ANNE Hathaway's rendition of I Dreamed A Dream in director Tom Hooper's sing-through musical brought tears to my eyes. Hathaway plays seamstress-turned-prostitute Fantine in this adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 five-volume novel of the same name.Hooper (The King's Speech) frames Fantine in this scene in a close-up and with a black background and films it without an edit. Hathaway's expression captures everything her character wants but can only dream of.I dare anyone to see this scene without shedding a tear. The Academy Awards can already present the best supporting actress award to Hathaway.The problem with this scene is that it raises the bar so high that everything that comes after this is a letdown. Fantine also disappears early on from this 160-minute film and reappears only at the end.The interminable length doesn't help and the film could have lopped off a few songs, especially that of Russell Crowe, who plays policeman Javert, who is obsessed with hunting down petty thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman).Perhaps the novel did a good job of explaining Javert's single-minded focus in wanting to catch Valjean, but, in the movie, he appears as a buffoon with nothing better to do than to ride all over France during the 19th century to look for a man who was convicted only for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's dying son.Valjean (Jackman) consoles a beaten-up Fantine (Hathaway).A lot has been said about Hooper getting the actors to sing live during filming, and not during post-production, so this translates into greater intimacy between the actors and the audience. Viewers can really feel the actors heaving during the singing.This may have worked out well for Hathaway, but, alas, not so for the rest of the actors. Crowe sings with his band, but his singing can best be described as mediocre. He also looks glum most of the time, preening in his policeman's costume.Jackman is known to sing for his supper, so he handily carries most of the film. His singing is better than average and he hits all the right notes, but compared to Hathaway, he doesn't even come close.Jackman's Valjean is tormented by his past. He made a vow to do right and has stuck to it since he broke his parole, changed his name and became a respectable member of society. But as singing Who Am I? twice says, he can never really run away from his origins.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter goof around.However, there's hope for him as Fantine appears to him when he's on his last breath, telling him: ""To love someone is to see the face of God."" Heck, he should have been called J.C. instead of J.V.He's been carrying his burden from the moment he was set free (shown at the beginning of the film) to his very end. He was, after all, influenced by the forgiveness shown to him by the priest whose church he robbed. That was the turning point in his life.He will risk life and limb during his life, fighting until the last moment to justify his second chance.The story is a social critique of the unjustness of the law and the ruthlessness by which the police will pursue petty crooks, regardless of the severity of the crime and the justification for it.It's also about a man who turns over new leaf but can never get rid of the vestiges of his past.Valjean becomes the mayor of a small town who runs a sewing factory. For all his good intentions, he doesn't keep close tabs on his ornery and horny foreman, who abuses his position to oust Fantine.After Hathaway's bravura singing, Valjean has no choice but to take care of Fantine's daughter, Cossette (Isabelle Alan, and later, Amanda Seyfried, who sang her way through Mamma Mia!) Crowe and Jackman face-off in Les MisViewers won't be swept of their feet by Seyfried's singing, but her duet with lover Marius (Eddie Redmayne) does add a romantic spark.What is more interesting is Marius' friend, Eponine (Samantha Barks), who pines for him and is devastated when he falls for Cossette.Her singing of her loss is heartfelt, and viewers will feel great sadness when she sacrifices herself to save Marius in the 1832 Paris rebellion.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add a touch of levity to this seriously serious musical by playing the innkeeper parents of the young Eponine.Samantha Barks plays Eponine, who pines for a guy falling for someone else.The film, although immeasurably wonderful, could have done better with a tighter storyline, fewer songs and better singing from some actors.www.jeffleemovies.com",7.0,Anonymous,History
Too Much Vibrato Hugh!,"OK! So here is my review for Les Mis√©rables.It's a beautiful modern musical movie and a great take on a true classic. I haven't seen the original real life musical in the theaters, but I can say this: Anne Hathaway HOLY SH*T! She gave the best performance ever. I will not try to spoil anything in this review.The vocal performances: The performances from all the actors in this movie are good. Although, some noticeably better than others. You can really pick out the 'real' musical singers/actors and the ones that were especially trained for this movie. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman weren't the best vocally. Let me tell you why. It was obvious Crowe and Jackman were lacking in tonal reach in some of the songs. They stayed in their reach, and the results were a bit of hit and miss. Russell was in my opinion noticeably better and clearer in his singing than Jackman. But maybe this was because he had less songs to sing. Jackman on the contrary had A LOT of songs to sing for his leading roll: Jean Valjean. His song performances weren't all that good. Not bad, but just not that good. There was emotion, for sure. A lot of emotion. But acting is different than singing. When singing and acting are in harmony, you have an amazing performance, but at times there was just too much acting in Jackman's singing. His 'acting as if I am singing good"" sometimes didn't make sense at all. Sometimes he just blew out random tones he tried to sing in a sentence as a reaction to a question or conversation he is in. Very confusing from a musical point of view. Hugh mostly sang in key though, but it was all sung in melodies within his very own tonal reach which results in sometimes boring and predictable melodies. Also, he really over did the vibrato effect in his voice. It was as if there was a big bee buzzing and flying in his throat the whole time. Seriously, vibrato is a cool effect, but not constantly.Now enough about Hugh's overdone vibrato, now on to the good stuff:Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. Anne Hathaway. She should win an award.Amanda Seyfried sang beautifully but didn't have the pure rawness of Anna. She was perfect for her role though.Sasha Cohen Baron and Bonham Carter were a good comical contrast for all the seriousness in this movie.It would be stupid not to mention all the other actors. But I don't know their names because they aren't big movie stars. But let me tell you, these actors were AMAZING singers and performers. The little french revolution kid was amazing. So were all the others.Lastly, it was all so EMOTIONAL! Sometimes so emotional that some people got really uncomfortable during some intimate song performances. You know it's a good performance when the cool guys before you are trying not to cry.So my verdict, 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worst movie of the decade,"If you have a modicum of intelligence, avoid Les Mis. It truly is miserable. This movie is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. Russell Crowe is dreadful and can not sing a note. Not since Pierce Brosnan pierced our ears in Mama Mia has an actor been so badly cast. From the opening scene when the dote appears you know this is going to be a dog of a film. And that's where is remains for the entire epic.There is a reason his band is a total failure; and Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are not much better. This miserable piece of garbage drones on for over 2.5 hours and I resented every moment. DO NOT SEE IT. EVER. If it gets any awards at the Oscars I may never watch them again.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Applause in the movie theater..Even grown men cried,"I have seen Les Mis on 3 occasions so thought I knew the plot pretty well, but when you see it on a big screen with such depth, and such acting..my breathe was taken away.I am only going to say that at the end I was so moved it took me over an hour for my heart to stop aching from being wrenched about. Each actor personified their role. Every scene was done with attention to detail. As a singer I will say that the Arias, the double arias, duets, and ensemble singing was well blended..I was very impressed and happily surprised with Crowe's performance.I live in a smallish town by metropolitan standards. The theater was full on New Years Day, about 400 seats in the Big D, and at the end the audience applauded, as if it was a live show...Grown Men were crying..and in the west that is a big deal..this was the most amazing of all the performances I have seen of this play..opera..musical and I feel drawn to see it again before it leaves the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
First Movie To Make Me Cry,"Les Miserables is a phenomenal film adaptation of the classic musical of the same name. It has tremendous acting and songs that help to set the mood of the film incredibly.Acting in this film was incredible. I really thought that Russel Crowe was great as Javert and he also was very good at singing which was a pleasant surprise. I thought that Anne Hathaway was very good as Fantine and sang the most famous song ""I dreamed a dream"" very well. Maybe not the best I've heard that song but very good nonetheless. Also Sacha Baron Cohen was excellent as Thenardier, that was a character I remember the most from the play growing up and I thought he hit the character spot on.For me Hugh Jackman was the best part of the film. He was outstanding as Jon Valjean and made the movie for me. He really worked hard for this role and I thought it showed a lot. I don't wanna give away what part it was, but there was a scene in which he made me cry for the first time ever during a movie. I was very impressed with him and he moved me.I didn't think all of the cast was strong tho. I have never been a big fan of Helena Bonam Carter and so I didn't find her part that good in this film. Also I thought that Amanda Seyfield was not a strong Cosette as an adult. I did think that young Cosette was very good.I thought that most of the songs were well done in this film. SOme were stronger than others but the really good ones stood out. The whole movie was basically singing and they did a good job with it, but maybe a few of the weaker songs could have been edited. BUt I enjoyed the music in this film.I do say that this is not a film for all viewers. I wouldn't take young kids to go and see as there are a lot of dark parts and some violence.Overall, an amazing film. Acting (especially Hugh Jackman) was incredible and the music was amazing. I think that it should be nominated for best picture.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Sing-A-Long Road Movie History (Lesson),"I should know better. It's not the movies fault or the original Musical, that I couldn't really enjoy this properly. I cannot for that matter compare this to other productions (be it stage or book form) of the subject matter. Obviously the movie covers a bit of History here, but it's the main characters that are the real attractions. Speaking of which: Wolverine, I mean Hugh Jackman gives the (oral) performance of his life! If anyone was doubting he could act, he more than proves it here, shouldering the movie amongst other things.While Anne Hatheway did spoil a bit (of her part/character), at least to me, she's equally enticing as is the rest of the cast. Even the sometimes misplaced looking Crowe. But he only looks slightly the way I felt about most of the singing. A movie that lasts over 2 hours and consists of 90 % of singing ... So you might want to add one or two points to my vote, unless you are fond of the book as a friend of mine is. He was very disappointed by the movie, which seems to be a common thing (read other similar reviews)",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Fantastic, I don't think I've ever seen a better film","This film is so far out of my comfort zone it is scary. This is not the kind of film I would normally watch. Thank God I went to see it, I have never been so moved by a film in my life, I sat crying my eyes out by the end, washed away with emotion, from the despair to the joy and everything in-between. The direction of the film, the effects, the singing, the acting, the lighting, you name it everything came together in a perfect storm and created a truly wonderful film. I've been to see it twice and both times it moved me so much it's ridiculous.If you go to see the film take some tissues for the tears, if you go and you're not moved then I pray for your soul, because this film would move immovable objects to tears or cause unstoppable objects to deflect from their path.I can't recommend this film enough, it's a true masterpiece of cinematic art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The strength of the musicals dissipates with the feature's lack of social concern, too committed to showing the next musical number, making the audience clamor for breathing","Adaptation of the Broadway play that, in turn, adapted a book by the novelist Victor Hugo, Les Mis√©rables has already become a classic due to its precedents. Despite the other versions for TV and two for the cinema, in 1935 and 1998, the 2012 film is the only one created in grandiose proportions, either in the sets or in the astronomical cast. The plot remains centered on ex-prisoner Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who, after breaking his conditional sentence, becomes mayor of a town where he meets Fantine (Anne Hathaway) and, after the girl's death and in search of personal redemption, spends to take care of her daughter. However, the policeman Javert (Russell Crowe), who has been chasing Valjean since the man's disappearance, finds him and the old rivalry returns to the surface. Will Valjean be able to escape again or will it be time to face his antagonist directly linked to his previous life? The environment in which the feature film is outlined involves, in this journey, not only these two characters, but also representative elements of ideologies beyond the French Revolution.Don't expect niceties and minutiae in musicals. Exaggerating is almost a watchword in this dangerous film genre. Knowing the right measure, however, is for few. And getting it wrong almost always means making the project unpalatable. Baz Luhrmann and, at certain points, Rob Marshall had the luck and, above all, the courage to find it, giving rise to the two great musicals of the century, ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"". In an attempt to make something even bigger and historic, director Tom Hooper, however, exaggerates beyond what is allowed in the dose. There are so many numbers and so many stories to be told that it is impossible to identify with or even care about any character in ""Les Mis√©rables"", with the exception of the vocal and dramatic talent of some of its performers.""Les Mis√©rables"" is much more like a great show than a movie. In it, the form matters more than the content. The scenery, its pomposity and that of some costumes, the make-up and, mainly, the dramatic nature of the interpretations, gain too much value while the story becomes a mere supporting element. And there are so many large-scale musical numbers that it becomes difficult to give due importance to each one of them. In short, there is a lack of silence that punctuates moments of this narrative that, because of this and because of Hooper and screenwriter William Nicholson's option to make it almost 100% sung, becomes run over and tiring. Soon, when we finish seeing an intense musical sequence that can impress visually and vocally, we enter another number so or more intense that it makes us forget the previous one and that also contributes little to the development of the plot, more specifically the relationships between the characters. And this situation is repeated several times during the two and a half hours of the film.Widely publicized (by the director and his actors) as the first musical to register the musical interpretations of the actors live, on the film set (which, by the way, is not true), Les Mis√©rables apparently bets on this resource as something capable of bringing ""authenticity"" to performances - a silly concept dismantled by eighty years of musicals marked by brilliant performances. In reality, Hooper's idea only sounds like a device to attract attention, since, in practice, it ends up compromising the film by forcing less musically gifted actors to surrender to embarrassment (and Russell Crowe, in particular, suffers visible difficulties to achieve certain notes and keep in tune with the songs).When he is not being forced to sing, however, Crowe gives Javert intensity and coldness, while Hugh Jackman, a slightly more gifted singer, does considerably better - besides, of course, incarnating Valjean as the unfortunate and suffering creature he it really is (and the actor's wrinkles and expression lines contribute to making the character more fragile). And if Anne Hathaway lives Fantine in a unidimensional tone of tragedy and pain, this is due more to the script than to the actress, who, of course, does a beautiful job in her main number, when she sings ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in a long take and shot almost in very close-up. On the other hand, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter seem to have come out of another film, as the comic tone of their compositions does not fit the heavy atmosphere of the rest of the narrative, while Samantha Barks offers perhaps the best performance of the feature with her complex √âponine - a fascinating character who seems destined to be forever ignored by audiences and critics alike. Finally, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne do their best to make the romance between Cosette and Marius engaging, but the truth is that it is a standard, predictable subplot that pales in comparison to the rest of the story - which, as if that were not enough, ends up sounding scattered by never establishing a really central character, insisting on introducing important figures in the second half of the projection.In the film, there is a whole careful look behind. The settings, rich in their ornamentation, from the wreckage of a ship at the beginning of the work to the filth of a Paris bathed by the division of social classes, are worthy of recognition. Furthermore, the feat of giving beauty to what has little beauty needs to be mentioned. The make-up and characterization of the suffering people of France are believable as the features of these individuals are palpable, showing skin affected by disease and grimy clothes. Despite the exaggeration, the intention of mounting poverty and the State's neglect into personifications becomes odd and collaborates with a greater objective: to flaunt the inevitability of a revolution. Almost always coming from the needy population and their commissioners, the songs assume that change, as essential as it is, is in the hands of a few. Especially because such musical expressions circulate around the daily life of the Parisian plebs, becoming personal only when it comes to the protagonists and their internal conflicts.Anne Hathaway's striking ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" sung by Fantine, is a significant type of musical style for ""Les Miserables""; complementary to the rest of the film and with a high emotional charge. If you look around the feature film, it is essential, for legitimately revolting times, melodies as intense as this. And that, along with the setting along with a slightly more careless painting by Eug√®ne Delacroix, enhances any spoken (or sung) speech, since the public's adherence to the proposal is also related to the visual impact. However, not even the fortification of the powerful songs cancels out the fact that, as it is a film that lasts close to three hours and almost entirely contains sung lines, tiredness is possibly part of the spectator's experience. Some - visibly performed out of tune - exist only to follow the idea of a musical completely musicalized in all its spheres.But none of that poses as big a problem as Tom Hooper's crazed direction, who, it seems, has some sort of fetish for wide angles and inclined planes, employing lenses that deform the sides while keeping the world skewed forever. For whatever reason, since these aesthetic decisions do not contribute anything to the narrative, they are inelegant. With quick acts - such as the presentation of Fantine's story and Valjean himself - and others that are too slow - such as the plot behind the barricades - Tom Hooper prioritizes what is being seen. The rhythm, however, remains in the same sequence of the images that the filmmaker finds interesting to show. In this case, he seems to have chosen to value more all the magnificence of the film's production with its open and aerial shots. However, with too many closed shots on the actors' faces and an aesthetic similar to a painting (elements seen in other works by the artist, such as The King's Speech, 2010), the theme fits into an unfair dispute. The performers' intimacy with their figures and the close accompaniment of every nuance in their voices and gestures, partly reject Broadway and its show when trying to bring the realism that the play could not give.The most appropriate location and scenic objects for each ""number"" of the feature film, returns to the issue of Hooper's enormous concern with plastic artifices, a means of capturing emotion. Unable to get around the weaknesses of Victor Hugo's work, such as the unconvincing love story that unfolds between Cosette and the revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne) after a mere exchange of glances and time transitions, it stumbles into lameness with its inconvenient direction. In addition to the shots already mentioned in the composition of the scenes, ""Les Mis√©rables"" fills the screen with manipulative close-ups of characters who just sob. The much-talked-about scene in which Anne Hathaway sings ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is just the foreshadowing of a drama that uses the most inelegant methods to enthrall audiences.""Les Mis√©rables"", although covered by a stunning beauty, travels through the social class that has suffered since the beginning, and gives voice to it through miserable characters disgraced by an impetuous society. With commendable versions of the classics that became the songs written by Schonberg and Boublil, making the best of them reverberate through a good part of the plot. It is a pity that the strength of the music dissipates with the feature's lack of social concern, too committed to showing the next musical number, making the audience clamor for some time to breathe, perhaps a division into acts, as in the theater. And, like a show, you'll come out of it humming some of the songs, but you won't care that the characters in this show just lived.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A perfect balance,"The very start of the movie intrigued me, the care taken into the detail from costume to language was picture perfect, and being a huge fan of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, this was a treat for me.A musical is not what i usually prefer but i would have kicked myself for the rest of my life if i had missed this on the big screen. this movie brought out the rawest emotions of men, and why we end up doing things we aren't proud of. the voice score was shocking,Anne Hathaway shook me up.

Didn't quite deliver.,"This movie definitely has its qualities.
Les Miserable follows the story of a thief Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who breaks his parol to lead a better life.
We follow his story as he is chased around France by an officer of the law (Russell crow)
As we follow Jackmans character we also become invested in other characters along the way.
Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a desperate street girl. Who Jean lends and helping hand to, and ultimately raises her daughter for her.
Cosette her daughter (Amanda Seyfried)
The girl that brings the characters together.As far as acting, cinematography, and story this movie is amazing.
The down fall is actually the singing in my opinion.
Though technically it's good. It severely detracts from several scenes.
When some parts should just be spoken, it seems that the actors were forced to sing it. Thus losing its hold on you.
I myself didn't enjoy this movie due to the singing, but couldn't stop watching it because of how compelling the story and characters were.
I give this film a 7.
Technically it's amazing. Very well thought out plot and characters. Just too pitchy for me.I rate this 15+
There is several heavily suggestive scenes, and themes.
Half the plot revolves around prostitution. (No nudity in this film)

Les Mis√©rables. the most aptly titled movie of all time.,"I must be getting old & cynical or both. I saw the actors listed and thought this has to be a great movie. It wasn't. I couldn't endure more than 30 minutes, so perhaps it got better after I left. (I doubt it). I love a good musical. I also like it to have some dialogue mixed in as well. When I realised the whole movie was going to be sung I started to cringe, no amount of delicious hot popcorn and gallons of coke was going to keep me stuck in the seat. It's the WORST movie I have seen in a long long time and I have seen some shockers lately (WRONG as an example). As I said in the header, Les Miserable is exactly how I felt when I walked out of the cinema after spending good money on utter rubbish.

I loved Les Miserables.  There I said it!,"Though I never saw an actual theatrical production of this musical, I did know about this through some of the songs played on piano by my Filipino ""cousin"" (technically, he was just someone from my parents' native country but me and my aunts in Jacksonville, Fla., considered him as such) as well as watching the PBS concert special with Lea Salonga doing the Eponine part. So it was with that in mind that I was very excited to watch this movie and as a result, I enjoyed it very much! In fact, this being the day of the Oscar nominations, part of me was very glad to see Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, the original song, and this nominated for Best Picture but was a bit disappointed that Tom Hooper was not given the nod as well as I believe his vision indeed put the whole thing together perfectly! And while Jackman and Hathaway performed their roles greatly, one shouldn't discount also Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, Eddie Redmayne, or especially Samantha Barks as Eponine. I'm singling Ms. Barks here because of her song ""On My Own"" about her unrequited love for Radmayne which I can relate to all too well. But, really, anything that got a tear from me really deserved one, in fact, by the end, my movie theatre-working friend asked me if I was all right and I assured him I was. I think I've said enough so on that note, Les Miserables is definitely worth seeing!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Hugh Jackman was brilliant in the role of Jean Valjean showing both strength and humility in this role.

Painless way to get acquainted with Broadway show,"Before watching this movie of course interesting question would be ""Is Baron Cohen proper actor for Victor Hugo adaptation?""After watching this movie answer is definitely ""yes"" because you get idea that this is not by any measure (even remotely) adaptation of Victor Hugo novel but ""music video"" for Broadway show.Finally I got enough motivation to watch this ""awesome masterpiece"" and can admit it can be well tolerated. If Broadway musicals make you sick (like they do to me), this movie is probably least painful way to taste this strange genre but not get mental trauma due to cultural shock.In worst scenario - you simply become a little bored here and there. Proper costumes, expensive decorations, well known actors... All these pretty things are buffering Broadway-style strike in the ear for unaccustomed viewer.Of course, it's quite difficult to hear Hathaway's ""artistic"" concept of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" after listening Susan Boyle, but frankly speaking it's the only moment when I winced, the rest of the movie is okey-dokey. Thanks to makers for brave attempt.One observation: in many reviews those fans of Broadway musicals complain that this movie is bad comparing to original musical. That's mysterious, because you could equally say that Broadway musical itself just mocking serious Hugo's novel, playing ""shallow"".

Little bit of a disappointment,"I would first like to say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical Les Miserables. I saw it on Broadway when I was much younger and fell asleep and did enjoy the non musical version unlike so many others. Now watching the story unfold I can appreciate it's scope and complexity but I can't help but feel it's all a little dull, sorry. And I think that mainly has to do with the way its been executed this time around. After a brilliant first 35 mins reaching its peak when Anne Hathaway delivers a heart stopping, tear inducing performance of I dreamed a dream the film begins to flat line. Each scene less effective than the last. And the performances seem to follow suit. Hugh Jackman who blows you away in the beginning starts to come off too intense and forced, Russell Crowe although not terrible seems ill suited for the role and speaking of terrible Amanda Seyfred is just that she's so shrill sounding and has the emotional range of a stunted deer in headlights. Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also show up and deliver the films ghastliest performances with not an wink of charm. And as a pretty much a first timer of the material I can say most of it is pretty mean and dreary. Which is not a bad thing if it had been delivered with the panache that the film started with this could have truly been an amazing experience. Something raw, original and ground breaking. Instead we are left with halted promises as the we get further from the films powerful opening numbers after a while it all feels drab, lethargic and a little rushed at the same time. But I don't wanna be too mean to the film it has a lot of great moments and some truly wonderful songs that are performed exquisitely and it's no doubt that these actors have shown up with their game faces on too bad the proper direction wasn't their to assist them in making something truly special instead of another missed opportunity. ***/5",6.0,Anonymous,History

OK but not worth a second watch,"It is an ambitious film with a lot of expectation. Not only is one of the most popular novels by the biggest French author in literature, but it is the most popular musical of all-time. Which, being produced in the 80's and 90's where musicals are way past their golden age is really saying something! Les Mis√©rables is set in 19th century Paris and tells the story of Jean Valijean, who has just been released on parole after a 19-year stint in the chain gangs for robbing a house to feed his starving family. Upon release, the officer Javert, warns him not to break his parole and that the papers he carry will always brand him a thief. Valijean realises that to change his life he has to break parole and Javert thus vows to hunt him down and bring him to justice.First the good things - it looks amazing. It really captures the sights, sounds and smells of old Paris. The introduction is particularly epic. Costumes are amazing and very authentic looking.It was well directed and well-shot and if it was a normal film, it might have worked.However, if you are a fan musicals in general, you will be very disappointed. It is not sung with any musical legitimacy. The aim is to pull everything back to sound like people are speaking normally to each other. Sometimes it is effective, but over the whole time period of the movie, it becomes boring and monotonous and you just wish that people would just speak instead.And they do... there is no dialogue in the original (which is sung all the way through like grand opera), but heaps of music is cut for dialogue... but it doesn't make the movie any shorter as sometimes the dialogue takes longer than the original music does! There are also a lot of alterations to keys of songs and to certain passages to suit singers - particularly Hugh Jackman's (Jean Valijean) part.I was fine with the cuts when they cut out all the obviously theatrical elements ie. inner monologues or exposition through song. But a lot of other cuts stripped so much from the characters. Eponine and all of the students were completely undeveloped. Most of the new music was rehashing and repeating themes that were already there. Most of the new text was invariably not as well written as the original text.As for performances - there are a couple of great performances and a lot of very average ones.The standout was Anne Hathaway was absolutely phenomenal. She is the best Fantine I have ever seen or heard. She looks just like you expect Fantine to look! She does something really unique with the music. It is a harrowing performance and it was a really good choice from the director to add the particularly disturbing section from the novel that is left out of the musical.Hugh Jackman is the most believable Valijean I have seen on stage or screen - not only physically believable (which is a very tough ask given how he is described in the book) but he was really immersed into the character. A very fine, noble and nuanced performance. I was frustrated that he couldn't sing it and that they had to change a lot of the music. However, if you don't know Les Miserables already, you won't notice it until his big song ""Bring Him Home"" at the barricade, where they made the unfortunate choice to keep it in its original (high tenor) key.I was really worried when I'd heard who they had cast as the Thernadiers, the evil heart of the story, but I was really surprised by Sascha Baron Cohen and especially Helena Bonham Carter as the Thernadiers - Sascha Baron's quasi-Greek Italian accent aside. Helena Bonham Carty sings much better in this than in Sweeney Todd. They were suitably nasty, but they managed to balance it with humour. With all the new dialogue, songs etc. the Thernadiers were unfortunately not given more. There is a LOT more in the book.He gets a lot of negative rap, but Russell Crowe had good moments when he wasn't attempting to ""sing"", but he doesn't have the training for this role. It's a killer. As soon as he had to do some real singing, his acting suffered. It's a shame - he has a nice voice, he fits the part and I reckon if he really trained he'd be fabulous.He was by no means the worst singer - I was more impressed with him than with Marius), Cosette and Eponine. Eponine was the only one in the movie who pronounced Cosette as Koe-sett... obviously listened to Gary Morris on the complete symphonic recording one too many times.After Fantine's part in the story ends and we get past the Innkeeper's spectacular opening scene - it is probably time to leave the theater.The second half is a mess. The cuts really killed the pace and the impact of the story. I just didn't care about the students or Eponine as we never got to meet them... they were just underdeveloped. A lot of things went unexplained - e.g. what are the students fighting for? Why is it important? why is Thernadier the innkeeper robbing houses? Oh wait... the explanations was cut... it is NOT the fault of the musical.As much as I love the musical, I never need to watch this version again unfortunately. I only hope that when I next see it on stage, I don't see people attempting to perform it in this way!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Looking But Has Real Pacing Issues,"Les Miserables (2012)** 1/2 (out of 4)I've never seen such a beautiful film so perfectly put together but fall so terribly apart. I will admit upfront that I've never seen any musical version of this Victor Hugo story so I really didn't have any expectations going in. The story itself is a classic as Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) can't escape his past and especially with Javert (Russell Crowe) constantly on his trail. LES MISERABLES, on a technical level, is quite an achievement and I must say that I might even call it flawless. The costume designs are downright breathtaking as were the set designs. I know some of the sets were created using CGI but I never found them to be distracting as they blended in quite well with the real footage. I also thought the music score was performed at a very high quality and help spark some energy. I also thought the performances were strong for the most part. The ""live singing"" approach was a mixed bag but I thought Jackman did an extremely good job with it. I also thought Anne Hathaway was good during her numbers including the emotional ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" which was clearly the highlight of the film. Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Amanda Seyfried were all good in their roles as well. It seems most of the controversy is coming from Crowe but I thought he was just fine. He was perfect for the character but it seems his singing is upsetting most people. While it wasn't what you'd typical expect to see in a musical, I thought it was good enough and in some ways its roughness fit the character. Now, the biggest problems with me and this film is that there simply wasn't any emotional connection to any of the characters. I thought this here was the film's fatal flaw because there was just nothing here that drew me to the characters and I must say that I wasn't overly impressed with all of the songs. I also felt the running time really dragged due to some poor pacing, which caused this film to seem twice as long as it really was. With that said, I'm guessing those who love the musical are going to love this version. It certainly has the look and sound but to me that simply wasn't enough.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Truly Amazing,"I for one loved this film. I came with a fresh mind keeping out the stage production (which I have seen in the west end). The reason I did this is because unlike some people I knew it wasn't going to be the same, just seemed obvious to me! This film was well paced and told the whole story in general well, lots of people have complained about russel, and okay he doesn't have the best voice but he has a better voice than Pierce Brosnan in mama mia. And plus he fits the role well, as well as being a big actor to try and get more people to go and see the film. In short it is a good film, 8/10 acting, 8/10 singing, 10/10 for the sets and overall looks. And YES it does give you goose pimples at the end just like the show.",9.0,Anonymous,History
And I thought I hated musicals.,"HOW I RAN INTO ""LES MIS"". Italy is one of the few western countries where the stage musical ""Les Miserables"" is not performed. As far as I know, nobody ever produced the Italian adaptation at all. I got interested in it when I discovered that Russell Crowe, definitely my favorite actor, was involved in the movie version. This compelled me to do some preliminary research, even though I am not keen on musicals at all. Since I've listened to the stage shows, like the 25th anniversary concert (thank God there is YouTube!), I've been falling in love with the story and the songs. So, I was really eager to watch this movie. I was also curious to see why there were several negative reviews about Crowe's performance and about the director's style.THE MOVIE. I will not deal with the plot, as it can be found in tons of reviews. I'll just give my two cents on the movie. I can see why many purists think it is worse than the stage show. Yet, I don't agree. The singing is more crude, as it is recorded live while acting in real scenes - often involving physical strain. This is a MOVIE. I don't find the less-than-perfect tunes to be annoying at all. They mix well with the sense of reality the scenes convey. Even though not all the actors are equally good performers, I did not find anyone to be dis-likable. Crowe might not be ranked as the best singer among the cast, but I find him to be *very* far from being the worst. His voice, very enjoyable when he sings his own rock-folk songs, here turns slightly nasal in some parts, as this singing style is surely light-years away from Crowe's usual gigs. But his portrayal of Javert remains totally convincing. Hugh Jackman is brave and AMAZING. Full stop. Deserved kudos will focus on Anne Hathaway, yet I think that Jackman is the real deal in this movie. As a whole, I found the film to be slightly too long, yet I cannot find a single scene that I'd agree to cut. A dilemma, indeed. The shaky use of hand-held cameras and the director's inclination (the pun is intended) to repeatedly tilt them are not totally pleasant, but I did not find them so invasive to distract me from the story. ""Les Miserables"" made me hum, sing, laugh and cry. I was totally absorbed in it. In the audience where I was sitting, men in particular found it quite hard to get through the 2.5+ hours of singing (my husband had directly decided not to join me...). As I said, here ""Les Mis"" is known by a very few people, and this will not help the movie to be appreciated. Moreover, in Italy non-dubbed movies like this are very rare as people have, on average, a poor knowledge of the English language. No matter what, I will annoy friends, colleagues and relatives with my pleads, hoping to convince them to give this movie a try. Unless you are *very* adverse to musicals, I suggest you not to have prejudices and to go and see ""Les Miserables"". Oh, and... Women, bring some tissues.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacular Riveting Emotional Roller-coaster!!!,"How can I add anything more to the many platitudes already written. I went to see ""Les Miserables"" with a hope that there may be some reasonable content to entertain me. Wow! The film was a non stop battering of my emotions to an extent Id not had since watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" 8 years ago. The cast were nothing short of brilliant. I wont give any of the plot away as cinemas are still being packed 4 weeks after release. I have now seen it 9 times and have not tired of it. I have watched virtually every film that has been released in the last 10 years and without doubt, this is right up there with the very best. Whilst the main stars varied in their singing capabilities, none disappointed, which, bearing in mind all the numbers were sung in one take on set, were of a high standard. Most notable performer was Samantha Barks as Eponine. She has stunning looks as well as an amazing voice. I doubt there's been a dry eye in the house during her last song. Anne Hathaway's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" almost stopped my breath with its' raw and harrowing delivery. Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Amanda Seyfried and Russell Crowe all belted out ballads and duets throughout the film with passion and power. Slightly lighter tones were provided by the characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. The scenes and backdrops were spectacular. The music score was magnificent along with the chorus numbers. Anyone reading this will be thinking, will he watch it again? Yes without doubt. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Half masterpiece, half mediocrity.","I really wanted to love this film, some of the songs and characters are some of the best in any musical and the story is engrossing and very sad. I personally have not seen the stage show, so my comments are from reading the book (which was years ago and I can barely remember it) and on the films own merits.Generally the film hits all the bases; the drama is spot on, he comedy is dabbed here and there and songs are in their truest form. Where the film really takes flight is on the lead performance by Hugh Jackman whom is both staggeringly honest and extremely well sung (even if his voice begins to grate towards the end). Anne Hathaway steals the entire show in the mere 10 minutes of screen time she has - and she owns it - in fact the film often loses its way without her. The young actress Samantha Barks is also very good and her version of the famous ""on my own"" is stunning.But where there is good there is bad, Russel Crowe being the worst offender. He neither has the acting ability nor the vocal capacity to pull off the role he is given and his songs sound more strained than the other vocalists. Amanda Seyfried also seems miscast, she has no chemistry with her males leads and her vocals sound terrible by comparison of Hathaway's or Bark's.In other areas the film generally works, the pitiful CGI at the start not withstanding the scenery is a sight to behold. Such a shame the director has no time to really have a look at it. The camera work is a little too erratic for my personal liking and barely gives the audience time to breathe between the mood changes.This does sound more negative than positive, but the negatives luckily don't take too much away from the general enjoyment of the film. It will likely tug on many people's heart strings but for myself I think a better director could have made this so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A great film in a Miserables sense...,"I'm glad to say I finally saw the film yesterday and I loved it. A very successful re-imagining for the screen and singing live actually works. Why the surprise? We do it seven to eight times a week in a stage musical and no retakes! I cried three times, just as I did in the theatre, which is an achievement since I know where it's going to happen now. Jackman and Hathaway are amazing and most of the actor/singers are really good.So, let's address that huge elephant in the room and I don't mean that big plaster one that keeps popping up in Paris. (Good to see him working though, even if he seems to have fallen on hard times since PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. I guess that's show biz!). Nor do I mean Russell Crowe, though I'll get to him in a moment.I mean that bloody Sacha Baron Cohen. I know he's talented and frequently inspired. My problem with him is he clearly knows it and, whenever he appears as a guest star, he appears to be acting in a totally different film. He ruined HUGO for me with his ""Officer Crabtree"" tribute performance and in this film the self indulgence is off the scale. The 'Allo 'Allo French accent comes out again and, yes, I know he changes it according to whatever Thenadier is trying to achieve but even then there's no consistency. The French accent frequently becomes Jewish which I doubt is deliberate.That said, let's address the Russell Crowe ""problem"".I liked his performance. I even liked his singing. No, he's not as good a singer as Jackman or Redmayne or Hathaway but, in context, it works. It works because he is the best man for the part as an actor and he conveys the class origins, the struggle with his programming/training and he makes sense of Javert's final moments in a way I've rarely seen in other Javerts who sing brilliantly. He is totally believable and if he occasionally bends the strict tempo into a more rock/pop style that's OK too. It makes a pleasant change in a piece that's 160 minutes long.To sum up, I can happily recommend LES MISERABLES even if ""happy"" is probably the wrong word for a film that wrings the withers quite so throughly.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I dreamed a lesser dream,"I was advised a day prior to seeing Tom Hooper's Les Mis√©rables to search up and watch the 25th anniversary concert performance of Les Mis√©rables, performed at The O2 in London in October 2010. The performance of three hours was spellbinding, with one lavish song after another captivating even the most distanced viewer with its monumentally talented singers and their brave, audacious vocals. While not a single number was disappointing, Lea Salonga's version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" was simply beautiful and mosaic, without being too emotionally dictative or manipulating. It has the right tone, and Salonga herself didn't appear to be trying to garner anything outside of a wonderful performance.All I can say is that because of enduring a lengthy orchestra, performing the sounds of Victor Hugo's timeless novel, is that Hooper's countless film adaptation suffers by comparison. The story should be familiar now; it's 1815, in a dark and grim France, where convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) has been released from prison, yet will still remain under the eye of prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe). After inhabiting a life of crime, Valjean decides to assume a life of good, and we fast-forward nine years later, where he now owns a factory.We soon focus on one of his workers, a young woman named Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who has been sending much of her wages to her illegitimate daughter, Cosette (Isabelle Allen). She is quickly fired after a fight and forced to succumb to losing some of her teeth and her hair just to get the bare minimum to service her daughter, who is living with the Th√©nardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). The remainder of the film centers on the eccentric stories of others in France, during a time of economic uncertainty and political grayness. Everyone is miserable, everyone is dirty, and it seems no one can choose a path for happiness.This is only the umpteenth time this story has been adapted into a film, and who better to do it than Tom Hooper, right? The man directed The King's Speech, a strong, well-made picture which went on to win the 2010 Best Picture Oscar, no competition. Hooper decides to go even more stylistic with Les Mis√©rables than he did that effort, and this is what presents the film with its almost fatal flaw. Hooper directs this picture with a very intimate, yet uncomfortable look, which has long, ponderous close-ups of actors, singing their hearts out to this material. From the first sequence of this, during ""Valjean's Soliloquy,"" the videography of the music felt unnatural and slightly awkward. I kept an open mind, believing that it's just the fact I've seen so many musicals that show dancing and atmosphere on a grandscale, only about halfway through when I found this to be a genuine distraction. Occasionally, it comes in handy, like during the ""I Dreamed a Dream"" number by Anne Hathaway, which has the audience deeply focused on her as she sings her heart out to one of the saddest ballads in recent memory. But for the most part, it's an unwelcome and very unnatural little feature that sort of sterilizes the emotional effect.It's that and just the way the numerous performers go about their musical numbers, in a heavily bombastic way, that lessen this film as an entire product. I mentioned before that Lea Salonga's rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" worked largely in part to the fact that she didn't seem to be trying to garner any sort of recognition, and just did it straight from the soul and left it at that. Hathaway, while presenting her impeccable voice here, with her tears, sadness, and overwhelming misery appears to be trying to get herself an award. Almost everyone in the cast does, including Jackman who plays Valjean well, until his voice must break into song, then he becomes just average. It's pretty damn apparent to anyone with an artistic eye that the actors in this picture were picked based on the merits of their names and not on their true passion and ability to perform the material as effectively as possible. No one does a bad job, but seeing how so many people with smaller names effectively energized the material at hand, one would figure that the bigger names aren't necessarily needed and the name Les Mis√©rables is big enough to which it could sell itself.Yet there are perks here great enough to warrant a recommendation of some sorts. While bombastic and anything but subtle, the musical score is performed efficiently here, the gray backdrops are enough to have the audience suffering in their own misery, and the performances are effective around the clock, including Sacha Baron Cohen, who I fear will go under the radar in yet another spectacular supporting role, on par with the quirky one her gave in Martin Scorsese's Hugo he gave around this time last year.There are several film versions of Les Mis√©rables, none of which I have seen. Hooper's version and the 25th anniversary concert are enough to get me through the next few years, as my thirst has been satisfyingly quenched. Here's a picture that likely because of its cast, crew, name, source material, and period will be a success among audiences and the Academy. As far as an emotional experience goes, I can't say much was done for me in that regard. I'm still backlogged tears after seeing Life of Pi a month ago.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.

I dreamed a dream that this movie was better,"I really don't have problems with movie musicals. It is not my favorite film genre, but I do respect the musical. However, a little dialogue would be nice from time to time incorporated with the singing. There was very, very little of that in Director Tom Hooper's film adaptation of ""Les Miserables"". So therefore, that was one main reason why I felt miserable numerous times in experiencing ""Les Miserables"". As most of you are aware, the movie is adapted from Victor Hugo's infamous novel and Broadway show. It is set in 19th Century France and tells the story of Jean Valjean, a former thief who for decades was hunted down by ruthless policeman Javert after he breaks parole. Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter Cosette. When Cosette grows older, she falls for revolutionist Marius who is set in standing strong against the tyranny of France. I wonder if Marius bought Cosette a corset and if they french kissed on the night of their prom. OK, those were some miserable puns! ""Les Miserables"" seemed like it lasted an entire day. Hooper does a decent job in reconstructing the look of the time and also the technical efforts in the movie were solid. But Hooper's direction was not powerful enough to persuade viewers who are not fan of the musical to buy in to ""Les Miserables"". If one is a Miserables fan, no doubt you will adore this movie. I can't really comment too much on the movie's screenplay because it was pretty much nonexistent since most of the screen played to characters singing away their melancholy. Undoubtedly, Hugh Jackman is a renaissance man and it showed once more in his performance as Valjean; however, I do not call it Oscar-worthy; Hugh know what I mean? Many people seemed to be scarecrowed of Russell Crowe's singing in his work as Javert; but it's actually not that bad. Anne Hathaway is sure to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the doomed Fantine for her emotional performance. I loved her work, but I was mostly watching a buzzcut Hathaway on screen and not a total transformation into the Fantine character; hey, that is just my buzz. ""Les Miserables"" includes other decent (though not spectacular) tenor performances from Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine, and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. I could have done without the ridiculous performances from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier. ""Les Miserables"" is not the most miserable movie-going experience I have ever had; but if you are an avid fan of the infamous musical, you should not miz out in checking out Hooper's ""Les Miserables"". *** Average",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not a Pretty THing,"I don't get it. I think people love Les Mis as a story so much they cannot write a negative review. This movie is terrible. The first sixty minutes is almost all close up views with no background. Faces and bodies filling the screen top to bottom. No depth, little screen context. And actors who cannot sing.The CGR at the start of the film is ridiculous. Totally unrealistic. And the idea ludicrous. Nobody pulls a ship into a dry dock in the midst of a storm when it is listing far to a side.""I Dreamed a Dream"" is a beautiful song and sung well, with lots of emotion. But who needs a face that big singing it with such a big body that every spot on her skin is like a blob. Instead of featuring the negatives (scraped skin, bloody cuts, ragged and dirty hair), why not pull back so we see the scene.And the music continues in the current trend of pound on the instruments. Make is noisy. Get the deep base so lound it shake the seat. Why?

Perfection,"It's been too long since I saw a perfect movie and Les Miserables is definitely one of them, I haven't seen the musical and I haven't read the book and therefore, I don't hold this movie to any expectations whatsoever.Firstly, the cast. Superb. Mind-blowing. I can't express in words my delight at the performances. I'm awe-struck. I'm amazed. The performances were so inspiring so real. They were able to invoke a myriad of emotions in me - pain, heartbreak, sorrow, despair, longing, happiness, hope, fear, disgust, anger. It was a true roller coaster..Secondly, the singing. I loved it. The performances felt intimate and real. Sure they are not Broadway singers but they don't have to be if they can bare all of the emotions and bring out the highlight theme in a musical performance. Of my favorites were Fantine's (Anne Hathaway), Eponine (Samantha Banks), Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and of course Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman). I was particularly impressed with Samantha Banks and Eddie Redmayne. Amanda Seyfried's voice was also quite surprisingly good.Overall, it;s a brilliant film; one that entertains, invokes emotions deep inside and provokes thought on the various issues of morality and ethics all through its duration.

"Very powerful, very emotional, bring Kleenex","I wasn't sure what ""Les Miserables"" was going to be like, but I went to see it at the movie theatre anyway and I am very glad I did. This film version is based upon the Broadway musical and, like the stage musical, is sung-through. It is very well done and I definitely recommend seeing it.The story is pretty much the same: Jean Valjean (not a very creative name, I know) broke his parole and has been being hunted by Javert, the slightly obsessive‚Äìcompulsive policeman. Valjean meets dying Fantine, who asks him to look after her daughter Cosette. They follow Valjean as he raises Cosette, Javert as he follows Valjean, and also an uprising against the poor conditions that the French are living under during the time period in which the movie takes place.The acting in this is amazing! The singing is really great too, with the exception of Hugh Jackman. Jackman is good in his role but I personally do not like how he sings. Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway both do wonderfully in their songs. I fell apart the first of many times during this movie when Hathaway gave her heart-wrenching performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"". This movie has an enormous cast, so I will save time by just saying that the acting of the cast, both lead and supporting, is awesome. You will want tissues handy, because, trust me, you are going to need them.If I were to describe ""Les Mis"" in just one word, I think I would use ""powerful"". The ending is absolutely beautiful, but then, the whole movie is (except maybe for the parts with Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen). This one is a must-see. I will be very surprised if it is ignored by the Academy, because it has both crowd-pleasing and artistic qualities to it.

"As an original fan of the Broadway musical, I say eh.","Truthfully Les Mis was not what I had expected it to be. As a fan of the musical, I did go into the movie theater knowing that the movie can't live up to all of my expectations. In some ways it exceeded them and in others, I was disappointed.The Pros: 1) Anne Hathaway was perfect. Her version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" brought me to tears and I truly could feel her pain. If she doesn't win the Oscar for her role, I will be extremely upset. 2) Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit both played their parts wonderfully. 3) I was pleasantly surprised Russell Crowe could sing and do a decent job at it. 4) The scenery and filming style was well done. They couldn't properly convey such things on the stage. 5) While they couldn't keep certain elements from the stage show like the stars revolving during ""Stars"", and the amazing affect of Javert jumping off the bridge to his death, they kept the scene of Enjolras hanging out of the window, so I was pleased. 6) I was thrilled when Colm Wilkinson appeared as The Bishop. I was very proud. 7) The ending rendition of ""Do You Hear The People Sing"" featuring all of those who had perished throughout the film was marvelous and very well done.The Cons: 1) All but one of my Cons have to do with Hugh Jackman's performance, to which I thought fell completely flat. I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I love Hugh Jackman, but he was wrong for the part of Valjean. 2) For one thing, Jackman was not the proper age to play Valjean. Even at the end as an old man he still looked far too young, and in my opinion, I'd rather have had him be older and look a little too old for Younger Valjean, as opposed to having him looking too young for the older Valjean. 3) Second, Hugh Jackman also lacked the proper physicality, he appeared too small and even later when he appeared to be larger, his face looked too small for his body. He also should have had a beard the whole time, not just when he was in prison. 4) Lastly, and most importantly, Hugh Jackman completely lacked the vocal talents to play Valjean. He required more of a classical style voice and required less belting at softer moments. His rendition of ""Bring Him Home"" was pitiful. The style of song is a soft prayer and he just belted it out loud and proud. I felt more like his performance was a half baked attempt between Curly from Oklahoma and Valjean. Ultimately I was not pleased with the outcome. 5) This isn't really a con, but in light of all the other performances I commended in the Pros, Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne's performances lost my attention a bit. Still very strong portrayals and vocal talents, but they didn't stand out to me as much as others did.All in all, I give it a 7. It could have been better.",,Anonymous,History
Stunning.,"I've been a long time fan of Les Mis, and as an avid film fan, I was obviously quite excited to see how such a long, powerful stage show could be appropriately transferred onto screen. I had been following the production of the film for the whole year, but it wasn't until I was finally sitting in the cinema that I realized this film was a masterpiece.First off, let me just say that the stage musical is longer (although it does have an intermission) and some argue that it is difficult to understand if you are not familiar with the plot. This film HAD to make some song cuts and some changes to make it shorter and more understandable. Director Tom Hooper had millions of Les Mis fans watching his every move, so naturally he would disappoint some people with practically every decision he made. The acting too, was superb. I cannot think of one actor in the film that wasn't good enough; even down to the last chorus role, everyone was great. The gutsy decision to encourage acting over singing has really paid off. The live singing would have gone to WASTE if they were going for a polished version. You can feel the pain of each of the characters. Standouts include Hathaway, Barks and Redmayne. I was not disappointed with any singing either. Even Crowe, with whom I had my doubts, had a wonderful husky voice to fit a husky character.The camera angles have turned some off, but personally, I hardly noticed them making a difference. I loved the camera-work in the King's Speech, and it works just as well here. The closeup shots have gained plenty of criticism, and I might say that this too is where I had some issues. I reckon the closeup shots worked wonders for the heart-wrenching solos, but for other times it felt a little awkward. Although I do understand Hooper's reasoning in shoving the poor living conditions in the viewer's face. The cinematography was great at the right moments, but at times I felt that the set could have been more spectacular. So much action happened in one set in the second half of the film, and I feel that if we saw more it would have added a dimension. The sets they did use however were terrific to the last spot.The new song and leitmotifs added work wanders to give the film an essence of something new for avid fans. I would admit it would have been upsetting if it was just the EXACT same as the stage show, because it has been seen so many times by so many people that they may have felt on familiar ground in the cinema.In the end, all I can say is that the film is a masterpiece of modern cinema, and will certainly go down as one of the classics of musical film. While it may not come to win too many awards due to strong competition in cinema this year, it must certainly not go down unrecognized; and word-of-mouth, as I have seen in it's two days since the release, will bring it further than awards ever could. Tom Hooper has done a fine, innovative job in adapting this loved musical. Under the wrong vision, Les Mis could have turned out much much much worse.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Great representation of Hugo's Masterpiece,"Based on the Broadway musical hit, with a cast of excellent actors, you get a magnificent version of Victor Hugo's book, which conveys the history, violence, poverty, revolution and rebellion and different human personalities - the maternal love, the conviction of the revolutionary youth, the opportunism of the scoundrels that exploit poverty to abuse of the wretched, the repentant prisoner, the unjust and discriminatory legal system and the hard and difficult time of the French revolution that completely changed the course of contemporary history. A masterpiece of Hugo, complemented by extraordinary music, that resembles more to a Wagner opera (the leitmotifs that identify the characters and events, great costumes, continuous singing, permanent drama) that a film. A grim and harsh atmosphere of the big city, Paris, and French villages where the action happens, with a camera focused particularly on the gestures and expressions of the characters, is human comedy at its best, or rather, the human tragedy .",9.0,Anonymous,History
Do you hear the people sing?,"I guess there are two types of people in this world; those who buy in to the world of musicals and embrace them, and those who do not. If like me, you fall in to the first camp, I'm sure you will love this movie. From the opening scenes where the two main protagonists, Jean Valjean (Jackman) and Javert (Crowe), first lock proverbial horns, I was sucked in to the turbulent world of 19th century France. The story, if anyone doesn't know is based on Valjean's struggle to turn his life around whilst on the run from the police ‚Äì in the guise of Javert. All the while playing surrogate father to Cosette, the child of Fantine. Along the way there are thrills, spills, action and romance. Basically, most of the ingredients in any blockbuster. What sets this film apart from the rest, is the seamless way it sweeps the audience through all of life's emotions.The cast is exemplary. The singing, a triumph. Crowe has come in for much criticism for his vocals, which I believe to be extremely unfair. Would he be cast to play Javert in The West End or on Broadway? No, off course he wouldn't. But then I can't imagine that any of the main cast, with the exception of Samantha Barks (who plays √âponine) would. We must remember, this is a film musical and not a stage musical. Film and stage are two very different art forms, and require different talents. I cannot think of many (if any) other actors that would bring the required level of acting gravitas to the role of Javert.The casting of Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter in the comic roles of the Th√©nardiers is a master-stroke. Both slip into their roles with ease and play them as larger than life characters and bring much needed light relief. Bonham Carter somehow manages not to be completely upstaged by Baron Cohen. Surely not an easy task for anyone.Les Mis√©rables has received a whole host of Oscar nominations, but how Tom Hooper has not been nominated for the best director gong is beyond me.This is a great film, it will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all it will make you wish you could sing!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Magnificent!,"If you persevere through the opening act, you will be amply rewarded for your patience. True, Crowe's singing does not match those around him but the other performances are good enough that his miscasting does not stay with you for too long.Tom Hooper's use of close-ups gives you an intimacy that would never have been possible on stage. Anne Hathaway is a revelation. She has performed the definitive ""I dream a dream"" and has set the standard to which all others will now be judged. No matter how many times I listen to her rendition, I always feel a lump in my throat. Despite the short time that she is on, she steals the scenes that she's in and truly deserves an Oscar for best supporting actress role.Hugh Jackman is superb and fits the role of Jean Valjean perfectly. In truth, excellent performances abound - Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks - to name but a few.If there is only one film that you would see this year and even if you don't enjoy musicals, I would say that this is the one that you should see - no question.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A literary classic, a stage sensation, and now -- a screen gem","I went into this movie quite determined to love it, if not like it as well. It's one of my favorite musicals, and the cast includes some of my favorite actors, so my bias is there. Well, i love it, and like it quite a bit too. It is a wonderful big-screen realization of a wonderful stage production. The cast does outstanding work, and the orchestration is superb as well. This film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, scoring, art direction/set decoration and costume design. I thought the editing could have been somewhat tighter. And i was put off by the new song that was included in the middle of the movie, which slowed down the plot development unnecessarily. In fact, i wished instead of the new song, the more enjoyable Little People number could have been used in full. Stand-out song performances included Anne Hathaway (I Dreamed a Dream), Russell Crowe (Stars), Hugh Jackman (Who Am I?), Eddie Redmayne (Empty Chairs and Empty Tables) and Daniel Huttlestone (Look Down). Those who are not familiar with the story may wish to check out the non-musical Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush first, before catching this musical version.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Truly Hard To Endure,"I love literature, and I love French writer Victor Hugo who gave the world gems like The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables, on which this musical is based.Personally, I do not like musicals, but I decided to watch this adaptation to see what the fuss is all about(considering that I never completely finished reading the novel). Within the first seconds, I was bombarded with singing that instantly turned me off. I love the story, but it was just too over-the-top with the singing, it absolutely made me cringe, especially when Russell Crowe started to sing. His interpretation of the Inspector Javert character was completely bland. For me, the singing removed away the dramatic significance of some of the scenes, such as when Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman)met the bishop who gave him the two candlesticks. Furthermore, the singing throughout the movie is merely for pure entertainment and removes the significance of dialogue in the interactions that the characters make, because dialogue has been replaced with singing (yes, I know its a musical) and it makes the whole thing extremely superficial.I don't know why I was expecting much from this pretentious piece of cinema that somehow butchers a great piece of literature. I would rather look for the 2000 French mini-series and watch it again.The only saving grace of this movie were the amazing, excellent performances of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Anne Hathaway as the whore Fantine, Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as the comical, thieving, greedy Thenardiers. The fact that Hugh Jackman lost weight and practiced singing for the role shows that he is indeed a well rounded character. Anne Hathaway did indeed deserve and Oscar for her role here which she plays with such emotion; she stands out among the whole cast. As for the rest, beginning with Crowe as Javert and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, their portrayals are nothing to write home about. Russell Crowe's singing is horrendous, and his character here seems to have no purpose because the signing fails to establish any reasonable context to the actions that the characters take and what they are doing what they are doing.The setting and costumes were also OK.",,Anonymous,History
A huge leap forward for movie musicals,"Les Miserables I'll say right up front that I'm not much of a fan of musicals, and, though I've long been familiar with some of its songs and its story of love and redemption amidst a 19th century French uprising, I've never seen the stage production of ""Les Miserables."" So, I wasn't expecting to be real crazy about the movie version. But surprisingly for me, I was entranced.There are two things I hate about musicals: one is characters that burst into song. The other is characters that spontaneously break into perfectly choreographed dancing. But ""Les Miserables"" is technically a rock opera that is sung throughout. That may seem like a small difference, but for me, it actually makes the work more accessible. The actors can't ever technically burst into song since they're already singing. So, the abrupt changes that normally take me out of the movie never happen. And there's absolutely no dancing.The other deviation from the norm that helped the movie work for me, is director Tom Hooper's bold decision to have his actors sing live on the set. Often in movies like this, no matter how convincing the sets and costumes are, the illusion is ruined when the character's voices sound like they were recorded in a warm, comfortable studio somewhere else (because they were). That problem doesn't exist here. The cast is not lip-syncing to songs that were previously recorded. Not only does the live element make it all sound more ""real,"" but you also don't get the sense that they're belting it out as if singing to the last row of a theater (as they might have if they pre-recorded the songs). Instead, they're only playing to a camera that's a few feet away. Because the cast sings the scenes live, they set their own tempo, pausing where they need to for dramatic effect. The music was recorded later, so the music follows the actors, not the other way around. The change makes a huge difference and its effect is very powerful. Essentially, what we are treated to is a very loose, intimate live performance captured on film.Anne Hathaway delivers the most powerful of these performances. She plays the tragic prostitute, Fantine. (Her mother performed the part in a national touring version of the stage show, so you could say this a role Hathaway was literally born to play.) Hathaway performs the signature song, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" in one, single, close-up take ‚Äì and it is devastating.Hugh Jackman is also particularly good. As Jean Valjean, the ex-convict-turned-factory-owner, he carries the movie. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also pop up to provide some much-needed comic relief. (I did find it ironic that all of the Australians and Americans in the cast sing with British accents, while Baron Cohen -- the best-known Brit in the cast -- sings with a French accent.) Not all of the performances are flawless, however, and not all members of the cast have the strongest singing voice (Russell Crowe, I'm talking about you). But this movie is an example of the beauty of imperfection. The flaws enhance the realism. You don't get the sense that Crowe's Javert is an opera singer in a police uniform. You get the sense he's a policeman who's expressing himself with the voice he has.Though the movie is based on a novel that's more then 150 years old, the story has a timely feel. When we see the depictions of barricades in the streets and a populist uprising, one can't help but think of Occupy Wall Street and current debates about social and economic injustice. Maybe the human race still hasn't come that far since the middle of the 1800s, but ""Les Miserable"" does represent a huge leap forward for movie musicals.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not as good as it should and could have been,"I'm going to start by saying that I'm reviewing this film as someone who knew nothing about this story before the film was released. I haven't seen the play / read the book etc. so I am only reviewing the film.I've read some comments that ""you have to know the background to understand"" etc. and this really annoys me. By that logic, all films are fantastic because we should be able to fill in the plot holes ourselves and we should expect to have to continue a storyline in our own minds to make sure the film makes sense...The main reason for giving the film 6 out of 10 is that anything I don't switch off i.e. anything I watch all the way through, gets an automatic 5 and then if there are any good points on top of that, I will increase my rating.The film gets a 6 from me because (as you'd expect with this type of Oscar-bait film) all of the actors give their best and we get to see some fantastic performances from everybody involved.My problem with the film is that it just wasn't a very good story.Again; I'm sure the novel went into so much more detail but that's not what I'm criticising here. The story as depicted in the film is extremely bare and jumps from one ""monologue"" to another with some grand scenes and often random musical numbers in between. A lot of the time the singing is annoying because the songs are not particularly memorable (a few are very good) - sometimes people just start singing their lines without there being a real song. I'm not sure how to explain that but it's annoying!It feels like in order to give every actor their ""15 minutes"" they don't have time to really develop each plot. Some things happen that just make absolutely no sense and are not explained - I don't care if it's explained in the book - if you want to make a film then try to make a good film; don't make a bad film and tell people who criticise you that they should read the book!There are many great elements in this film as mentioned already; the acting but also some of the musical numbers really are great and clearly a lot of effort went into this but given that they had two and a half hours to develop the plot, I don't think there's really an excuse for the lack of plot and character development.Congrats to them for finding a young girl to play Cosette who looks almost identical to the portrait on the original novel (or so says my limited Wikipedia-research). The poster for this film is really eye-catching. Now, when you have higher praise for the marketing team and casting than the film makers, you know there may be a problem.Worth watching but not the epic it's made out to be and whilst the actors and set designers etc. deserve awards, the film itself does not I'm afraid.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
My worst hated musical,"I watched this movie three nights ago and I'm generally never a big fan of musicals however considering reading many positive reviews about this movie, I decided to give it a try and was hoping that it could change my perspective. It unfortunately was very disappointing and after almost three hours of singing, I had enough. These songs were done by actors who clearly did not have any experience and training in singing. Even simple dialogues were in songs which were very irritating considering the fact that the writer had obviously aimed for a 100% musical without any normal dialogue. It seems like a cheaply made movie consisting mostly of only a few stages which is repeated throughout the whole movie. The first scene was very eye-catching which seemed to have been designed to prevent further disappointment. Even though the theatre had assigned the largest screen to this movie but it never really helped to drive my enthusiasm. The settings were always too dark and depressing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic Musical,"Of course, this film is inspired by a theatrical production inspired by a book loosely based on real life events. And the translation generally works. Score is tremendous, and performed very well (notably Hathaway and Redmayne). Yet, Hugo may have issues with the way his story is told. E.g. Cosette is being horrendously treated, yet Bonham-Carter and Baron-Cohen are comedic instead of utterly unforgiving scum. Nevertheless, I loved it and still do. On this note, please read the book - and Hunchback - Last Day - just for the wisdom, humanity and social conscience of a Great and Good Frenchman...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables review from a big fan in London,"The transition from stage to screen is never an easy one for any musical let alone one which is not simply a musical but a modern opera that continues to delight audiences all over the world. Tom Hooper faced this challenge head on and in a risky move, stuck to the show's sung through format and only rarely do the actors employ spoken dialogue. Is there a place for the sung through musical on the big screen? If It is done properly, then yes and that is what makes the movie of Les Miserables a milestone, not the live singing. Much has been said of Anne Hathaway's take on the consumptive prostitute, Fantine, and her version of I dreamed a dream stands out not only because the actress plays the part so well but also because the orchestrations have been stripped to what at times, makes the song sound like a chamber piece but it works so well and you will be forgiven for shedding a few tears. Hugh Jackman delivers a captivating performance as Jean Valjean and the young leads of Cosette, Eponine and Marius are beautifully interpreted by Amanda Seyfried, Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne, whose Empty chairs at empty tables will no doubt leave some of you reaching for your hankies again. Yet another stand out performance comes from Aaron Tveit as Enjolras who leads a highly competent set of 'Barricade boys'. Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were fittingly cast as the Thenardiers and I laughed during their scenes. The role of Gavroche has been expanded slightly and offers a chance to pay homage to Oliver. That now leaves us with Russell Crowe who appears to be going somewhere with his take on Javert though a sense of frustration over never catching Valjean, is something that could have been worked on and without giving too much away, one might want a bit more anguish leading up to that certain climactic moment. I will however give him credit for giving what I think is a nice rendition of Stars and the confrontation scene is done really well. Voice wise, he's not brilliant but far from awful. On the technical side of things, the IMAX experience of Les Miserables is fantastic and the sound engineers did a superb job of mixing the live vocals with the orchestra in post- production. For those of you who are as nerdy as me, the orchestrations are mainly new, intimate at times and big when necessary. At points they sound more like the ones used for the 25th anniversary concert, in particular during One day more. The synthesisers, bass and electric guitars as well as the drum kit are nowhere to be heard. The costumes are realistic and come across nicely on screen and the CGI added a certain dreamlike quality, taking in the best of what Moulin Rouge and Sweeney Todd had to offer though don't always expect a still camera but do expect some nice vistas. There were moments where I thought a song was edited too much and therefore rushing the narrative a bit and with the film running at more than two and a half hours, a few more minutes wouldn't have killed anyone. We shall see if there will be an extended blu-ray edition. All in all this is a film which I highly recommend and while it is not perfect, the good outshines the bad and most importantly, it touches you as much as the stage production. For all the fans out there, the parts that made you cry in the theatre will make you cry in the cinema and for the uninitiated, you will see why Les Miserables has become the success it is and you will certainly connect with at least one of those iconic characters. I give this film 8/10 Well done Tom Hooper and cast!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A wonderful movie musical,"Although I had never seen ""Les ""Mis"" before, I was very eager to see the movie. I do like musicals and it looked like a very good story as well. I absolutely loved the music and how passionate the performances were by the actors. I actually liked the fact that the majority of the film was sung. It brought a certain emotion to it that simply can't be felt by talking. The story was very touching and it was a joy to see the transformation of Jean Valjean. It was amazing to see that he could go from a prisoner with nothing to a man who changes his life and becomes a father to a young girl who is in desperate need. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant Musical of the past times.,"Les Miserables: 8.5/10Entertaining, Artistic, Melodious, Brillianted Acted by the ensemble cast and Perfectly presented by the talented Tom Hooper, Les Miserables is almost like a breath of fresh air to movies of the past and is a real entertaining and artistic ride from the start to the end, and is aided by the amazing acting from the front trio(Jackman, Crowe and Hatthaway) and the rest of the cast and the brilliant presentation by Tom Hooper who has made one of the finest Musicals of the past years.The Story which is based on the book written by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg and Alain Boublil, is during the 1800's in France where a prisoner Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) is given his freedom after many years of prison, but with a note of shame because of which he can never get any recognition. But after getting inspired by An Old Man after he stayed at his house for a night, he decides to become a better person and after some years He becomes the Mayor of a town and now runs a factory and lives a good life, but his old tormentor or the guard of the prison he was in Javert( Russel Crowe) is back to reveal his identity and take him back to prison, but Jean decides to take the girl of the deceased and dying Fatine( Anne Hatthaway) and fulfill her wishes of keeping her daughter safe and he must run from Javert and give Cosette a good life to live.The Acting by the whole cast in the movie was absolutely as good as it gets, and every single actor in the scene's have done their role's superbly and have done brilliantly with their lyrics too. But Hugh Jackman steals the show as the lead character Jean Valjean who is running a life of running away and keeping his daughter and himself from harm and Jackman does amazingly in this performance and makes the role his own, his acting and lyrics delivery is quite perfect and this is one of his best performances ever and he proves that he can do lead roles by himself. Anne Hatthaway does'nt have much screen time in the movie, but whatever she has done, she's done to utmost brilliance as the desperate mother Fatine who can do anything to save her daughter from harm, and the role is perfect for her and she does perfectly too. Russel Crowe too did a great job as the ruthless Javert and his lyrics delivery is superb. Sacha Boren Cohen and Helena Botham Carter give an comedical taste to the movie with their hilarious performance as the sly couple who had Cosette, and Amanda Seyfield and Eddie Redmayne too have done their jobs well.Tom Hooper was quite bold in making this type of a movie, as this is his 4th movie ever but he is such a talented director that he has made a superb musical movie and one of the best of the past years, he had chosen and handled his multi-talented cast perfectly and he has synchronised all the lyrics of the movie brilliantly with the visuals as well as the music, and all the aspects of the scenes were terrificly well made and he continues to keep on making great films and entertaining one's too and considering the amount of work he had to put in with such a huge staff, he really did a great work to make this movie.The Story of the movie based on a book is quite brilliant and all the years shown in the life of Jean where he travels through different places are written superbly, and it is adapted brilliantly by Screen- Play Writer William Nicholson and the lyrics of the movie are so brilliantly written as well by Herbert Kretzmer and they are greatly fitted for a musical movie and all the aspects of the story are synchronised superbly in the film. The Cinematography of the Movie is also quite great as the places of the pre-war France is shown superbly and some of the scenes are quite spectacular and the Cinematographer Danny Cohen really did a great job.The Music in these type of Musical-movies are obviously the backbone of the movie and the music director Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg did not disappoint here, as he did a terrific job in synchronising the music perfectly with all the lyrics in the movie and the different type of classical music used by him in the movie can be a music-lover's delight. The Art Direction team needs to get its applause too for its superb effort with the art direction of the film and the 1800's France is so brilliantly shown in the movie. The Costume Design team too needs to get applause for its effort with the costumes worn by the actors and the costumes were so realistic and added to the brilliance of the film.Finally, this movie is one of the best musical movies i've ever watched and one of 2012's finest movies which can be enjoyed by all sets of audience and this can be a real Awards favourite this time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The People Look Down,"I am previously familiar with neither book nor stage version. The same criticisms (and of course praise) dog it since the 1860s as I read: bombastic, simplistic, manipulative. Baudelaire praised the book's social indictment but called the writing 'tasteless and inept'.The public each time voted with their money; people like what they like and that is that. So let's see something else, cinematic.It's the camera that appeals to me, this is the subjective camera that hovers around the characters, sometimes floats or swirls with the action. Calling attention to itself as present in the film, this camera is unlike the smooth, invisible one favored by old Hollywood and classic musicals, it is from a radically different cinematic tradition much more interesting to me.I have noticed that it's being used in a variety of recent films, down to Snow White & Huntsman, I believe the film responsible for bringing it back in the vocabulary in a big way is Malick's Tree of Life. Malick of course did not invent it, but he's been doing the most high- profile work as of late in this mode. I'm eagerly anticipating his next batch of films as the next step forward, we'll see.Previous landmark instances of this camera include, 1) Soviet films like Soy Cuba (Kalatozov) and Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (Parajanov), 2) Welles in Chimes and a variety of projects, and back to France in the silent era, 3) Menilmontant (Kirsanof), A Propos de Nice (Vigo) or your choice of Epstein. Great films all, a bit different than the norm, that I recommend to you.It hasn't been always used to consciously the same effect, but it can achieve a few great things, at least Malick knows this; it can immerse you in the world of the film as a pair of eyes, it can discover the space of the story, in the silent era they filmed in this way to create 'city symphonies', and linked to both create something like memory or daydream.So my problem is not that it's overly sentimental. The same can be said about Malick. Both this and his Tree are lush cinematic symphonies. Both films are structured as people being 'reborn' into previous or next lives. Both films end with sweeping visions of inter-connected souls in some afterlife.The opening shot is pretty astonishing, we start underwater beneath a French flag, swim up and jump fifty feet in the air to see a galleon being impossibly tugged by grimy prisoners. So there's great potential in the camera, the songs are catchy as hell and as they later recur in the film, you have memories of them as memories of the characters' previous lives.So it's interesting that it goes nowhere. It's all average here, nothing submerged‚Äîall you need to know or see is loudly splashed on you, bucket after bucket of spent youth, injustice, the redemption that love affords and sacrifice it demands. We will see a lot more Oscar bait from this Hooper.Whereas Malick shines a fragile light to a fragile reality, this drowns and flattens.It's like being in a rally, rousing for a while but tiresome because you're not getting anything done, you're not getting to know anyone, and the slogans seems more and more mindless and simplistic, a waste of energy.",,Anonymous,History
Classic Musical destroyed by star power,One of the greatest musicals of all time and a director's quest for the biggest names turned it into one of the worst musical adaptations to date. Rather than finding actors that had the vocal prowess to actually pull their roles off they went with huge names and filmed the singing live. There were notable standouts but overall this movie was a major letdown.,6.0,Anonymous,History
Almost perfect .....,"Absolute priority - take a very big hankie. This screen version captures an intensity of emotion that I feel is impossible with the stage version, simply because you feel you are there, sharing all the experiences, which you cannot do seated in a theatre. Anne Hathaway's rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' is breathtaking and heartbreaking in its emotion as is Eddie Redmayne's of 'Empty Chairs'. There were two elements that for me did not work: the 'Master of the House' scene was not as raucous and rumbustious as seen on stage (twice)-it involved too many customers and therefore the interplay between 'Master' & Mistress'did not come across as effectively, plus I was not taken with Amanda Seyfried's singing voice - reminded me of the type of voice one would hear in a 30's/40's musical film. Although Russell Crowe's voice was not as strong as some may have liked, for me it reflected a character that was damaged and vulnerable and it worked. And for those wondering if Hugh Jackman could make 'Bring Him Home' work - a resounding Yes ! I left the cinema feeling that I had fought on the barricades, suffered alongside a brave man (Jean Valjean), cried over the unrequited love of Eponine, had a flickering of compassion for Javert and all to the background of wonderful overpowering music. And you wonder why I recommended a big hankie !",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A musical that's a tale of hope, love and rising to oppose the rich and powerful for change!","""Les Miserables"" is one of those musical's that is long and drawn out and kind of in depth from director Tom Hooper. And the film may not be liked by everyone as the live music action taking place on screen is much different than that of actual speaking dialogue it's like a live action musical! Anyway it has a touch of history being set in 19th century France as it involves the citizens uprising against the powerful and corrupted. Based on a Broadway play the musical performances are top notch especially the vocal work of Anne Hathaway. The story is centered around Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) a prisoner a French convict who after years of hard labor has broken away from the grips of the tough and rugged French officer enforcer Javert(Russell Crowe), and along the way Jean will become the protector of Fantine's(Anne Hathaway) beautiful daughter. Fantine a woman who was a factory worker has turned to the world's oldest profession of selling her body to make a buck for her daughter takes a dive. So the rest of the way the surge and uprising and new revolt of citizens is lead by the ex convict Jean. Overall this film entertains as a musical and it's message of the people's uprising of revolt and fighting for freedom and rights of equality and wage rights rings true today overall a film that dreams of freedom, equal rights and human equality that equals and fights the powerful.",6.0,Anonymous,History

An ode to the Hollywoodization of mighty musicals,"Just seen Les Miserables and came out of it shaking with rage. How dare they reduce the greatest musical ever made to this pile of absolute s***. The only bearable bits I found were Russel Crowe, because he actually decided that acting was a good idea, and Eponine, but even then she lacked the power and strength of voice to sing the part. If I were to pinpoint all that was wrong with the movie I'd be here longer than the show's been around. And Hugh Jackman, you have no excuse. You are a musical theatre actor and you have brought shame upon yourself and your profession for your lack of vocal control (meaning his huge sodding vibrato) and your decision to NOT even bother with any acting. Any half-wit can shed a tear and make his eyes water. My advice, GO SEE THE MUSICAL! You won't want to tear your eyes out and plug your ears. Shame on you Cameron Mackintosh.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A MASTERPIECE IN ITS OWN RIGHT,"Tom Hooper's 'Les Mis√©rables' (2012) is a dramatic and outstanding musical about Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) after breaking parole in 19th century France. He then makes a decision that would change his entire life.Oh my days, this is an extraordinary achievement for musicals! This is so much more than just a film, it is an experience with tremendous heart! It is heart-warming, heart-wrenching, heartbreaking and heartfelt!'Les Mis√©rables' has a great set design and beautiful cinematography with close-ups turning into wide-angle shots during the musical numbers.
It suffices if we just take a look at the impeccable opening showing the French Flag attached to a huge ship being pulled in by prisoners while the fantastic song 'Look Down' starts playing. Pure perfection!Here we have a fantastic soundtrack that is so good that you can even play it on its own! Admittedly some of the musical performances are a little weaker than others, but all of them are impactful enough to make the viewer care about the story and the characters!
If I am not mistaken, 2 songs in this film copied the melody from 2 songs out of Tim Burton's musical 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' (2007) (which is actually my favorite musical), however they do fit in their intended scenes!'Les Mis√©rables' is well written and the pacing is also quite good with the exception of a few scenes that are a tad bit long.Let's now talk about the superb cast!
Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter and Eddie Redmayne, just to name a few!
It is unbelievable that these phenomenal actors are also gifted with this incredible voice that they show off very beautifully! In my opinion, the best singing duo in this film consists of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, hands down! Their musical performances together and even alone are absolutely breathtaking, moving and beautiful! Both of them have great singing voices with the ability to completely capture the audience's attention in the most striking fashion!
Before watching this film, I had already been aware of the outstanding musical talent of Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen from their brilliant performances in Burton's 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'! I genuinely believe Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter don't get nowhere near as much credit as they undoubtedly deserve! They bring this gritty atmosphere with them sprinkled with a funny undertone!
Even the children delivered great acting and musical performances!Stunning visuals, fluent transitions between scenes, a good romance and plenty of effective emotional gut punches!
There were also a lot of moments when I found the film to be unpredictable.This was my second viewing of the film and I can confirm that it is rewatchable, however I don't see myself rewatching this film on a very frequent basis due to the long runtime of 158 minutes.
My go-to musical still is 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' which I watch very often!Overall, 'Les Mis√©rables' is a great achievement for musicals in general because the musical numbers carry this epic and grand piece in an extravagant way! A beautiful soundtrack, outstanding performances and great moments as a whole make this a very rewarding and also rewatchable experience! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Nearly Achieved The Impossible,"Not only is Ann Hathaway the greatest ""Cat Woman"" ever, but she also won an Oscar for best supporting actress in a roll with limited on screen time that probably should not have qualified for a nomination in the first place. Yes! She is that good! It would have been simple to cast seasoned Broadway performers throughout the movie, but the brilliant cast choices will surely bring in some curious onlookers who otherwise would stay away. Russel Crowe gave an adequate performance, but did not quite capture ""Javert"" as the relentless,heartless,despicable and sadistic individual that he was. Hugh Jackman continues to demonstrate his great versatility. Is there anything he can't do? Samantha Barks, Eddy Redmayne, and Aaron Tveit helped to elevate the whole production to new heights with their amazing voices. At times the movie was breathtaking,but it did seem to drag on. It is much too long and even the die-hard fans were starting to fidget in their seats.

What is all this juice?,"A poet and priest, Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote in his very Christian poem ""Spring"" - ""What is all this juice and all this joy?"", referring to nature, God's creation, and I think the answer can be found in Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"". What is the essence of all this joy? It is beauty, it is creativity, and in ""Les Miserables"" both are a bit overwhelming. The deepest things are seen and heard in a fresh way. Someone said ""caring is the greatest thing"", and this film is all about caring, every kind of caring. A priest for the suffering, a mother for her child, man for his fellow man. And a deep caring is also reflected in the making of the film. So much is so original in the production that there's too much to mention, and remarkably the film's originality doesn't draw attention to itself, primarily because of the performances that are so direct and human. The formidable technological contributions don't get in the way. Everything serves the story. This is a year in which many of the best films are best seen in the theater - ""Lincoln"", ""Life of Pi"", ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", and now ""Les Miserables"".",10.0,Anonymous,History

Aptly Named!,"After reviewing a number of the other reviews here, it is clear that I just didn't get it. The 'sung- through' style of 'singing' any dialog between the characters was, uh, agonizing to sit through. Of the main characters only Hathaway and Seyfried could hold a note; Jackman and Crowe should really, and I mean really, never appear in a musical again. Another disconcerting thing was the character Gavroche, the little urchin kid, who spoke and sang with an extreme English Cockney accent. Really? If they needed a kid with an accent are you telling me that the producers couldn't find a kid, any kid, with an accent similar to the other actors/actresses in the film, or, hell, maybe a French accent??

Hugh Jackman is the most impressive role in it, his appearance in the film change a lot but still so so unforgettable.

Le mis review,"Le miserables is a musical from the academy award winning director Tom Hooper who is well known for his work in the 2010 film ""the kings speech"". Hooper is back again and is stepping out of his comfort zone a little bit with a musical, not just any musical but the very popular musical ,Le miserables and not only did he chose a musical with very little straight talking and most of the movie being sung, but all the singing was filmed along with the scene in real time witch makes for a slightly less polished singing performance but if you know Le mis its anything but polished.Hugh Jackman plays the lead character Jean val jean who is a convict that was convicted for stealing a loaf of bread for his sisters starving child and was forced to spend 20 years in incarceration. once he was let free he was put on parole but he had ran away and failed to report to his parole and started a new life. the story revolves around him and the people that he helps and puts his life on the line for all while being chased by military officer Je vert played by Kurt Russel. the cast also includes Anne Hathaway and Amanda Sifried.first of all I'm just going to say this movie is not for everyone.this movie is more like a play happening in front of your eyes in movie form. its a very long movie but i think if it was any shorter it wouldn't really connect with all the points that would make this a full story. with this movie being based off a play it has no real middle, movies usually have three acts and Le mis is based of a play and they have two acts so its a little hard sometimes to figure out where you are in the movie. but the music is very good and you find songs that you herd earlier in the movie coming back is some of the dialogue melody's. the singing really went hand in hand with the acting and although some where better than others overall the acting and singing really carried the movie and kept me interested.overall i think the movie was very good. it will definitely be a Oscar contender and without a doubt take home some awards. although this movie is not for everybody i think if you go in with a open mind and just see the movie for what it is you will probably come out with a smile on your face.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Surprisingly Powerful,"I had not originally planned on reviewing this film, or seeing it for that matter, it was just a routine night out with friends and I had little input as to the final destination. Sometimes it's just more fun to take a back-seat and enjoy the company of others. It ended with the kind woman sitting next to me trying to unobtrusively stuff tissues into my coat pocket. Saying that much, post movie, I just had to say something about it to someone who wasn't there. It's said that happiness shared is happiness multiplied; but, it's just as true that it's happier still to broadcast your joy to the heights. Having said that much : The total production of the film was bleak and depressing, to say the least, perfectly in keeping with the film's theme. The sets, costumes, makeup, art everything were all top-notch. It also helps to have actually read the novel. If you do you'll have a deeper understanding of the characters, motivations and the significance of the historical setting. Hugo was brutal.What's left is to find performances by the cast you like. Wow, to start, it's undeniable that Anne Hathaway as Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Russel Crow as Javert, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were all tremendous. I have to mention Hathaway's performance was very moving. She gave real life and form to one of literature's most wretched characters. Crowe was exceptional as a classic villain cast into that position by life's uglier circumstances. Amanda Seyfried was breathtakingly beautiful as the story's corner post, being - at the same time - Fantine's downfall and Valjean's salvation.As for the rest ... well ... ... it's hard to put into words really, but Hugh Jackman was nothing short of stunning in the lead; and stunning is too little praise for what I experienced. I had no idea he was such an incredibly talented singer. The film is not really a musical (does anyone else know the difference anymore?), it's a grand opera and Jackman, I think, could hold his own in most operas in the world he's that good. Wow. Amazing. The music had such power and passion it was impossible not to be moved. Now, I have to admit that I might be a touch biased, being a father of a grown, married daughter myself I can totally identify with his performance ... and ... a professional who should know once told me that I reminded her of Valjean in the book. But even with those biases it was still nothing less than a completely magnificent performance. At this point I am left drained and convinced that it was the most powerfully convincing performance I've ever witnessed by a man on film; or any other media for that matter. It even washed away the smarmy, slimy aftertaste from being subjected to Django Unchained the day before.So, by all means, see Les Miserables. It is an uplifting paean to the soul of humanity and reflects that good can be found anywhere, even in the most unlikely of places. Thanks Hugh.By Bruce L.

"I hate musicals, but...","...this one was really great entertainment, from the start to the very end. I think that both Anne Hathaway, for her incredible rendition of ""I dreamed a dream"" and Hugh Jackman, for the whole performance - but in particular for the starting scenes when Jean Valjean is still a prisoner - deserve an Oscar. By far, the most stunning performances I saw in years. Helena Bonham Carter was as good as ever and Eddie Redmayne (who I didn't know before this movie) a great surprise too. The only thing that I hated (and I wasn't the only one, judging from the comments of the other viewers around me) was Russell Crowe: weak and totally inexpressive voice.

Unenjoyable Musical Score,"During the film I gradually downgraded my initial 10/10 expectation to a score of five. I had this film earmarked as a special viewing treat for some time so was really surprised at how much I didn't like it.I knocked off a mark first of all because I couldn't get through it all in one sitting. That's bad, but then again that could be attributed to something else.Victor Hugo's novel is a really exciting read, so I knocked off another mark for the film being so pedestrian. Granted, trying to condense such a body of work into a couple of hours is hard, but that usually results in inaccuracies, not drudge-like film entertainment.The singing by Hugh Jackman was valiant but irritating. His voice is whiny and not up to the job, while Russell Crowe, unfortunately, was even worse. Big names, star-studded cast, but horrible sonics. Another mark erased.But the worst aspect of all was the musical score. Two marks off. Listening to the main characters recounting their thoughts in song sounded, instead, like they were just making it up on the spot. I had difficulty believing many of the songs had a pre-defined structure at all. Considering virtually the whole film was in song, how could they have penned something so dull?There were some good aspects to the film such as the inclusion of Sacha Baron Cohen, who is universally excellent, the parts with pretty Anne Hathaway, as well as some of the close up, portrait-like cinematography, but I couldn't help feeling the cast selection was an unimaginative rehash of other musicals/period dramas, especially the clich√©d inclusion of Helena Bonham Carter.If you've seen 'Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street' you'll appreciate how a musical should be done. It's witty, has great songs and has an underpinning dark and cynical nature to it.LM has great actors, who don't act, but try to sing-talk instead, emphasising the director's tactic of using big names instead of concentrating on good singing.To be fair to the cast and production crew, it's a musical ruined by a weak score.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""Les Miserables"" is a thundering, emotional wallop","Tom Hooper's emotional wallop of a film is easily the biggest spectacle in recent years. It's a lavish musical that hasn't been seen since ""Chicago"" took a stab at it back in 2003, complete with intricate and ornate sets, lush costumes, and of course, singing. Lots of singing. In fact, there's only singing, and while it may take a bit of getting used to, the skill and expertise of the actors is put on display in a rare and marvelous way that no one dare not appreciate. The film, based on both Victor Hugo's sprawling novel as well as the famed Broadway production, takes us into 19th-century France, where Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) daughter, Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), a fateful decision that changes all of their lives forever. Throw in a couple of hilarious scene-stealing performances by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, and a solid turn by young Eddie Redmayne, and you've got a a minor casting miracle on your hands. What makes this film really stand out among musicals is the choice to use live singing on set. No voice-overs or dubbing of any kind here. Every word and note are presented as they were sung on set, raw and true. The result is both refreshing and gritty, lending a darker edge to a usually uplifting genre. While the title may suggest great sadness, the power and triumph and beauty of life in this grand film cannot be overcome, and I challenge anyone to emerge from this film feeling ""miserable"".-Thomas Bond",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Vidiot Reviews,"Les Mis√©rablesThe hardest part of vocal performance during a revolution is not confusing your musket for your pitch pipe.Fortunately, perfect pitch is not a prerequisite for this musical.Breaking parole to start anew, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) assumes a new name and becomes the mayor of a village.But when Valjean's former prison guard (Russell Crowe) recognizes him, Valjean must flee; however, this time with the daughter of a deceased prostitute (Anne Hathaway).When Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) matures, she becomes romantic with a revolutionist (Eddie Redmayne) that Valjean later saves the life of during an uprising.Meanwhile, Valjean's nemesis threatens to expose his sorted past to his adopted daughter.Based on the musical inspired by Victor Hugo's novel, this contemporary adaptation looks fastidious, but sounds amateurish, with only a few tolerable singers, and even fewer French accents.Besides, the only thing that the French won't rebel against is Nazis occupation.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,History

This is such an epic musical and one of the most popular of all time and this film tarnishes its reputation. It's just SO bleeding boring. And campy. And just falls flat.

Riveting and emotional is the best I can summon up. Anne Hathaway for me takes my top award - for the part as a whole, but 'I dreamed a dream' was incredible.

Bravo!,"See full review (www.browney237.com)There had been much discussion about Tom Hooper's direction and the fact that all songs were sung live. I wondered if this was to manage expectations down? From the opening scene in the shipyard with the sound of the water splashing and ""Look Down"" in semi muffled tones and the mountain scene you are quickly transported from stage to screen.While neither Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe have the depth of voice that the roles on stage have traditionally command this is quickly overcome. They can both act and it's a movie so it genuinely works. Jackman's portrayal of a man wracked with guilt in the monastery sets the scene for a wonderful performance as Jean Valjean.Much has already been written and said of Anne ""Give her the Oscar now"" Hathaway and how she quite simply steals the show. Her performance is breathtaking. I have listened and seen many versions of Les Miserables but nobody has and most likely will ever capture ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in way she does. It's raw emotion and simply takes your breath away. She isn't standing in front of a microphone belting it out, she is just sobbing her way through it accompanied by the audience.Crowe's presence grows throughout the movie. He looks every inch the policeman and both his major songs ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Suicide"" are well done with a talk/sing style which works well for him. He isn't a weak link at all.For me, the performances of Amanda Seyfried as Corsette and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were satisfying, whereas Samantha Barks as Eponine quite simply nailed it.There is a very strong religious theme much more evident for me in the movie than in the stage production. I have simply been astounded how the line ""To love another person is to see the face of God"" has reverberated around the twittersphere.Overall Les Miserables the movie is a success. It doesn't seek to be the stage show reproduced to fit the screen but seeks to define itself - bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,History

The sets are huge and impressive and no expense spared.In my opinion there is a massive gulf in quality between the stage performers and Hollywood stars, with √âponine (Samantha Barks) giving such an amazing performance.I am a fan of the stage show and was really pleased with what was done.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Stop shaking the camera on purpose!!,"Dear Mr Hooper,First of all, thank you for a near-perfect film.However, if you want to be all trendy and not use tripods then that's up to you of course, but having the cinematographer shake the camera about ON PURPOSE is distracting, over-rated and looks amateur. Actually perhaps I'm being too harsh here...on amateurs. No amateur cameraman that I've seen, jostles his instrument about deliberately, to further exaggerate the ""hand-heldness"" of the camera! Why would he? He knows it'll be annoying and possibly nauseating to his viewers. So he tries his best to keep it still...but we can still tell it's hand-held. And we can tell this very easily because we are NOT COMPLETELY STUPID.You wanted a live feel and so you mic'ed up the actors on set and filmed and used long takes. Brilliant. Awesome. I have never seen or heard better singing performances on the silver screen. Like I said initially, this movie was near-perfection for me. I've been to the cinema twice to see your film, (though the second time I sat way back,) and I shed a tear in the same places both times.You wanted a live feel so you had your cinematographer man-handle the camera into the faces of the actors. Commendable. It's okay not to use tripods. But having the camera bouncing around even more, not only draws attention to the cinematographic hardware, but also to the fact it's being deliberately mishandled. That detracts from the subject matter, and we don't need it thanks. We're trying to look through this window into the world you've created, so stop flipping-well shaking the window about!Yours sincerely, Regular Movie-goer.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A mediocre adaptation of the stage musical.,"Couldn't wait to watch this film but now that I did I can't say that I'm impressed... My biggest objection was the casting of Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman as the movie's leading characters. Crowe's acting and singing was disastrous. Jackman's performance was convincing enough but his voice wasn't what someone would call captivating... ''Les Miserables'' is a musical filled with overly emotional and heartfelt songs consequently great acting and singing skills are required to transmit these emotions to the viewer. That wasn't the case here. Rest of the cast did a great job especially Anne Hathaway and the girl who portrayed Eponine.Another issue I had was the director's obsession with close ups during the actors' singing performances. This would have done the trick had the actors possessed better acting and singing skills. It worked for Hathaway but not the aforementioned duo. It also made the overall movie experience feel a bit boring and uninspired. Beautiful sets and a bit of body language (a little dancing maybe?) instead of constant close ups would have made the film more pleasant to watch.Finally the pacing felt a bit rushed and made the story seem somehow implausible; Characters and their emotions felt totally underdeveloped (Marius and Cosette fell madly in love with each other right after they shared their first 'hello'!!!).All in all, the movie was O.K. (not bad) but having watched the stage musical a few months ago (which is spectacular by the way) I must say it felt like a missed opportunity. A not so talented director and a few miscasts killed this one (6 out of 10).",,Anonymous,History
"Some outstanding vocal performances and moving moments, but better on stage","I have seen the musical on Broadway several times and have viewed the various Les Mis movies. I was looking forward to the movie based on the musical. In many ways it did not disappoint. There are some outstanding vocal performances (Marius, Fontaine and Eponine) Hugh Jackman managed to pull off the vocally demanding Val Jean. However the vocal mix was a bit strange, with the beautiful orchestrations buried. That is until the last song, when the surround sound seemed to kick in. The recitatives which carry the plot along might have been better spoken then sung. And Javier was a huge disappointment.

A Great Musical,"As someone who has never seen the stage adaption (or any adaption that is), I really enjoyed this. While some fans have complained about it, I really loved Tom Hooper's direction and cinematography. It was visually stunning to look at and really helped captured the incredible scope of the project. All of the performances are great here. It's been a while since i've seen a film with such raw and emotional performances. Normally in a musical, there's at least a few numbers that I don't care for, but here I enjoyed all of them and can't really think of any that irritated me or that I disliked. Some I enjoyed more than others, but none of them I disliked. I really enjoyed the story as well, but felt like it would've been easier to follow if I had been familiar with the story before hand like I can imagine most who are going to see this are. If I really have any other complaints, I did feel that the start of the 2nd act was a little shaky where the film lost it's focus on the main story and fell into focusing a bit more on a relationship between two characters a bit more than I felt it needed too. I also felt that some exchanges of dialouge that were sung between the numbers came off as rather comical and would've been better if the actors had communicated without singing their lines.

"A Visual Spectacle, Though Not My Cup of Tea","In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who for decades has been hunted by the ruthless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) after he breaks parole, agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter, Cosette. The fateful decision changes their lives forever.Let me say that this film is visually stunning and for those who love the musical, I think they will be quite happy with the performances here. Tom Hooper has given our senses something to enjoy, and this may be his bet work yet (though I still prefer ""King's Speech"").Hugh Jackman is a performer even more so than he is an actor. Maybe that is a fine distinction, but Jackman has singing and dancing in his blood. Sure, he made a name for himself as Wolverine (among other roles), but he also starred in ""Oklahoma"" and other musicals. The world of ""Les Mis"" is no foreign territory, and he shows this. I wish I could say the same for Russell Crowe, who was pale in comparison (though with Valjean as the hero, maybe this is okay).Stealing the show are Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Could two people have filled their roles better? I doubt it. They had too brief a time on screen to be seriously considered as supporting actors, I suppose, but I would still wish that honor upon them just the same.Which brings me to Anne Hathaway. I just do not care for her. I cannot say she is a bad actress and I cannot say she is a bad singer, but I did not care for her as Fantine and although she gave it 110%, I just do not have my heart in giving her an Oscar for this role. She has a Golden Globe and she is probably the Oscar front-runner, but I just do not see it. Although, I suppose this is the peak of her career (thus far).More than my personal dislike of Hathaway is my apathy towards the film in general. I never fully empathized with Valjean or any of the other characters. I like the historical context of France between the two revolutions (1789 and 1848) and I appreciate that the June Rebellion is included in the musical. But the overall story is Valjean's redemption, and the story is too broad and covers too much time.I know I am probably in the minority and those who love musicals are huge fans of ""Les Mis"". I like my share of musicals, but I just cannot get behind this one. I can accept it getting Oscars for sound mixing and visuals, but Anne Hathaway as best actress? No way. And best picture?

Russell - Il Chante Bien!!,"This was an amazing movie. For me what made it so interesting was how difficult it must have been to act and sing at the same time with a camera right up front. Russell Crowe was perfect in the part of Javert and had a great Baritone voice. The opening scene when they were pulling the ship into the dry dock was really cool, imagine what it must have been like to build ships in those days. Hugh Jackman toiling in the bottom of the dry dock reminded me of Ben Hur in the guts of the Roman Galleon. It was hard to believe that these actors were not professional singers, they were all so great. The scenes in Paris were recreated extremely well. I can just imagine what the barricades must have been like. I guess my favourite song was by Samantha Barks who played √âponine. I must admit I am biased toward anything French, having grown up in Qu√©bec. Where would we be without Descartes and Fourier!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Real singers badly needed to put over this epic tale of squalor and redemption...,"I have to give this a decidedly mixed review.My first impression before the film's first hour was over was a silent reminder ""don't buy the soundtrack."" The singing, even from Hugh Jackman who acquitted himself so well as ""Curly"" in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ""Oklahoma!"" is, to put it charitably, just passable. Russell Crowe does as well as can be expected since he is a non-singer to begin with, but the others do not have the kind of voices that are needed to put over this kind of material.Cinematically, it's a bit over-the-top with its wondrous camera views from high places. Nothing is done to suggest that the squalor isn't real. The mud is as muddy as possible and the make-up (in extreme close-ups of Anne Hathaway for example), is enough to convince us that these wretched people had nothing to sing about.Not being a fan of the show and familiar with only a couple of the songs, I was not expecting to be thrilled by the score alone--and I wasn't. Whether you have an appetite for these kind of musical numbers is clearly a matter of taste. Most of the lyrics are as downbeat and desperate as the story itself suggests.A much needed touch of humor is furnished by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, although some of the humor is a bit gross and overdone.The almost unrecognizable first appearance of Hugh Jackman as a slave hauling a ship with his comrades as Jaffert (Russell Crowe) looks on, is an astonishing moment. Jackson looks nothing like his real self, so part of his performance can be attributed to a marvelous make-up job. But he does well with the anguish and pain of seeing so much suffering around him. Anne Hathaway is obviously a singer/actress who does all she can with the powerful emotions she displays in her big scene, but her role is a small one in the scheme of things.Despite the power of some of the performances, the overall effect for me was a story that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale and hard to follow unless paying strict attention.Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live. The pre-recording of all the lyrics would have enhanced the big numbers which required more vocal ability and professional technique than is offered here.Summing up: Definitely not for everyone, but the squalor of the French Revolution period is magnificently realistic with lavish, detailed sets and costumes that convey the right atmosphere. Stunning photography is evident in the final scene where Crowe's conscience forces him to take drastic action.Biggest flaw: The lack of tension in the cat-and-mouse game between Crowe and Jackman that was so powerfully portrayed in straight dramatic versions of the story filmed previously which sharpened the suspense. Instead, Crowe's recognition of the hunted man is done so casually that there is no building of suspense from the outset.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Not only does she sing amazingly, but her performance is beyond imagination. Hugh Jackson, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, is haunting as Jean Valjean, He, too, is an amazing singer. Russell Crowe as Javert, is decent. Eddie Redmayne as Marius Pontmercy, is first-rate & is also a gifted singer. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, is fair. Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen play the Th√©nardiers, hilariously. Aaron Tveit as Enjolras, is expressive.On the whole, 'Les Mis√©rables' is a major success.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""The People Shall Be Free""","I've said many times to friends when I hear about certain projects like adapting Les Miserables as a musical I'm usually skeptical. Then as often as not I'm proved wrong and I'm happy to say I was proved wrong here. Les Miserables is far more than a musical, it has the same epic quality that dramatic film versions I've seen, most particularly the 1935 film with Fredric March and Charles Laughton.As for the musical score the only show I can compare with this is Porgy And Bess, a much simpler story on not so broad a canvass, but still with an epic quality. Both Les Miserables and Porgy And Bess slip ever so surreptitiously into a category of music some might call opera. In another century Les Miserables might very well be labeled an opera.And it's interesting in that the leads are done and well by a pair of non-singers Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean and his tormentor Inspector Javert played by Russell Crowe. Neither are exactly trained voices, but they get the musical score delivered. Hugh Jackman got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the film for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations for technical categories.And it brought a Best Supporting Actress Award to Anne Hathaway as the tragic Fantine. I always thought Anne was overlooked when she played Jake Gyllenhaal's wife in Brokeback Mountain, that she should have been nominated that year. Nice to see the Academy made it up to her this year.The success of Les Miserables on Broadway and in film once again shows that there is indeed a market for the classics when they're intelligently made. Besides Anne Hathaway, Les Miserables took home Oscars for Sound and for Makeup. It seems to have an appeal for folks in my age bracket who went to school in the Sixties. The revolutionary ardor of the students fomenting rebellion in the years of Orleanist France seems to strike a familiar note with those who marched in protests. Even so with young people today who like to identify with the young of that era in France lost in a cause much bigger than their own individual lives are.And I think it will be so in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,History
You won't see a more thrilling piece of cinema this year,"""Les Miserables"" is the most thrilling piece of cinema i have seen all year. Director Tom Hooper, who won an Oscar for the ""The King's Speech"" has succeeded brilliantly in bringing the hit musical to the big screen. The only weak link is Russell Crowe who is a mediocre singer. His acting however makes up for it. Hugh Jackman is a revelation as Jean Valjean. His singing gets better as the picture progresses. As for Anne Hathaway they should cancel the best supporting actress category and just send the Oscar to her already. When ""One Day More"" started the my hair stood on end. I saw the stage version 3 times and wondered how they would pull this off but Hooper makes it dazzling. After the screening people cheered and clapped. The live singing was revolutionary but it worked. This is one the best films of the year and one the best musicals ever made. The finale with the entire cast singing is the most exciting ending you will see in a film this year. The order of the some of the songs have been changed but this is actually an improvement. Even if you don't like musicals you will like this film.",,Anonymous,History
Miserere nobis! Save this artifact with selective dubbing.,"Apart from the portrayal of Javert, there's nothing essentially wrong with the acting here. Of course, it's easy to fault Crowe's conception, when one has the genius performance of Charles Laughton as Javert to compare it with. In that much earlier film one ends up caring more about Javert's tragedy than about Valjean's thwarted love story. That being said, you can save this very expensive new edition by dubbing the roles of Fantine, Javert and Valjean with real singers. Consider it very post, post production. For Fantine, get someone like Christine Andreas. Tap Norm Lewis for Javert, and Jonas Kaufmann for Valjean. The third stand-in is an A-list opera tenor, which one apparently needs to get the role's long recitatives executed with conviction and musicality. In fact, some of his music was borrowed from a real opera. The show is through composed, so every line is set to music. If one is not musical, that can be disastrous. The three actors cast here could not handle this style of sung dialog and most of their work is painful to the ear. That seems odd. It's not as if this were Janacek's From the House of the Dead or something vocally challenging, but apparently beyond the efforts of these leads. As for the music itself, it is not that extraordinary, except for Valjean's big number, Bring Him Home, which everyone knows was stolen from the Humming Chorus of Puccini's Madama Butterfly. However, this film is worth saving, as the art direction and cinematography are fine and all the other characters sing beautifully, even Amanda Seyfried. Barks' Eponine gives a vocal performance that will give you chills.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A deeply moving, masterfully crafted masterpiece","Les Mis√©rables Is an experience. Director Tom Hooper has realized this timeless and often repeated Victor Hugo novel that was transformed into a near operatic setting by Claude- Michel Sch√∂nberg, Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer by opening up the story even more and utilizing genuinely creative musical enhancements. The result is an emotionally charged, breathtaking spectacle that while it is discussing the French Revolution and aftermath as a subject it remains a gently warm tale of love and commitment.The cast is extraordinary, down to the smallest role in the film. It is truly an Ensemble work and deserves recognition as such, but the individuals should also be honored individually. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is completely immersed in this multifaceted and very difficult role: it is the zenith of his career both as a film and as a stage actor/singer. Equally impressive (and a surprise to those of us who knew nothing of this early career in musical theater) is Russell Crowe's Javert - very deserving of Best Supporting Actor at Oscar time for his powerful embodiment of misguided and tortured head of police, but for some reason he is being overlooked. Anne Hathaway gives us a Fantine that will be the benchmark for all others who sing this role. Amanda Seyfried handles Cosette's difficult soprano lines with relative ease and feels completely right in her approach to the role. Another major shock is Eddie Redmayne as Marius: we all are aware of his acting sills, but this young man has a splendid voice and makes his character one of the standouts of the story. Samantha Barks as √âponine is a star turn, combining screen presence with fine acting and a solid vocal ability.Each of the lads who spark the revolutionary barricade is outstanding; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras completely wins hearts with his handsome looks, his sensitive acting and his very fine voice and close behind him is performance quality are George Blagden, Killian Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche. Director Hooper has given us a different take on the Th√©nardiers - no silly slapstick here, but instead a smarmy, oily evil couple whose behavior at other people's expense make us laugh: Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen make them unforgettable. And it is a true bow to theatrical history to cast Colm Wilkinson (who originated the role of Jean Valjean in 1980) as the Bishop.In all this is a stunning success, visually, vocally, acting, directing, costuming, and large ensemble wise. It is unforgettable. Highly Recommended.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,History
Two major problems kill any possibility of masterpiece,"Since so much has been written already about this movie, you are probably aware of two facts that I will mention here, that I believe, kill most of the potential this movie had to become excellent:1) Extremely bad CG ruins your immersion in the story:When seeing the main characters move in the screen with an extremely bad computer graphics background behind, it suddenly reminds me that this is a movie, that this man is an actor, that the background doesn't really exist and that there are lots of technicians trying to fix that mess. I don't want that, I want to forget that it's a movie and I want to dive inside the story, but the extremely bad and distracting CG makes it very difficult.2) The choice of the actors singing ""live"" brings an additional problem:Here I am only guessing, but I am willing to bet that the choice of having the actors singing live, involved certain logistics that could only be achieved if most of the shots were static with very little movement and editing. That choice of directing makes that instead of a movie feeling, we get some sort of music concert feeling. In fact, this movie feels as static as the actual musical, but instead of a stage with live singers, you get a cinema screen.If you are looking for drama and emotion, look somewhere else. The story has a lot of drama potential, but the directing choices and the distracting CG, kill most of that potential, so it ends up being a boring and extremely long piece that makes you come out of the cinema thinking ""What could have been"".",6.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely Amazing,"This movie is simply breathtaking in its dramatic presentation of this literary masterpiece. All the actors did a fantastic job drawing us in and causing us to feel the emotions and become a part of the action. The fact that it is a musical will be a turn-off for many, but this is a musical like no other where the songs here are rich and deep, the plot well-crafted, the characters fully engaged, and the costumes and scenery simply breathtaking. This is a movie for both men and women, boys and girls. It is fun, sad, thrilling, and contemplative all in one. I went with low expectations and was blown away by the movie. It exceeded my every expectation and is now my favourite movie of all time. It is nice to see that Hollywood can produce something that doesn't depend on vulgarity and crude humour to attract their audience, and can deal with the theme of redemption from a perspective that doesn't have to offend Christians. Loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,History
This is where More................really means Les Miz.,"I have seen Les Miserables 3 times as a stage musical. Each time it got a 10...15 minute standing ovation. Many people were crying. I have also read the novel by Victor Hugo (1862). This was a brave attempt by Director Tom Hooper to blend the musical into a sprawling epic film. And so near Oscar time...what a coincidence. When two of the leading characters don't do ""there thing"", then it is a struggle. Russell Crowe is simply mis-cast as Javert. His singing voice is not good enough. And--he makes a one dimensional character into a half dimensional one. Amanda Seyfried as Cosette is ....well lets be kind....not good. Her relationship with Marius (Eddie Redmayne) is like two frozen peas trying to get frisky. The cinematography is ""experimental ?"" . Like pushing a hand held camera into the singers faces at all key moments. Anne Hathaway will win the Oscar for best supporting actress...and that is fair. Hugh Jackman will probably win for best actor...but playing Jean Valjean is to carry a heavy load. His use of different singing techniques for each song was a wrong decision...disorientating the audience. I feel he saw this as a huge Oscar chance...and went for it. Perhaps....like some beaten athletic runners..he saw the winning post too soon. (some scenes did look hurried...) Certainly... here in Australia ...this has been hyped savagely. Two Australian actors in a huge frenzied ""epic"" !!!!!. Hype is a strange beast...you enter the cinema WANTING to keep in step with ""public opinion"". So...you walk out happy. If you want to get the real Les Mis.....See it live on stage. (no hype required)",3.0,Anonymous,History
A fine British movie for the World to enjoy,"This movie is an excellent attempt to capture Les Mis on film which mostly succeeds.I've read many of the reviews posted on this site and firstly would like to clear up a few inaccuracies. We Americans are so insular, aren't we? We think it's a Hollywood movie based on a Broadway show set during the French Revolution. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Actually, it's a British production made in London based on the hit West End show (which later transferred to 42 countries - one of which was the USA). It's not even set during the French Revolution! European history isn't our thing, right? The storming of the Bastille, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette etc...that was the French Revolution and it happened in 1789....the rebellion/ uprising scenes in the movie are set during protests in the 1830s.A reviewer bemoaned the fact that most people on screen sing/ speak in English/ cockney accents. Errrr....that's the way many of the locals in London talk. Someone else suggested they should have French accents. Oh puhleeeease.....where's the realism if everyone has phony accents that sound like Inspector Clouseau?! Street urchins using their genuine London accents sounds much more realistic.OK, now for my review proper.I loved the movie. Having seen the London stage production 3 times and listened to the CD hundreds of times I had high expectations. Anne Hathaway as Fantine steals the show - I Dreamed a Dream is one of the greatest tear-jerkers ever written, and she does it justice. WOW! Speechless. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe....all great. Crowe's Javert is most convincing, and his singing isn't nearly as bad as I had expected after reviewing some critical reviews. Sets, costumes, sound, direction...all top notch.The big disappointment is Sacha Saron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thennadiers....they just didn't tick the right boxes for me. Master of the House is a bit flat.The overall movie experience is an emotional roller-coaster - if you don't shed a tear at the end you must have a heart of stone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Russell Crowe cannot sing,"NEVER MIX Hollywood ACTORS WITH THEATRICAL STAGE PERFORMERS...IT WILL ONLY SHOW HOW BAD YOU ARE IN ACTING AND SINGING (Anne Hathaway your an exception and Meryl Streep, Mamma Mia) ""Les Miserables"" would have been a fantastic film. One of the best I've seen in awhile BUT when you put A-list celebrities to sing, and I know the reason why, for box office draw, then you just killed a masterpiece. Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried are passable and I can live with but of course I would rather have Simon Bowman play Jean Valjean and Emily Bull or someone else play Cossette but Russell Crowe? Tom Hooper were you drunk when you chose Russell Crowe? The guy can't sing every time he sings I want to go to the bathroom or do some meditating and wish I was in another planet! Everyone else was fantastic, Samantha Barks as Eponine was awesome (of course she played Eponine in the London production). Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Fantine now I know why Hugh Jackman lobbied for her. Her performance as Fantine deserves an Oscar nomination and I hope she wins. Eddie Redmayne as Marius is amazing and the list goes on. Overall an amazing film! I would definitely watch it again and when the DVD or Blu- Ray comes out I will definitely get a copy and ""WHEN RUSSELL CROWE COMES OUT TO SING THEN ITS TIME FOR ME TO GO THE BATHROOM or MEDITATE AND BE IN ANOTHER PLANET"" Please just be the Gladiator and make sequels part 2, part 3, part 4 I don't care just stay away from musicals and by the way I don't even own a copy of any of your movies hah! Here is my Christmas wish... Director Tom Hooper when you release the DVD or Blu-ray I'm sure it will be a Special Edition release can you please take out Russell Crowe and use someone else to play Javert, I sugggest Hans-Peter Janssens (from the London production)and THAT WOULD TRULY BE A SPECIAL EDITION COPY :)",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Very Satisfying Big-Screen Depiction,"From the moment I first caught the previews of this film and noted the cast members I had a sense that this rendition might be superior. I have seen both the stage production and read the unabridged book and find that I just love the story. I can pronounce myself satisfied with this movie. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and Fantine (Anne Hathaway) show their prowess as their vocal performances alternately soar and tremble and the tight shots add a tremendously powerful dimension to their sorrows. I particularly liked Valjean's Who Am I? and Fantine's I Had A Dream. Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) struggled a little with his vocalizations employing a certain brand of descant which I personally disliked but did not lessen the experience. Also the scene in the tavern with the students, including Marius with Enjolras and Courfeyrac, singing Red and Black, brought tears to my eyes. Actually, that happened on a few occasions. The Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen as M. Thenardier and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiess) were utilized as comedy relief for the most part and most of their very real viciousness was thereby dissipated. That I do regret. Cosette's very real misery at their hands is necessarily 'superficialized' for the film but there were many acknowledgements of the novel:Cosette's longing for the doll in the shop window and her being sent late to the well in the forest by Mme Thenardier are excellent examples. As is Gavroche's 'elephant home' with the other 'lost boys' of Paris. These may seem very minor but as a lover of the story I was much gladdened by their additions.Overall a magnificent film and a very satisfying adaptation of the novel.",9.0,Anonymous,History

No, I did not just get emotional, I cried huge and heavy tears. Not only the movie was beautifully done, but Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway had the performances of a lifetime. They both deserve the Oscars. Hugh Jackman showed how an actor can reach deeply into his soul and bring out feelings that are so intense that they are able to truly touch the souls of those on the other side of the screen.

Cinematic-performance wise - great. NOT the singing.,"Well, opening sequence was awesome, that is until I heard Russell Crowe sing. Never again let him do high pitch again and why director made actors sing who can't sing is beyond my understanding, especially in a musical, duh.Performance was over the top great from ALL the actors, Sacha Baron appearance - great success!Russel performs greatly, though cant sign well higher tones.Jackman, can sing and perform, good job man. - Hathaway sings well and over-performs as always, unattractive as she is, she gets the job done.Overall, I really like musicals, most of songs are under average standard, only few of them are great tunes with unique melodies, and I think I heard ABBA here too.My recommendation - if you like musicals with almost no dialog, watch this, great cinematic experience. Music orchestra IS awesome.Crowd song signing is actually the best. Costumes and clothing - almost PERFECT.And for the real experience, please watch 1998 movie, Les Miserables with Liam Neeson.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Best!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm an old cinema-maniac and IMHO this is one of the three best movies EVER made! Hugo's masterpiece novel (do read it) shines through enlightening and brightly illuminating the human soul! The music and lyrics (from the best musical I've seen) were hauntingly memorable beyond any previous film - (including West Side Story) - and the cinematography is quite without parallel. A total ten - only because there wasn't a higher rating available. Hooper should have gotten best director award but the critics are without much taste at times... Good example back in the 1960's was Phillipe de Broca's ""King of Hearts"" (Alan Bates & Genvieve Bujold) which got next to nothing in terms of awards but ran in some theaters for many many years. Also, Les Miserables (1995-C. Lelouch), with Jean Paul Belmondo... was a true masterpiece but only some precious few critics saw that.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables,"A full-house weekend cinema viewing, maybe a second-row syndrome which left my anticipation unfulfilled. First of all, I never successfully accustomed to the ""all sung script""bravura which blatantly dissolved the narrative into a mess of inconsistent singing ballyhoo, yes, I aware it is a musical film, but the semi-sing,semi-speak preposterousness is so distracting as if we were watching aliens perform their own performing art, a dreadful insouciant nonchalance has penetrated from the beginning to the very end.Secondly, the singing expertise from the cast is uneven, I don't intend to name the black sheep here, just wonder what's the advantage of adapting a musical into a feature film if the latter's voice prowess cannot keep in the same level albeit putting money to create more detailed settings instead of simple tableaux on the stage. There must be some artistic reasons behind but for the profitable perspective with exponentially-surging attendance. I may opt for a stage musical against my film aficionado predilection.Special congratulations to Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks, their solo renditions alone are worth the ticket (maybe a soundtrack is more felicitous), Hathaway will 99% sure win her first Oscar, and she should perform in the upcoming Grammy awards as well. Barks is a new- found gem, but whether or not she can leap into a stardom out of the genre is a moot. Hugh Jackman finally gets his hard-earned Oscar nomination, but impaired by the sketchy and episodic storytelling, it is far from an award-worthy leading performance. Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried are adequate, while Helena and Sacha pair engenders a Burton-esque high spirit to offset the dreary misery and wide-eyed revolutionist mirage.Fairly speaking, Tom Hooper's workmanship doesn't generate too much excitement, starts with his shaky camera, eerie and undetermined, the CGI surroundings can hardly be called innovative, as an Oscar-winning director, his unjust fluke will sooner or later boomerang on his own luck.Sorry for grudging all over the place, I am pining for some involving lifelike revelations, clearly I am pigeonholing myself into the wrong consumer coterie, or simply don't watch it in the second row.",6.0,Anonymous,History
This is a musical in the truest sense of the word,"It has been 14 years since the last Hollywood adaptations of this, undoubtedly, significant literary work. That is enough time to forget how motives and the most of the secondary characters were created. If you also read this Hugo's novel a time before adaptation since 1998, this two and a half hour movie will not seem too long and you will find it entertaining because that is the reason that all movies was made.This is a musical in the truest sense of the word. All through this movie they all were singing. Even when you think that it would be much better to become silent and listen the music which very effectively describes their characters and the building of mutual relationships. It doesn't matter who sings better, although it is difficult resisting the need to form your own, often laic, judgment of their vocal qualities, even for those actors who that have not previously worked in musicals (Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman or Russell Crowe). It seems that all of five chapters have a same continuance. That's enough time for meeting with each of characters and for finding that in the most of them Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen add a little bit of humor to this not-so-happy atmosphere.Whoever you talk about this movie in terms of adaptation, or the division of roles, previously denied them an experience of enjoying in the film with exciting music, epic scenography and memorable costumes, made to make you see this movie once again, so you will be note all this details yourself",8.0,Anonymous,History

Have These Guys from Hollywood ever Read the Novel?,"When I was a teenager, Victor Hugo's ""Les Mis√©rables"" was the most impressive tale of injustice that I have ever read, with the heartbreaking story of Jean Valjean, a man arrested for stealing a piece of bread and haunted by the persistent and merciless Inspector Javert.Then I saw at least two great versions of this novel in the cinema, the 1935 with Fredric March and Charles Laughton, and the 1998 with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush in the roles of Valjean and Javert.I had the highest expectations with this musical, awarded with several wins and nominations. Unfortunately this version does not develop the character Jean Valjean and shows him after many years in forced labor as a thief, omitting the whole beginning of the injustice in the story. It is impossible to feel sympathy and pain for his suffering.There is more emphasis to the story of Fantine in the beginning and Anne Hathaway is excellent. However, Russell Crowe singing is unbearable; Hugh Jackman singing is boring and the songs are terrible and I stop watching the DVD of this pretentious version with 45 minutes running time.

The musical brought to the big screen in a big way!,"¬®But remember this, my brother, see in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver to become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, by the Passion and the Blood, God has raised you out of darkness; I have bought your soul for God! ¬®Academy Award winning director, Tom Hooper (The King's Speech), brings one of the most famous musicals based on Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Miserables, to the big screen with quite a remarkable screenplay adaptation, a beautiful production design, and some stunning performances from the cast. The film is directed in such a way that you feel like you are watching a conventional stage musical rather than a movie. For the viewers like myself that live far away from the big cities and have no option of watching a live musical this is as close as it gets for us. Hooper took a huge risk by letting his actors sing live on set while they were performing instead of simply having them doing playback like in most musical adaptations. This is in my opinion what gave the film such a livelier feel to it and made me feel like I was watching a play. The film is almost entirely sung as there is very little dialogue, so if you aren't a big fan of musicals you will want to stay away from this one. My only complaint about Hooper's style of direction is that he used extreme close ups on every character during most of the film, which didn't allow us to enjoy the grandeur of the production design as much as I would have liked. These close ups were a bit too much for my taste. Most of the songs performed were done in long takes so I can imagine how hard and exhausting it must have been for the actors to get each take right. I enjoyed this film very much, but did have some issues with the length of the movie. Even so, this is a great film and Tom Hooper successfully manages to adapt this well known play. It deserves all the recognition it is getting.For those of you familiar with the novel or the stage play you might want to skip this second paragraph focusing on the plot. The film takes place during the post-French revolution time period where we are introduced to prisoner 24601, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who has spent the past 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his dying niece. He is finally being released, but Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) warns him that he must not break parole. ¬®Once a thief, always a thief¬® is his motto and he's sure Valjean will end up behind bars again. Jean finds it extremely difficult to find a job after being marked as a criminal and is very bitter about life, but he finds redemption in a Bishop who saves him from returning to prison and makes him turn his life around. Jean breaks parole and begins a new life as a successful businessman who becomes mayor. He is a kind person, but his past continues to haunt him as Javert appears several years later and recognizes him. Jean has to go on the run again, but not before he makes a promise to a former employee of his, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), to care for her child. Jean wasn't aware that she was fired from his business after the employees discovered she had a child and was single. Fantine was forced to turn into a prostitute in order to maintain her child, Cosette, who is being cared for by the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) who take advantage of her. Feeling guilty for what has happened to Fantine, Jean pledges to care for Cosette and buys her from the Thenardiers. Several years later we see Jean and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) enjoying life together as father and daughter, but once again Jean's past catches up to him as he runs into Javert during the student revolution led by Marius (Eddie Redmayne). When Cosette and Marius fall in love with each other, Jean realizes he won't be able to run all his life.We are all familiar with the story and the universal themes that this classic novel touches such as love, redemption, mercy, poverty, and the revolutionary spirit. The film captures all these themes perfectly thanks to some wonderful performances from Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway who both received Oscar nominations. My favorite character however was the young Gavroche who was played brilliantly by Daniel Huttlestone. Samantha Barks as the broken hearted Eponine also gave a strong performance. Much of the success of the film is owed to these great and inspiring performances. The songs were also beautifully delivered and I enjoyed most of them. I think my favorite one came from the student revolutionaries, ¬®Do You Hear the People Sing? ¬® Les Miserables will please fans, but those who have no taste for musicals or haven't enjoyed the stage productions will hate this film because it is manipulative and over the top. Having that said, I still think Hooper's effort pays off and he's made a great musical, although his best film was the much smaller and far less ambitious in scale, The Damned United, which catapulted him to fame. I did not feel as emotional as other people did about this film, and wasn't moved. In all honesty I was a bit exhausted by the time the credits began rolling, but it still was an entertaining film worth checking out for the performances alone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
An immensely powerful and riveting masterpiece of modern cinema!,"An immensely powerful, riveting, remarkably shot masterpiece of modern film making.

From Hugh Jackman's daring, enthralling performance to the heart-breaking, electrifying, dynamic and perfect delivery from Anne Hathaway, especially the ''I Dreamed a Dream'' segment, which will leave you absolutely speechless.

See the Legend!!,"Like any good fan, I have been waiting with eager anticipation for this movie and Tom Hooper has delivered.It will be very hard to write a fair review considering I have seen the Broadway musical live as well as the DVD's of the 10th and 25th anniversary of it, but I will try.The sets/costumes...Very good, had the time period nailed perfect, watching the prisoners try to bring in a ship was kind of awe struck. To be honest the Barricade was a little weak, but they were working within their means of the period. However I was confused, because the ending had the Barricade that was envisioned.But let's talk about what really matters...the singing.Val Jean: I really wasn't worried with Hugh Jackman being cast, but I was concerned when I saw ""making of"" clips and he was talking about how he can control the tempo but considering he is an accomplished Broadway actor, he nailed it perfect.Javert: Russel Crowe also did a good job. He had the physical presence of the role nailed however there were some spots where his voice was off.Fantine: Ann Hatheway did an excellent job. I really did love her take on ""I dream a dream"". Instead of making it a romantic version that usually portrayed on the stage, she made it more emotional and made you feel the pain Fantine was experiencing.Thenardiers: Sacha Baron Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter both did a good job and actually fit the roles perfect. Watching ""Master of the House"" was a fun scene.The rest of the cast hit their spots as well.My one issue that I had, was they wrote a new song just for the movie. They also deleted a song as well. I guess that is the purest talking in me.I should also mention..It was awesome to see Colm Wilkinson in the movie. He was the original Val Jean from Broadway and it was something special to see him on the screen.I am definitely going to see this movie again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Both fantastic and fantastically bad.,"The problem with this movie is that it has excellent moments in a general sea of mediocricity and boredom. At the end it depends how quickly you are drained by the bad parts.Let me be a bit more clear. Anne Hathaway got an Oscar for her role and you will see why. ""I dreamed a dream"" is a legendary piece that will be remembered for a long time. Unfortunately it's about four minutes long in a movie that clocks a total of 158. There is still Hugh Jackman that does a great job in both acting and singing and, unlike some reviewers, me and my non-existent musical ear found Russel Crove to be quite entertaining.That's about it. The rest is fairly needless ""singing"" of pretty much everything which would include ""we're oooout of tooooilet paaaper"" (sing it in the ""look down"" rhythm for dramatic effect). While not bad in itself it streches the scenes and stops the plot in a grindhalt. Seeing the movie at home i just started skipping scenes toward the end and I didn't feel like i missed anything. That says a lot.Basically if you find repetitive recitation of dialogue appealing this movie is for you, otherwise you may skip it and watch the ""i dreamed a dream"" scene on youtube.",6.0,Anonymous,History
amazing musical,"one of the best musicals i've seen...Anne Heatherway is truly amazing actress & singing I dreamed a dream made me shed some tears...her singing is beautiful & she acted the part vert well..was very impressed with the other characters as well...very surprised at Russell Crows singing...who would of thought this man could sing?! Helena Bowen carter was amazing/funny as well as Sacha Baron Cohan...laughed/cried durning this musical...I would watch this again!!!!!! also made me feel for the charters & at times had a ump in my throat as well the hairs at the back of my neck stood up! Hugh Jackman was very good as well, Incredible songs that you could sing along to!!!!!!!!! shame these actors are not on the stage! Would recommend this to anyone x",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very pleasing to the eyes and the ears,"Two years after cleaning up Oscar awards for The King's Speech, Tom Hooper shown the spotlight back on one of the most beloved stories and musicals of all time. The star power and the acting are very compelling even if some of the singing seems forced and difficult for certain numbers. Hugh Jackman changes the tone and volume of his voice as Valjean evolves throughout the movie, but the opening numbers with him seem like they are just barely out of his range, to the point where he sounds nasally. Russell Crowe makes a terrific Javert on paper, but it seems a struggle for him to match the volume of everyone else. In his defense, his performance gave much needed humanity to an otherwise rigid and bombastic policeman chasing a bread thief. The uncertainty and conflict is a welcome touch from Crowe's interpretation of Javert, so much that his performance from an acting standpoint is second only to Anne Hathaway's Fantine. Speaking of which...Damn....I mean, just...wow. Hathaway owns every single second she is on screen, just as she did as everyone's favorite feline comic book character earlier in the year. She provided the most gut wrenching and heartbreaking martyrdom for any character in recent memory. The fact that she is able to belt out such melancholy notes while maintaining the character's anguish speaks to her true talents as a performer. (Something you have to see to truly appreciate) Some songs felt like they were in the wrong key for some of the cast or that some of the cast was wrong for the key the songs were in, but that couldn't be further from the truth in Hathaway's case. She sounds angelic in every sense of the word.The cinematography provides for some breathtaking shots of Montreuil, especially during both renditions of ""Look Down"" and the revolution. The idea to fixate the camera on Fantine's face, as well as Valjean and Marius during their respective soliloquies. The supporting cast also provided for a stronger ensemble as the movie did not have to rely entirely on star power. The Thenardiers were appropriately cast (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) even if their characters relied too much on SBC and HBC doing SBC and HBC things. Again, those two are textbook actors for those roles, but I was a little annoyed every time they appeared on screen and I was just as relieved whenever they went away. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like they are both becoming ubiquitous at being cast as the scoundrels and deviants they play in any movie they find themselves in anymore.It was truly refreshing to see the return of this masterpiece to the forefront of mainstream cinema this year. Some have complained about the casting, but like it or not, Tom Hooper has an Oscar and I have a feeling he knew what he was doing when he made this movie. It probably won't win too many of the big awards aside from Hathaway running away with Supporting Actress, but it's bound to receive a lot of technical recognition. And why not? Hooper's vision was as memorable and stunning as any adaptation of this timeless classic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miss,"Epic, limb-numbing musical-infused version could possibly be the biggest turkey I've seen this side of Christmas (it opened here on Boxing day so the analogy is relevant).Hugh Jackman seems like a tremendous stage actor, full of the exuberance and intensity needed for that medium, but for film, he's consistently over-wrought (in my opinion). Often his portrayal fails to convince me, his expression becomes 'comfortable' looking, failing to exude that sense of despondency that Jean Valjean experiences throughout his life, the subject of the ruthless tyrant Javert's (Crowe) relentless pursuit and character assassination.Big Russ actually seems restrained, almost pensive in some respects and I was glad to see the make-up crew didn't give him a Bonaparte hair-do; Helena Bonham-Carter's, on the other hand, has the look of an electrified troll doll - not to take away from her talents as a thespian, but the look was truly maniacal.I reserve my most ardent criticism for Anne Hathaway. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" suited her style, whereas she doesn't seem ""mature"" enough for this role, she always looks adolescent, her porcelain skin defying the rigours of her character's desperate predicament.If perchance you're a fan of the epic film-musical set to battle hymns, then this version of ""Les Mis"" might pique your interest once more. For me, I'm content to stick with Richard Jordan's more inspired Jean Valjean from the seventies.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great adaption from stage to screen!!!!,I am a massive musical fan and Les miserables it is my all time favourite musical even though i have never seen a professional company perform it live on stage. I have only see good quality amateur theatre companies and the 25th anniversary concert on DVD.The movie was incredible and a great watch. Hugh Jackman is outstanding and he made the character his own. I was nervous about Anne Hathaway as i didn't know if she could sing - well she couldn't of played the part any better and deserves every award that hopefully comes to her.As i am Australian i was proud that we had 2 Aussies playing leads in this movie but when i heard Russell Crow was playing javert i was a bit hesitant about the singing yes he looks the part and acted the part BUT the singing left a little to be desired a stronger voice was needed!The rest of the cast was great with massive wraps on Eddie Redmayne on his role as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone for his role as Gavroche. A Must watch and it did the musical justice will be watching it again tomorrow.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Loved seeing the world of Les Miserables on a grand scale. It is exactly as I imagined. When it was over I wanted to see it again immediately.,"The epic musical Les Miserables tells the story of a man named jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman set during the dawn of the French revolution. After serving 19 years as a slave because he stole a loaf of bread, he breaks parole and spends years reinventing himself as a new man. Jean is being hunted by officer Javert played by Russell Crowe, who swears he will not rest until Jean is behind bars. While running from Javert, Jean Valjean finds himself caring for a factory workers young daughter, Cosette. The young child changes his life forever.Les Miserables is honestly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This film is almost three hours long and I still wanted it to go on longer. Les Miserables is a very well known Broadway musical and it stays so true to the play it is unbelievable. Not a single word is off. However, the one thing that changes for the better is they made the movie easier to understand and follow. I have been a huge fan of Les Mis for a long time and I know almost every single song by heart. I was trying so hard not to start singing along with the film, the musical score was amazing. The whole film is better than I could have ever hoped for, but seeing this tale up on the big screen was phenomenal! The visuals and special effects are truly breathtaking. It is set in France at the beginning of the French revolution when life for the poor was awful and life for the rich was grand. They capture the hard times of the streets perfectly by using dark colors and wonderful lighting contrasts. I loved seeing the world of Les Mis on a grand scale and it is exactly as I imagined it would be. I love this entire movie so much that when it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters. I have so many scenes that I love so much, but my favorites are the Lovely Ladies scene and the Master of the House scene. I like the Lovely Ladies scene because that's where Fantine, Cosette's mother turns to the streets as a home after losing her job at the factory. It is a wonderful musical number and Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! It is so historically accurate showing how people would do anything to make a quick penny from selling their teeth, to chopping off their hair, it was hard for everyone. I also love the Master of the House scene because it is so hilarious. It has Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the innkeeper and his wife. They con people into staying the night at their inn, then trick them into never leaving. They are so crafty and hilarious and they rob everyone blind. This scene is so clever and hilarious. Sacha and Helena make an amazing duo. I love all of the characters equally, but I'll only pick a few to talk about. Jean Valjean is a truly amazing character and Hugh Jackman brings him to life so well. Hugh's talents are really shown off during this film and I was very impressed by him. Fantine, played by the remarkable Anne Hathaway is a very memorable character. Anne is perfect as Fantine and this was, in my opinion, her best role. The last character that I really enjoyed is Eponine played by Samantha Barks. Eponine sings all of my favorite Les Mis songs and her incredible duo of A Little Fall of Rain with Eddie Redmayne. A little fun fact is that Samantha Marks played Eponine in the Broadway version of Les Mis. Overall, I give Les Miserables 5 out of 5 stars because it is truly the most amazing film I've seen in a long time and it far surpassed my expectations. This film is definitely for ages 13 and up because of the dark period it is set in and the violence and cruelty that occurs. Raven Devanney, age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Story, Good movie, Ho-hum singing","The title says it all!The only thing to add is that as a movie it's good but since the ""musical"" part of it is unconvincing it's about an hour longer than it should be.Don't expect Chicago or the Sound of Music!I have to admit that I haven't compared this to the old (1998?) version of Les Miserables (starring Uma Thurman?) so I will have to do so some day and update this review when I do.The good thing is that it has motivated me to go read some more about the French revolution - when did all the kings come and go exactly? How much of what is shown here is historically accurate?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Simply beautiful...,"This film is stunning! As one who cried through most of the stage show, I wondered if this would have the same effect. It did! Anne Hathaway's 'I Dreamed a Dream' is heartbreaking, she did it beautifully, and Hugh Jackman's voice is fabulous. Amanda Seyfried has the sweetest, purest voice and Eddie Redmayne played a dashing Marius. People had mentioned in reviews that the camera work was a little odd but I thought it conveyed the feeling of being on the stage, where we tend to look directly at the person singing, so I had no problem with it at all. The weakest link, for me, was Mr Crowe whose voice was poor next to the others. Had he not been alongside so many fantastically strong singers it may not have been so noticeable but, sadly, he fell a little flat in comparison. This is my first review as I felt so strongly about it I just HAD to write one! GO AND SEE IT! IT'S AMAZING!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A flawed yet charming musical.,"Les Miserables is a musical, set during the French revolution, about Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman) who breaks his parole & is viciously hunted by police chief, Javert(Russell Crowe). Valjean agrees to adopt Cosette(Amanda Seyfried), who is the daughter of Fantine(Anne Hathaway). After adopting Cosette, Valjean's life changes forever. The supporting characters include, Marius(Eddie Redmayne), Eponine(Samantha Barks), Thenardier(Sacha Baron Cohen) & Madame Thenardier(Helena Bonham Carter).I would like to start by saying, Les Miserables is a good movie but, definitely not a great movie. The movie's story, based on the book & the play of the same name, is touching & brilliant. However, the story is hampered by the constant singing throughout the duration of the film. All the words that come out of all the different characters' mouths is in the form of a song. Not even a single dialog is uttered throughout the movie. Whether they're dueling with the policemen, happy, sad, heartbroken, or even dying they sing about everything. This can get extremely frustrating, at times. This is the movie's greatest flaw. A note on the performances. Hugh Jackman is mind blowing as Jean Valjean. His role in this film is completely different from X-Men antihero, Wolverine. This movie proves that, Jackman can attack any role with the same dedication that he attacks the role of Wolverine. Russell Crowe is brilliant as the antagonist, Javert. We really do love to hate him. Anne Hathaway has given one of the best performances of her career as nice girl turned prostitute, Fantine. Amanda Seyfried is great as Cosette. Eddie Redmayne is spectacular as Marius. Samantha Barks is impressive as Eponine. Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen are hilarious as Madame Thenardier & Thenardier respectively. All the actors sing beautifully. The most impressive part is that they all sang live while they were shooting. Although Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway deserved their Golden Globes for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actress respectively, I doubt the movie deserved the Golden Globe for Best Film: Comedy or Musical. I'm sure the Bradley Cooper & Jennifer Lawrence starer, Silver Linings Playbook was a better movie. Anyway, I would like to conclude by saying, watch Les Miserables only if you love musicals. However, I'd recommend that you give this one a miss if you hate a movie with songs every one minute or so.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An intimate take on the beloved musical that highlights incredible performances,"There are few musicals like ""Les Mis√©rables,"" an operetta lined with incredible music from start to finish, with a story so grand and tremendous that somehow manages to fit on a Broadway (or West End) stage.Needless to say, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil's story has been ripe for a film adaptation since the English version opened in London in 1985, a chance to place this larger- than-life production in an environment with no physical confines or limitations. With the keys in the hands of Tom Hooper (""The King's Speech""), one would expect something extravagant, but surprisingly, the Oscar winner chooses to do the opposite ‚Äî to zoom in on the story and its characters in search of greater depth.It's this choice that completely determines the effectiveness of this take on ""Les Mis."" As anyone familiar with the musical knows, you're not going to walk out of any film version disappointed with the music and lyrics or the quality of the overall story ‚Äî they guarantee the film a certain measure of success. Instead, it becomes all about presentation.Hooper's primary technique for telling this story is the close-up. If he and cinematographer Danny Cohen got any closer, in fact, you'd swear the camera would smack into the actors' faces. With so much of the music being sung by one character at a time ‚Äî characters who are usually pouring their souls out ‚Äî it makes sense, but there's little breathing room for the audience. Stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and more are literally right there; the makeup department had to be utterly scrupulous to be sure.But Hooper doesn't just expose his actors physically, he also does so vocally. With the choice to film all the singing live on set as opposed pre-recording tracks in studio for the actors to lip-sync to, their voices become the object of audience scrutiny. With the lens so close on these characters, the actors had no margin for error in their performances, so it's truly a compliment to say that there is some truly incredible acting in ""Les Mis√©rables.""Jackman and Hathaway excel the most with this technique as Jean Valjean and Fantine, respectively. Valjean is the protagonist in this large ensemble, a man released from prison on parole for stealing a loaf of bread, who after remaking himself eight years later, promises the dying Fantine that he'll look after her daughter, Cosette (played later on by Amanda Seyfried).Interestingly, their best work comes at the very beginning of the film. As the prison-worn down-on-his-luck Valjean who is given a second chance, Jackman sets the bar for the film's emotional intensity with ""What Have I Done?"" only to be outdone by Hathaway, who, despite minimal screen time, delivers the iconic ""I Dreamed a Dream"" with an intensity that really hammers home the lyrics in a way no previous renditions have ever done. It's incredible, though sadly it goes unmatched for the entire rest of the movie.Young up-and-comer Eddie Redmayne as student rebellion leader Marius and West End starlet Samantha Barks as the street urchin Eponine also succeed when the camera fixes squarely upon them in their respective songs ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" and ""On My Own.""As much as the close-ups really highlight and enhance the acting, some members of the cast struggle with it. Russell Crowe has a lot of trouble with Inspector Javert, both vocally (at the beginning at least) and emotionally. He's a tricky character who's hard to empathize with in the first place, and Crowe just seems uncomfortable during his two huge solos.Opinions will vary on the overall sound of ""Les Mis√©rables"" because of the choice to do on-set singing. Some lyrics become a bit lost when multiple people sing at once, and the actors generally choose to restrain their voices or even speak some of the lyrics rather than belt them, which given the choice and the film's intimate nature, makes sense. Great pitch is somewhat sacrificed for a raw quality that benefits the acting. The entire film is really built around the performances.Usually, when a film doesn't quite have the emotional impact it should wield, it's a lack of introspection and intimacy that can be blamed, but in this case, it's when ""Les Mis√©rables"" fails to get big enough that it lacks that power to hit all of the story's several emotional high points. We never get that big sense of scale because of Hooper's preoccupation with the characters and that intimacy. The wide shots in the film are mostly sweeping pans to establish change in time and location, and they're very effects-heavy.It's odd, because what made ""The King's Speech"" such an excellent film from a technical standpoint was the way Hooper beautifully incorporated the scenery in almost every scene. The rich detail of the set decoration, props and costumes all came through. Here we can pretty much only judge the costumes from the waist up. Half the shots in the movie could've been filmed with actors not wearing pants and we wouldn't have known it.The trade off is that we get some of the very best performances in a movie musical of all time. These are star-making turns for Redmayne and Barks, and when you stop to consider at any point in the film that the guy playing Valjean also plays Wolverine, you'll have a whole new level of respect for Jackman. He and especially Hathaway will wow you like no acting performance has in quite some time.""Les Mis√©rables"" has its missteps to be sure, but it's a worthy adaptation that utilizes its talent to impressively bring new insight to a stage musical heard and seen countless times all over the world.~StevenThanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
Didn't like it but I can see why you would,"Wow. I don't think I have ever had such a different opinion on a movie. I liked alien 3 when no one else seemed to but wow. Guys I REALLY didn't like that. Now believe me I recognize why people like this movie so much, and even though the music is absolutely fantastic and I'm going to buy the OST, as a movie or at least THIS movie, it's just really bad. I feel terrible saying that since everyone loves this movie but I just have to get this off my chest.There are many problems here but the one that the rest stem from is direction. Tom Hooper has showed us before with the king's speech and now again with this that he has absolutely no intention of making films for the sake of film. This man wants to win Oscars and that is all. The movie spends way to much time showing off that these actors are actually singing the songs on set, which is awesome and all but you could be using that time to make the plot slightly more interesting or slightly less convoluted. The only time this movie reached anything above boring and uninteresting is when Anne Hathaway is on screen. And she's great and she deserved the Oscar but we all (who where aware of the story of les mis) knew that the role was going to win the actress best supporting no matter who it was or how good she played it.I really wanted to like this film and I tried pretty hard but considering a movie this boring goes on for an unforgiving 160 minutes I just couldn't stop pleading for the movie to end.

Les Miserables,"After seeing many Broadway musicals ruined when adapted to the screen, I was weary about seeing Les Miserables, afraid that it would join the others in disaster. Les Miserables was most definitely a pleasant surprise.Everything about this film was done tastefully, and beautifully, from the set design to the performances. There was not a single actor in this film whom I thought could be replaced with another. Hugh Jackman gave the performance of a lifetime in a role which I personally feel he deserves an Oscar for. Russell Crowe made one of the most sympathetic villainous characters I have ever seen, another performance I personally believe he deserves an Oscar for. Anne Hatheway had hardly a single scene she was in where she did not bring tears to my eyes, having perfectly portrayed every single emotion of a woman who has been beaten again and again. I enjoyed every single moment in which she was on screen.Before seeing this film, if I were to describe to someone who Amanda Seyfried was, I would probably tell them ""She's the dumb chick in Mean Girls"" but from now on I would say to everyone ""She was the girl Cosette in Les Mis"" after making a small but significant part so beautiful and memorable. Samantha Barks, having little to no film experience prior to this film, should have a long withstanding career in her future, after such a beautiful and heart-wrenching performance in this film.As I have said before in this review, there was not a single member of the cast which I felt was weaker than the rest. This film was beautifully done in every way. It is so very rare that I feel that a film is a ten out of ten, but I would give this film that exact rating, as it deserves. This is a must see film which I would see again and again and again, given the chance.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Magnificent Triumph - Surpasses the Stage Version,"Is there anything more predictable than the high-brows lamenting that this piece of fluff should command attention?First, the abomination of the original stage play itself, which - of course! - ruined Broadway for the thinking people. (""More Hedda Gabler!"")Second, who do these actors think they are, singing!Third, why on earth do directors think that panoramic film spectacles should be panoramic and spectacular! Who do they think they are, trying to fiddle with people to make them emote?Fourth, too many . . . (fill in blank) close-ups, singing scenes, missed high notes, close-ups (again). In the manner of a famously dim royal in another film who critiqued by offering that Mozart's piece had ""too many notes,"" the humorless in this case might say ""so much grandness!"" and mean it as a slight.This was a magnificent piece of film-making. Far more intimate than on stage - and containing an actual sense of story. In fact, while being superior to the stage play in terms of the immediacy of the experience, it couldn't have been more different in the way familiar scenes were captured and mounted with scene-setting that was not constrained by the limitations of the stage.I applaud the film-maker. I applaud the director. I applaud the actors, particularly Mr. Jackman, Miss Hathaway, and Mr. Redmayne. Filming them as they sang was a brilliant stroke. It intensified both the singing and the acting, particularly in the most emotionally intense moments.Brilliant. And, as to the high-brows, they probably still harrumph about the Wizard of Oz, remain so very dejected that Mary Poppins didn't have the dark tone of P. L. Travers books, and scoff because The Sound of Music contained fictional elements (quelle horreur!). We can never please that type, but we can certainly enjoy majestic film-making - and Hooper has directed a majestic film.Encore!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables - c'est formidable!,"I am not a great enthusiast for 'musicals' but having seen and enjoyed the stage production of Les Mis way back when, we decided to give the movie a try. I'm glad we did.The film starts with a bang as the camera swoops into a French naval shipyard where bedraggled convict labourers struggle to haul a huge galleon into dry dock. From there on the action moves at a brisk pace as the story of love and liberty unfolds over the next two-and-a-half hours of visual excitement and stirring songs.The performances are uniformly excellent with Hugh Jackman, in the lead role of Jean Valjean, outstanding. Some critics have disliked the singing, but I thought it was always adequate and sometimes superb, a considerable achievement given that there was no studio recording or dubbing. Certainly the singing is vastly better than the awful efforts from Brosnan and Streep in Mamma Mia! That these are not operatic performances added to the reality of the story for me. However, the 'sung speech' became a little monotonous in parts, where everything seemed to be sung in five- or six-word phrases.Even so, an exceptional movie, well worth seeing - my wife detests musicals but she loved Les Miserables!(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK 20.01.13)",8.0,Anonymous,History
Shame about the box office taking being more important than the casting,"It broke my heart that they had cast box office 'names' rather than talented singers in the lead roles of Cosette and Javert. Amanda seyfried sounded so high pitched, as though she had been on the laughing gas and Russel Crowe's voice lacked any strength and passion. It's especially sad when I have seen those roles performed on stage on numerous occasions and always sung so beautifully and yet when it comes to casting, those actors are overlooked. Very sad.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Some of the worst singing ever,"I've seen and enjoyed this play a couple of times. But I really did not enjoy this version in the least. The main question that comes to my mind is why in God's name was Russell Crowe cast in this? His singing is truly awful! Jackman is only slightly better. Other than Anne Hathaway, the singers suck. This hurt my ears to the point that the director should be shot for casting them. The dark visuals are appropriate, though it does tend to drag on and on in the darkness. Of course, this is not a bright and happy play, so I don't expect this to be happy or anything. But it shouldn't hurt my ears, and, in fact the other performances have been sonically pleasant to my ears.",,Anonymous,History

Where to Start...?,"Where to start? This movie was just bad. I should probably say that I've seen the stage show of Les Mis 9 times. I went into the movies expecting to be underwhelmed, but I never thought I would walk out of the theater disappointed enough to sit down and write this review for it.Almost everything about this movie was wrong. The two people who could actually sing (Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit) were only given small opportunities to show their talent. The rest of the cast was either underwhelming (Helena Bohnam Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen) or bad (Eddie Redmayne, Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe).The classic musical numbers that make Les Mis spectacular were completely unrecognizable. Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"" reminded me of when Dory decided to speak whale in Finding Nemo. ""Master of the House"" and ""Beggar at the Feast,"" two comical numbers were scaled down so much that I wonder why they even bothered putting the two in the movie. ""Stars,"" my all time favorite Les Mis song was butchered by Russell Crowe, who sounds worse than Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia! Jackman's ""Bring Him Home"" was the cherry on top of a collection of poorly executed songs.A lot of people are complaining about the ""Blair Witch"" camera work, and I have to agree. It's distracting and takes away from the movie. Also, it provides the audience with a close up view of the saliva in the actors' mouths. Gross.I will admit, I am very biased, but I think that everyone involved in the movie should have realized that a lot of the audience members have grown up with the 10th Anniversary cast recording or have actually seen the show.If you're seeing this because you've seen the musical, think twice. It is nothing like the stage production. If you're seeing this because you read the book, think twice. It is similar to the book, but not enough to pass as an adaptation of it. If you've seen it and read it, go see Django Unchained instead. I've heard it's pretty good. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A perfect combination of musical and movie,"I have never cried so much in a movie yet I felt great crying, weeping or blinking away tears watching this movie. There was this strong sense of community with human compassion when I heard people around me searching for tissue papers or wiping tears or sobbing. It is alright to cry in a movie and I felt comfortable crying with them. It was also great I chose a late show so that I could go home right afterwards without walking around with red eyes.I have never read Hugo's original but that did not prevent me from appreciating the story and admiring his confidence in and love for humankind. I have seen the musical years ago but this movie made that production bland and unimpressive. Tom Hooper has demonstrated a perfect combination of musical and movie and made this epic a masterpiece. I can watch it and listen to the songs over and over and never get tired of it.It is a tragic story and we cried but we felt great watching it because out of this intriguing chaos there is something noble about the human race which gives us hope and keeps us going.The story itself is simple yet so rich that it inspires you to think what is important ‚Äì survival, forgiveness, salvation, compassion, help, trust, love, justice, morality, revolution, sacrifice, fairness, liberty, hope, and death. Yet, without the songs and music, these themes could not have been explored and yet leave you enough room to ponder, absorb and be moved. With the live singing and close-up of intense emotions, the production easily moves you into tears and laughter.The singing was simply beautiful. I was not sure if it was their heavenly voice, or their emotions, the music, or the situations in the story that moved me. I cried when Fantine (Anne Hathaway) sang about her lost dream, when little Cosette (Isabelle Allen) sang of her castle in the cloud, when Eponine (Samantha Barks) sang of her loneliness and love in her mind, when Marius (Eddie Redmayne) sang of his lost friends and of course in the last scene.Hugh Jackman is unbelievable. I almost did not recognize him when he appeared in the workshop. Then again when Cosette grew up he seemed transformed into another person. Yet throughout the movie, the determination in his eyes was powerful and unforgettable.Anne sang beautifully and she just swept the audience away at every frame she appeared and every note she sang. It was such a pity that her appearance was so brief.When little Cosette first appeared, I felt OMG, she is exactly like the sad girl in the poster! The sadness in her eyes made your heart ache. Then she sang and it sounded like an angel! Yet you could also feel her longing and hoping for a perfect world.All the cast were great. In comparison, Russell Crowe seemed to be less impressive although he did well. Even when there was no character struggle, the singing and visuals were simply entertaining. You will not notice time has passed as it is simply captivating. I am now looking for the sound track and DVD. Just hope HMV does not close down so soon.",9.0,Anonymous,History

He can do so much more than his silly movies (which i do enjoy).But the hero of this movie is Hugh Jackman. To me after this movie he became one of the greatest actors. His eyes, face and voice so full of emotion. I love him in his action movies but in Les Mis he really entered my heart.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Musical/Film!,"I almost did not see this outstanding film due to the critics reviews, as well as personal experience with stage to film adaptations. I tried to watch ""Phantom of the Opera"" but had seen the original stage production and nothing could compare.The major criticism of Les Miz, seems to center around the idea that great actors should transform into opera singers, or vice versa.It appears to me Director Tom Hooper chose to focus on Victory Hugo's 150 year old, multi-layered story (one of the best novels of the 19th century) rather than attempt to imitate one of the all time greatest stage shows. It was a brilliant decision.A big budget film with extremely complex characters, demands a strong cast that will deliver on performance vital to the storyline, as well as appeal to a broad audience.Mr. Hooper delivers magnificently using a method not seen before; He opted for strong, leading actors such as Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway, in the most significant roles. Rather than mime to prerecorded songs (the norm) they sing their entire performance. The fact that he chose a cast able to do both simultaneously, is an amazing feat and fascinating to watch. Undoubtedly some vocals are better than others, however those with smaller roles tend to have the most singing talent. Samantha Barks in her first film, is a perfect example of this. She delivers a phenomenal performance in her short screen time.It is my opinion, unlike live stage shows, this format allows us to see the many dimensions of each character. Inspector Javert, came though much more authentically due to the ability and talent of Russell Crowe. (authentic to the story) My guess is that this film will suddenly inspire more interest in the history of France. On the big screen we can better envision the scope and magnitude of living and working conditions during this era.Hugh Jackman is, undeniably excellent playing the lead as ""Valjean"". I was quite moved by his performance in every way.Equally crucial to the storyline, Russell Crowe as ""Inspector Javert"" is receiving criticism. I thought he brought a great deal to a complex multi-dimensional role. (on stage this has not been done-to my knowledge) Granted he does not have a huge vocal range, but his acting range is superb and he does sing well! His baritone voice is perfect for the dark and menacing Javert. He delivers excellent performance singing Stars as well as his final scene. (no spoilers!)Anne Hathaway has been given all the praise already so I will limit myself here, other than to say I also thought she was great!The entire cast is incredibly talented and give outstanding performances. I purchased the DVD and watched several times already, each viewing I take a little more away from it.In this era when Hollywood is giving us so little of quality to choose from and cutting films to 90 minutes, this 3 hours of pure talent and great storytelling is a treasure! Give this a try if you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed! Unless of course you don't like musicals. IMO - this will become one of ""those""...destined to become a classic! Easy 10 stars!",,Anonymous,History
It's Not Easy Being French,"For the uninitiated, ""Les Miserables"" concerns itself with the lives of 19th century Frenchmen and women dealing with issues as vast as love, redemption, god, hardship, and revolution. The principle yarn involves a former convict named Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) who makes a promise to a young lady (Anne Hathaway) to take care of her young daughter after she succumbs to illness.If bravado and bombast were an award category, I'm sure ""Les Miserables"" would take home the blue ribbon. But while ""Les Mis"" is filled with many, lets say rewarding emotional peaks, the film as a whole suffers from way too much muchness; too many story lines, too many indispensable characters, too many close-ups! Too many sustained moments of cathartic weeping and whimpering, clunking along to the ebbs and swells of Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg's musical score.This is not to say the makers shouldn't be credited for their hard work. Recording the vocals live instead of in studio must have been exhausting and ultimately did add a little je ne sais quoi to the proceedings, but like the first films in technicolor, the artists behind the camera just didn't know what to do with such techniques.The story of ""Les Mis"" has been adapted for the big screen more than a dozen times, and will likely be adapted again in the future. Watch it only if you have to, otherwise consider ""Les Mis"" obvious Oscar bait likely to be forgotten by this time next year.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,History
Perfectly Matches with the Play - Moving Performances,"Les Miserables, the movie opera, is a perfect tribute to the emotional magnetism of Victor Hugo's historic novel of early 19th century French Revolution, portraying the valor of one good man in the face of societal and historic turmoil. Indeed, the movie version is a hit, because the compellingly plot, one that transcends centuries, was kept in tact, consistent with the powerful mega hit opera that preceded the movie. Performances by Hugh Jackman as the valiant John Valjean, and Russell Crow as the powerfully righteous Javert, are realistic to their roles as mirror opposites and equal protagonist characters. I've seen ""Les Mis"", the stage opera, five times, including once in London, where it's justifiably a theater staple of London's West End. Therefore, I was skeptical about cinema weaknesses, but the movie exceeds expectations. It's magnificent. Ann Hathaway gives the breakout performance of her career as Fantine. Hathaway sheds her previous movie characters, as she bares her soul to the plot, playing the abused mother of the beautifully sympathetic child named Cosette (played as an adult by Amanda Seyfried). Cosette becomes a stunningly beautiful lady because Valjean intervenes into her dismal situation as a child orphan who was poorly cared for by the two crooked but comically played Thenardiere's (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an inn keeper couple who treat Cosette as child labor. ""Les Miserables"" is one of the greatest novels of modern history and the opera-play, now the stunning movie, are challenged to maintain the emotional integrity of Hugo's drama, as well as the strength of the iconic Valjean and Javert. Thankfully, the integrity of Hugo's story put to cinema is maintained. Although the music is beautiful, the singing voices of Jackman, Hathaway and Crowe do not equal those in the stage opera. On the other hand, Seyfried is perfectly cast in her role as Cosette. Eponine, the character played and sung by Samantha Barks, isn't as strong in the movie plot as her character appears in the stage version; nevertheless, she provides a powerful performance. Child actors Isabelle Allen, Natalya Wallace and, especially, Daniel Huttlestone give good performances, with Hugglestone excelling in his role. This movie will be loved by fans of the novel and the ""Les Mis"" stage opera. Those exposed to the story for the first time, or who are unfamiliar with Victor Hugo, may want to brush up on their literary history before enjoying this memorable movie. Victor Hugo could not have foreseen how his novel would extend the powerful moral intention of this historic saga well into the 21st Century.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Somewhat disappointing,"If you've seen the stage version of this musical, it's unlikely you will find the movie adaptation satisfying. Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen are out of their depth vocally, and in the case of Crowe, this is a serious shortcoming. Even Hugh Jackman, who I believe is a consummate all- around entertainer, strains with the vocal demands of his role. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne are lovely as Cosette and Marius, although they project little amorous fire. The smaller roles of Eponine, Gavroche, young Cosette, and Enjolras are very well cast. The editing is unnecessarily choppy, although I know this is the common model of today's filmmaking. There's no question the film is visually sumptuous, but the production never misses an opportunity to hit us over the head with the pathos, as if audiences are incapable of relating to subtlety. It is a sad statement that the appearance of Colm Wilkinson as the bishop makes one long for his performance in the role of Jean Valjean.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning Masterpiece,"Of films most recently seen leading up to the Oscars, this one leaves me breathless, wound up, crying, laughing and in short totally wrapped up the incredible long length of its run.I believe this film will go into the history of cinema as a phenomenal talent & range of each actor's artistry in singing, acting, comedic timing to compel laughter, tears, anger -- basically the whole spectrum of human emotion -- and infused into the story by each.Even for those ""not into musicals"", be assured, you'll walk away from this one mesmerized and touched in every emotional string..over and over again throughout each scene.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Where's the 'Mute' button?,"I tried. I really tried.But after a third failed attempt, I guess I'll have to declare myself forfeit. I can't watch ""Les Miserables"" in its entirety¬Ö not with keeping myself glued to the screen anyway. I'm not sure I would use it as a background noise¬Ö sorry, I meant music. I love ""The Mis√©rables"" as a story but is the fame so great for the American audience that director Todd Hopper thought a musical would be the best way to boost the audiences or grab the interest. I know it's an adaptation from a Broadway musical, but this is no musical, this is an opera, a loud, bombastic opera where every line is sung as loudly as if the actors' lives depended on it, it comes to such a proportion that there's no purpose whatsoever to have a language section in the Bonus Features and here's why.The second time I tried to give the film a chance, I put the French version, just for fun, well, what do you know, the songs were kept in the original language so that French was popping up here and there in a few random moments where the characters actually spoke, like ten minutes in a whole, I totally forgot it was in French. That's how ubiquitous singing is, and not just singing, everything is emphasized to the point that you almost feel the pain and the agony of all these talented actors but so-so singers, it's like you witness suffering and despair in motion, and again, it's so omnipresent that there's no moment that can pass as relief, one you could catch your breath. Even the highlight of the film that earned Anne Hathaway her Oscar is diluted in the rest where it's all the same loud and hyperbolic songs. ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is memorable but not a standalone moment because everything else is just the same.The film had everything, the sets, the decoration, a talented cast, Hugh Jackman did a convincing Jean Valjean and even Crowe could be a decent Javert, I wasn't even shocked by Sacha 'Borat' Cohen as Th√©nardier whose villainous two-faced creepy role has often been played by comedic actors as to highlight the grotesque clown-looking men, but Todd Hopper's choice to tackle the story through singing wasn't the most inspired. He proved to have succeeded with simpler methods with his ""King's Speech"" which, while not the most flamboyant movie of the year, was still moving enough to catch the hearts of people. Here, it's like the young, and certainly talented and well-intended director, was so wrapped up by his success he wanted his musical. Recently, Damien Chazelle did the same with a better movie, and yet lost to the more modest ""Moonlight"". Sometimes, the fewer, the better.Musicals are hit-or-miss but while ""Les Mis√©rables"" is a critical success (or was it?), I'm not sure it's the wisest approach to a story that is multi-layered and benefits from regular acting. Take the scene where Valjean meets the priest who saves him from another arrest with the candelabra, this is a quiet and powerful moment between two men, something that should say a lot without an abundance of lines, here they're singing their lungs out and it's totally inappropriate, if not comical. So many attempts on emotions are lost because of this focus on opera and the more you progress in the story, the more you realize it was a bad strategy after all.Indeed, if people aren't into music and opera, they will not enjoy it, if they do, they'll hate the singing and deem it as amateur and cringe-worthy, a simple glimpse at IMDb's review section will give you an idea. So ""Les Miserables"" belongs to the posterity on a simple Wikipedia-level, but I'm not sure it will have this aura that stands the test of time, and as if it embraced its own malediction, even Anne Hathway wasn't too happy about her win.The film was obviously made to impress, but I wish it wished to 'express' as well.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables is miserable,"When so many people love this movie I get to thinking why am I so off track with my feelings about this musical. Maybe I just don't get it, maybe it's because I wasn't that familiar with the Broadway production, maybe it's because I went to this movie to be entertained....big mistake. Now don't get me wrong, the production sets, acting, costumes, and big screen epic stature are all there, but what was missing was the emotional story and connection to the audience. I guess I knew this wasn't for me about 10 minutes into this seemingly long slow moving movie when I found I was already wondering how long until it would be over. Now I'll admit the only song I really knew going into this movie was "" I dreamed a dream"" however, the endless non melodic off key vocalization by the entire cast with the exception of Anne Hathaway in my humble opinion simply ruined any chance this production would work for me and those movie goers who were seeking a memorable story put to music. I like the 1998 movie production staring Liam Neesom so much more than this miserable attempt. Simply put this movie was a huge disappointment, no in truth it STUNK...sorry but I call them as I see them.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Go and see it!,Excellent film in most respects; the singing is exceptional and performances intense and very believable. There are however two exceptions to this - the Thernadiers are miscast leading to the ruining of Master of the House. This is a rousing song with very clever words which were lost in the film by poor delivery and not helped by the fussy camera work during it. You have to see it performed by Alun ARmstrong to really appreciate it.Having said that the orchestrations are to die for and the performances by Ann Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are first class and deserve awards as does direction and settings and costume.

A Rhapsodic Extravaganza With Fabulous Elements!,"Les Mis√©rables being my first Les Miz experience as well as my first ever musical cinema experience turned out to be amazing.The story is great and in parallel to the 19th century French era which is one of my few areas of interest. The intricacy at which the script revolves around the lead characters and some trivial plot kings is marvelous and unlike Cloud Atlas blunder, everything gels here to bring out a perfect musical.Hugh Jackman is great, so is Russell Crowe but I didn't like Hathway much, maybe because of a personal whim since I saw The Princess Diaries. Anyways, I also think Amanda Seyfried and her reel-life lover were sidelined and that instead of Sacha & Carter having their names in the promotional posters, I would've wanted their names to come up. Well I am no marketing executive..Music is exceptional and choreography is good, too. The lyrics of the pieces are just so true and extraordinary that I fell in love with the verses - of all aspects.Bottom line is that even though it just tries very hard to complete the story in about 150 minutes, Les Mis√©rables is a perfect blend which you can enjoy with your family!

"1st chapter - meh, 2nd chapter - fantastic, 3rd chapter - get me out of this theater!","Maybe I think like this because my local cinema didn't pause the movie, but this was just so tedious. While the intro of the movie was a rather weak debut, the second chapter was ceaselessly sublime and full with great, rememberable scenes. Anne Hathaway's performance was perfect, but sadly this can't be said about the bigger part of the others. While Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen added admirably funny touch the movie, I was quite disappointed with the rest of the cast. Yes, they were all good, but it's just not what I expected from such a big production. Hugh Jackmann did a great job most of the times, but I think his turn in this movie is overrated. The singing was also not as good as I expected it to be.So much about the acting. A big plus point of the film is how it looks. Cinematography, make-up, costumes, set design, etc. are all quite Oscar- worthy. So the only major problem of mine with 'Les Miz' was the exhausting length. I admit that I've seen neither a stage performance nor an other movie based on Victor Hugo's novel in all my life - therefore I was a total newbie to the story - therefore I can't agree with the people that have read/seen 'Les Mis√©rables' before and consider it a too short adaption of the story because the 158 minutes of this movie were already much too long for me.But let's go back to the point where I was actually loving the movie, which is about the first hour and 15 minutes. After this second chapter was over and time fast-forwarded once again, the entertainment factor got lost in the skipped years. The revolution and the film's big love story are the new plot-points and that was far less interesting as the story of the films 2nd part. I admit, it was made totally fine, but it was just missing something to jazz it up (Anne Hathaway probably would've helped).All in all, if you haven't seen any form of the story before like I did, you'll be better off getting the movie on home media so you can take a big break at some point - you'll need that.",,Anonymous,History
A simple critic,"I have read the book years ago, but i did not have any expectations from a Hollywood movie to be accurate with it. So for me this was not a reason to not watch and not like this movie.What is wrong with this film is simple: Russell Crowe has a nice voice but did not match at all with his character; How can you sing about something bad with an angelic way? He was bad as well playing his role making the bad guy...The film was too long, and the songs needed that something more to give this 'magic' to the audience, except a track that you could hear during the whole movie which makes the difference. Also a musical film does not mean that all the characters should sing all the time (which made this movie really boring) while its not needed at all, they could talk as well...Anne Hathaway was amazing and really emotional, and even if her role was really small she was still big. Hugh Jackman proves one more time how great actor he is.Simple!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Highly Enjoyable. Would recommend it to anyone.,"I loved this film.I would not of thought that such a thing could be humanly possible but it is. After all I do not count myself as a massive musical fan or a fan of the original source being either the book or the musical. Having nether seen the musical or read the book, I wasn't sure as what to think about the story as what I had heard was mainly synopsis from IMDb or other such websites.I was quite surprised at how detailed the story actually was. Which is nice considering at what low expectations I had of the story on a whole.The film stands apart from the most modern film musical with the largely incredible performances from the cast. Which rest on the shoulders of an incredible Hugh Jackman. But the supporting characters of the film have some quite incredible performances. Most namely Eddie Remane and the incredible Anne Hathaway.Tom Hooper show's what a talented director he truly is. Demanding incredible performance's from all of the cast. Which is what he gets no question. But also the way in which he shoot's this film. From the long close up's he uses to the incredible swooping shoots that shows just how amazing the spectacle of Les Miz truly is.All in all. I was not expecting to like this film as much as did. But came out of it with a tear to my eye but also throughly enjoying this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Actors, Poorly Trained Singers","I enjoyed seeing the film of Les Miserables, having seen the stage show several times. Film is hyper-real, so questions arise that never come up in the stage show. The events of the novel and the film take place during the 1832 June Rebellion not the First Revolution (1789-99) as many Americans might assume, but Hugo's novel was also influenced by the Revolution of 1948 which deposed Louis Philippe. Victor Hugo hated the monarchs of the time and the novel (and the show) exaggerates the bad social conditions of the time.But the main problem for me was unfortunately the singing. The work is effectively an opera with almost no spoken dialogue. The music is a huge part of the emotional appeal of the work, and the actors--great as they are--make one of the great mistakes of singing. Rather than letting their voices convey emotion, they emote first, then sing. They obviously don't know the difference, and it is a very significant one. Since they were singing virtually a capella on the actual set of the movie under extremely strenuous physical conditions I can empathize with their limitations, but the director's method here, though bold, robbed the movie of much of its emotional impact.Then there are some, like the great Russell Crowe, who sadly, just don't have the chops. Javer's fabulous ""aria,"" ""Stars"" fell flat in Crowe's safe but bland rendition. Javer's enormous conviction sets up his later suicide, and Crowe couldn't bring it off. Sad.Anne Hathaway grinds her way through ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and robs us of the emotion inherent in the music. Susan Boyle brought me to tears. Anne Hathaway made me admire her grit and physicality, but it was not her singing that created the much more limited emotional response I felt.Hugh Jackman has the singing chops, but his big ""aria,"" ""Bring Him Home"" is the graveyard of many stage Jean Valjeans. It is horribly high in tessatura, and Jackman was almost screaming to get out the high notes. The song says, ""hear my prayer"" and it was not a prayer, but a shout.These are all great actors, but the direction was off-base here, and audiences who never saw the stage work will never know how affecting it can be if they only see the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Art at its maximum expression,"Expect to find something like Moulin Rouge, Chicago and Across The Universe, but this is not ""a Disney movie"" where there are about 14 or 17 songs - like in the movies mentioned - and the rest is a normal film dialogs, negative. Here the songs are 95% of the film. It's a musical as it is that of Joseph with Donny Osmond, only that this is a film that I mean. The development, setting, production, is 10, a lot of money, for many good effects, but the sense of the whole movie is totally theatrical, the proof is uncut planes often demonstrating an impeccable ability action of the protagonists. Being all sung, at times you can be ""heavy"". But it's all part of what a real musical form, an orchestral score, a single track from start to finish with its ups and downs, their different situations, different moments, culminating as any other piece of music ends, but clinging tightly their history, their characters, their thoughts and their small recreation of the world that we see.A production level we have a winner in every way. All design, effects, settings, costumes, is totally believable, dirty, filthy, beautiful, crisp ... I think the film is reaching impeccable levels from 2010 onwards. From now on I think not ""get off"" again, I do not see how to improve production at a product like this nor saw how to improve production at Inception. All that remains to improve almost adjoins subjectivity. Performances, script and story, and music. The rest, visually there are many things that seem almost perfect. At least I repeat, I do not see where or how to improve a product like this.The script and story are superb. This would not be thanks to Tom Hooper (director) I suppose, because it is the adaptation of a product already made in the form of music. It's a classic in my opinion, very well told, very long ... one of those stories as long as life itself, you can not impute anything, because they have left almost no detail, such as The Notebook or Men of Honor in my opinion, characters level, know the level inside the personalities of each, simply explain almost everything that has to explain to us to maintain a relationship of self-identification in the characters (some of us feel identified, some not, because we are all different in many ways). Some stories we might like less or more. Honestly, to this day, December 27, 2012, any story about the French Revolution and in general France had seemed boring stories where I never felt identified with anyone, and that appealed to me the least. That has changed now, thanks to Les Mis√©rables.Performances, decades pass and most concerning actions shall have Marlon Brando to name only one among several papers few behind, such as the monologue of this actor Apocalypse Now (not to dwell much more) , but we have new benchmark gentlemen. What they have done in this masterpiece Anne Hathaway (just do not see what is more interpretive actress Anne Hathaway for more than reviewing film history right now), Hugh Jackman and Eddie Redmayne alongside Russel Crowe has been a scandal, worthy mentioned for decades and decades. It was the perfect catch theater performance brought to the big screen, we, as the uncut long monologues that have been marked before other actors and the realism with which they have done. Anne Hathaway has been my vastly superior to all, and has been absolutely perfect PERFECT the fact that we see the subtitle of all songs depending on where the first plane to different sides of the character. Not always focused down, but to the left or right. I did not expect at all (international), and is the finishing touch to this magnificent and incredible photography, which sometimes reminded me Terrence Malick (not to mention others whose jobs basically unaware of ignorance). Anne Hathaway has made me mourn for the emotion, almost made it into a movie called underrated Love and Other Drugs where his performance is also superb. But what has been achieved in this film, I will not reveal, and thanks to perfect planning and many, many eggs by the actors, which in the theater is always present, but in the film we see little of, we observed that is probably the best scene in the whole year of film, and personally, of the best acted scenes and the best performances I've seen in my life. Like I said, it has made me mourn such action, so desperate, so sad, so angry and so much hope reflected in every pore of his body. Unsurpassed until proved otherwise.Hugh Jackman is not far behind at all. Get the most out of his career without a doubt, and it is much to say for it is one of the successors in my opinion Brando, Heston, Eastwood and company. His best performance by far.All the voices of all stakeholders, nuanced. Forced ... they put many balls as well have told me, I do not know if it is true, that all voices are prerecorded, but the scenes are sung and filmed at the same time. Are you kidding me?. If that is not credible to a musical, I do not know what the hell it is. An added plus to work so magnanimous.All I do is give in to such a timeless masterpiece.The makeup plays an important role throughout the play, as is every detail and every feature. But makeup for the characters ... so much ugliness, so old age. Other added more to this blockbuster. It's a film that honestly see very hard not to become history.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Try and make it to the second half ... it does get better.. Jackman does not sing as much,"So went to see Les Mis tonight... I have to say I was a bit disappointed. First let me say that Barks, Redmayne, and Seyfred saved the show for me. Cosette, Marius and Eponine makes the back half of the movie really good. Hathaway as Fantne was very good as well and man she really sacrificed for the part. However that is where the good parts end... it seemed to me that they could not figure out if they should make it look like a theater stage or Paris in many of the scenes. Crowe does an OK job as Javert but you can see he struggled to show any of the emotion of the character and sing his lines. However at least he can sing .... Jackman holds a note as about as well as a colander holds water. He was really the wrong person for the job; they should have looked for a singer who has done some acting rather then an actor that has clearly never had to sing. The part I was most disappointed with is ""Who Am I""; This is a powerful turning point for the character and he just did not have the strength in his voice did not show it ...

It has all the elements of a good story, a love interest, jealously, and a clash to the death. Hugh Jackman, as Jean Valjean carried this film and did a top job.

By using familiar, modern shots but combined with classical context and substance, people of all ages and generation will find it pleasing without being mundane.and the heart wrenching theme of this novel and film setting is brought out with meaning and power through the strength of the acting and the direction resolve. it makes us care and wonder and think of something more than the tragedy that is the end of this film. it gives us hope.lastly, the raw, realistic imperfections that seem out of the ordinary and maybe even bohemian in traditional film making is what set this film apart with not only films that are in the same category, but all films.from the chosen actors and actresses, to the raw perfect synergy of singing and normal speech, we get the best possible balance of all.this film covers, like its synopsis says, so many facades of life and emotions that this film is a perfect spectacle and embodiment of what it means to be humanity.definitely buying the DVD, it's worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

You can't go expecting the quality of singing performances heard on Broadway, but if you don't have that expectation, then just sit back and let the movie do its thing, you will find a remarkable translation of the play to the big screen.

Surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics.,"There's no need to vouch for the musical that swept the world. Few are as celebrated as Les Miserables, and for all the right reasons. The musical production was truly beyond compare. Its songs; powerful, its acting; stellar, the storytelling; wondrous; and its impact; everlasting. It's long earned its place as my favorite. To develop a work of cinema out of this phenomenon would be a great challenge requiring respectful care, but would not be an impossible matter. This much is established by Tom Hooper's most recent addition to his growing body of ambitious work, an entertaining film adaptation that faithfully emphasized the themes that countless viewers, myself among them, fell in love with.The movie follows the same path as the musical, starting with Jean Valjean's release from 19 years of slavery on a charge of stealing bread to feed his starving family and his failed attempts at escape. A Bishop who shows him compassion and the path to salvation sparks Valjean's journey to redemption. Henceforth dedicated to upholding his bargain with God, Valjean assumes a new identity and a new life, breaking his parole to fulfill his mission to show the world the goodness that he has found within himself. Years pass and by that time Valjean has become a respected factory owner and the mayor of a town that prospered under his reign. An intervention of fate leads Valjean to a new task that would change his life once again. Fantine, a desperate woman symbolic of the miserable life of poverty in France was betrayed and deserted by her lover. Left alone with Cosette, the child she bore out of wedlock, she commits herself entirely to her daughters welfare, going as far as to sell her own body for the coin she needs to ensure her daughter's survival. As Fantine lies dying from an illness, Valjean learns that he had a part in her downfall. Fantine had been a worker in his factory who Valjean fired at the request of his lecherous foreman after she rejected his advances. Overcome by guilt and wishing to make amends he now makes another promise of a lifetime ‚Äì to become the father Cosette never knew and raise her as his own. Valjean finds Cosette and what then begins is something greater than he could ever imagine being possible; he experiences love for the first time, a sequence illuminated in a beautiful song; one of the original touches this movie delivers which has rightfully earned its academy award nomination.Made possible by Victor Hugo's novel, Les Miserables is a timeless story filled with timeless characters and enriched by timeless themes. The essential pillars which hold the structure upright are the complex forces that come into play. Throughout the course of the story, Valjean is hunted by his obsessive enemy Inspector Javert; a man obligated by his duty to the law who shows no remorse for those he perceives as unjust. Since he does this sincerely in the name of God, he and Valjean prove to be two sides of the same coin. Javert isn't evil, but his own unbending sense of Justice renders him blind to the forces that can lead weaker men astray. This and his complete lack of compassion for those he considers sinners ultimately lead to his tragic downfall when he realizes that Valjean is a better man than he. The Th√©nardier couple, an innkeeper and his wife, who kept Cosette in a dismal life of servitude light the tone of the story with comedic appeal. All of these events unfold in the midst of a revolution of youths rising up against an oppressive government, under the leadership of the dashing and charismatic Enjolras and Marius Pontmercy (who would later develop a loving relationship with Cosette). Within this turmoil, all the characters find themselves bound.Fresh from the success of The King's Speech and the John Adams mini series, Tom Hooper gave the world of Les Miserables a gritty and down-to-earth atmosphere and took the unusual step of recording the songs during the filming rather than dubbing the voices in later. This is where the movie has fallen flat for those expecting top-notch vocal performances. More focus is thus placed on the acting as opposed to singing and it doesn't seem fair to compare the actors to their musical theater counterparts. There are enough positive elements to overwhelm the negatives, including the Oscar nominated performances of Hugh Jackman (who is no stranger to the musical world and as a result is absolutely wonderful portraying Jean Valjean) and Anne Hathaway, who despite having much less screen time, delivers a stunning performance as Fantine. Her scene involving the famous song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" shows how far she has come since Princess Diaries, a powerful blend of song and emotional acting. The production value reflects the tone that was intended and enables the viewers to immerse themselves in the world of strife and struggle; to savor all the passion. The most important aspect is conveying all the emotions and all the themes for which Les Miserables the classic novel and classic musical is rightfully renowned for ‚Äì liberty, love, redemption, and the triumph of the human spirit even when the battle is lost.I admire all movies that take risks, those that take a path that conformist filmmakers dare not tread. Tom Hooper's Les Miserables is a work of exceptional fidelity that is surely the best cinematic adaptation of one of literature and theater's great classics. The cinematic experience is one that won't soon diminish for me and frankly I hope it never will!",,Anonymous,History
Casting director was horrible,"I love musicals, and Les Miserables is my all time favorite. I've seen it 10 times in the theater, and listened to the CDs for years. I just can't get past four horribly cast people. Russell Crowe was horrific as Javert. Javert is an amazing part, and he was wooden and most egregiously, he can't sing the amazing songs Javert has to sing. Sacha Baron Cohen was miscast as Thenardier. Thenardier doesn't have to have perfect singing. But Cohen lacked the personality needed. Helena Bonham Carter also was poor here. Singing and wrong personality for Madame. Anne Hathaway is also a decent actress normally, but she lacked the chops for acting and singing for Fantine. Beyond that, decent movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterpiece,"Having seen Les Miserables on multiple occasions in London, when I heard a musical version was being brought to the screen, it worried me. I then heard Tom Hooper was directing and instantly that worry turned to excitement. I cannot tell you how much I loved this movie. It is a near perfect adaptation of musical with a dream cast that brings this timeless story to the silver screen with such finesse and beauty. I left the theater speechless and in awe of the talent and production that went in to this motion picture event. Do yourself a favour, don't wait for the DVD. Watch this on the biggest screen with the best sound you can find. An unforgettable experience awaits.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not Bad/Not Good Either,"Les Miserables was written as music, not a classic stage play with dialogue. Therefore, first and foremost, you need people who have the vocal talent, musical background, and range to perform this. The director relied to heavily on 'acting.' It is the music that carries Les Miserables, not acting. Using Hollywood big names in any role may stimulate box office receipts but in the end dooms the production. Russell Crowe - a great Roman general, lousy singer. Hugh Jackman - should have stayed with X-Men. Eddie Redmayne - best of the group, but needs coaching to do Marius. Aaron Tveit - good but not the caliber I've seen on the stage. Similar comments for the other actors as well. This is a good attempt but falls short. The music as always, moves your soul, just overlook who's performing. I'm surprised Cameron MacIntosh signed off on the choice of actors.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Les Miserables - So sad, it's good!","I have seen this movie twice already and hope to go again before it comes out on DVD. The first time, I teared. The second, I cried. (Maybe because my mother was with me and she's more emotional?) The fact is it is a truly amazing musical. A GREAT story, AMAZING songs and an AWESOME cast and crew. What makes this a strong, uplifting film is that the actors actually payed more attention to the acting aspect rather than the singing (where they can probably fix it up in the studio).The point is that it is a really emotional film. I rarely cry at movies except at one where the director makes you feel for the characters, (such as Jonathan Larson's Rent). Tom Hooper did exactly that and I'm sure everyone else who has seen the film will already agree. Every time I'm working, I notice that there is always someone walking out of the theatre with tears in the eyes or still continuing to try to get over the outcome of the movie and its characters.Hugh Jackman does an outstanding, superb job as playing the courageous Jean Valjeant, Russel Crowe really surprises the audience with his singing voice and the bad-ass crooked policeman Javert, while Anne Hathway plays a wonderful Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette (which still plays a decent actress almost the same as Sophie from Mamma Mia!) the boys like Eddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit as Marius and Enjolras make you want to fight for their cause, and last but not least, the perfect comical duo Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Samantha Barks also played a wonderful Epenine as she did in the Broadway musical.This film is recommended for all ages. For the drama, comedy and musical people at heart, it serves its purpose in showing how Les Miserables were truly miserable!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Les Mis film is botched by shaky camera and all those CLOSE-UPS!,"A truly epic, emotional stage musical is turned into a frustrating and annoying, TV adaptation due to several bad choices made by the director, Tom Hooper, who did the excellent ""The King's Speech."" Which classic film musicals has Mr. Hooper seen? Has he watched ""West Side Story,"" ""Cabaret"" ""Singin' in the Rain"" or even ""The Sound of Music?"" ""Les Miserables"" is practically opera and it's subject matter is, indeed, operatic. But instead of reinventing the stage musical for film, shooting in medium, or wide shots, he chose to put his camera right in the actor's faces making every single moment over-the-top and melodramatic. We, as the audience, never get a breather, let alone a breath. With such dramatic material as Victor Hugo and these characters, you don't need gigantic close-ups to make it dramatic. The drama is inherent in the material. Where do you go when you film almost every scene is close-up? Rather than heighten the impact of scenes, his wall-to-wall, in your face camera moves lessen the impact and weakens the material. His hand-held camera makes us dizzy after a while and it often goes out of focus during much of the film. It gave me a headache. This film is exhausting. I feel for the talented cast, many of whom are not trained singers. They try hard but, much of the time, they're performing for the last row of the balcony while the camera is up their nostrils. It was an interesting experiment to have the actors ""sing"" in the moment but this choice magnifies the uneven variety of singing talents. Hugh Jackman and Ann Hathaway come off best but the camera continually distracts us from some of their most emotional scenes. Russell Crowe comes off as a boring stiff and looks constipated, as if he'd rather be doing something else rather than straining for his top notes. What could have been a revitalization of the movie musical, with some great songs, ends up being a bombastic, relentless and utterly disappointing mess of a movie musical. Sometimes, less is more.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Please Watch This At Least Once.,"Today was the second time I watched Les Miserable.The first time I tried hard not to cry because I'm manly like that, and I actually succeeded but my eyes were still kinda red...The second time I thought, ""Ha! I've watched it already. Now I can see all the ladies sniffle and weep!""But damn, when I watched it this second time, I COMPLETELY LOST IT, and I'm still trying to figure out why. (I'm a guy by the way.)And that, my fellow readers, is what's so brilliant about this movie.Frankly, I can't even remember the last time a movie was so successful at making even tough guys like me cry.I won't spoil the movie in this review, because if you like great music... and if you want an emotional ride... then really... you should go watch it if you haven't already.The singing was excellent. Some people didn't like Russell Crowe's singing, but I thought he was just fine. It's just that he isn't very ""Russell Crowey"" in terms of singing lol.The acting was perfect, especially from Hugh Jackman. Don't believe me?

523rd Review: Mostly perfect....,"Do I love the stage musical? - a huge resounding yes! Les Mis is easily my favorite musical of the past 30 years - and I really know it inside and out - so like many I've been on tenterhooks waiting to see the big screen version. And it is great - mostly.The story of Jean Valjean, a victim of heavy justice who discovers redemption and his journey that finally leads up to the barricades of a Paris student uprising in the late 1820 is told with verve and assurance.It is moving and well done. The younger cast in particular shine with heart and vigor. (I did have a problem with two songs that were absolute showstoppers on stage and both were curiously underwhelming in this reviewers opinion.) All in all, this is a unique and interesting interpretation and as nearly everyone else has noted it is not a straight from stage to screen adaption that tries to reimagine the soliloquies and internal dialogs in a far more intimate way.Considering it was the film I was most looking forward to it was a great experience....mostly....",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazed.,"This was beautiful. First movie that really made me cry. I have to applaud the entire cast (yes, even Russel Crowe) for being so amazing. But I must say, the performance that really gave me chills was Redmayne's 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables'. I've been a long time fan of the musical, and I've been listening to Michael Ball's version my entire life and that was the first time I really, really felt the grief and pain in that scene. Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman most definitely deserve the praise they have been given, as well as Samantha Barks as a tear jerking Eponine. Amanda Seyfried brought some depths to Cosette that I'd never seen before. Russel Crowe's Javert may not have been stellar, but I believed him. I have seen a lot of reviews putting the directing down, with the extreme zooms on singers. I must say that I was worried about this, but to me it just gives a beautiful view of everything the character is feeling. A+. I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I never liked musicals... until now! What an AMAZING and MOVING film!,"First, I have to confess that the only knowledge I had of this legendary tale came through popular culture references. If it wasn't for Star Trek or Seinfeld episodes, I would have known absolutely nothing about Les Miserables. Yeah, I'm THAT guy. I can also say that I never met a musical that I liked or even wanted to give much of a chance. That changes in a BIG way here!I was completely enthralled and completely moved by this film and the way it was presented. I've read the critiques stating that the direction may be inferior or that the vocals should have been sweetened in post but I find both those criticisms to be without merit whatsoever. The entire cast was superb and there really are some award-worthy performances to say the least. Hugh Jackman is amazing as is Anne Hathaway (although being a novice to the tale, I was surprised at how small her role was). Every actor struck a chord with me emotionally. I honestly didn't expect that to happen. Sure, a person can nitpick the story and the rather instantaneous love and connections that happen between characters but why seek to cheapen the experience? Getting hung up on logic when everyone is singing their thoughts and feeling would be missing the point. The overall message is as grand and moving as the performances. I also have to finish with another confession. It takes a tougher man than I to not tear up at the end of the film. The conclusion hit home in a big way with me as did this film, much to my surprise.(Note: I usually consider myself in the ""it's not my kind of thing"" category when it comes to musicals. I saw it because of the hype. Five minutes in when Crowe and Jackman are doing their opening sing/speak I thought to myself, ""good lord, this is going to be intolerable."" ""Why the heck did I pay to see this?"" Now, I'm so glad I kept an open mind and allowed the film to do it's thing. This is one of the few 10/10 ratings and experiences for me of the 2012 releases. I enjoyed it FAR more than I thought I would.)",,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables,This movie had some amazing stand out performances. However the technique used to capture the actors' singing while was effective at some points was also very problematic. Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried were the standouts and gave incredible performances. Eddie Redmayne and Russell Crowe really left a lot to be desired. The way the camera drunkenly swung around was dizzying and frustrating at times. I am someone who has read the book twice and worships the stage production so it was a little disappointing seeing this film fall a little flat. However I think it is still worth checking out if you are a fan or enjoy movie musicals.

...Comparing to the Stage Productions,"The movie will be probably most appreciated by those who haven't fallen in love with this work on stage. The movie went for star power over voice power in almost every character, doing disservice to the most beloved numbers.Hugh Jackman - Jean Valjean. A fabulous performance by Jackman. He's unrecognizable in the opening Valjean imprisoned character. Incredible transformation. Slightly higher pitched than the stage version Valjeans I've seen, but it works. I was moved to tears during his Bring Me Home...and judging by all the sniffling around me, mission accomplished. He deserves his nomination.Russell Crowe - Javert. Of the six times I've seen Les Mis, five on stage, Crowe's Javert performance ranks 6th. He is a good singer, not great. Javert's performers on stage have commanded standing Os every time. If Crowe were on stage, other than for the Javert role prominence, I doubt anyone would be standing because of his voice.Anne Hathaway - Fantine. An A for effort but a D- for voice appeal. I'm speechless at how poor a singer Anne Hathaway is and the superlative accolades she's receiving. She murdered I Dreamed a Dream - nails on the chalkboard. At one point I covered my mouth - in shock. Fantine's voice is supposed to be beautiful and convey deep anguish. She conveyed the anguish fine but it made my ears hurt. There was nothing beautiful about it. She simply does not have a good singing voice. It was literally hard to listen to and it seemed endless. She gives her whole heart to her performance, but she shouldn't be in a musical starring role.Amanda Seyfried - Cosette. The star voice of the show. Best Cosette I've seen. She masters everything and her range is stunning.Eddie Redmayne - Marius. Reminded me of a high school musical performance. Every time he sang Eponine's name it sounded different. Fair voice, not great. Countless performers could do better. Disappointed with the casting of this very important supporting character. Distracting physicality including extreme vibration of throat, mouth. Incredulous love at first sight. Now the Enjolras actor would be a different story. Not Redmayne's fault, they miscast him.Samantha Barks - Eponine. Excellent Eponine. As good as any I've seen. Great voice, beautiful girl whose story evokes emotion in the audience.Aaron Tveit - Enjolras. Excellent performance. Wish he had been cast as Marius though. I'd understand why Cosette would get worked up over Aaron.Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter - Thenardier couple. Drop them on the stage anytime, anywhere. They were perfect.Colm Wilkinson - Bishop. Best performance for this role ever. He and the movie version of this character explain the effect on Valjean better than the stage ever has. His role is so powerful you are reminded of him throughout the movie unlike the stage version ever achieved but would have benefited from.The movie feels like an old friend - reminding you of the best of times. However, when you look at the friend today, you see a not-so-strong version of the friend of yesteryear.For those who have trouble with musicals, since there is very little talking in this movie, it is similar to watching a movie with subtitles...you get used to every word being sung and the music becomes a subconscious thread adding depth to the words.The casting agent went for stars who could sing. Most of them could anyway. I'd prefer no-names who are better singers (but keep Jackman and Seyfried). In the scenes where the non-stars performed (crowds, etc), those performers were as good as stage. Since the characters nominated have been played thousands of times by better voices across the globe over the past couple decades, it would be difficult to understand how they would win an Academy Award. I'm very pleased Jackman's performance was recognized as he was excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,History
outstanding in so many ways,"In this cinematic operatic production of Victor Hugo's ma gnus opus, there is beautiful color, superb acting, and grand singing. The poor, miserable, and destitute people of early-eighteenth-century France are depicted well. Hugh Jackman came across well as the horribly mistreated Jean Valjean, and Russell Crowe was definitely cruel, heartless, and horrible as the mean Officer Javert. Anne Hathaway made you sympathize with her in her role as the anemic mother of Cosette, and the little Cosette was a heart-stealer, and you can't do anything but feel love and sympathy for her because of the mistreatment of her by the Thenadiers: it was easy to fall in love with her when she became a girl of roughly twenty years of age. While I did like the singing, it maybe made the movie comical in places. But again, It maintained my attention well and is bound to be one of Universal's most outstanding productions.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Movie in Oh So Many Ways,"Everyone must see this epic movie, even if they do not like musicals. My wife and daughter talked me into going to the Les Mis play at the Fox Theater in St Louis a few months ago. Further encouragement came from the memory that the most literary minded man I ever knew, a very well read old judge, long ago pronounced his judgment that Victor Hugo's Les Miserables was ""the best novel ever written."" I never finished the tome-like book, but loved the play - becoming a real fan. So, when I heard about the movie version, and was exposed to Anne Hathaway's emotional and terrific rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in the pre-release trailer and promotions I could not hardly wait to see it. I was not the only one. Several days after Christmas, my wife, daughter, mother, mother in law, sister, brother-in-law and I went to see it at a local theater. Everyone in the family loved this epic drama. They and the rest of the movie audience even applauded at the end. I have been a Russell Crowe, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway fan for some time and they, especially Anne, exceeded even my lofty expectations. Now I have become a Hugh Jackman fan, too. I Love Sally Field, I Really Love Her, but Anne Hathaway's performance in this movie, with heart-rending acting and singing, was perfection. If she does not win an Oscar, it will be a travesty of epic proportions. She would have stolen the show in Les Miserables completely like she surprisingly did with The Dark Knight Rises, except for the exceptional performance by Jackman as Jean Valjean. Give him an Oscar, too. (Poor Daniel Day Lewis. He also deserves an academy award. How about a tie?) I apparently liked Russell Crowe better than many. Javert is an extremely hard role to play opposite the heroic Jean Valjean. Crowe is one of the few with the kind of acting talent, strength and dominating spirit needed for the part. But, except for ""conversational"" singing and the superb solo near the end, I would agree his ""live"" singing under Director Hooper's revolutionary guidelines (pun not intended) was not as effortless as it was for Hathaway, Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, and others.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"If you love the story, you won't be disappointed with this movie.","Les Miserables is often called France's national story, but it's a story the whole world loves. So, its story's a winner, but what does this movie bring to its telling?All the key elements of the musical have been kept. The movie does add two things at the start that the play could not. Views of the French countryside let us see how far the government could reach to continue hounding Jean Valjean. More importantly, Hugh Jackman shows us a dirty, wounded beast of a man. Jean Valjean's papers labeled him a dangerous man, and his injured spirit and anger made him more dangerous than even he knew. This makes the transformation by kindness that much stronger.This movie also brings in a tad too many shots of singing heads. Cinematography should be something you notice only after watching the movie. I noticed it, but this wasn't enough to derail my enjoyment as I watched. This movie develops the story at a good pace: moving along without rushing things.Some have criticized the vocals. I'll admit, if this movie was ""Javier Sings,"" it would have fallen short of a good experience. On the other hand, with Russell Crowe's force of presence, his raw vocal style complements his performance. Overall, the staging, the pacing, and the acting enforce the drama of its music.Les Miserables is one of the great stories of the human spirit, and this movie delivers its full impact.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Quite Well Don, But......","I'm at odds with myself. Did I like this movie because it is a really good movie, or am I so wired into the music that I'm no longer objective. When the 25th anniversary video came out, I couldn't wait to get it. I was not disappointed. I had seen the stage play a couple times and listened to the Original Cast album countless times. The concert was terrific. If I had to, I'd say I would prefer it to this movie. Yet it is apples and oranges. Les Miserables has been done so many times, but in dramatic form. There are relatively new versions as well as the 1940's version. My eighth grade teacher played a piece of one of them called ""The Bishop's Candlesticks"" where Jean Valjean commits his life to paying back the old man. We had read this chapter and it was kind of cool to talk about. This is a very nice version of both play and musical. It is stunningly visual, recreating the world of the rebels, trying to face off against insurmountable odds. The casting here is excellent, though I wonder how these people would handle the theatre stage. Anne Hathaway is probably one of the saddest presences in all of movie history. She sings the saddest of songs and hands the raising of her daughter to a man she barely knows. Russell Crowe is Javert and he sings with emotion and intensity (though much less operatic than the role usually is). Hugh Jackman has the versatility to play the man who must face his god and pay a price to the law. He has a very nice voice though at times it's hard to imagine him aging as he does. I looked forward to this film and I felt good about seeing it. There is spectacle and fear; everything is truly operatic. It worked for me.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Commoner's View,"""Les Mis"" was anything but miserable! From the opening note to the credit line the Acting was an impeccably forceful, gritty, masterpiece. Not that screen actors would present, or even mostly possess, the illustrious vocal prowess of many, many famed stage performances of this; however, the raw, emotional, realness of these vocal performances propelled the characters to highest rarely seen in any venue. The only peculiar vocal performance, obviously, was that of Russell Crowe, who gave the biggest risk to his celebrity and popularity. In my opinion, however, he will have grown tremendously in his further acting for the enormous amount of emotional fortitude this role required, and also to have had to sing directly into Hugh's face most of the time. The endeavor will outweigh the performance. Hugh...Hugh, Hugh, Hugh. What rare, magnanimous, awe you have inspired. This is your moment that will pale the rest of your career. The scarcity of this level of perfection is extreme, and you have achieved such. This is what the purity of entertainment and acting is about. Anne, your multitudes continue to change and amaze viewer's imaginations. A short but powerful statement. Amanda Seyfried provided a needed sweetness and charm and Eddie Redmayne showed both his vocal power and deep emotional nuance. Samantha Barks performance was particularly moving also. New fav duo SBC and HBC tickled the dark and sarcastic, comical child in those of us that always love them for it, as they commonly do. This film can be summarized by three main points: a beautiful artistic vision, viciously bold directing, and irreligiously brilliant acting. Not a must see, but a must experience film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not even for musical lovers,"I'm a big musical fan, but this (the 11th film iteration of the book with ever how many of those as musicals), as I suspected is a one and a half song wonder. The lyrics are good enough, but for most of the movie, all of the dialogue is set to musical notes placed in the score with a shotgun. Add to that the the subject matter, class warfare between snobs and ""the miserables"" with their hands out and chips on their shoulders. The only one I really liked was the little token French Oliver who was sharp as hell and had spunk. Anne Hathaway and ESPECIALLY Amanda Seyfried have superb voices, but the rest were only so so, including Samantha Barks who probably gets some sympathy points for her character.I think this franchise gets a lot of support from people (many of whom were applauding at the end), because it makes them feel that by doing so they're doing something for the poor. I'm just glad this wasn't a theater production where I'd have had to endure the endless encore applause with the audience and the cast all making each other feel good, thinking the story applies to modern Western Civilization in some way.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables would score Oscar as the ace-flick :p,"After finishing for the second time, my feeling is like being marooned in the nineteenth century-France by the elegance of Les Miserables. English Literature student, Tom Hooper made an accomplishing task to choose and direct the eminent novel Les Miserables. He perfectly transformed the story into the musical narratives with bravery. Two Aussies, Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe were as always splendid in their roles---protagonist Jean Valjean and antagonist Javert. Especially as Hugh's magnitude of acting was too grand; it must be the 2nd mightiest leading characters in 2012 after Daniel Day Lewis. Anna Hathaway, in her little but the most catchy-tragic appearance, won all hearts and emotions and would win surely the Oscar in best supporting female role too :p Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter also glowed to render comical relief brilliantly :p Amanda Seyfried and Eddie were just pitch- okay with their performances. The cinematography, OSTz, costumes, society of that period, French Revolution setting----all came as well- crafted. In my notion, if Oscar were not biased with the American sentiments around ""Lincoln"", Les Miserables would score Oscar as the ace-flick :p",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great story. Too much singing,"A decent movie set in times around the tragic history of France. The film has a great cast and hearing some of them sing like Russel Crowe was pretty good. There's one massive problem with the movie and that's that it's super long and there is no talking through the movie, it's all singing (or sing talking) and this can get tiring. One of the reasons the movie is so long probably is cause of the overuse of singing. The film did a good job at showing various every day people characters in France at the time showing a range of stories. The story was pretty good and shouldn't have been a musical or not as much of one. Anne Hathaway had a big singing scene which is the most popular song from the film and the performance and the rawness of that singular shot was powerful to that story and to the story of the women back then. Overall it's decent, just too much singing and too long due to that.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Hollywood at its best - ruining the great musical,"Being in love with the actual Les Mis musical, and having seen it 5 times on Broadway I was disappointed with the movie adaptation. Here are the list of really irritating things in the movie:Singing while sobbing and crying - Seriously, every other song is sung through tears. At some point instead of sympathizing with the character, you want to kill him or her for ruining the song. Can you guys cry first, and then sing? This is a musical - songs are important!Too many closeups - I don't understand the reason behind showing an actor's face occupying 2/3 of the screen (and we're talking large screen in the movie theater) and blurring the background. Especially when the character is moving and the only thing we see is again the giant face. Should be great for dentists but for the rest of us, it's just annoying.Way too much suffering effects throughout the movie. Everyone suffers all the time. Cheap special effects are used to intensify the suffering - why is there always rain and their faces wet, why are they always crying? It's the audience that should cry out of sympathy. Instead, most of the time their artificial suffering is laughable.The set and placement of the actors. This musical should not be about showing off the set. Why show three-tiered barrier in the water, why walk around the gargoyles, why those telescopic shots that zoom up in the sky? Do we actually need all those ships in the beginning?Music quality. This is a musical. Almost all of the lines are sung - singing should be taken seriously. Compare this to the ""25th anniversary of Les Mis in concert"" and you'll see that every song is performed significantly worse then the concert production. If your actors can't sing, hire different actors. Their sex appeal is not that important here.Overall, major disappointment. Wishing the musical production to be back.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Without a doubt, one of the best and most beautiful film I've ever seen.","I was speechless.I would gladly kiss the feet of Tom Hooper for this film. Ignore all the trolls. It wasn't boring, it wasn't badly made, it was pure brilliance.I was in shock at how amazing the film was, not just the actors and the songs, but the camera work and the set was just as beautiful. The whole audience in a full screening gave a standing ovation which I've never seen before.I would even go as far as saying that it is one of the greatest and most life changing films. I honestly can't understand why anyone would hate it. Everyone needs to see this film. You will never witness something more amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Les Miserables (2012) A HUGE treat!,"Having only seen one previous film version (1935ish), I am delighted to report this version is enthralling and moving! Plan to bring Kleenex!! My husband has had no experience with either book or film version and had only a mild problem with following the story line. If anyone is planning to go without any previous experience with this story -such as my husband- my suggestion is to allow the story to lead and the main story line will make sense! Music is extraordinarily moving, actors portray the emotions of the specific scenes exquisitely and the background scenery allows the one viewing the film to feel and be involved! So many times background scenes maim or injure the believability of the film, but this movie background does NOT!! I was so engrossed in the film, I found myself leaning forward and having lost all tract of time!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Incredible,"Les Miserables had been my most anticipated for several weeks now. I've never seen the stage musical, but I did read the novel because of the film's hype. I also barely see any musicals, and the amount that I have seen in my life could probably be counted in less than two hands. I will try to put out all my thoughts on this, so please bare with me.I've heard countless of endless criticisms of two particular aspects. The first of them is Tom Hooper, and how uninspired his directing was, how sloppy, how dull, and how plain bad it is. The reason being because of the close-ups, of him allowing the camera to be way into the actors' faces, not allowing the material to breathe. I did expect it to be a little annoying, but I am honestly surprised at all of the exaggeration. The only real time it felt awkward was Valjean's Soliloquy. After that, it either worked very well or there really were no extreme close ups. Examples of some songs being unedited is Fantine's I Dreamed a Dream and Eponine's On My Own, both of which stay in the characters' faces. But the camera is never stationary besides very few scenes, and both scenes work extremely well. Aside from that, all of the countless criticisms of the camera not showing anything else besides close-ups is so not warranted. If anything, I think Tom Hooper makes the film work well, and he actually has more control of this than The King's Speech.The other point of criticism is one of the cast members, Russell Crowe. The biggest criticism is that he has a horrible voice. Again, I don't see many musicals, but I thought Crowe had one of the most satisfying voices of the cast. It worked extremely well with his character, and that's because Crowe plays Javert with such a stoic approach, but it makes Javert all that more menacing and sympathetic throughout the film's story. Completely fascinating and engrossing performance from Crowe, and probably the MVP of the film. I wouldn't have expected that at all. The biggest reason I bought into the hype for this film was because of Anne Hathaway. I admit, I have seen the teaser trailer and clips of her in the film countless of times, and perhaps that's why I was a bit underwhelmed? Don't get me wrong, Hathaway is great, but also gives the most calculated performance of the film. It's all rather, I don't know, obvious? Still, I feel completely wrong for even pointing out anything because as a whole, she's a success if anything. On the other hand, Samantha Barks gives a performance in a different vein to the rest of the cast members. There's a true sense of despair in her that doesn't feel rehearsed, a true sense of wonder and longing that she conveys in spirit with just one look. In a way you can tell she's not an experienced film actor but I think she helps her character's limited screen time very much, and as a whole is one of the most memorable and sympathetic characters. Redmayne and Tveit both have amazing voices, and both do their characters complete justice. Redmayne is completely heart- breaking and his solo one of the most powerful in the film. Cohen and Carter bring in a lot of much needed lightness to the picture, and I think their characters remain much needed in the span of it all. Hugh Jackman is also a force to be reckoned with, carrying the picture brilliantly and never missing a note in his acting, even when his singing occasionally falters.The criticisms of Crowe and Hooper aren't just incredibly bewildering to me after having seen it, but so are the countless of critical reviews. This has its fair share of detractors, with many of the criticisms calling it just completely bombastic and unshamelessly and endlessly sentimental, to the point that it pleads for emotion from the audiences. I had read the novel and knew the story and so I expected that, but while it's moving, it never feels as overbearing as many critics said.Overall, I already feel like I want to rewatch this, but it's definitely satisfying and one of the best films of the year, if not the best. At the same time however, there was so much hype and endless anticipation on my part that it feels like I won't be able to fairly grade it until a rewatch. Perhaps that's why I seemed to feel somewhat different to what nearly all were saying about the film, expecting exactly that what I had heard (for example, Hooper's direction and Hathaway's extraordinary performance). I somehow loved this a lot, but at the same time am fairly cautious on what I want to say about it as a whole. But it worked, incredibly engrossing film and a true movie experience.",,Anonymous,History
Worth the watch,"The 1980 musical once again comes to the screen in ""Les Miserables"", featuring an all-star cast and from the director of ""The King's Speech."" 16 years after the French Revolution, Jean Valjean (played by Hugh Jackman) is released on parole after nearly two decades of slavery by Inspector Javert (played by Russell Crowe). He is offered shelter by the Bishop of Digne, but steals his silver during the evening. After being caught by authorities, though, the Bishop deceptively informs them that the silver was given as a gift, and secures Valjean's release. Touched by the Bishop's grace, Valjean makes an incredible redemption, promising to start a new and better life.Eight years later, Valjean becomes a factory owner, but is still living in fear of Javert. One of his workers, Fantine (astonishingly played by Anne Hathaway), is discovered to have given birth to a child out of wedlock, and is sending money to her illegitimate daughter, Cosette. When she is dismissed by the foreman, she is left with no other choice but to become a prostitute.Hathaway then gives us the performance of her career as she sings ""I Dreamed a Dream"" in one long close-up that blew everyone away at her audition alone; a heart-wrenching and mesmerizing single act that must be seen to be believed. Goodness knows she deserved the Oscar for this one.What's more impressive is that despite her character's significance, she's not in the film for very long. Javert, now a police inspector, arrests Fantine, but Valjean intervenes and takes her to the hospital. As she dies, Valjean promises to be a father to Cosette. He then flees with her from Javert.The only characters I didn't care for were the couple whom Cosette lives with before going to be with Valjean (played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). I guess they're supposed to be comic relief, but I just didn't find it all humorous how the man continually mistakes Cosette's name. Otherwise, the first act of this film is compelling and had me allured by the story.The second act, however was disengaging. It takes place nine years later when Cosette is a young woman (now played by Amanda Seyfried) and has found a love interest. The characters are less developed and the plot suddenly shifts into a war story when the Parisians revolt. Frankly, I began to lose interest.The film makes a comeback, however, in the wonderfully executed third act. For those who haven't seen the movie, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say, one part made me think of Judas.95% of the dialogue in the film is sung. You'd think that would mean very talented musical actors are necessary. It does not. Russell Crowe wasn't very good, and Hugh Jackman sounded a bit raspy, but somehow, it didn't seem to matter. (Anne Hathaway was excellent, though) This was a tough movie to rate, but I finally awarded it a strong 7/10. It was worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
They sing every word!,"First off, I want to do a mini review for all the non-musical fans out there: Musicals aren't for everyone. Furthermore, it is my opinion that ""Les Miserables"", while being the most internationally well regarded musical in history, is also the most inaccessible musical for most novices. So, I cannot in good conscious recommend that anybody, who is not already a fan of musicals, or this particular sweeping and grandiose musical, go see ""Les Miserables"".With that said, the following is my review for the people who are probably going to see ""Les Miserables"", despite anything that I have to say: Assuming that you are already familiar with the epic identity crisis story of Jean Valjean in 19th-century France, I will be skipping the synopsis rundown all together. ""Les Miserables"" features a star studded cast, the likes of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, in the role he was born to play and is absolutely superb in, Russell Crowe playing Javert, Valjean's adversary, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, who is also quite excellent here, showing off her exceptional singing voice as she nails ""I Dreamed a Dream"", Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, who add some much needed levity as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, who despite his age, has one of the best singing voices of the lot. OK, it's true that not everybody here can sing, i.e. Seyfried who seems very pitchy and Redmayne, who has one of the weirdest singing voice I've ever heard. But Jackman, who is clearly in his comfort zone and can sing this musical under any condition (even waist deep in feces) and Hathaway and Crowe are so strong here that the others lack of stage talent can be forgiven.The one true nagging problem here (much like Peter Jackson choosing to shoot ""The Hobbit"" in 48 fps) is director Tom Hooper's choice to record all the singing live, which creates a very distracting atmosphere throughout. Allow me to explain: What Hooper actually did was fit all the actors with earpieces, which fed them the music, so only the actors could really hear the music and sing along. The problem with this is, that within the first ten minutes there arises a disjointed feeling when pertaining to the audio, making Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway all sound like they are singing either out of key or simply singing along with a track in the same way you might sing along to your favorite song in the car. Also, because maybe live acoustics aren't picked up as clearly as acoustics recorded in a studio and dubbed in later, at times the orchestra (which seemed to be layered in during post production) seemed to be lowered to the point where I felt that I wasn't getting that surround sound cinema quality that I'm used to hearing in a theater. Whatever it was, when listening and watching this film, it is very noticeable that something is audibly off as a direct result of the vocals having been recorded live.Hooper, who is sure to get Academy recognition for his masterful direction, constructs a beautifully shot, to say the least, adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel turned musical. When Hooper shows the dingy slumps of France, the scenery is so gritty that you can smell it. But aside from Hooper's work on the visuals, the fact that this film contains the best wardrobe and set design of any movie to come out of 2012, should not be overlooked.Final Thought: Is this the best picture of the year (a la ""King's Speech"" material)? No. Would this be considered as one of the top ten must see films of the year? Probably not. As great of a story as ""Les Miserables"" is, it's not without its faults, and will undoubtedly overstay its welcome with its unnaturally prolonged 15 minute conclusion; but if you are a fan there is a lot to appreciate here.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited Nicole I.

Boring,"The entire movies was sung, and quite horribly by some of the actors. In several recent successful musical to theater translations, the directors have done a great job of adapting the play/musical while retaining the integrity of a MOVIE. After a bout a half hour of nothing but singing, at times too quickly to understand the lyrics, leavings gaps in the storyline (if you have not seen the play/musical). This is simply a filming of a musical with better sets. 5 minutes in I was ready to leave. Simply put, if you want to see Les Mis, go see the musical. If you want to see a translation of Les Mis into a movie, wait 20 years for a remake. 2stars because great storyline.",2.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece!  Spectacular!,"I was ready for this film to be fabulous due to the incredible talents involved in making it. But being unfamiliar with the story before seeing the movie, I was unaware of how beautiful this story is. Jean Valjean is a hero of the first order. A man who was down and out, but when a priest offered him amazing help, it changed his life.The film is different from the stage show, or so I've read, but it actually adds some things from the book that the stage musical left out. (I've been reading about it nonstop for 3 days now.) And this film is spectacular to watch. Stunning! The cast is superb. If Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway don't win Oscars it will be a crying shame. Aaron Tveit is especially good as well.This film is quite long, yet when it came to an end all I could think was ""Gosh, I wish it was longer!"" I didn't want it to end. I will probably go see it again next week. It's THAT good.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beyond Brilliant,"In most musicals, they often try to glorify the settings, but I really liked in Les Miserables that they wanted it to look the actually setting of how it was in the decade that the movie is set. I believe that the t.v. show The Fugitive(1963-1967) was a little inspired off this.The actors are fantastic here, Hugh Jackman really shines here, so was Russell Crowe, but Anne Hathaway really blew me away, she really felt bad for her, she gave a good acting job through singing, I hope she won't be missed by the Oscars, If she is I'll be very angry. Amanda Seyfried is alright, and Sacha Baron Cohen lightens up the movie, the moments when he comes in the film. The setting is perfect, so is the actors in there roles, this is the best film of 2012.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The worst thing is the singing all along the whole movie!,"I saw once an older version (1958) of this one with Jean Gabin on TV and was astonished that I could like such kind of movies. Dramas I mean as usually I do not like them. But the classic one had a wonderful coherent story line. Good actors and all fitted together. Here it is a different thing. The worst thing is the singing all along the whole movie! I mean common' people what's that?! And then such horrible singing, especially from Russel Crowe. I was very surprised to see him, specially him, when you have seen him in Romper Stomper and Gladiator and then this?! Strange, really strange experience. If there wasn't the singing I think I would have liked it more. Also I was surprised to see Sacha Baron Cohen in this one. If you consider that normally he plays in a complete other kind of movies (Borat, Br√ºno) which I like much more. But he played well and funny.",,Anonymous,History
A romantic musical set against French Rebellion.....,"""Les Miserables"" is fully narrated as a musical with almost all the dialogues sung and reminds of the 60s musicals like ""Oliver"" or ""My fair Lady."" From the maker of The Kings Speech, Les Miserables also charts a historical story set in the background of relationships, love, care, and humanity, which comes as a great feast for your eyes through superb cinematography and performances, with a small but a winning performance from Anne Hathaway as a prostitute, Hugh Jackman as a runaway parole, and Russel Crowe as a ruthless policeman. Set as a musical stage play, the film succeeds in its depiction of historical details and character development. However, the over doing of song sequences and over length of the movie certainly creates a distraction and takes away certain leverage from the film. But overall, the film is still impressive at instances and singing is also good. Anyway, I feel liking of this musical would be to the taste of the individual viewers. For me, the film was still a visual treat ; and at instances felt good with the narration and performances.Rating : 2 stars out of 4",6.0,Anonymous,History

Very well done,"I saw Les Miserables on Broadway many years ago - it was a stunning musical. Saw this movie tonight and was very impressed. Clearly, a compromise was made between singing and acting and, for the most part, I was happy with it. The cinematography and visual effects are great. The sets and costumes are great. The acting is great. The directing is very good - I do think some minor mistakes were made (would love to be able to ask the director about some of them). The vocals ranged from very good to disappointing.I believe Russell Crowe as Javert was a mistake. While visually he is an appealing Javert, the vocals were too weak to justify this casting decision. Javert's final number was a great disappointment for me - a powerful song that Crowe could not deliver.Other vocal pieces were also muted, but they were justified by magnificent acting performances that could not be achieved without compromising the vocals. These are interpretations I can live with, although I think many of the vocals from Marius were too high in tone (I think I would have cast him differently).I thought the performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks were outstanding. Strangely, I also particularly liked Colm Wilkerson as the Bishop.All things considered, this an excellent production, and I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Singing belongs on stage,"This movie is good, but isn't great. My only problem with this movie was the ""musical on screen"" thing, and as that took up 90% of the movie, I didn't think it was that great.The cinematography is superb. Very good camera work, one of the best features of the movie.Acting is also superb. Emotional, dedicated performances from most of the cast. Dialogue is good (even though there was barely any of it)Soundtrack of course was excellent. Some very good numbers in there, although there are some moments in the film that would've been better suited as dialogue, instead of a cappella singing.If this film was just a film (not a musical) I probably would've loved it. I just didn't really enjoy the constant singing on screen. Only two songs actually suited their role on screen, the rest just seemed a bit weird in a movie. I probably will much prefer this in a theater.The scenes with dialogue, or just music and no singing were the best, but they all came to about 15 minutes in total. I just wish there was more of it, instead of four songs in a row with no dialogue between them.If you like the concept of musicals on screen, this is great. If you don't, should probably avoid it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing synchronization,"I was startled when I saw Les Miserables. Amazing synchronization. This movie was unique, everyone agrees. Actors were spot on, every actor played and did a fine job. The music and its placements were beautiful. The only major problem this movie had was its story. The real story was improvised and that had an immense effect on the script, hence limiting its production. This movie was lengthy, but i guess that is how it was supposed to be. Les Miserables captivated a major message, which being empowered with support. Les Miserables, no doubt will be held by the world for a long time. Movie deserves a huge crowd.

Loud but not Lavish,Loud is the first thing that comes to mind. I was really let down by this movie maybe I was expecting something completely different but overall was left feeling that this did not belong on the big screen. There were some notably stand out performances but it just didn't seem to quite gel for me. Maybe some of the characters didn't fit in. Someone really needs to tell Russell Crowe that he can not sing whether it was Hugh Jackman singing too well that made Crowe look bad I don't know but it was definitely visible. Th story moved along well but it lacked that extra kick and every time I thought it was about to ignite into something spectacular it would just slow right down again. Cinema in my opinion needs to be cinematic and as my fiend pointed out it just didn't offer anything cinematic the close ups the shaky cam and loudness of certain scenes just didn't sit well. It's a shame because for all the good the movie did show it was quickly put in its place by the poorer elements. I'd even go as far as to say was this a movie at all or was it just one large set after another trying to be a moving piece of dull theatre? Maybe the theatre is the best place for this story and the cinema should reserve the right to be a place for true cinematic art.,6.0,Anonymous,History
The Musical Without Any Music,"I have never been able to comprehend what anybody hears in this ""musical."" The score is a trite, repetitious, uninspired and unmemorable collection of chords that go nowhere and say nothing. For as many times as I have heard and seen this show, none of its music sticks in my mind's ear...and I say that as a musician. Ask me to hum a few bars of this aria or the other, and I can't. It's THAT unmemorable. The limited musical vocabulary of the composer(s) of this score is truly frightening.The score imagines itself to be more like an opera than a musical as every single line of dialog and ""song"" is intoned. I say ""intoned"" rather than ""sung,"" because song - from which singing derives - requires a melodic line which rises and falls, and which reinforces the text being sung. Much of Le Mis is sung on a single tone, extended speech, as it were, that grows boring in very quick order. It's like a trip to an old Roman Catholic church where all of the monks were unfortunately monotones. I have visions of the composer writing a single note as a placeholder for 15 pages of music, with the idea that he'll come back later and write the actual melody...only he never did!This music is ghastly stuff! It's The Emperor's New Clothes in musical guise. To quote Gertrude Stein, ""there's no there there"" when it comes to the music.And so along comes this movie which drops this horrible, uninteresting score into the hands of a bevy of actors who couldn't sing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" were a gun put to their heads. There is more awful singing per minute in this movie than in any other musical in history. Much has been made of the director insisting that his actors actually sing their intonations on set, rather than syncing to a prerecorded soundtrack. BAD IDEA, because what we as an audience get to witness are the contortions and physical agonies many of these ""singers"" go through to emit the simplest of musical thought. This is not art. This is the amateur hour, a hack show of, well, epic proportions.Singers who actually know how to sing ""give their all"" NOT through convoluted and obviously painful and visible tensions in the throat and body, but by having a singing technique that allows them to produce their basic sound freely, with emotion and drama added to what is, in fact, a balanced and easily produced sound. Of course, the masses see this physical distress as a singer ""giving their all,"" rather than what it actually is - ie: a singer struggling against themselves to produce the effect they desire. Can one imagine admiring an athlete for whom simply putting one foot in front of the other in a foot race was the hardest thing to do in life? No, we'd say ""that person is an amateur who hasn't a clue as to what it means to run a race."" Yet in this 2012 version of Les Mis, we are supposed to praise amateurs for their INABILITY to sing. Pathetic.But does it matter? The truth is that one could drop the finest singers in history into this ""musical,"" and they would still be stuck performing the musical equivalent of singing the phone book.Dreadful, dreadful stuff. The stuff of adult nightmares, in fact.Were there a ""zero"" rating available, I'd give it to this turkey.",1.0,Anonymous,History

A missed opportunity.....,"I had been looking forward to seeing this from the moment the trailers were released and while there were a lot of positives (most of which gushing reviewers have covered many times over) but it was ultimately a little disappointing.The biggest problem for me was that everything was robbed of context making it hard to connect with the characters. The framing is reminiscent of a film that has been badly cropped for television! Most of the musical numbers are close up head shots... all well and good but you never really feel that the characters exist in a era that has a profound effect on them and gives them an emotional connection with that same world. There are very few long shots and those that there are are disappointing or fleeting. The editing goes from non-existent in the main numbers to a bit choppy the rest of the time with little in between. It could have been epic but instead they have managed to take something relatively small scale (the stage production) and made it feel smaller and a lot more cramped. They should have opened up Victor Hugo's visions of France but instead it feels like you are getting a glimpse through half drawn curtains.The passage of time is also poorly dealt with, condensing the whole production into a slightly frantic affair. I think complaints of its slow pacing are dues to that fact that (despite a few genuinely compelling performances) you might not really care about the characters. There is little evidence of the true oppression and hardship besetting the world the characters live in due to the 'singing heads' nature of the camera work. A few more minutes setting the various scenes would have helped the pace rather than hinder it.All that said it is entertaining and there are some very good performances, the lighting is generally good as is the digital grading (not too severe for the most part).7 out of 10 from me as I appreciate the live vocal technique used and it was a reasonable (if slightly frustrating) trip to the flicks. Don't go expecting great cinematography though.......",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent - An honorable tribute to the musical,"After years of waiting, Les Mis the movie is here. Excellent tribute to the musical. I have seen musical twice. I am not going to explain the plot, just commenting on the technicals.Great Points: Movie is long, seems to have all songs and some I don't remember from the musical and the cast soundtrack. The twists and turns of the plot were easier to follow than the musical. ( I have ADD) Hugh Jackman is perfect for Jean ValJean. It looks like he starved himself to shoot the opening scenes, then gained weight for the rest of the movie. Voice is great. Film showed the gritty of France's poor during this historical era. I guess they did not have to spend a lot of the budget on makeup or soap or hair dressers. Scenery was great as well, gritty and clean when it needed to be. Cinematography was lots of head shot of the singers with blurry background. kind of like an antique camera. Since it is a musical, it worked. Sacha and Helen Bonham were very good as the innkeeper and wife, but I was expecting a little more comedy relief. Also, Sacha started with French accent at beginning but ended up with a Cockney accent at the end of the film. I liked Anne Hathaway's solo, lots of emotion and very good voice. I know she has received a lot of bad press on her performance.Not so good points: I love Russell and he is a respected character in many movies, but I could not accept him singing. I kept seeing him as Gladiator or Capt. Aubrey. He did ride a horse like a pro.Movie is long, so see with empty bladder.Hope you enjoy it as well as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,History

There was way to MUCH singing, would have been better if at least half of it were just talking. Phantom was also singing when the time was right, but there was half of it just speaking too.

An engaging musical filled with emotion,"""Les Miserables"" (2012) is certainly the most musical of musicals I've ever experienced. This famous Victor Hugo story has been adapted countless times. This ambitious film version features a wide range of characters and the story is told almost entirely through song. I did not have a problem with the highly active cinematography and film editing. Some have criticized the film for excessive camera movement and film editing. ""Les Miserables"" has a large scope with many characters. The camera is always moving in for close ups of characters singing. It's an entirely different experience than a stage musical version, where an audience views the story on a large scale. I agreed with the active camera work of the film, to emphasize the emotions of all the characters. There are a couple of comical characters, which I felt weakened the impact of the film. ""Les Miserables"" is very much a drama, one about love, honor and redemption. For those who dislike musicals or admire stage musicals, this film version of the famous Victor Hugo story might seem overly long and excessive with emotion and song. I had no problem with it's 157 minute running time. It's a big story that requires significant length to best be told. What's unusual about the making of this film is all the actors are singing live on camera, without post dubbing. Anne Hathaway's strong performance is certainly one of the highlights of the film, in addition to the directing, music score, art direction, costumes and makeup.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic,Best Film Musical I've seen in a very long time. Jackman is wonderful.,10.0,Anonymous,History
A really stunning movie.,"While I heard of Les Miserables, I never actually knew what it was about or had seen it in the movies or watched a play. After seeing previews and trailers for this movie, I became interested. Now I have to get my hands on the older movies.I love plays and musicals, such as The Phantom of the Opera and Evita. I knew I would love this too and I did. 2 hrs was a perfect length of time to tell a complete story and trust me it doesn't feel as long once you get involved. You actually want to see what happens next. Like I said, I didn't know the story going into it, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I fell in love with it.I also read what the cast had to go through to play convincing and genuine roles. That is a level of dedication that is so rarely done on film. It truly is an artwork and the actors/actresses are using their voices, talents and physical self to perform art. Its so rare to have a masterpiece put on screen.Les Miserables was done so well that it seemed to flow seamlessly and for a second you forget that you're in a movie theater, or that you're seeing someone on screen that maybe played in another movie you know.I definitely recommend you seeing it if you haven't already. Even if you aren't a big musical fan, you'll develop an appreciation of it after seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I liked the actors and story,"I didn't know anything about this story before watching the movie. I thought it was good. All of the songs weren't great, but they were good and told the story. Everyone sings in this, there is very little talking, all the story is told in song. The only negative thing I could say is the story is so depressing. People do not get happy endings in this movie.I thought Russell Crowe was excellent and probably didn't win awards since he has won them in previous films. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter had the best roles. They were the comedic relief and very funny. They just had great characters. And I didn't think Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar. She was OK, but only in a very small role as her character was only in the very beginning. I just didn't think the role was strong enough to win awards.FINAL VERDICT: If you like musicals, it's a must see. If you want a decent story, then this is a good choice too.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good film, one glaring problem.","The film is a very well done piece, the music is truly top notch, however while listening, you will notice one glaring issue, Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is a pretty damn good actor, he can bring a sense of badass to just about any character from a Professor to Noah, however he can not sing worth a damn. When Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing talk to each other, it's like listening to a Broadway actor trying to teach a high school student how to do it. Russell Crowe gave a performance which was terrible, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway deserve better as actors, especially Hugh Jackman who had to interact with Crowe the most. I am a huge fan of Russell Crowe as an actor, this movie was a bad choice on his part.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Adaptation That's Not For Everybody,"As a precursor to this review, it should be noted that for me, seeing a movie made from a stage play is quite like seeing a movie made from a book--if you loved the original, you will nitpick the movie to death because it doesn't hold to your images and love for the original. That said, 'Les Miserables' as musical movie is pretty darned good. The visual effects of Parisian poverty and the 'miserable' life of many of the characters does in fact add an element of reality to the movie that the theater can't give us, and Tom Hooper certainly did his best to convey the image of a time and place where life truly didn't seem worth living to the masses of destitute French citizenry. For my own taste, some of the scenes were a bit too stylized, and Fantine's time among the working girls seemed more art than drama, but on the other hand, the scenes of the students and the barricade were truly magnificent, as were the sewer moments. It was great to see Colm Wilkinson in the role of the Bishop after having seen him as Valjean in London. Magnificent performer! As for the acting and singing. . .I did not expect much from Hugh Jackman but will readily admit: Boy, was I was wrong on that one. Jackman may not have the vocal range of Wilkinson or Alfie Boe, but I certainly came away believing he WAS Jean Valjean. Splendid performance that really carried the character and the story throughout. Eddie Redmayne was an excellent Marius, and Samantha Barks gave a good rendition of Eponine. After that, the rest of cast--Ann Hathaway included--were admirable, but not outstanding. I can only believe Hathaway won her Academy Award on the basis of cutting her hair and looking extraordinarily pitiful in one song. Baron-Cohen as Thenardier was a huge miscast. Steve Martin could have done better. As a visual experience, Les Miz The Movie was quite a treat. I have to wonder though. . .if you had not seen the stage play and were not already familiar with the story, how in the world would you be able to follow what was going on? It's terribly difficult to identify what is happening with all the characters when all dialog is sung, and it's hard to match operatic vocals with the tremendous visual impact on the screen in front of you. Be that as it may, this was a superb movie, and well worth anybody's time.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Great Historic Film  Not To be Misssed,"Les Miserables is the best movie I've seen this year As great as the Broadway show was, the film is better, more action the closeups. etc The cast is excellent HUGH JACKMAN should receive an Oscar for his performance as should Anne Hathawy wonderful performances Russell Crowe is excellent as well though his voice doesn't stand up to the others Auduence broke out in applause several times (rare in a NJ theater) After Hathaways moving performance "" I Dreamed A Dream"" "" and ""Master of The House"" ( Sascha Cohen , Helen Bonham Carter hysterical,) and for Hugh Jackmans performance of ""Bring Him Home""At the end received a standing ovation.. Long yes 3 hrs, never boring not a bad moment in film beautifully directed by Tom Holland and photographed..

Better than my great expectations.,"I saw ""Les Miserable"" at noon on Christmas Day with my wife & grown son in a movie theater where well-dressed waiters brought sparkling water to our seats to go along with our hummus and eggplant dip. It was a much better & pricier film venue than we usually patronize, but it seemed appropriate, given our extraordinarily high expectations for the film. And besides, it's near my brother's home, where we spent Christmas.I did my homework preparing to see ""Les Mis"" critically, having spent dozens of hours singing along with various stage company soundtracks, and several thousand tickets at The Fabulous Fox over the last 20+ years. I downloaded the film's soundtrack a few days before Christmas, prompting a few snarky Facebook postings question Russell Crowe's contributions. I once even got a couple of hundred pages into an English translation of Victor Hugo's masterpiece (too many French names to keep up with, it turned out missed the music too much to read all the way through it). I read up a bit on France's June rebellion of 1832.At the end of the day, several things about ""Les Mis"" exceeded my expectations. Hugh Jackman & Anne Hathaway were even better than I anticipated. Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne were especially outstanding. Colm Wilkinson was delightful as the Bishop of Dinge. Amanda Seyfried & Helen Bonham Carter were pleasant surprises. Sacha Baron Cohen surprised me by putting his own effective spin on Thenardier. Many, many others made their old familiar roles fresh & new.My big shock was the success of Russell Crowe's performance. In the vacuum of the soundtrack, his voice seemed outclassed by his cast mates. On screen, however, his Javert was multidimensional & most satisfying. I've been a Russell Crowe fan since ""Gladiator,"" & I was excited when his casting was announced, but after hearing the soundtrack I identified two big mistakes in this film's production: Hiring Russell Crowe, & not firing him after his first day on the set. He made it work with his screen presence, though.Not all the changes worked for me. Creative makeup designs tried to evoke the disease & the squalor of 19th century France, but came out alarmingly close to 21st century zombie apocalypse.All in all though, ""Les Mis"" is a winner. Les Mis devotees & musical theater aficionados have something new to love. If musical theater is your thing, this is your movie. If you are a musical theater neophyte & this film doesn't turn you on to the genre, don't waste any more money trying to catch the bug. This one's as good as it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Master of the House,"Greetings again from the darkness. One of the most anticipated films of the year is the first from director Tom Hooper since his Oscar winning ""The King's Speech"". It also happens to be based on one of the true literary classics by Victor Hugo (first published 1862). Oh yes, it is presented as a true musical ... the dialogue is sung and story advanced through forty-something songs. The latter feature gives it more of an opera feel than the stage version I saw more than 20 years ago.The biggest question and curiosity going in was whether the cast of top notch movie stars could hold their own vocally. Sure, Hugh Jackman (Jean Valjean) is a Tony winner, Anne Hathaway (Fatine) has some Broadway chops of her own, Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) sang in ""Mamma Mia"", and Russell Crowe (Javert) has toured with his own band. But this is a whole new challenge, as director Hooper decided to have the actors sing ""live"" during filming, providing a more intimate feel to the film. Throw in two exceptionally strong vocal performances from Eddie Redmayne (Marius) and Samantha Barks (Eponine) and only the harshest critics will claim the singing disappoints.""Seinfeld"" fans will enjoy the comic relief from thieving innkeepers Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as they take advantage of their customers while belting out ""Master of the House"". It's pure joy to hear Colin Wilkinson's voice as The Bishop who offers Valjean his chance for redemption. Mr. Wilkinson is legendary as the original Valjean in the London and New York stage versions from the mid-80's.There were a few things that distracted me at times. The most annoying being the incessant facial close-up on every song. This is typically a device to cover-up weak set design, but here the sets are spectacular and really capture the nastiness of 19th century France. And while I certainly enjoyed Ms. Hathaways' show-stopping ""I Dreamed a Dream"", I found her overall acting to be quite distracting during her few scenes. Russell Crowe's physical presence perfectly captures the omnipresent Javert, though the lack of punch in his vocals prevented the boom needed in a couple of songs. Lastly, Mr. Jackman seemed to strain on the high notes in my favorite ""Bring him Home"", though again, none of these things ruined the experience for me.As with most film musicals, the best approach is just to allow the story and songs to wash over you ... don't dwell on the minor issues. Keep in mind that this is a powerful and interesting production thanks to Victor Hugo's source material. It's a privilege to enjoy a first rate presentation seen through new eyes and heard through new vocalists.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Epic,"This film has an epic and sweeping scope, with amazing cinematography and special effects that make 19th century France look larger than life. The characters and their drama are portrayed in a very compelling way that draws the audience in. The constant singing style is divisive - you either love it or hate it. I didn't mind but some of the musical sequences slowed down the pacing too much and dragged out the film's runtime.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing performances with disappointing directing,"I am a Les Mis√©rables virgin, meaning I have not seen any other performance or adaption of this story before. I was enchanted with the story, who is as hauntingly beautiful as it is sad; and I was excited to see how many wonderful actors they have managed to gather for this film. They do live up to their name and reputation - the performances of the actors are astounding and I have never had more respect of Anne Hathaway, who finally had the chance to show what an amazing performer she is. As far as acting, the only negative I can comment on is that I feel Russell Crowe was an extremely wrong choice for this role - I am sure there are plenty others who would be a lot better for this particular film. What a shame.As far as directing goes, I was disappointed how Tom Hooper didn't use more in his arsenal than close-ups and zooming in and out. Also, making the actors sing every single word (well, at least 98%) was a bit too much. I wish they would have left the speech scenes to exactly that - speech.All in all, an amazing story with -fantastic- performances, but there was room for improvement for the directing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"I liked it, but it could have been better...","Nominated for a total of 8 Oscars, it's difficult to not go into this film with ridiculously high expectations. Not only have you got Tom Hooper at the helm, whose previous film 'The King's Speech' swept up the Academy Awards just two years ago, but you've got the likes of Catwoman, Wolverine and Maximus Decimus Meridius belting out the tunes made famous by Susan Boyle. And it's a musical. A musical. How's that going to get an audience? It's just a case of ticking all the right boxes. For the women, could be the best weepy since Titanic; for the lads, well, you may need a little more convincing. But it's certainly safe to say that fans of the stage production will be wholeheartedly satisfied.Much like a subtitled film, it takes a little while to get used to the cast singing almost every single line of dialogue, and the film doesn't gradually work it in either. The opening scene is a sweeping long shot of a ship being hauled into harbour by bald and bearded convicts. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is among them; he stole a loaf of bread which resulted in a 19 year sentence. Javert (Russel Crowe) tells him that his parole has begun, making him a free man. However, when Valjean breaks his parole following a religious redemption, Javert embarks on a life-long mission to capture the elusive Valjean.Watching this is like a wave of unsubtle emotion crashing over your face for 158 minutes, but it is somewhat refreshing. In a baron cinematic landscape where 'epic' usually means a lack of character, it's comfortable knowing that Hollywood still know how to make 'em how they used to; load, vast and unashamedly sentimental. However, the constant tear-jerk emotional reactions that the film is constantly trying to provoke, especially in the second act, becomes unintentionally grating. Also, some of the songs become extremely tedious; after all it's only musical theatre, no Bizet. Not only that, but there are times when the second act seems rushed, almost as if you barely know the characters that are meeting their demise. But that is not to take away from the astonishing raw power of the first half. Anne Hathaway steals the show as Fantine, providing a lump-in-your-throat rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' caked in tears and snot. If she doesn't get the Oscar this year, there is something wrong with the system.Overall it's an enjoyable, solidly crafted movie, but it's not the weep-a-minute that so many of us were expecting. The second act doesn't live up to the brilliance of the first half, but nevertheless, it's a useful reminder that musicals are still alive and well.My Blog: www . celluloidramblings . blogspot . co . uk",7.0,Anonymous,History
So Utterly Disappointing,"You guys....... I was so disappointed with Les Mis. Like, utterly.Where to begin.....Things I liked: 1) Eddie Redmayne. His was the standout performance. While anyone could have played a bashful, smiling Brit in ""My Week With Marilyn,"" Eddie actually brought talent to this role.2) Anne Hathaway. Yes. I know. I never thought I'd say that I liked her in a movie. Let's face it: Meryl and Stanley made ""Devil Wears Prada,"" and any teeny-bopper could have been an accidental princess, but Anne's vocal talent and physical commitment to this particular role made the difference.3) Russel Crowe. Maybe it's because I had such low expectations for him going in, but he was significantly more musically accurate than Hugh Jackman. Sure, he doesn't have the lungs for the lines he has to belt at times, but at least he seemed to be able to carry a tune.Things I didn't like (Or, ""The Endless List""): 1) Hugh Jackman. Would it have killed you to sing a note? Really. It's a musical. What if Nikki Blonsky had muttered her way through ""Good Morning Baltimore"" or if Christian Bale had turned ""Santa Fe"" into a soliloquy? What a disappointment. He sang maybe 40% of the notes and only got about 60% of those right. Oh yes, and he murdered ""Bring Him Home."" That's unforgivable.2) Tom Hooper. I understand that you wanted freedom for your actors to actually act while they sing, but, see above: it's a musical. At some point you have to keep them to the score.3) Tom Hooper II. Would it have killed you to give an establishing shot? There was one of the ship at the beginning, some pretty landscape shots, and then one at the end with the barricade. But none of the close-quarters scenes where it actually matters.4) Tom Hooper III. What on earth were you doing zooming in and out incessantly in the same shot?!5) Tom Hooper IV. Now we know why people lip-synch to a pre-recorded track in a musical. Because it actually sounds good.6) Tom Hooper V. When the barricade is completely surrounded, how are the revolutionaries only being attacked from one side?7) Tom Hooper VI. Since when do canon balls only make some feathers fly around? If you're gonna bring in the canons, at least show some carnage.8) Tom Hooper VII. How were you showing hundreds of people singing but only piping through the audio of about 20 voices? Seriously underwhelming. Note for (God help us) the next time: make the music and the voices louder than the ambient sound (e.g. waves, breeze, my own heartbeat - which was very slow because it was broken).9) Amanda Seyfried. Let's face it: her vibrato sounds like she's sitting on an idling Harley. It's not pleasant. Yeah, she may have hit the high notes cleanly (except at the end of ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" where she was at least two steps flat), but her voice is weak on its best day.There's so, so much more. This had such great potential. I'm counting down the days until the remake.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing,"""Les Mis√©rables"" is a cinematic triumph that left me utterly enthralled and emotionally moved. The acting performances, led by Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, are nothing short of extraordinary, breathing life into Victor Hugo's timeless characters. The film editing masterfully weaves together the intricate narrative, capturing the raw emotions and sweeping drama of 19th-century France. The musical score, a poignant symphony of hope and despair, elevates the film to unparalleled heights. The strength of ""Les Mis√©rables"" lies in its unwavering message of resilience, redemption, and the indomitable human spirit. The cinematography paints a vivid tapestry of revolutionary fervor against the backdrop of breathtaking landscapes.

In my opinion he looked older in the chain gang scene than in the death scene. Other than those 2 complaints I absolutely loved the movie! I almost cried during the Epilogue.

I admire the photography and set pieces to this film and hats off to whoever had the courage to make it a full blown musical, the live singing gives the soundtrack reality, especially Anne Hathaways set piece (oscar on it's way) though the acoustics especially in the opening scene were a little weak and the film, like the stage version, is way too long.

"Legendary musical, decent film","An accurate way to describe Les Mis√©rables would ironically be to compare it to a music album. There are songs that you play over and over, and then there are songs that when you hear it, you hand reaches towards the skip button. There are many scenes that hit home; however, at the same time there were several parts that were superfluous. Les Mis√©rables was a film that showed little restraint, stuffing its lengthy running time with heaping measurements of grandeur. This worked for, and against it.It seems pointless to mention the soundtrack, but nevertheless, it was magnificent as expected. It's a musical. Duh. Most of the singers carried their weight. Anne Hathaway was flawless in both acting and singing, and Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, and Hugh Jackman held their own. Russel Crowe however, was the weak link. Though his acting was exceptional as usual, his vocals were mostly underwhelming. The set-pieces were breathtaking and effective, fitting the fantastical and slightly dilapidated nature of stage sets, yet grounded in the reality of film.The story itself was magnificent, with a strong thesis and an armada of interesting, well developed, and colorful characters. Many of the scenes held endless meaning and relevance to life, resulting from the moving character conflicts of redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, and working towards the future. The ideas contained in this story were so near to greatness; however, an unforeseen and unavoidable enemy stopped them short. Les Mis√©rables was a musical. Too much time was wasted on singing and pomp, eventually burying the ideas of the film. There are several instances in which an entire three to four minute song will be devoted to ""We are dishonest innkeepers."" something that could've been shown in a mere three to four seconds. To compensate, Les Mis√©rables was rushed from set-piece to set-piece in order to incorporate all the songs. There was no time for patience or subtlety because so much time was wasted on trivial information.In film I have always emphasized the importance of patience and subtlety. Though Les Mis√©rables was a grand affair worthy of the hall of fame of musicals, its grandness was so constant that the contrasts between the scenes became deluded. I was surprised by how little I was crying, as I normally do under such moving circumstances. But because no time was allotted for pondering or rising action, everything was just one big climax. It was like a parent spinning their child around playfully, but never embracing them. That kid is going to get dizzy. Grandeur most be used sparingly so that when it comes, it's actually something special.Les Mis√©rables was so was close to being great, but ultimately the choice to produce the musical adaptation of the book rather than the book itself eventually led to its demise. If it was a film, there could have been more focus in the plot leading to an increased clarity of the ideas. The musical aspect of the production only wasted time on the art of music, distracting from the art of film. It depolarized the atmosphere, dampening the power of many of the moments in the film. Les Mis√©rables is an excellent musical, but it made too many sacrifices to reach that end, ultimately hurting the film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Russell and Eddie are terrible,"What a shame that the miscasting of Russell Crowe and Eddie Redmayne should ruin a good half of the movie.A most deserving Hugh Jackman gets to show a wider audience his charismatic Broadway and West End performer side. Unfortunately he doesn't sound as powerful and resonant in this movie as he does in real life. There has been some criticism about the method of recording the voices. It becomes quite apparent in some of Hugh's songs where his voice in the movie sounds thinner and weaker than on stage. Anne gives a moving performance. Maybe they didn't need to make her look so terrible after all it is a musical.Eddie Redmayne is seriously miscast. He is not leading romantic role handsome. He is more supporting cast character actor with his slightly crooked features. His voice is limited and sounded like he had a cold. Bad choice. Aaron Tveit, a real Broadway performer is so much better a singer and has more leading man looks. They should have switched roles.Russell Crowe as expected has no singing voice whatsoever. Every time he sang it spoiled the movie and made it feel amateurish. He was completely monotonous and lacking in any emotion or passion in his singing. What were they thinking? Even if they wanted a movie star there are so many famous actors who can sing better. Or they could have done what so many prior screen musicals have done (My Fair Lady, Sound of Music) - dub his voice with a real singer.Amanda Seyfried is a competent singer and is suited to her part. Helena and Sasha are alright in their comical supporting roles as well.The battles and sets were more involving than on stage. Didn't like some of the strange camera angles and prolonged close ups. Some of the over the top cockney accents were ludicrous.If you see it for Hugh and Anne be prepared to cringe when Russell and Eddie take over. Many great musical movies of the past are changed for the better from stage to screen but in this movie they didn't improve things and that was a disappointment.

Loved it!! But I LOVE Les Mis!,"I love Les Mis. When I say I love it, I mean I know every single measure of every single song by heart. That being said, I found the ""extra songs"" to be awkward and grating. (But I don't think you would pick up on it if you don't know every single word...) Hugh Jackman portrayed Valjean very expressively and completely transported the viewer into the moment; BUT the role of Valjean requires a very adept signing voice as those songs have a lot of depth to them, Mr. Jackman just doesn't have the voice required for the part. Same thing with Russel Crowe portraying Javert. Some of the most intense, touching parts of the music were lost to less than adequate singing ability. Anne Hathaway, stole the show no doubt... However, I was also pleasantly surprised by Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, she wasn't the best ever, but was well casted and delivered quite nicely. Eddy Redmayne was a phenomenal Marius and has a surprising voice. The one role (albeit a small role) that I can't believe no one is talking about is Samantha Barks as Eponine... Wow! Filling the shoes of Frances Ruffelle was a big task (I am very biased in this area as Ms. Ruffelle is my favorite and Eponine is my favorite character)but Ms. Barks was stunning!!

Castle on a Cloud,"This film was my first encounter with the Les Miserables story, i havent ventured far from it. I have watned to read the book, but am a bit daunted by how massive it is. I also once saw a theatrical performance of it on stage. So when i review this film I review the ""Les Mis"" story. Which some may dislike... But to be quite frank im not sure how this story could be told in any better way.This film is seriously an epic. Everything is done in a grand way, from the singing and orcestra, to the awesome cinematography & camera work, and masterful set desings. This film screams beauty in every sense of the way.It is the perfect vehicle for this 'near perfect, earth moving' story.10 Stars is rare for me. For a film to be 10 stars it must leave the silver screen and into my heart, or normal life in some shadow of great importance. A 10 star film bleeds into reality in a profound way.By the very nature of this moving story, it deserves 10 stars. Its depiction of the Law, Grace, Light and Truth is unparalleled to any story on the earth today. I believe that. It is deeply moving and profound, one could and should meditate on this story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Breathtaking.,"It's not so often you see a film that leaves you speechless, the first time I saw Les Mis, that's exactly how I felt, I felt the same way upon a recent viewing.It's an incredible mix it's moving, dramatic, it's a love story, and strangely uplifting.The direction is sensational, it looks and sounds tremendous, the visuals are incredible, the filming, camera work and staging are sublime. No wonder it raked in the awards.The music is iconic, one of those CDs that lives in the car to this very day, it's so dramatic and big.The acting is impeccable, everyone plays their part, Jackman, Crow, Carter etc, Anne Hathaway however, that's one of the best performances I can think of.It's a great movie, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Jackman isn't Wilkinson. Crowe is somewhat miscast. See it anyway.,"David Letterman once said that everyone who has hosted a late-night program in the last 30 years has been trying, in vain, to be Johnny Carson. Similarly, everyone who has played Valjean in the last 30 years has been trying, in vain, to be Colm Wilkinson. Hugh Jackman is no Colm Wilkinson, but he's not really trying to be - his performance breaks out of the vocal and emotive mold that Wilkinson created for the role. It's different and, once the audience gets past that, fairly well done.Russell Crowe's singing, such as it is, will make no one forget Philip Quast or Norm Lewis (I frequently found myself wishing they had gotten Lewis, who played the role in the 25th Anniversary concert) but, taken on the merits of the acting (disregarding the singing), Crowe has a decent (not great, but decent) showing and, particularly in one scene after the second attack, stays true to Hugo's vision of the character, if not Boublil's and Schonberg's.Anne Hathaway kills and buries her Disney legacy with her turn as Fantine, which absolutely deserves every accolade it has received. It's not pretty. It's not refined. It's ugly and brutal and hard to watch (in keeping with the character and her story) and it is riveting. She has set the standard for future actresses in this role. Period.As for the Thenardiers, it's a different take than the loud, bombastic performance you see on stage, but again, they're not on stage, and it works fairly well. As well, this is the first Sacha Baron Cohen performance I've thoroughly enjoyed, and I wish he would do more things like this, and less playing with feces and calling it piercing social commentary.Speaking of doing right by Hugo, the final scene is beautifully done and pays a wonderful homage to the both the novel and the play. If it doesn't leave you at least thinking about being in tears, check your pulse.In summary: if you've seen the stage show, don't expect a line-by-line faithful adaptation of the stage show. Expect to enjoy, but not be blown away by, the vocal performances of anyone not named Anne Hathaway. But if you allow yourself to move past those limitations and be immersed in the movie, do expect to enjoy yourself, and probably to be moved to tears more than once.If you've not seen the stage show, it may help to familiarize yourself with its basics, but then the same applies.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderful musical movie,"This is the one of musical movies. Some people don't like musical movies, but actually, I like that. Some people says singing suddenly is very strange and I agree with that, but I don't care about that so much because the songs characters sing shows their feeling so well. In this movie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than usual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way they want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills. This movie shows a view of the Les Miserables world so well. We can enjoy everything about Les Miserables same as the play.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Excellent demonstration of why vocal training matters,"I finally got around to seeing this. Absolutely terrific in very many ways, but, while I do understand the marketing appeal of using big-name movie stars, this movie just goes to show you that there's a long distance between ""can sing pretty well"" and ""can handle opera."" Crowe and Jackman were definitely in the former category, in my view. (As were Cohen and Carter, but those were comic roles so they could get away with it.) Javert and Valjean are super-challenging parts, from a musical perspective; it's not just that there's a lot of singing, it's also that those are HARD, counter-intuitive tunes, and it's just really obvious when the singer is struggling to hit the notes. The only way opera is the tiniest bit credible is when the singer is good enough to persuade you that this singing thing is just the way he happens to talk, and I never thought Crowe or Jackman got there.On the other hand, they weren't on screen all the time. Hathaway, the other big-name star, totally nailed it. AMAZING voice. I had of course seen the ""I Dreamed a Dream"" clip before -- hard to avoid if you don't live under a rock -- so I knew that would be great, but her dialogue singing was just as good. She richly deserved that Oscar. And Seyfried and Redmayne and Barks were just terrific. Barks has more of a pop style than an operatic one, but I thought it worked really well. So there was a lot to love, in the singing department. And the music itself is just magnificent. I always think the ""Tonight Quintet"" section of ""West Side Story"" is really wonderful in its complexity, but ""Les Mis"" is like two and a half hours of that stuff. And great photography and locations and costuming and all the rest of it. So, 9 stars, but falls short of 10, to me, because the best you could say about Crowe and Jackman as opera singers is that they were pretty good, considering.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Admirable rather than likable,"Although I think the movie is very good, I must say I admired it more than I liked it. There are many things about it that are great, but it didn't grab me quite as much as I hoped it would, and certainly not as much as it did some of the sobbing and sniffing people sitting all around me in the theater.Some of said great things: the fantastic actors, the live singing (which I found very effective - sans Russell Crowe), the impressive sets and costumes, and the extremely catchy songs.As for why it didn't work even better for me? I think maybe it's that it seems a bit overstuffed. The original novel is one hell of a sprawling tale, and it's all a bit much for just one movie if you don't set a clear focus. There's a bit of a redemption story here, a bit of a love story there, and a bit of revolution for good measure. Focusing on just one of these might have made the movie more effective for me. I mean, it's clear that this is mostly Jean Valjean's story, but the movie seems to lose sight of him quite often to get a few more love songs and fight scenes in there.But still, I think it's well worth seeing and I'll probably have about five different songs from it stuck in my head for the next week or two.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Outstanding performances from the actors; A not so outstanding performance from the director,"First off let me preface this by saying I have never seen the stage production. Having said that I was thrilled beyond belief to see this story unfold in front of me on the silver screen. As the story progressed I continued to be unnerved by the choices in camera angles, framing and slow focus pulls. As a film student who knows what a challenge it is to achieve crisp focus in scenes and have had to cut great footage because it is too soft to use am embarrassed. I am baffled why the director made certain choices, and I am not really sure who is at fault but it prevented me from me being able to enjoy this film. If you are not troubled by out of focus shots or cramped in your face framing then you might enjoy this film. I however expect such an esteemed director to not settle for anything less than perfection and as moviegoer's we should not either. Les Mis was miserable!!",2.0,Anonymous,History
At the end of the day . . .,"I can't believe it's been twelve years since this adaptation of ""Les Mis√©rables"" was released in the cinema. I like musicals and ""Les Mis"" is one of my favourites and I do think that his adaptation is strong - though I wonder how much credit should for to Hooper and how much to Schonberg and Boublil.Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is paroled criminal, given a second chance at life by the kind acts of a benevolent Bishop. He flees and beings a new life with a new identity. Years later, Valjean is a factory owner, though is startled when Javert (Russell Crowe) who ran the prison is made chief of police in his town. Valjean adopts Cosette (Isabelle Allen / Amanda Seyfried) the daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway) who used to work for him. Years later again, and living in Paris, Cosette falls for Marius (Eddie Redmayne). But revolution is in the air and Marius is a key member of the group plotting for violent uprising.Steering away from the adaptation for the moment, the songs in ""Les Mis√©rables"" are amongst some of the most classic songs from musicals of all time. It's a sprawling adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel, full of the heart and tragedy of the time.Visually the adaptation is strong, expanding on the stage sets into lavish recreations. I think most of the singing is really good, even if the ""sing through"" aspects of the show. Russell Crowe received a lot of criticism around the films release and whilst he is a touch flat, compared to people I've seen play the role live, he doesn't disgrace himself.It's a really good adaptation of a really good show. One of the best there is.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Certainly meets the expectations!,"Apart from a few epic exceptions, I'm not into musicals, which may be the reason it took me so long to check out Les Miserables, but I finally watched it, and honestly found more than what I expected. The promising cast surely meets the high expectations from such a story and production, resulting in a very, very good musical in my opinion. Anne Hathaway was brilliant, hats off to her, yes, but no one's performance was disappointing anyway! Almost every scene was bursting with feeling (various feelings, that is), successfully reflected thanks to the director as well as the cast. Every actor obviously put a lot of effort and made their talents talk, and so it's been a pleasure to watch this version of Les Miserables. The second half was exceptionally emotional and there were quite a few scenes that blew me away. One of them certainly Gavroche, Javert and the medal (*gulps*). The flow was, however, rather slow t certain parts of the movie, but can't thinks of any other major problems with Les Miserables. All in all, I'm glad I checked it out. A goodie of the genre for sure. A 7/10 for me, only because I can't do 7.5 on IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Unfortunately . . . . disappointing,"I'm sure my expectations were too high. Les Mis is our all time favorite play - we have seen it a number of times on the stage & on videos of the play. Unlike some who were disappointed by the singing (which in the case of Russell Crowe especially) was not good - that gave the movie a dose of realism. And a number of the cast were excellent singers (A Hathaway - Sasha Baron Cohen - Aaron Tevit - and Samantha Barks) but the rest were so - so.The two highlights of the movie for me came early in the production - Hugh Jackman's great acting/singing after he is given a break by the man of the cloth - as he contemplates turning his life around - Pefection; and Ann Hatheway's ""I dreamed a dream"" after being raped (it certainly was not consensual sex). As far as I am concerned she stole the show (Susan Boyle creep back into obscurity). She acted the song while she sang it - for me the highlight of the entire movie.Unfortunately the rest of it did not measure up. In fact I was quite bored with some of the transition scenes - the director should have known that less is more. Maybe they could have kept the movie closer to 2 hours without some of these scenes which were not really needed.One good thing: they got to the crux of Valjean's issues quite quickly - I have seen a few of the plays where it takes 15 - 20 minutes (or so it seems) to get to the stirring opening chords - and on with the actual story.Now I contradict myself. Russel Crowe's problem is that he did not project the focus and determination - and self doubt that I have seen in many of the plays as Javert. And I believe the reason he did not do so was because his voice was weak - not up to it. In the play, ""Stars"" is a moment which really stirs the blood as we see how Javert sees the world - which sets up the questioning and self doubt expressed especially after Val Jean gives him a break. It it takes a butt kicking manly voice to project the certainty and power that Javert has - until the very end. Poor R Crowe could not hack it. In my opinion there was enough star power with H Jackman, A Hathaway, and A Seyfried to interest the audiences - one more star who barely sings better than I do (well - that's going a little far) was not needed - and I think put a damper on the whole movie.I'm glad I went (& only paid $5) - it is a good movie - the story of redemption is timeless - and the music is the best. Again - I just think I expected too much. DonB",7.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning,"When I first watched this movie I was a bit skeptical as to how it would turn out, after all, when a movie has to include so many famous actors and actresses in it, it generally spells disaster and the writing and directing fall so short that the movie is a train wreck, nothing short of abominable. With Les Mis, not so.Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job with his role as the incredibly conflicted Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, even though we didn't see much of her. My personal favorite character though was Javert.Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job with his part and I really enjoyed seeing a different side to Javert, not just the evil man that a lot of actors portray when they play the part. All in all I really couldn't call him a villain because he was so convinced that Valjean was the criminal and when he finally came to terms with the fact that Valjean had changed it wasn't that he just didn't want to believe it, it was that he had wasted umpteen years of his life chasing down a man who proved that everything he believed was false.The music was wonderful and some of the sets they had were breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop scene when Javert was singing Stars because it was just a really beautiful scene.The film was fairly emotional, barring the occasional moments where my father would sigh and upset the feeling of the scene, as he did not feel quite as enthused about being there as I was.The last few scenes will leave you weeping so bring some Kleenex, and don't wear eyeliner.Overall it was a fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Yes, These French People Sure Are Miserable","Director Tom Hooper clearly wants us to wallow in the realism of revolution-era France. I can think of no other reason for his making his makeup artists work overtime to make Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and an assortment of extras look as awful as possible and then stick the camera up their noses so that we can appreciate every open sore and rotten tooth in extreme closeup. There's a scene of Jackman carrying Eddie Redmayne through the Paris sewers, both covered in excrement until all you see of either of them are eyeballs, like something out of ""Predator"" or ""Rambo."" The one moment of comic relief in this angst-filled endurance test is a romp with a couple of grimy innkeepers during which the bodily fluids fly copiously. If Hooper's intention was to convince me that I never would have wanted to be alive in early-19th century France, he convinced me.The problem is, ""Les Miserables"" the musical isn't remotely realistic. It reduces one of France's many revolutions into a few power ballads and a trite romantic triangle. The characters are paper thin, and are meant to be mere stand-ins for large themes: one character represents ""goodness,"" another ""justice,"" another ""greed,"" etc. On stage, the thinness of the characters and the melodrama of the plot were easy to overlook, because the physical production was so impressive and the music so bombastic. But take the bombast away from ""Les Miserables,"" and all you're left with is a plot that seems downright silly on screen, and a bunch of characters who could be played by anyone. Hooper, in his attempt to make this a more realistic film, takes away the one thing that makes ""Les Miz"" worth watching -- the music. Oh, the songs are all there, but they're hushed and subdued, as if the orchestra were instructed not to drown out the singers (who, as I'm sure we're all sick to death of hearing by this point, sang their songs live on set). This decision, which has been used as a gimmick in marketing the film, was supposedly landed upon in order to give the actors more freedom to act. Which would be fine if there were any need for them to. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway sure got the memo, as both act the heck out of their roles, but there's only so much you can do with cardboard characters and songs that just outright tell you what the characters are thinking anyway.I don't want realism from ""Les Miserables."" I want to hear ""I Dreamed a Dream"" belted out by someone who knows how to belt out a Broadway show tune (sorry Anne). I want ""Master of the House"" to be the rousing show-stopper it is on stage rather than the dismissed restroom break it is in the movie. It's not a good sign when, at a movie's climax, when you're supposed to be moved to tears, you're instead wishing that the main character would just shut up and die so that you can get up and relieve your numb butt.Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,History

This movie was a masterpiece in a lot of ways, but I felt like the musical talent wasn't robust enough to meet the challenge. The actors that sang put a lot of passion into it, but it was stifled by their lack of true musical talent.

Imperfect yet powerful adaptation,"Les Mis√©rables is one of those huge stories that are hard to adapt into any other format other than a novel. It spans years and years, following the life of one Jean Valjean, a released prisoner that vows to turn his life around, while at the same time one of the French Revolutions is about to begin. Its themes are massive and not easily explored, given the time constraint. Add the fact that this is not an adaptation of the novel, per se, but rather an adaptation of the world famous musical based on the book. So it's pretty easy to say that the deck was heavily set against this being a good movie.How did it do? Well, I have to be honest and say that it's a heavily flawed film. Not all of the actors are well-suited for singing their lines - though oddly I didn't mind Russell Crowe all that much - the cinematography is way too in love with extreme closeups, the set pieces, while impressive, feel too cramped and the story jumps around, wanting to go over all the relevant plot details, but losing coherence in the process.And despite all that, I was moved to tears by the end of the film. Naturally most of that is due to the strength of the original story, that of a criminal turned saint earning his redemption for his past crimes. But even a masterful story can mean nothing if it's told incorrectly. And that's not the case here. The extreme closeups can be distracting, as can be the singing, but the more the movie goes on, the more you find yourself being pulled in, feeling the emotions of the characters, the despair, the joy. It's a captivating experience, one the best I've seen in years. There were moments where I had to remind myself to breathe.This movie is a rough jewel. It has raw talent to spare, but it loses some of it due to technical imperfections and poor choices. It is worth seeing, but at the same time you have to mourn what it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I was surprised that 99% of the movie was sang and I had to remind myself that it is not just a movie but an opera. I had never seen the first one, but it was surprising. The actors did a magnificent job singing with heart. To see them cry, was astounding as you could see their eyes swell up with tears and watch them stream down their faces. I will definitely be buying this movie! I love musicals anyway, but this was exceptional! I feel that Russell Crow, Hugh Jackman & Ann Hathaway definitely came alive in this. So touching.

didn't quite grasp me as it did for others....,"Went to see this on opening night with an open mind. Having never seen the play, I was really excited to see it. Based on the previews, it looked really good and the music sounded amazing.First off, I really liked the movie, however, the singing was a different matter. Although the story was very interesting, and I must admit, slow in parts, I couldn't get beyond the singing. Why the director chose to have these actors sing live is beyond me when they can't even sing in the first place.Additionally, all these close ups of the actors singing really got me against the wall. The movie was shot as if the singing was the highlight of every scene, but why on earth would you allow these so call singers to try and hit these high notes when they can't. To me, it just ruins the whole scene. The director could've easily had the actors croon to their abilities without pushing them to mess up when they had to hit the high note.That's not to say all the singing was horrible. Ann Hathaway did a decent job of singing and so did the girl who played Eponine, and also when the singing was in a group. Aside from that, Russell Crowe couldn't sing to save his life and, although, Hugh Jackman could unleash a vibrato, his singing was so off, I couldn't help but noticed it, although his acting was superb.Readers who have an ear for music will agree that the singing was mediocre at best, but if you don't, fortunately for you, the movie was all that much better. Unfortunately, for me, the singing brought the movie down to a four star. After all, this is a musical just as much as it is a story, but if the music doesn't sound good, then it takes away from the story as it did for me.Now, I'll just have to go see the play where they'll cast characters that can actually sing the part.2 cents.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"""Those who do not weep, do not see."" ‚ÄìVictor Hugo, Les Mis√©rables","I wept through much of Les Mis√©rables, and Tom Hopper, Les Mis's Director, earned every fallen tear. I wasn't alone. Everyone around me wept, and since it was a sold-out crowd, we were weeping very close to the strangers who surrounded us. It was no matter. We were all in the tragedy together. We all knew there would be pain and death, still hopeful to see what the other side of that coin held, and we felt it deep inside. I am a better person for having seen this movie.It's hard to bring a play to the screen, especially a musical. I think some of the great musicals have been ruined by the screen. Annie. Phantom of the Opera. Evita. Such disappointments. Maybe the problem with Evita was Madonna, who could never be Eva Per√≥n, but whatever the reason, it didn't work. Chicago? Don't get me started. Les Mis√©rables is better on the screen. The story lends itself to the fluidity of the scene changes, which are less disruptive in a movie. Or it might be that the way it was filmed, having the actors sing their lines on camera rather than in the studio, made it work better. I generally don't like dialogue in song, and I was worried about it before I saw the movie, but you hardly notice it. And this new method of acting with singing in tandem to acting could be the reason why.Really, it's all about Victor Hugo's masterpiece, which I have been lost in since the movie. Hugo somehow understood that the pendulum swings equally toward bad and good, and he knew how to bring that understanding to life through storytelling. The worse the bad, the greater the capability for good. The so very believable love at first sight between Marius and Cosette cannot be taken in without the hate felt by Javert toward Jean Valjean. Les Mis√©rables has all the sensations of living a truly full, human, flawed life. Love. Weakness. Strength. Hatred. Charity. Faith. Betrayal. But love is the greatest of them all.""When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love, soar."" ‚ÄïVictor Hugo, Les Mis√©rablesCan't wait to talk about the acting.Anne Hathaway, I wasn't looking forward to seeing you. Despite the hype, I find you somewhat ridiculous, and it did not occur to me you had it in you. But you do. Your scene singing perhaps one of the greatest songs written for the stage is by far the best one ever done. I am a fan forever. Hugh Jackman, I felt your pain. Your love. Your charity. You embodied every emotion that matters to me, and each time you wore it, you did it from within. Have you recovered yet? You must win the Academy Award for this performance, not just because it was the best I've seen this year, but also because it matters. It showed us the potential we carry within ourselves, and a grateful viewer thanks you for this. Amanda Syfried, the innocent Cosette, was predictably poised on the screen, but seemed to struggle a bit with her high notes. Truth is, I don't much like her. Saw her on Letterman, which I recognize is a ridiculous reference, but she was a twit, and I just can't say much about her. Russell. Russell. Russell. I want to be kind here‚Äîthe movie makes me want to do that‚Äîbut alas, you were not up to the job. I respect you greatly, and my disappointment was less in your performance than in the fact that you should have known this was not your role to play, and you should have left it for someone else. A bunch of us decided Bono could have played the role, and he could have sung it well too. This is the worst of your crimes, Russell. Lastly, your singing talent wasn't up to the challenge. I contend you knew it all along. Just as you knew Jean Valjean was a better man than you.But the character who stole my heart was Eponine. Lonely, suffering Eponine, brilliantly portrayed by Samantha Barks, who is new to the screen. I hope to see her again and again. Her minimalist approach to her character made her all the stronger. Her voice was kind and gentle in its painful message, and I could hear it inside my soul. You were marvelous, and don't let anyone leave you out of the kudos because you haven't had box office draw capability. Your time will come.There are a few small things to iron out. The opening scene with the ship being pulled into port. Not so much. Sorry. The scene in the Inn. Offensively over the top. Out of place a bit. Unnecessary. The two coffins set in front of the barricade. Not so much. The butterflies when Cosette sees Marius in the garden. Don't be ridiculous. But those are minor offenses in a movie that spans a generation and teaches us everything about life in two and a half hours. There are those who say it was too long. It was not too long. It was the length it needed to be to tell the story at a pace that allowed us to take it in.We were taken to the depths of the dark bowels, and for a few hours we were shown great truths there, and we emerged better for it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway!!,"There are some things that I didn't like in this movie but Jackman and Hathaway's performance made up for that! Their performance was sooooo moving.
Eddie Redmayne did a good job too.
But there should have been more dialogue and less songs in my opinion and not all the actors sang perfectly which annoyed me a little.
( Ps: I love Russel Crowe's voice but I don't know why I felt it doesn't suit his character)
Overall it's really a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing film,"Hugh Jackman gives a stunning interpretation of J. Valjean and his interpretation is once more the prove that he is both a great singer and a great actor.
The song ""bring him home"" literally broke me down in tears.
The rest of the cast is also very good and I was happily surprised by the vocal skills of Russell Crowe.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Some parts may give you goose bumps... but...,"I've been using for a while a rating system that considers a ""Watchability Factor"", Acting and plot... The rating system goes from 1 to 10, with 5 points given to the ""watchability factor"", 2 for the acting and 3 for the plot.The scoring works as follows:Watchability Factor5 - Spectacular!

The running time of this film should be cut short to exactly 43 minutes...!!!,"Too long, too boring, alright, alright the artistics were great but these things are common in every film shooting for the awards,though the acting was good, this is the best i've seen from Hugh Jackman yet, however the real show stealer was Anne Hathaway.Such a short and memorable cameo it reminds me of the greatest supporting roles ever, she is gonna take the home a little statue, that's for sure! But after Anne's character dies in the film, i found no reason to continue watching, just piles over piles of boring music and singing, just not worth the time.while it is worth the watch for Anne's sake, this film is good but not great...!!!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Four words: cried my eyes out,"I have read the book, seen the musical many times. This is a wonderful movie.The acting in this film is off the charts. My hat is off to Tom Hooper for collecting so many talented people capable of giving such powerful performances! Anne Hathaway's scenes alone made this movie worth watching, and Hugh Jackman is no longer Wolverine in my mind, but Jean Valjean.I strongly recommend this movie for the themes of Grace, Salvation, and forgiveness that eco throughout. It is a wonderful thing to see so clearly Law against Grace, as Javert is against Jean Valjean. Valjean was a lost man burdened with his sin until he is given Mercy and redeemed by the priest, really by God. (As are we all)His soul set free, and knowing now what mercy is, he extends it to Javert. Javert can not reconcile the Law and Grace and it eats at him and conflicts with his soul until he can stand it no more.This is a lesson that the Law alone will kill and destroy men, but with grace we can all be saved.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good musical,"Good classic. Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit have done Les Miserables on stage before, and they are excellent in the film. Many stage actors can't transition to the screen, but these two have succeeded (with a lot hard work, no doubt). Amanda Seyfried is one of the weakest links in the movie. She is, of course, lovely as the adult Cosette (Isabelle Allen is excellent as young Cosette), even though the part is underwritten (in the film or on stage). Her singing voice is okay, but not as strong as expected, and I find her performance somewhat one dimensional. But she and Redmayne have great chemistry together, and that's a good thing. Russell Crowe also is the weak link. He is a good actor and I think he does his best with this role. But his rock-opera voice is jarringly different from the rest and he just stands out like a sore thumb. However, in the course of the movie he grew on me. In his final scenes I can see the great acting (it's all in the eyes, people!). So while I can't say he's the best Javert ever, I'll give him a pass.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Fantastic!,"I loved the stage musical so was interested to see they had converted to film. I was surprised to find that I actually really enjoyed it and I thought they did a wonderful job of conveying the grandeur of the story, which can sometimes be missed on the stage production.After the film I looked up a little on how they filmed the singing scenes as there was something so raw and realistic about it which I loved and I was amazed to find that the cast sang everything live on set. There was no pre-recording which was played with them miming along and no auto-tune added to individual performances, honestly I wish every musical employed the same process.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"I'm glad I'm one of the ones that ""got it"".",I have seen Les Mis live on a couple of occasions so I knew the movie was not going to be an opera on the big screen. Using opera stars would have made it a big screen opera and it would have bombed since it offered nothing new. I also doubt that opera stars would have been able to handle the rigors these actors went through while carrying a tune...in my opinion. These actors brought the characters to life in ways no one else could. They showed the trials endured during this time period better than any book I have ever read. The singing parts ranged from good to excellent and I am impressed they were able to both sing and act their parts. I have seen it three times and the songs are still in my head they were so moving. Once you realize it's not Wolverine singing you get a 9 star rating for cast and story! I also suggest watching it with the closed captions on at least once. I missed a bit of the lyrics the first time around.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Love-Hate. It could have been REALLY GREAT that It's Frustrating :(,"Let's not talk about the singing. We know it wasn't as good as we want it. But... Set that aside, let's talk about the acting and how the whole movie came out... was it good?I, as much as everyone else, had high expectations for this movie. It was so good in a lot of very specific moments... that it makes you resent the other scenes which came out very poorly.Okay, it's love-hate for me. I didn't like it as much as I expected I would. It wouldn't even be my Best Picture pick. I just feel like they compromised too much and forgot to piece it all together.I am a big Les Miserables fan. I just know that there are so many ways that this 2012 version could have been made better. I have seen the 25th Anniversary Concert, I have seen the 2nd movie with Uma Thurman and Liam Neeson as Fantine and Valjean. The 2nd movie wasn't a musical but it was done so good that it raised the bar for a 3rd movie.And this, I have to honestly say: I feel sorry for Russel Crowe. He wasn't right for Javert's role. It's NOT his fault. He is a great actor... but he just isn't right for the role. I love Russel Crowe. But he is no Javert. Every moment the camera is on him, I see only Russel, I do not see Javert. The Javert that is cunning and inhumane... the Javert that I have come to hate... I can't see it. That it's frustrating. Javert's role is very important here and they failed to show that in this movie. He is the reason for Jean Valjean's suffering but sadly, it wasn't portrayed well.Overall, I really didn't like it. It's frustrating. Because there were scenes here and there that were really captivating and moving, but there were so many other scenes that makes you feel like they weren't sure what they wanted to do.You know that feeling when you are about to sneeze but you lose it at the peak of wanting to sneeze??? It felt that way for me. I can think of a much better way to explain that but it's too pornographic. But you know what I mean.It's unfortunate. It could have been really great.",6.0,Anonymous,History
