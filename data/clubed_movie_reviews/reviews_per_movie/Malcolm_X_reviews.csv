"With this, his best film, Spike did ""the right thing.""","Outstanding film, with brilliant work from Washington in the title role. Lee's direction is excellent and, despite being a tad preachy at the end, this is without a doubt his penultimate picture. The supporting cast also is great with fine performances from Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz and the marvelous Al Freeman, Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. It's a terrific spiritual and emotional journey of a young black man in mid-20th century America. The fact that it is taken by a man who contributed so much to our history as Americans makes it all the more special. I urge all lovers of cinema- and history- to take this journey for themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great but needed a better editor,"A great movie if overlong and slightly unfocused.Washington carried the film with a great performance worthy of an Oscar nomination if not a win which might have been guaranteed had the director managed to focus.Spike Lee did a good job as director which is saying a lot, given the historical scope, danger of offense, and controversy of the project. His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn't have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat, there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman's skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say, ""Hey, that's Spike looking at us!"" Lee's biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the African-American experience. That's more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X's life, Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the African-American experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don't know. It certainly didn't help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying ""I am Malcolm X"" also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter, shorter, and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything, including the kitchen sink, into it.That being said, it is a great movie and I'm glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Truth seeker,"I think the major success of Alex Haley with this movie is that he tells the story of a dynamic person known as 'Malcolm X' with such a skill that no man from any part of any society get his feelings hurt. I think it is a commendable effort from Alex Haley, Spike Lee and Danzel Washington that they made a hero out of Malcolm X. I think he deserved it because he was the man who was not after money or popularity......he changed his statements, his way of life , even his faith as he knew that those were true. The theme of the movie is very clear that Malcolm X was not a hardliner rather he was always open for truth. Secondly, it also emphasized though in the end that negotiations and reforms is a better way than the violence. But yet it also gave the message that the ruling races reap the violence which they breed themselves; sometimes in the hegemony of their power or sometimes due the wrong interpretation of their religious verdicts. I think it was right to hit at the ' Black organization known as nation of Islam' and Elijah Muhammad. Muslim community is itself greatly indebted to this movie because Elijah Muhammad's teaching were very far from Islam. The real Islam practiced worldwide does not believe in the continuance of prophet-hood after Muhammad (P.B.U.H)and the Black supremacy by Elijah Muhammad was a ridiculous idea as Islam does not believe in Nationalism. Any Muslim anywhere in the world whether black or white are equal in Islam's teachings. It was great to see the scenes of pilgrimage to Makkah ....... these were not unnecessary ......because they helped us to understand the sudden change in the teachings of Malcolm X. Denzel's acting is really superb and also that of Al Freeman Jr. I think this movie is an invaluable resource for the people who want to take an insight into the Malcolm X's life.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Denzel Washington Show.,"A stunning performance by Denzel Washington (Oscar-nominated) carries this film literally into cinematic excellence. He stars as the titled character, the controversial Black Nationalist Leader who is easily one of the most interesting people who lived during the 20th Century. Spike Lee's uncompromising direction focuses on X's life. From his very early childhood to his violent death, the audience is given lots and lots information on the character as the film runs about 195 minutes. A good supporting cast helps, but this is Washington's show from the very start. His performance is very dominant and this is easily one of the best jobs that was never honored with an Academy Award. Brilliant biopic. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
It inspired me...,"As I watched MALCOLM X, I was surprised how much I liked the film and how interesting it was. So interesting, in fact, that I soon was inspired to read ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" that was compiled and written by Alex Haley. Then, I read a rather interesting (warts and all) account of Malcolm X's mentor, Elijah Mohammad.From what I have since learned from these and other sources, I was quite impressed at the movie--it seemed to try very hard to get the story right. Malcolm X's life was neither over-glorified nor was he portrayed the opposite--the story seemed to be quite balanced and without a serious ax to grind. It would have been easy to make the movie just an attack on the Nation of Islam or an attempt to make the title character some sort of saint.As for the acting, it was super. The script, excellent. The direction, first-rate. An excellent film that everyone should see--it is fascinating from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent and interesting,"I was only familiar with the history and influence of Malcolm X before I saw the film so I can't really judge it's faithfulness or accuracy. But as a film, I thought it was great. I really like Spike Lee; he keeps things fast-paced and interesting with his camera angles and colours/lighting. For awhile after Malcolm first begins his activism with the nation of Islam, you find yourself conflicted, both respecting the man and often disagreeing with him. Lee handles it well without condemning or supporting really, just showing Malcolm's gradual transition in his beliefs. The inserted documentary footage, especially at the end, shows how Malcolm's words still relate today. Someone commented that they only watched an hour of the movie and Lee doesn't know how to tell a story but maybe if they would be slightly more open-minded, realize it's not a literal adaptation of the autobiography, and actually finish the film, they could understand that Lee does not just want to tell the story of one man but rather wants it to reflect the struggle of a race. I really enjoyed the film; it was long but never slow and definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Bloated Biopic!,"With Malcolm X, director/co-screenwriter Spike Lee has produced a true-to-life biopic on the title character who was first a strident advocate for the American Nation of Islam during the 1950's and early 60's, later becoming an extremely high profile human rights activist during the civil rights movement, before his assassination in 1965.The film dramatises key events in Malcolm X's life with the main thread beginning with his post war criminal career and later conversion to Islam whilst in jail, which directly led to his assumption of the identity of Malcolm X . Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatised in (ironically) brief flashbacks, considering the elephantine length of the rest of the film.From my understanding of the life of Malcolm X, Lee has stuck closely to the facts in constructing his biography. I believe there is only a limited amount of fictionalisation for artistic and dramatic licence. For that, I guess many will be grateful. Lee has also recreated the roughly two decades the film's story covers, extremely authentically. The sets and costuming are first class, with occasional pieces of newsreel footage and still photos supplementing that of his own filming. The performances are uniformly outstanding. Denzal Washington must have been desperately unlucky to miss out on the 1992 Academy Award for his powerful, central portrayal of the conspicuously, hard-nosed and divisive X.For me though at 202 long minutes, this film is too dragged out and warranted tighter editing. The first act focusing on his early life of crime in Harlem and later Boston is for instance, needlessly protracted with interesting, but ultimately quite unimportant night club dancing and musical interludes. Could it possibly be that its prolonged appearance is due to Spike Lee himself, appearing in this section as a supporting character?Malcolm X is a technically well-made, obvious labour of love for Lee, but I think it may have reached wider audiences if edited to a more manageable, less indulgent length.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Epic film does justice to its subject.,"Spike Lee struggled mightily to get 'Malcolm X' made, financially and artistically. But when all was said and done, he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life.There's great differences between the two as well, but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic (and moral) vision to the screen, and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. (For example, from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the ""truth."") Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X,' with footage of real-life figures blended in, though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation.This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles, one of which is almost cartoonish: witness the scene where Malcolm (Denzel Washington) and Shorty (played by Lee himself) go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom, resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious, heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance, the movie opens with a full-screen shot of an American flag while we hear a voice-over of one of Malcolm's most rousing, or inflammatory speeches, depending on how you look at it (""I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet!"") The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away, the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation, having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp.Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightly-deserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking, you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting, an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman, Jr. (especially good as Elijah Muhammad, a controversial figure in society, and eventually to Malcolm himself), Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, Kate Vernon, Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast.It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily, one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not, the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself: impossible to ignore.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Good film, but way too long","This movie was entertaining and did justice to Malcolm x but it didn't have much of an angle to it. It seems like spike Lee just wanted to adapt his autobiography word for word. The film would've been more interesting if it focused on one particular part of his life, like Steven Spielberg did in ""Lincoln"" instead of giving equal attention to everything. It's just the film felt like a documentary at times.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Spike Lee's best movie ever,"Reaching his apex of greatness, Spike Lee created a perfect biography of the Black Nationalist leader. In the title role, Denzel Washington literally becomes the character. From the opening, when he accurately accuses the white man of all the injustices that the white man has perpetrated, to his conversion to Islam (and rejection of his slave surname), to his eventual assassination, the movie is top-notch in every respect.Having read Malcolm X's autobiography, I can affirm that the movie followed it very closely. Reading his autobiography will actually help you understand him even further. As will his indication that African-Americans bled for the white man in Korea, Japan, Italy, etc., so why shouldn't they bleed for their freedom at home? Anyway, ""Malcolm X"" is a perfect movie in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lee Does Justice to Controversial Civil Rights Icon,"It's impressive this biopic, ""Malcolm X,"" works as well as it does given its rather difficult production, beset by outcries on all sides as to the portrayal of the controversial historical figure, and given its 3-hours-plus length by a writer and director, Spike Lee, who has been criticized for his bluntness and excessiveness, at least occasionally, and a star, Denzel Washington, who is often celebrated more the more over-the-top his performances. Yet, the film is remarkable for its relative restraint and balance. We see all sides of each, and, ultimately, I think we mostly experience the best of them.There's the Malcolm Little born a son to a preacher harassed by the KKK and murdered, to be raised in a discriminatory system of foster care; ""Red,"" the zoot-suit-wearing lover of a white woman who becomes a gangster; the prisoner converted to the Nation of Islam and to civil-rights minister ""Malcolm X""; and, finally, the more tolerant and cooperative Muslim activist out to lead his own mosque before his assassination. Lee seems to revel in the free-flowing zoot suit and gangster parts--even casting himself as a sidekick, and he mostly reserves his usual didactic overkill this time--making sure to connect past to present racism--to the opening (including footage of the beating of Rodney King) and an ending that admittedly helps cleanse the palate from the protagonist's tragic death, as well as including images of wealthy African Americans who donated money to bring the production to completion (plus, who can say anything bad about a cameo from Nelson Mandela). For the most part, Lee lets the compelling narrative of Malcolm X be told. Arguably, even, America's history of white supremacy doesn't receive enough criticism throughout the film. In the later parts, the Nation of Islam and Elijah Muhammad, instead, come across as the picture's main foes (which makes it all the more odd that the Fruit of Islam provided security for the film) while the FBI eavesdrops under its COINTELPRO program of undermining American civil-rights and political organizations.As for Denzel Washington's performance, I think there's a good case for his being robbed of the Oscar. That year, as typical, the Academy awarded an actor, Al Pacino, for overblown histrionics. Likewise, it took Washington ranting and raving in ""Training Day"" (2002) before he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar. Despite criticisms of extremism and the natural focus on speechifying the part requires, such tactics wouldn't work for playing Malcolm X. There are moments requiring silent reflection and intelligent argumentation. In the end, it turns out that Spike Lee and Malcolm X are more moderate in their radicalism, ultimately compromising within larger systems seeking progress, whether they employ traditional filmic storytelling and hagiography or try to cooperate with other civil-rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., than some give them credit for.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Malcolm X: Almost The Truth,"""The nation was founded in the late '20s by traveling salesman Wallace D. Fard, whose preachings combined Islam with an Afrocentric cosmology. He taught that blacks are descended from Shabbaz, a tribe that came from the moon 66 trillion years ago, and that whites were the laboratory concoction of Yakub, an evil scientist.""FROM: http://slate.msn.com/id/10759/10ths of the way into this movie, I was thinking ""I can't believe it. Spike Lee actually has the balls to tell this story truthfully"" and expose the Nation of Islam for what it really is: a lying, racists, hate cabal, that murdered Malcolm X.But just short of the end, he (Spike) just had to throw it in; The Nation Of Islam could not have murdered Malcolm X without help from ""The Man"".

A film that stands the test of time.....,"This was a stirring tribute of a film that to this day still stands the test of time even after its release more than a decade ago. This was in fact a autobiography and educational film which some of the most electrifying performance ever displayed on film,and it is the reason to see why. This was Denzel Washington's finest piece of work and most notably the best of his career in which he should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscar category,instead of his work which he won the Best Actor statue for 2001's ""Training Day"". Anyway,""Malcolm X"",was a brilliant tribute to the controversial black activist,a leader in the struggle for black liberation as well as black pride and one of the most outspoken individuals who had a different side of the civil rights movement where a time when America was at war with itself.Based on the best-selling autobiography by Malcolm X and Alex Haley,and with spellbinding direction by Spike Lee,it traces the story of Malcolm himself,from his days as a hustler and drug runner and hitting rock bottom during his imprisonment in the 1950's,he became a Black Muslim and then a leader in the Nation Of Islam under the guidance of the honorable Elijah Muhammad. His assassination in 1965 left a legacy of black nationalism,self-determination and racial pride that continues to the day and within a new generation whom for the first time has witnessed a masterpiece of cimematic work. This is marked by strong performances throughout with powerful direction by Spike Lee,cimematopgrapher Ernest Dickerson,and riveting breathtaking performances by Denzel Washington,Angela Bassett,and most notably from Al Freeman,Jr. as Elijah Muhammad. The real centerpiece of the film is from Denzel Washington himself,whose convincing performance in the title role brings this film alive. When this film came out,it only receive one Oscar nomination but however,the film garnered a lot of  awards including the NAACP Image Film Award,The New York Film Critics Award for Best Actor,The Los Angeles Times Film Award for Best Director and Best Actor,and MTV Movie Awards for both Denzel Washington and Al Freeman,Jr.--all of this happened in 1992,when the film came out.As far as the cameos go,this film had a lot of them in one picture including Black Panther Bobby Seale,Reverend Al Sharpton,The Honorable Nelson Mandela,Reverend Jesse Jackson,along with Hollywood walk-ons: Christopher Plummer,Karen Allen,Peter Boyle and Danny Glover,and Whoopi Goldberg.Brilliant!-Five Stars",,Anonymous,History
Don't Listen To Yevgeny Bazarov,"For he/she is nothing but a hate monger himself/herself and doesn't realize that Malcolm X is probably one of the most misunderstood, but influential black leaders in history.  Throughout the course of the movie, we see Malcolm go through a transformation from street hustler, to convict, to positive black leader.  Malcolm X was only violent and hateful towards white people until he made his pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city of Islam. When he got there he never saw so many people of many different races worshiping Allah.  It was then that he decided to change his views of race. After that, it was then that he realized the mistakes that he had made and decided to break off his relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the rest of the Muslims, who in fact were the real hate mongers and that's why they later killed him, because he didn't feed on hate anymore.Another thing about director Spike Lee.  Spike Lee is in fact, probably one of the most under-appreciated African-American directors in Hollywood.  His movies have many underlying messages about race in America.  It's a shame that his movies are so under-appreciated.  Sure his movies are ""critically acclaimed"", but that doesn't mean that people are actually getting the messages he is trying to send.  The same goes for John Singleton and The Hughes Brothers.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor of 1992 -- Masterpiece Snubbed at Academy Awards and Golden Globes","Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", the major winner of the Academy Awards in 1992 for best director and best film, is good solid film-making. However, ""Malcolm X"", produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington in the title role, is a bona fide masterpiece--a 20th century film equivalent to a masterwork of the Renaissance. Certainly, it may be unfair to evaluate the two films against each other, but since one received much more acclaim than the other during the year of its release, it begs comparison. However, it's like comparing a Caravaggio with Michaelangelo's frescoes atop the Sistine Chapel. The first is certainly exceptional but the latter is a magnum opus. ""Malcolm X"" is Spike Lee's Sistine Chapel. Like Selznik's ""Gone with the Wind"" or Welles' ""Citizen Kane"", ""Malcolm X"" may be hard to top.The only thing equally as superb as Washington's acting is the directing and the script, which is at once honest and compelling. Except for a coda at the end that seems at odds with the rest of the film, the script is near perfect, relying heavily on true accounts of Malcolm X's life instead of altering the story to fit prescribed entertainment values, a bad habit of Hollywood filmmakers. Instead, Lee and Washington rely on Malcolm X and his history as the guiding force behind the film. Many of the incidences portrayed in ""Malcolm X"" actually happened, from his father being assassinated on railroad tracks, to the young Malcolm being involved with drug dealing to his rise as a star among the Nation of Islam, or so-called Black Muslims. In one scene that is history and not fiction, Malcolm X orders his entourage of male associates to stand outside a hospital when a fellow Muslim, Brother Johnson, requires medical attention.Malcolm Little was an African-American, the son of an assassinated preacher whose family had sustained vicious threats from the KKK. As a young man, he relocated to Harlem and became a streetwise hoodlum involved in crime gangs. Racketeering, gambling, prostitution, and drug dealing were his first religion. Then after an incident with white girls that landed himself and his associate Shorty (Spike Lee, perfectly cast) in jail, he meets a member of a new religious organization claiming kinship with Muslims in the Middle East and re-claiming their African roots.Headed by the honorable Elijah Muhammad who had converted to Islam and brought the religion (or at least his version of it) to the United States as the Nation of Islam, the so-called Black Muslims (although they do not refer to themselves as such) lures Malcolm into a new world of honesty, compassion, and purpose. To the their credit, the religious organization gives Malcolm Little, now renamed Malcolm X, a sense of purpose, an identity, a loving community, and rehabilitation from the vices that were destroying himself in Harlem.After his conversion, he becomes a prominent voice among the sect, a spokesperson for the honorable Elijah Muhammad and his message of religious determinism. Simultaneously, they also preach dangerous messages including that all white folks are devils, and that the honorable Elijah Muhammad is to be obeyed without question. As the spokesman of their cause against whites, Malcolm X in some ways becomes the darker side of Martin Luther King, Jr who propagated that proclaiming African-American superiority was as sinful as proclaiming white superiority. The press dubbed Malcolm X the ""angriest man in America"".Washington does more than just portray Malcolm X, he becomes him. Washington, I imagine, must have studied footage of his speeches and spoken with people who knew him. Speeches of the real Malcolm X as compared to speeches in the film as enacted by Washington are almost indistinguishable. His performance ranks as one of the top two or three performances by an actor in the history of the performing arts and cinema, up there with Ben Kingsly as Gandhi, Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane, Laurence Olivier as Hamlet, and Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara.The turn in the film occurs when, in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm makes some ill-conceived remarks to the press. Malcolm X further learns that Elijah Muhammad is not practicing all that he preaches. The star of the so-called ""Black Muslims"" begins questioning not only his role but the integrity of the entire movement. He then makes a pilgrimage to Mecca, required at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim. His pilgrimage changes many of his views.It's hard to describe this film without using many superlatives, but if there was ever a film that deserved it, it's ""Malcolm X"". Washington and Lee do a tremendous job of neither vilifying nor idealizing Malcolm X, the man. In retrospect on the man, I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end, Malcolm X began to encourage that dream, but, like Martin Luther King Jr, his mission was cut short. As for the film, it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself, the work may only be appreciated by later generations. Malcolm X is the embodiment of the American story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Becoming a revered public figure,"Right from the opening credits in which an American flag slowly burns to form a letter 'X', this biography of the title human rights activist from Spike Lee is riveting viewing throughout. The film's strongest asset is Denzel Washington's lead performance; he undergoes several character progressions throughout as the film documents his whole transformation from convicted criminal to angry protester to revered public figure. The film benefits from some magnificent editing too with well-melded, dreamlike childhood flashbacks, a clever cutaway in which Washington imagines throw a cake in a condescending young man's face and some very deliberate cutting in a scene in which he looks up the definitions of 'black' and 'white' in the dictionary (probably the most potent part of the entire movie). The Oscar nominated costumes (zoot suits in particular) are great too. What does not quite work so well though is Lee's choice to unabashedly celebrate the title character. The sentimental epilogue seems ill-judged. Also, given how callous Malcolm is shown at times (coldly telling a sympathetic young white woman that she cannot do anything to help his cause) and how close-minded he is on certain issues, he always seems like more a deeply flawed man with his heart in the right place than a leader worthy of Lee's celebratory treatment. Never to mind, the film is engaging the whole way through, regardless of how one views the title character, with nary a boring moment to be had - which is a quite remarkable achievement for a that film clocks in at over three hours in length.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Spike Lee and Malcolm X:  Some disagreements,"I heard Malcolm X speak at Berkeley in 1963, the year of Kennedy's assassination, albeit before that terrible event.  I remember that tall, intense, lean man striding to the microphone and beginning with, ""Brothers, friends...enemies.""  This film is a fine but flawed work which creates a confusing and often confused picture of a very complex man.  The Black Moslem movement is a significant political event in our nation's history. Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X, however, is much more Lee than Malcolm X. This film is long, repetitious and often tedious.  The coda is distracting, unnecessary and borders on the maudlin. However, Lee presents but misunderstands the turning point in the life of the late Malcolm X, i.e., the change from a political icon, mouthing the half-baked, jingoistic half-truths of Elijah Mohammud into a man who underwent a profound religious experience.  Many Black Moslems are an anathema to mainstream Moslems; this distinctive African-American movement is willing to lay all the ills of the African-American's treatment at the door of the ""whites.""  This is not religion; it is politics and has little to do with the religious tenets of Islam.  The accusation of Elijah Mohammud that Christianity is a ""white man's religion"" and Judaism is practiced by Jews who ""exploit Black people,"" is pure nonsense.  The origins of Christianity, Islam and Judaism have common roots among the Semitic peoples, Arabs and Jews, and it should be remembered that it was Islamic Arabs who ran the Slave trade that sold many of the West African ancestors of African-Americans into bondage in the Americas.  In fact, the international slave trade feeding slaves into the productive leg of the old Trade Triangle was created by the Portuguese colonization of Africa.  But, facts rarely enter into consideration where idealogy is concerned. Islam is a religion where the ""law (sunni)"" is part and parcel of everyday living, as it is in Judaism, (i.e., no division of 'church' and 'state') bespeaks of its desert origins based on a system of tribal ownership of wells.  My point is, the Black Moslem movement was a political movement (and largely, still is) where the religious component has been greatly misrepresented.  The misconception and misrepresentation of Islam as a Jihadic or militant religion persists today in the anti-Arab attitude reflected daily in our public news media.  Unfortunately, Malcom X's diatribes during that his political period did precious little to remedy the situation.  Sadly, only after Malcolm X had made his hajj, did he come to realize that people are people and the real monster is the hatred people create for other people. Spike Lee is a fine film maker.  In spite of its flaws, this is a fine presentation of the life of one of the most interesting men of our past century.",7.0,Anonymous,History

As is visible, this movie has touched me in many ways. Denzel Washington's performance of the ex-Muslim leader is amazing. The only thing more amazing is the fact that he lost out in the Oscar race to Pacino, who portrayed a less important figure, by far.

An important film,"Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before  it does, after all, span 200 minutes  and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself  but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's protégé gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie  and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is a baaad movie.,"No disrespect to Malcolm X, I admire him so I watched this movie and I didn't like it. After watching this I decided that I don't like Spike Lee's movies, he's a bad director. I haven't liked one of his movies yet.What's with the long dancing scenes at the beginning of the movie? The end is so melodramatic, I'm pretty sure it's Spike Lee's voice saying why you should respect Malcolm X... nobody cares what your vision of life is, rather tell me a story and then you can catch my attention , but the voice over spoils it. It's also ridiculously long and it's unnecessary.Sorry Spike, you had to stay more centered to tell a good story, you couldn't shape your admiration for this man into a fine movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm Big,"There's two ways to look at this movie: as an entertaining evening filler, a roller-coaster of a movie, it's very successful -- strange, and no mean feat, for a biopic about a radical black leader from yesteryear. As a biography however, which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person, I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice, and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.The acting is great, I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz, as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend, the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made, as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.OK, let's focus on content, then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King, but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography, Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug, although one who was driven to this life by racism, who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father, that of a black separatist minister (his father had followed Marcus Garvey, Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead).Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam, and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is, when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out, that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department (and I don't think that he was anything but sharp). But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and non-racist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie, Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his -- very much younger -- secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume, have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing, i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either, neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed, some questions it should have raised. Instead it ""cultivates"" and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer, what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them, did they work out, did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races, or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he, especially in the light of Obama, fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window, through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene, Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow, that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzle-dazzle.Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK, where this is at best highly speculative.Another point: were the NOI with their guru, their uniforms, their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in ""the KKK had finally met their match""-sense but more as in ""made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation, and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies""? Just a thought.Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a ""I'm Malcom X"" scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah, and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X, then even his autobiography is a better choice.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Biggest Snub in Oscar History,"This is one of the greatest epics on one of the most complex individuals of the twentieth century.  However, this was also a victim of one of the greatest snubs in Oscar history.  Despite the greatness of this film it was only nominated for two Academy Awards.  Denzel Washington, deservedly, was nominated for his performance.  However, he was beaten out by Al Pacino for his portrayal of a blind former army officer in Scent of a Woman.  But perhaps the biggest snub was suffered by Spike Lee.  Lee made the film come to life as he told Malcolm's story, but he wasn't even nominated for his work.  Perhaps it was because of his controversial statements regarding blacks in Hollywood that caused him to be snubbed.  No matter what, this film should have received at least six or seven nominations, especially for Angela Bassett and Al Freeman.",,Anonymous,History
Malcolm The Hero !!!,"I saw it last night and absolutely loved it . Not a big fan of the biopic genre and its runtime of over 200 mins. made me skeptical but im glad i ended up watching it. Dont wanna talk about its historical accuracy but as a movie it did well enough for me to think about the speeches Malcolm X gave and int shouldve erpret on it. Spike Le does a fantastic job in binding the film toghether however he shouldve teimmed it down to about 170-180 mins.
Denzel was on total fire and carried the entire movie on his shoulders .Maybe should have gotten the oscar nod over Pacino for tatally making it believable that he was indeed malcolm X. A solid 8/10 from me",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Religion as a tool, not a weapon!","This was not a great movie, though it had some great parts. In general it was too long and was very slow to start. Being almost three and a half hours was a little excessive. One of my friends saw a ten minute clip and with about two minutes of background on the movie, understood almost the entire movie. Looking back on it, I don't know that there is any one scene you could take out and it would still be the same, but three and a half hours is just way to long to be watching a movie that slow.On the other hand though, the message in those ten minutes was so important, but I feel is over looked by most of the people who watch this movie. The ideas and values that Malcolm X had and how he changed through the movie culminated in his acceptance of white people and people of other religions. He saw that freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are not characteristics of Muslims alone, rather that all man (almost all man) wants exactly what he wanted. He saw that his religion was actually a tool to bring people together rather than an excuse to keep them apart.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This is an American cinema masterpiece. I'd score this an easy 10/10.,"Malcolm X (1992) is a movie I recently rewatched on Netflix and tells the tale of the rise and fall of the epic Malcolm X. The story starts with his childhood where his mother who goes insane leaving him and his siblings as orphans. He starts in a life of crime before discovering the Muslim religion while in jail. This religion changes his life forever, helps him get released from jail, and sets him up as a public speaker for his faith. He quickly rises in notoriety which brings him as much success as it does challenges. This movie is directed by and stars Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing) and also stars Denzel Washington (Man on Fire), Angela Bassett (Strange Days), Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty), Theresa Randle (Bad Boys) and Albert Hall (Major Payne). This is the ultimate character piece that shows the vast evolutions of a character. His perspectives and outlooks changed so significantly over time and that is brilliantly depicted. The writing in this is so fantastic as is the acting. This is probably my all time favorite Denzel Washington picture, though Spike Lee is very good in this too. The settings, cinematography and outfits in this are out of control good. Overall there's nothing I'd change about this movie and this is an American cinema masterpiece. I'd score this an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Unveiling the Essence of Activism,"Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X' is a monumental cinematic achievement, capturing the essence and complexity of one of the most influential figures in American history. Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X is nothing short of mesmerizing, delivering a performance that is powerful, nuanced, and utterly compelling. Lee's direction skillfully navigates through Malcolm X's life, from his tumultuous youth to his transformation into a charismatic leader. The film doesn't shy away from the controversies surrounding Malcolm X, presenting him as a multifaceted figure whose evolution is both inspiring and thought-provoking. The cinematography beautifully captures the mood and atmosphere of each era, immersing the audience in the turbulent times of racial injustice and political upheaval. The supporting cast, including Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo, deliver standout performances that enrich the narrative and bring depth to the characters. The screenplay, penned by Lee and Arnold Perl, strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and dramatic storytelling, offering insight into the complexities of Malcolm X's ideology and legacy. The film's soundtrack, featuring the stirring compositions of Terence Blanchard, adds another layer of emotional resonance to the storytelling. 'Malcolm X' is not just a biopic; it's a profound exploration of identity, activism, and the quest for justice in a divided society. Spike Lee's masterpiece remains as relevant and impactful today as it was upon its release.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An amazing movie for an amazing person...,"""Malcolm X"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life story of Malcolm X. He was a legendary African American leader. He was born as Malcolm Little but he changed it to Malcolm X. When his father was killed by the Ku Klux Klan something changed him, he became a gangster and he spent some time in jail where he discovered Islam from the writings of Elijah Muhammad. He became a member of the Nation of Islam and he also visited Mecca.I liked this movie very much because it is based on the life of a very controversial person who also influenced a lot of people. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was simply outstanding and I enjoyed very much the way it was presented all the life events of Malcolm X, from his early life as a young boy to the time he became a member of the Nation of Islam. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Denzel Washington who played as Malcolm X and for one more time I wasn't disappointed at all because he was simply amazing on this role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Angela Bassett's who played as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Albert Hall's who played as Baines and Delroy Lindo's who played as West Indian Archie.To sum up, I have to say that ""Malcolm X"" is a very good movie with a great plot based on the life events of Malcolm X, some great interpretations made by its cast especially Denzel Washington's and a story that will be in your mind for a lot of time. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that every person no matter the religion he/she believes in, he/she has something to gain by watching it. This movie will make you think a lot of things except religion and the story of Malcolm X, it will make you think about your life, your choices and also your legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
If you're a fan of cinema...,"This film has it all. Spike Lee is truly a fan of cinema and studied those that came before him. This movie was epic in so many ways...storytelling comes first. It entangles you in Malcolm's world; you understand his background and why he made the decisions that he made. The costumes were brilliant for each time period. I'm glad Ruth Carter is receiving her dues now. The music...the score was done with such emotion that it was a hidden character in each scene, plus the big band dance number...omg. The angles and the shots on the actors made it seem like an older classic film. And of course, the performances. Denzel was born for this role. He embodied Malcolm X and performed his character with so much honor and respect. Shoutout to Delroy Lindo as well who made West Indian Archie iconic. I read the Autobiography of Malcolm X (more than twice) and Archie is Lindo in my mind now. It has been arguably the most important film ever made for Black America and I'm proud of Spike Lee for the job he did. The only thing that hurts this film is Warner Bros involvement.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Myths,"I have been working on a book for some time now titled ""The Deification of the American Niggah: Whole Lotta Lies Don' Make No Truth"". The thesis is of the book is that the severe bigotry and injustice experienced by Negroes in America has been replaced by an equally inaccurate and unjust expectation of perfection. There is an attempt to correct the errors of slavery, prejudice and brutal discrimination by recreating reality in an equally tragically inaccurate set of expectations. Blacks have been miraculously transformed from ignorant, vile, sub-humans to noble, perfect, superior beings that have been unjustly suppressed for reasons of racist ambitions, greed, envy, etc. Neither of these depictions is accurate and both misconceptions degrade the social and economic ascendance that is the answer to the issues of black society.This film and its writers, producers, directors, critics, etc. are an example of the extremes to which myth has attempted to transplant error. The protagonist is depicted as a humble, gifted, noble and superior hero who conquered white oppression through ""self-enlightenment"". In reality, Malcolm Little was a felon, a convict and a miscreant who sought advancement through narcotics, prostitution and illegal gambling. His ""enlightenment"" through the spiritual experience of the Nation of Islam (Black Muslims) was depicted in his statement about President Kennedy's assassination ""the chickens would come home to roost."" Malcolm's association with the Black Muslims ended in his own brutal assassination by other peaceful, enlightened members of the Nation of Islam.But Spike Lee directed this movie as a tribute to a hero who transcended racism though enlightenment and moral superiority. This is a terrible film not only because of its betrayal of reality but because it perpetuates the myths that are as evil as the bigotry and persecution that it assaults. There are no mythical heroes just as there are no sub-humans among the black races. Miraculous transformation of history does no more to elevate society than prejudice does. Greater lies cannot correct other lies.Richard Pryor made the best statement on reality I have ever heard. Its majesty lies in its simplicity and accuracy. On a trip to Africa he attended a large community celebration of ethnic music, dancing, revelry, etc. As he sat among the hundreds of revelers he thought to himself, ""Now look around you. Do you see any Niggahs here?"" He answered to himself, ""No, there aren't any. There never were any. Just people. That's all there ever were."" In the same way, if the filmmakers as well as the multitudes of activists who advocate societal betterment would just see that all they have to deal with are people, the issues could begin to be resolved. Fantasies like this movie only prolong the hatred and incomprehension.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant,"This film was absolutely brilliant. Spike Lee is a genius. We're studying him in my film class and a lot of his works are controversial, but I think they're necessary. Malcolm X was beautifully acted by Denzel. He took Malcolm's mannerisms and passion into himself and carved this wonderful character. The film traced him from a young kid to his Nat'list days to his death. His beliefs were different, but he never compromised himself. Considering where he came from and the time he grew up in, no one can really yell and scream about why he was the way he was. So many want to glorify King as the only leader of the time, but X was a leader in his own right. His ideas weren't that different from King's. His approach was honest and a response to the times. Denzel shows every emotion in his face that seemed to formulate in his mind. I seriously thought of him as Malcolm. He really had to earn people's respect from the background he came from and I liked that. Nothing was glossed over and no stone left unturned. Malcolm X is a great film and worth the watch!",,Anonymous,History

We see the ""Detroit Red"" days as well as what I call Malcolm's initial ""brainwashing"" into the Nation Of Islam.Spike Lee also makes history as one of the only filmmakers to ever be able to document the Muslim ""Hajj"" or Holy Pilgrimage to Mecca and pulls it off beautifully.

That would help you understand what was going on in this country in the early 1960's and you can then see ""Malcolm X"" with an open mind.

One of Denzel's best,"What an actor Denzel Washington is . It's very rare that he makes a bad film . I'm not sure why it's took me so long to get around to seeing Malcolm X . Perhaps the Three Hours , Twenty Two minutes running time put me off in the past but there is no doubt , this is one of the best performance the great man has ever put in .This is a biographical epic of the controversial and influential black nationalist leader, from his early life and career as a small-time gangster, to his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam.Despite it's length , I never felt this film outstayed it's welcome.It's a well paced movie and I have to say it's much farer than I was expecting .It highlights the good and the bad of Malcolm X and isn't just a vehicle to batter the non black population of America .Denzel is fantastic. Not only do you feel this IS Malcolm X ( especially in the latter part of film ) you absolutely buy into his performance.It's not his greatest ever role , I think that will always be as Alonzo in Training Day , but it's very close second .If I had to be critical I would say it's a little self indulgent on Spike Lee's part . He casts himself as Shorty and has quite a few scenes . He , himself will admit ( I hope) that he's not a great actor and it does show at times.The rest of the cast are superb . Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo are always fantastic to watch and it's interesting to see early performances from Wendell Pierce and Giancarlo Esposito who both went on to star in The Wire and Breaking Bad respectively .If you want an in-depth look at Malcolm X then this is the perfect film .Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History

There could never be a Malcolm X movie better than this,"Spike Lee's Malcolm X is and always will be the best retelling of Malcolm's life and legacy. It's a movie that has just the right amount of nuance while still staying true to the man's ideologies and even his flaws. While on the one hand it brilliantly demonstrates Malcolm's evolving perspectives of the world he tries to change, it also shows how the commitment to one form of thinking that isolates anything foreign and discourages any bit of doubt could and would lead to the petty downfalls of ignorance.Malcolm X as a movie is all parts brilliance. The way in which the movie was written and how the life of Malcolm Little unfolds on screen is done so masterfully that the 202-minute runtime of the movie is barely noticeable. From the production design, to the makeups, to the costumes and even the color tones that contribute towards the building of this particular universe... it's every bit of detail crafted to perfection and should be commended greatly for that. What holds this movie up the most is certainly lead actor Denzel Washington himself, as I don't think there could have been a better actor to portray the revolutionary leader with as much power and nuance as was. The transformation from a more comically expressive Malcolm Little at the start of the movie to a leader who has realized the seriousness of his role in the world and has a much deeper understanding of the issues he finds himself trying to solve by the end of the movie... that's Denzel at his best.The true star of the movie though, is director Spike Lee; whose vision and style combined does great justice to Malcolm X's life and legacy. The movie screams Spike Lee throughout and yet in no way does that discount the scale and seriousness of the movie. It's a work of art that's every bit a tribute to Malcolm's legacy as well as every bit a testament to Spike Lee's prowess as a filmmaker and storyteller.Malcolm X is a movie I found to be truly inspiring about a leader I have the greatest respect for. And this movie is an important tool for keeping Malcolm's legacy alive even today.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Moving,"Having recently finished watching Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X,"" I find myself perched on the fence between admiration and skepticism. While the film undeniably captures the essence of a pivotal figure in American history, there's a sense of ambivalence lingering in the aftermath of its three-hour narrative.Denzel Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X is, without a doubt, a tour de force. Washington's ability to embody the charisma, passion, and inner turmoil of the civil rights leader is commendable. From Malcolm's early days as a hustler to his transformation within the confines of prison, Washington navigates the complexities of the character with skill and intensity. However, this stellar performance does not entirely compensate for the film's occasional descent into predictability.The non-linear narrative structure, while attempting to infuse depth into Malcolm X's story, feels at times like a forced attempt to add complexity. The constant shift between timelines, marked by flashbacks and voiceovers, can be disorienting. While it might be argued that this mirrors the tumultuous nature of Malcolm X's life, it occasionally detracts from the overall viewing experience, making it challenging to fully engage with the character's evolution.The film's exploration of Malcolm X's relationship with the Nation of Islam and its leader, Elijah Muhammad, is a compelling aspect that adds layers to the narrative. However, there's a lingering sense that certain nuances are left unexplored. The complexities of Malcolm and Elijah's dynamic, including the eventual rupture due to ideological differences, are hinted at but not thoroughly examined. This lack of depth in crucial relationships leaves the audience craving more insight into the internal conflicts shaping Malcolm X's trajectory.Cinematographer Ernest Dickerson's work adds a visually arresting quality to the film. The recreation of historical events, such as Malcolm X's speeches and the vibrant portrayal of the era, is commendable. Yet, the film occasionally leans on its visual prowess to compensate for moments where the narrative falters. While the attention to detail is apparent, it doesn't entirely salvage the film from occasional pacing issues.The film's runtime, exceeding three hours, might be a hurdle for those expecting a more concise exploration of Malcolm X's life. There are instances where the pacing feels sluggish, especially in the middle portion of the film. While the deliberate pacing allows for a thorough examination of the subject matter, it also risks losing the audience's attention, making the overall viewing experience more of a marathon than a sprint.In the aftermath of ""Malcolm X,"" I find myself grappling with a sense of ambivalence. The film undoubtedly succeeds in capturing the spirit of a complex historical figure, but it falls short of delivering a consistently engaging and thought-provoking narrative. Despite Washington's standout performance and the film's visual achievements, there's an underlying feeling of having witnessed a somewhat formulaic retelling of a transformative journey. ""Malcolm X"" is an average cinematic experience that, while shedding light on an important chapter in American history, leaves one wishing for a more nuanced exploration of its central figure and the turbulent times he navigated.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Sadly one of Lee's flattest film but still a story worth hearing and features a good performance from Washington,"Malcolm Little was a young man when his father was murdered by the KKK and he and his siblings were taken from their mother and separated.  As a young man he became a hustler and eventually a full robber with his friends, before eventually getting 8-12 years in prison for his crimes.  While inside he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam.  Once released he rises in the ranks of the Nation of Islam to be an uncompromising leader of the black movement , tackling white oppression head on.Lee does not want any question about the tone of this film.  Opening with footage of the Rodney King beating projected onto an American flag that chars before bursting into flames while Malcolm's `American nightmare' speech is played over the top, Lee leaves us in no doubt that this film will not step back from being provocative and incendiary.  Unlike many reviews on this site, I will not review the politics of Malcolm X but I will try and view this as a film.  I do not need to agree with the stance of X to be interesting in this film - I did not watch this film to fight with it or get annoyed by it, I watched it to listen to Lee tell the story of Malcolm X.Substance wise, the film is too long - Lee did not allow the editors to be as ruthless as he should have been.  I can understand why though, this was a labour of love and he must have felt that he needed that long to do the job. As a flow it works reasonably well, although it is too baggy quite often, but it is an interesting story nonetheless.  Many critics have lambasted the film for it's bias.  In that regard the only thing that surprised me was that they genuinely seemed surprised by this fact - what did they expect from Spike Lee?  However, I don't believe that this is a fair accusation to make at Lee.  He tells the story in a fair light - he doesn't hide the double standards of the Nation of Islam nor does he spin the anti-white teachings to paint Malcolm in a better light.  Of course Lee is going to bring his own pro-black politics to the film, but that is his right and he doesn't rewrite history to serve himself.In fact I admired some of Lee's touches as they actually produced a more balanced view.  For example, where Malcolm is talking to Betty about his thoughts on women, Lee cuts to Malcolm being told the same opinion (word for word) by Muhammad - a brave move that implied the spoon feeding of his views that I didn't expect from Lee.  Of course the other way to look at it would be Lee excusing Malcolm's stance on women by pinning it on Muhammad and in fairness to that view, Lee does tend to gloss over the NOI's view on woman's place.  The film is a little kind to Malcolm but not to the point where the absurd claims about bias and spin would really stick - well, for the majority anyway.  I did feel that, although it wasn't spin, that the final 5 minutes of the film really went too far with the little kids all standing up saying `I am Malcolm X', parallels with Jesus and then Mandella being wheeled out...now THAT bit I found to be unnecessary as it was not from Malcolm - it was heavy politicing from Lee himself in further evidence that he was knocked off his usual style by the weight of the material.In fact, this stands out to me as being one of Lee's least stylish and slick films - only the early, freer scenes of Malcolm's crime, drink and dancing seem to be directed by a Spike Lee using the camera and the space.  For the most part, Lee sits back and watches - apparently in total reverence of this subject and afraid to take away from the supposed importance of what the film is trying to do.  It is a shame because the overly long running time means that it desperately needed a spark at times and I did expect Lee at least to bring the film alive with visual flourishes.  Sadly, like I say, Lee's respect for his subject causes him to do nothing and, worse still, he includes some bits that just don't work - Muhammad's appearance in the cell is worst but Malcolm's trip to Mecca doesn't work as it is overlong and forced (again, as Lee stresses that Malcolm dropped the anti-white stance). In regards this, critics have unfairly accused Lee of trying to lessen Malcolm's stance and make it more acceptable (ie change history) but those of us who are a bit older know that we will learn things over our life and will not hold the same opinions as we did when we were 18, or 25, or 30. In the same way Malcolm lost his harsh teachings with age - this is the case, it is not Lee trying to trick us.For all these reasons, the film is greatly in debt to Denzel Washington. If it weren't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority.  Happily then, Washington rises to the role and deals with it's changes and development really well. He makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role - or that the film would have worked without him.  The names of those involved is impressive, but not all their performances are.  Bassett varies between being a shy little woman and having raging fights with her husband, in neither mode does she convince. Freeman is also pretty comic - but part of the blame for that lies with Lee's portrayal of him (floating in a cell is not a good look!).  Hall, Lindo, Randle, McDaniel and Lee himself all do reasonably well in minor roles but the film belongs to Washington and it is just as well for the film's sake that he is up to the task.Overall this is an interesting film that is worth seeing as an INTRODUCTION to Malcolm X - however if you take your opinion from this film alone then you are doing yourself a disservice.  As a Spike Lee film it is surprisingly flat and lacking in the usual visual style that he brings, it is a real shame but this labour of love is not one of his better films (although it is not among his worst) - it is rather pedestrian, overlong and, were it not for a charismatic performance from Washington, would be a lot duller than the subject deserved.",,Anonymous,History
"Holy cow, what a good movie!","Malcolm X is a powerful, three-hour tribute to which the man movie names itself. This epic of a film guides its viewers through the evolution of Malcolm X's philosophy in each phase of his life.Spike Lee could not have selected a better cast for this film. Denzel Washington delivers a performance full of heart and passion. Truly both Spike & Washington at the prime of their careers. There were times I was convinced I was watching the real Malcolm X many times in the film.For a biopic, the plot will be straightforward. Yet, I found the dedication to each tiny detail in each era of Malcolm X's life was both painstaking and rewarding. The set designs, costumes, and music were all loyal to the sign of the times. The film also follows each stage of Malcolm X's philosophies without saying which is right or wrong. The film is well-rounded and makes its audience understand each decision made.This movie is loyal to its source material and viewers can tell that Spike Lee did his research. It pushed boundaries as far as can be reasonably told in a three-hour movie. I also enjoyed the final montage as it showed Malcolm X's far-reaching impact. I was even surprised to see Nelson Mandela make a cameo in the film. You don't see that every day.4.5/5. A loyal and timeless classic from Spike Lee. Stellar performances by Denzel Washington and the crew. Doubt any other biopic about Malcolm X could top this.",9.0,Anonymous,History
fascinating figure from a great actor,"During the war years in Boston, Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) and his friend Shorty (Spike Lee) are zoot suit wearing, hair-straightening negroes about town. His father was a preacher in Nebraska urging a return to Africa and killed by the KKK. His mother was born to a black woman raped by a white man. He is taken by Sophia (Kate Vernon) and gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He leaves his innocent black girlfriend and goes into a life of crime. Malcolm and Shorty are imprisoned for 10 years of hard times. In prison, he is befriended by Baines who introduces him to Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. He falls in love with Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett).Director Spike Lee dives into a fascinating historical figure with the great Denzel Washington. His charisma is perfectly translated and transformed on the screen. That's not to say there are no problems in this movie. The pacing is a little slow at times. I don't want Spike Lee to act in this movie. It's too much of a distraction. Spike does lay out his life very well and leaves it up to audience to some extent on what his life truly means. The movie probably needs somebody with less reverence to be more merciless in the editing room.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good historical film with strong cast,"Denzel anchors this biopic about the life of activist Malcolm X. You learn about his young beginnings, youthful upbringing, how he became transformed into the Islamic leader, then his eventual disillusionment and further transformation.This story was a fascinating view with strong acting by Denzel. He seems to thrive in characters where he can go a little over the top though, and at times, that can get a bit tiring, much like in the more recent Fences, where his non-stop action is something you cannot keep up with. Malcolm X was a bit like that, but you saw that Malcolm had a deliberateness and an immediacy to his actions that pushed action.The setting was inner city with excellent costumes. His friend shorty and his other crew grew up to support and eventually adore Malcolm, but he also gained enemies. As his views started to venture from the strict Islam line, he created enemies.The film got a bit slow at times, but Angela Basset as his girl helped bring a nice evenness to the plot by solidly standing by her man thru thick and thin.This movie was a fascinating view of how a person can change colors, while always still doing the right thing according to their convictions. Such morals as Islam play a big role in our world today. Watching Malcolm X will help you understand how there can be good parts to it, but also abuses of it that are not good.I hope you enjoy Malcolm X.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A good and thorough biopic,"Malcolm X is definitely an important person in American history for the things he stood for and the things he had achieved. So I think it is an important film for whoever is interested in his life and/or that era in the US history.

"superior craftsmanship, Washington's performance, and a sobering mixture of history and drama","Malcolm X is many things to many people, but one can never say he didn't make a significant mark on his time and for 'his' people, as he and the Nation of Islam defined it. But 'his' was contingent on his religion, his experience growing up and being an 'Afro-American' in the United States, and as it turned out it was not set in stone. What Spike Lee's film does so compellingly is shine light on the history of the man and his place in a country with one of the most disturbing, racist histories in the world, and not make it too dogmatic or beyond reproach. On the contrary, this is one of Lee's most commercial works, made in epic form and imbued with his style at the top of his game. Only Do the Right Thing, in terms of his non-documentary features, tops this for sheer directorial virtuosity and intelligence with the subject matter.How much it sticks true to the autobiography of Malcolm X (as told to Alex Haley) I can't say yet, having not read the book. But for what it's worth, on its own terms, Lee crafts his story with the grandiosity appropriate to the character and the circumstances. Malcolm (Washington) is born to a religious man, but one who's killed by white people. He's denied his dream of being a lawyer and forced into labor. He becomes a criminal and is sentenced to 10 years for multiple counts of theft. And then in prison is changed around by Baines (Albert Hall), who converts him to the Nation of Islam and its teachings. It's mind-opening because, for the first time for him, his perception comes clearer than ever regarding the black experience- and what are really their rights, which have been few since the abolishment of slavery- and he becomes the big cultural figure he's remembered as.Even if one doesn't agree with all of the philosophy and speeches from Malcolm- and it's not hard to see why Malcolm had so many enemies, even from his own fold- it absorbs one not terribly familiar with what he was about in thought and practice and deed, and it gets the audience thinking one way or another about the nature of racism and race and separation in America. And past all that, it's directed with nerve and pizazz, while not going too far off into avant-garde. For all of Lee's success here as a storyteller, it wouldn't be quite the same without the star; oddly enough once he's off the screen- for the final ten minutes which becomes a long eulogy that drags on longer than necessary in nearing pomposity- it doesn't work as well. Every moment he's on camera, whether in the early years in Boston and Harlem as a thug or as X himself in full public figure mode on stage and behind closed doors, it's a reminder why he's the star he is. It's simply one of his very best performances, full of subtlety and wit and bigger-than-life bravura moments that usually (though not this time get Oscars.It's a period piece, it's a history lesson, it's a biography, and a testament to the possibility for a person to change. But above all else, Malcolm X works as a movie, and it's watchable in that big-movie-event kind of way without the usual drawbacks.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A travesty - no Oscar for Denzel,"Spike Lee newly acquired position as the top dog amongst Afroamerican directors with extremely high art-house appeal was put to good use with initiating the production of ""Malcolm X"". Based on his autobiography with slight parts edited in, updated or filled Spike Lee dares not to venture far from the source material giving this key figure in black activism an extremely accurate, albeit lengthy movie portrayal. Not backing down on a critique of the small-minded ""Nation of Islam"" Spike Lee also unabashedly takes on Malcolm X's point of view in the key breakaway from the movement by its biggest spokesperson.A huge figure for black America is gifted a great cinematographic autobiography, which only flaw is being too short while running over 3 hours. Certain key aspects of Malcolm X's life are glossed over (like his prison term or the fate of his mother), as is a glaring under-focusing on post-Hajj era of Malcolm's career, the one which in all essence has the most profound and lasting impact, also is most cited and revered. The road from rags to moral riches is a passionate and convincing one, especially in the gifted hands of Denzel Washington, the only person worthy of an Oscar in 1993 for Best Actor. Starting of from a low-life cat with sticky fingers and a jail-bird through a period of religious fanaticism, until finally discovering his own voice is a spectacular journey through his career, one that could well last 2-3 more hours and still not bore. Flashes into childhood are overwhelmingly brilliant in building context, focus and vividly present the remarkable life of a true American hero.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X-tra Long,"The challenge when reviewing biopics (particualrly when the protagonist was as contraversial and powerful as is the case here) is that critics and readers tend to become emotionally attached to the content / story - and potentially, it's accuracy to real events - as opposed to the success of the motion picture itself.Undoubtedly, Denzel Washington's acting performance was (of course) the highlight of this movie. A youthful, yet powerful portrayal of Malcolm Little / El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz / Malcolm X, Washington does indeed carry this movie with bold monologues and in the way in which his mannerisms and movements are such accurate depictions of the real-life character.There are some hugely provocative and contraversial lines in the movie - adding to the notion that Malcolm X did indeed follow a long and winding road through his religious and political ideologies. Look out for a description for 'how he likes his coffee' at the height of the Nation of Islam propaganda.However, and although not a particularly highbrow criticism, I would disagree with the sentiment that this motion picture was particulalry well-paced. It is nearly 3.5 hours in length and, even with that being the case, the editing (for me) is lazy in parts and watching it, my interest did dissuade in parts. Music doesn't really play a huge part in the movie - which I feel is a huge missed trick when you consider all of the possible options which Spike Lee had at his disposal.A great springboard performance from Denzel and a tough subect-matter to cover - but to rate this movie a 9 or 10 / 10 is overly-complimentary for me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Too long to keep interest!!!!,Frustrated by this one as it tries to cover too much ground and eventually gets to the point when you no longer care!!Its an interesting story and Malcolm X was surely a great and very inspiring speaker who I guess became almost bigger than the organisation he represented.I think the film could have been improved without the first hour which covers his early (pre prison life) as not that relevant and only serves to make the point that Malcolm X was a gangster who found Islam when he was in prison.All in all a it could have been OK if it wasn't so long. Do yourself a favour and watch a documentary instead!,5.0,Anonymous,History
I suggest reading the book. The movie is still fantastic,"Spike Lee's Malcolm X is an outstanding example of a movie that stays to its source. However, I feel it is necessary to tell people that the novel written by Alex Haley with the help of Malcolm X is even more important than Lee's spectacular movie. In Lee's film, Malcolm never reaches the level of honesty that he does in the novel. Instead, Lee uses everything else in his arsenal to tell this compelling story. He tells most of Malcolm young life through flashbacks that just don't seem authentic and they feel rushed, but at the same time his use of color, lighting, and sound is phenomenal. The first third or so of the movie it runs through Malcolm's life as a hustler and during this time Lee uses very bright lighting and colors to give this part of the film a feeling of joy and it almost feels like it is to good to be true. However, in the novel there is a completely different feeling when reading it. You feel sorry for everything Malcolm had to go through as a child and reading about him making bad choices never really feels happy at all. Along with the color, Lee does an amazing job in large crowds. There is a scene when Malcolm arrives in New York and there is a huge gathering in the street and the camera zooms out but you never lose sight of Malcolm because he is the only one wearing somewhat bright clothes. Lee take on Malcolm being this beacon of light perhaps? If you are thinking about watching this movie I highly recommend it and it shouldn't be missed, but you shouldn't miss out on the novel as well. Each are very important stories told in different, but honest, ways.",,Anonymous,History
X is for excellent,"Having never really known Denzel Washington before this movie, I was quite impressed by his performance.

"Engrossing, detailed and fearless biopic","Malcolm X, Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the street hustler turned spokesman for the Nation of Islam who was assassinated at the age of 39, is undoubtedly the director's most assured, complex and mature film, but it is a wonder that it was ever made at all. Controversy began long before production even started, with heavy criticism laid on the fact that Norman Jewison was lined up direct what many, including Lee, felt was a project a black director should handle. When Jewison gracefully bowed out and Lee took over, many still felt that the polarising activist's life would somehow be whitewashed, labelling Lee a 'Buppie' (middle-class African-American).The irony of many of the statements thrown at the biopic before it was even made was highlighted, and the resulting film was a 3 hour 20 minute testament to Lee's persistence at getting his hands on a story he had dreamt about making since film school. The studio had thrown in a budget for and insisted on a 2 hour 15 minute running time, but Lee, understanding that the contradictions and evolution of Malcolm's teachings and the many events and influences that helped shape the man demanded a longer running time. When the budget was exhausted, Lee called in for donations from the African-American community, and many of them obliged. Somehow, it's still too short to really get to heart of Malcolm, but it's certainly a far better film than it would have been had Lee not been so insistent at bringing his vision to the screen.Malcolm's life was crammed with incident, and Lee does a decent job getting almost everything in. Flashbacks to his childhood, when his mother and father were tormented by the Ku Klux Klan and his family lived under the constant threat of death, are juxtaposed with his early life as a sharp-suited, ambitious numbers runner in Harlem known as Red, working underneath gangster West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). His actions soon land him in prison, where he meets Baines (Albert Hall), a fellow inmate working for Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) and the Nation of Islam. Baines teaches Malcolm that the drugs and alcohol he enjoys so much are simply ways for the white man to keep the black man in their place, and that the white man is, without exception, the devil. Malcolm leaves prison as Malcolm X, ditching the 'slave name' given to him by his ancestor's owners, and is transformed into an extremely enigmatic and convincing spokesman for the Nation of Islam.The rush of excitement and danger of the opening third soon gives way to a more serious tone, as Malcolm's radical views on segregation under the watchful eye of 'the honourable' Elijah Muhammad makes him an incredibly controversial figure; loved, hated and feared in equal measure. Malcolm's popularity soon causes rifts and jealousy within the ranks of the Nation, and he sees the man who once took him under his wing become a deadly nemesis. His wife Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) receives threatening phone calls, and the family's house is set ablaze. Lee's technical discipline throughout these moments, especially for a director who usually embraces visual flourishes, ensures that a steady, gloomy momentum builds up towards Malcolm's eye-opening pilgrimage to Mecca and eventual murder.A film of such emotional weight also calls for a great performance, and Denzel Washington delivers in spades. Even when Malcolm is at his most questionable, Washington imbues the character with the same charm, wit and magnetism that no doubt saw him sore through the ranks of the Nation and become loved by many. When the pace sags, and it frequently does, Washington manages to draw you back in with his effortless screen presence. The film manages to paint a well- rounded picture of a man who underwent a few radical changes in his life, thanks both to Lee's thoughtful approach and Washington's incredible performance. Lee does go slightly overboard with his worship of the man at the climax, as Ossie Davis reads a eulogy over a montage of children declaring ""I am Malcolm X!"" and a speech from Nelson Mandela, but this doesn't do too much damage to what is engrossing, detailed and fearless biopic of an inspirational man.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A good movie,Denzel did a great job on this one. He truly is a great actor. I watched this after the documentary and must say that it is also historically accurate on many things.I do however want to make another point clear. The real Malcolm x can be seen as one of the most deluded person in history YET with also a very strong believe in his own deludeness lol. How else can any sane person become Muslim which is wrong on really everything. The religion of the moon god which is actually the religion of Satan.,7.0,Anonymous,History
A courageous intelligent leader!,"Your teachers just tell you that Malcolm X was pro-violence against whites when they educate you about him, but they don't tell you the whole story. Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, taught Malcolm X that all white people were the devil and that black peoples needed to separate from them in all way's in order to achieve the equality that is required. When Malcolm X visited Mecca and witnessed people of all races sharing the same beliefs and praying to the same deity, he decided to understand the truth. When Malcolm X returned to America, he told the truth and was assassinated for it. Jealousy is a powerful emotion that can destroy any solid bond.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The under-appreciated power of 'balance'.,"Disappointingly I felt, the majority of this film is devoted to the time of his life when Malcolm X was self-admittedly in error. In later years he was an inspirational man, but I spent most of the film hating him and the aggressive ideals he adopted for so long before his eventual renunciation. Unfortunately it seemed Lee was more interested in his dubious activities, instead of giving equal weight to BOTH sides of such a complex character.I understand that 'length' would have been a concern in evaluating this, but here is where I think Lee and his editor could have been more judicious in selecting crucial points of emphasis. They were certainly different men in a lot of ways, but in ""Ali"" I think Michael Mann did a much better job of capturing the overall essence of a person by zeroing in on pivotal moments and excising as much of what could be thought 'supplementary material' as possible. I still gave grudging respect to the composition even at times when I was dissatisfied with the path taken, though, because undeniably the scenes are exceptionally well-realised and blended together, throughout.If Spike had tried to balance it out and given more of the running time to Malcolm's conciliatory efforts then I would most likely be saying it was a masterpiece and calling it an honest and just portrait. When such a large amount of coverage is devoted to an 'unsavoury' element, it makes it seem almost as if 'extremism' is what we should most remember the man for. It isn't. I bitterly regret that what we were handed does not represent the 'even spread' that it should have.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Does a good job with handling its subject.,"Actually I can be very short about this movie; it's one that serves its purpose and serves it well. It's a biopic that does nothing else but telling you all of the right required information you need to know about Malcolm X.So it's a biopic and nothing more and nothing less really. You could say that this is enough, since it simply serves its purpose but I prefer a biopic with a clear story to it, that features a beginning, middle and end that are all connect and not a movie that chronicles the life of a person, through fragments. Or maybe at least something that makes the movie 'spectacular' and memorable to watch. Nothing about this movie stands out really. It remains on the safe side of things and I never felt really involved with the movie or any of its characters. It was like I was watching a moving history book. And again, there is nothing wrong with this but not the type of approach for a biopic that I prefer seeing.But really, the movie does a good job at telling you the life story of Malcolm X. When you are too lazy or incapable of reading a book and documentaries perhaps aren't your thing but you would still like to learn about Malcolm X; this is a good way to do it! Personally I knew very little about him, which I realized all the more after finishing watching the movie. I'm glad I watched it and feel more enriched now. And even while that the movie is almost 4 hours long I'm sure that the movie left a lot of things out, deliberately or not, I feel like it did a more than great job at covering all of the fundamental things you need to know about its subject.The one foremost thing I now especially respect Malcolm X for was that he made black people proud of their color and race, which also taught them to stand up for themselves and show them that they are worthy of all things that are great.It's definitely a well told movie. After all, it's over 3 hours long, yet it never starts to feel overlong or tiresome. It probably is because the movie is always moving. It doesn't linger too long on just one particular period of Malcom X's life and is being set at lots of different locations. It never becomes a movie that drags or slows down too much in any way, which is a real accomplishment for a movie this long. Spike Lee deserves lots of credits for that!The movie gets almost entirely carried by Denzel Washington, who earned a well deserved Oscar nomination for his leading role as Malcolm X. Even though he doesn't look very much like the real Malcolm X, he still convincingly becomes him through his acting and the love and passion he puts into his role. No doubt that a lot of the people involved shared a love and passion for its subject, which shows in the movie. You might question its objectivity because of that at times but it still makes this a good and more than maintaining movie to watch.The movie also does a great job at capturing all of its different time periods, which the movie is taking place in. The movie also still manages to maintain one style throughout, which lets the movie feel like one big whole.Well, I thought that I could be short about this movie but it seems like I failed at that. I could summarize it by saying that it's simply a really good biopic!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
A bit too long but well done,"Spike Lee created an epic in two parts. The first one illustrates the atmosphere of Malcolm's childhood and junior years and is less focused on the facts, the second one recites the story and leaves the atmosphere in the background. I cannot comment on the accuracy of the facts since I'm not familiar with Malcolm X's life, but I sense an effort to make him likeable to everyone. Of course this might be attributed to Denzel Washington, who does a remarkable job. The film has the right blend of personal and social life and it doesn't become cheesy except in the last minutes. It would be better for everyone if they didn't exist.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Too long to be called a good movie,"Overall, the movie is OK. And I am sure that people who appreciate the overruling and charisma Malcolm X possess would rate it higher. It definitely involves spectators into the life and mind of Malcolm IF it does not manage to kill you within the first hour. Which almost happened to me. Also, it gets repetitive towards the end, trying (to my mind) to state too obvious things to the audience. Which is OK when politicians address the masses convincing that the they have the only worthy cause at hand, however this is not proper for a movie.

About acceptance and about America. But, in same measure, it gives one of the most inspired performances of Denzel Washington.

Forget the Malcolm You were Taught in School.  This is a True Biopic in Every Sense of the Word!,"This movie changed my mind about who Malcolm was. I thought he was simply a demagogue and a hate monger. However, what I saw from this film, with its excellent acting--the chemistry between Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz as played by Denzel and Angela Bassett was amazing and palpable; and Al Freeman Jr.'s (Elijah Muhammad) accent was wonderful--was an evolving person, seeking truth about himself, God and his people.Some of the most intense and profound scenes include (spoiler ahead): Malcolm X getting an innocent man out of prison and the trip to Mecca, where he received a revelation that all whites are not ""devils."" The cinematography is especially amazing in this scene but the entire film steeps the viewer in the time and place of Malcolm.Malcolm was an individual of his time and I think the time needed him as much as MLK. With them, you saw the two different sides of black manhood--the pacifist and the firebrand--on their own terms and not of those created or caricatured by whites.Potent and relevant, Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is a must see by every American intent on learning about an oft-misunderstood individual.

Exciting and Dynamic Biopic!,"MALCOLM X (4+ outta 5 stars) Spike Lee's most ambitious project... and it is *almost* the film classic that he had hoped to make (I believe he wanted the Malcolm X bio to be an African-American ""Lawrence of Arabia""). Unfortunately, Lee's ego gets in the way a couple of times... not enough to ruin the movie... but he does get the eyeballs to roll a couple of times. First off (let me get the bad stuff outta the way first), when is he gonna outgrow that infantile ""A Spike Lee Joint"" crap? It was cute for some of his wacky indie comedies... but not a ""real"" movie... come on now! Second, why does the movie have to start with Spike walking down the street pretending to be cool in his zoot suit? Is this ""The Spike Lee Story""? Nope, it's ""Malcolm X""... so cut out those first 2 minutes please and start the movie out in the barber shop! Third, that dance number at the start is kinda cool (even if it is totally unnecessary) but, for the love of Lean, does it have to end with Spike sliding down the floor towards the camera, beaming out at the audience like this is some cheesy music video? Okay... time to let it go... all the bad stuff is over with in the first twenty minutes... everything that follows is pretty dang cool (which just makes those three lapses in judgment all the more annoying). Denzel gives a great performance as Malcolm... definitely the only actor who could have done the role justice. The script is great... telling the whole story... from Malcolm's less auspicious beginnings... to the revelations he discovers in prison... to his eventual role as one of the most eloquent and powerful speakers that the world has ever known. You don't even have to agree with everything the man says to realize that the man had a gift... and a voice that the world will know forever.

a travesty,"By focusing on, and even celebrating, the rise of Malcolm X and his legacy of heightened militancy in the Black Muslim movement of Elijah Muhammed, Spike Lee has totally butchered the point of X's autobiography, which ends with him embracing all of mankind and coming to grips with the anger(totally justified!)and resentment that he held for the whites he dealt with in his life. This should have been a story of inclusiveness, concluding with a certain joy instead of this childish ""I am Malcolm X"" black hero c***. Malcolm is a hero for everyone, and should be praised by everyone for his angelic ability to accept and forgive the world that so often wronged him. Why do you think Elijah Muhammed had him killed? Because he didn't feed on hate anymore, and wanted others to feel the same way. That would have destroyed the Black Muslim message, the most blameful of heresies. This is irresponsible, manipulative, self-indulgent film-making on a scale equal to ""Birth of a Nation"" as it rewrites history in an all too convincing manner. Shameful.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Sobering,You don't have to like all Spike's movies but you have to respect and appreciate this one. Casting is spot on. Proud notch in many of the actors who participated.

Malcolm X,"The first hour of Malcolm X is absolutely electric, one of the few times where Spike Lee has come close to matching the energy of his masterpiece ""Do the Right Thing"". Essentially a gangster flick, complete with vibrant colours and a perfect soundtrack. Interspersed are constant reminders of the reality Malcolm lives in but tries to ignore; we cut from a freeze-frame of him sauntering down the street to a flashback of a Klan raid on his childhood home. We see his house being burned down and his father being murdered. The editing is impeccable throughout, as is the pacing - it may be a platitude to say at this point, but it is true of this film that it didn't ""feel"" 200 minutes long. Nary a moment that doesn't hold complete attention, even when it slips into a more standard biopic for two hours. Several montages are breathtaking: the sequence of Malcolm's speech over newsreels of police brutality, then his face as he watches MLK denounce violence; or scenes depicting his pilgrimage to Mecca in documentary-style black-and-white, intercut with Elijah Muhammad's demise. The success of the movie primarily comes down to the strength of Denzel Washington's performance and of Spike Lee's direction. The former is consistently stunning, and an obvious example of Oscar-robbery, and the latter is on top form, using every opportunity available to showcase his visual prowess. The gliding overhead shots, the Altman-esque sequence where the camera moves 360-degrees, picking up fragments of different NOI speakers until returning to Malcolm; the tracking shot of Lee chasing Washington, then him laying face-down in front of the screen, pretending to be shot dead in an ominous moment of foreshadowing - it's all pretty brilliant. VO narration often feels perfunctory, and in its admirable breadth the film occasionally feels impersonal w.r.t. To its titular protagonist, but who cares when it builds to a climax this amazing; the heartrending cutting between Malcolm's burning house and that of his father's from earlier signals the end is nigh, as does the beautiful sequence of Malcolm's family arriving at the venue of his murder, set to Sam Cooke's ""A Change is Gonna Come."" The lengthy runtime helps us feel his tiredness, and by then we can sympathise with him standing still with the world moving forward regardless, and understand the acceptance in his eyes before his death. The last ten minutes are take-it-or-leave-it, a little out of place in this viewer's eyes but not overwhelmingly so - Lee's films are always about pushing a message for the current times, as shown straight away here with the opening image of a burning US flag, next to contemporaneous footage of the Rodney King beating. He has certainly made the link between film narrative and present-day moral takeaway through more clumsy and didactic means in his career, so the eulogy and Mandela tribute here hardly bothered me. A rousing, multifaceted portrayal of a significant historical figure, presented in epic fashion with a wonderful lead performance and wonderful directing, never once succumbing to the weight of its three-and-a-half hour running length.",8.0,Anonymous,History
brilliant,"Malcolm X, the Black panthers, soul brothers, power to the people,..those words spoken in the 60's and 70's spark images of riots, impatience, anger. And yet after the smoke has lifted (not cleared) we see layer by layer echoes of thoughts and sentiment from black ancestors who where silenced by the systematic social-polictical machinery. The 20' thru 40's were a MF for blks in the south. The popularity of radio and TV put social and economical issue in our living rooms. Ask yourself, as a dominating presence in America,and evaluating the Black role in it's economics would you stand and allow a system that basically ""tortured"" both physically and mentally an entire race? (exaggerating? hardly;). Ask the four girls in Alabama who died in the church bombing. What has this to do with X? Remember that bully in grade school? The one tha humiliated you and you could'nt do a damn thing about him? Remember now as an adult and meeting up with that bully?  This man was not a Castro, Stalin, or an Amin, he simply said if you swing at me, I'm going to swing back. You cannot appreciate a movie/documentary of thisman w/o knowing/bearing the pain. Sure he started out a hustler, pimp, drug pusher,addict etc. and eventually became one of the prominent leaders in the black community-(although not black America as a whole). Where would he be today? Probally on Larry King, maybe. Anyway this movie is based largely on the brilliant autobiography by Alex Haley nothing more, nothing less. Mr Lee's crown jewel. The reason it was shun at the Oscar's are obvious. Mr Washington's portral of Malcolm is uncanny, brilliant and possibly his best. (Oh sure I remember him getting the Oscar nod as a confederate slave in Glory as whitey crack his ass up and down with a whip). But for this so called black militant? Hollywood likes (or so they say) to award the ""feel good"" movies of the day. How about movies rated on their merits alone? You know what-F__ Hollywood!",,Anonymous,History
The Autobiography is Better,"Malcolm X, though noticeably affecting to American audiences, is not so much a stirring biopic as, say, ""Andrei Rublev"" (1966), or structurally innovative as Paul Schrader's ""Mishima"" (1985), or as crisp as Fincher's ""Zodiac"" (2007), but it is a fairly respectable work, held up by its ceaselessly fascinating subject. Thematically similar and with the same fire-and-fury be-damned-to-you attitude as Do The Right Thing (a far more visually creative, quick-paced, lively, idiosyncratic, stylized cultural landmark), this one is a lot more straightforward, and the only thing that really keeps it afloat is Washington's embodiement of Malcolm. It's fairly serviceable, but feels like it could've been made by anyone - it doesn't have that Spike Lee vibe that even his bad movies have - though at least here, he's pretty restrained and tones down his trademark over-the-top Spike-isms to deliver one of his more coherent and concise movies. A pretty typical biopic, though by no means a bad one, and relatively solid for a director whose entire body of work is a mixed bag. Despite some of its flatness, its still in the upper tier of his work. A fine watch, but not much more.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A story worth telling and told well,"Biopics are usually pretty formulaic and boring; but some people had interesting lives, few more so than Malcolm X, a street hustler who fell in with a creepy religious group but somehow came to inspire self-belief and resistance in a generation of black Americans. At the time of his death, he had left the cult behind and was broadening (without compromising) his beliefs; for which the cult had him murdered. Aside from its choice of subject, this film also benefits from some smart directing from Spike Lee, who experiments a little with the form but without losing the narrative, and of course for the impressive (and career-making) performance of Denzil Washington in the lead role. The script, meanwhile, lionises its hero, but is also impressively frank about what he, and the Nation of Islam, stood for, for good and ill. There's even a cameo in the final scene that should make anybody smile.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X,"I cannot imagine the hoops Spike Lee must have had to jump through to get any form of investment into either the concept or the production of this truly groundbreaking study of a man who divided opinion in a way few others have since the end of the Second World War. I say a study of man, but this is way more than just about him, it identifies and develops themes about inter and intra racial and gender attitudes and leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. All of that said, it does struggle as a piece of entertainment. I don't mean to trivialise the subject matter, but if it wanted to be a documentary then it should have been more tightly focused on fact and less on the dramatisation of events, some real, some not. As a biopic, it kind of falls between two stools. We are presented with, essentially, a collective of unpleasant individuals who either started out that way, or were corrupted by the environments in which they existed and/or created - clearly illustrated, for example, by the way the women are treated by their husbands/bosses etc. This left me with an overwhelming feeling that had there been more general respect and decency on offer here - across the board - then a lot of the violence from both ""sides"" might have been avoided. It is a must see movie, but perhaps time has robbed it of much of it's potency and left us with a sad reflection of a time when vileness didn't care about your colour.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Powerful Character Piece,"This movie felt like a true character piece film. Similar to Goodfellas in that way. You really get an idea of the kind of person X becomes through his life of racism and struggle. You see his philosophy morph. Denzal is incredible. A true display of acting .He should have gotten an Oscar. My main criticism is that it didn't go deeper into Malcolm's philosophy. There's was no mention of his Marxist views. Probably too controversial at that time. I feel as if a character piece movie has to include the formation and foundation of someone's philosophic views. It was a 3 hour movie, yet is missing this component.",8.0,Anonymous,History
X marks the spot.,"Although it is a little indulgent at over three hours in length, Spike Lee's biopic crackles with enough energy to keep you invested for its entire duration. Some earlier sequences could easily have been trimmed, but the runtime itself compounds the evolution of the focal character by simply having a lot of time separate his various stages of growth. When you reflect on where he is at the start of the picture to where he is at the end, you get a real sense of development not just because of the narrative itself but also because of the fact that you saw those early scenes quite a long time ago. Furthermore, the length of the affair adds to the sense that it's an epic, and its clear adoration of its protagonist makes it clear that it believes an epic is the only thing that can come close to conveying his importance. It kind of feels like 'Once Upon A Time In America (1984)', especially in its opening movement with its almost dreamy lighting and colourful recreation of its period setting. However, the feature does feel as though it's lacking some key information that could have been included in something of its size and it occasionally seems so laser-focused on its lead that it forgets to fill in the context around him. Still, while 'Malcolm X (1992)' definitely isn't perfect, it's almost always compelling and is often rather powerful. Spike Lee consistently makes movies that simultaneously reflect the period they depict and the period in which they're made, and his no-frills approach to the political and social resonance of his subject matter often leads to stark moments that grab you by the collar and remind you that the issues he's depicting have arguably never been more relevant than the moment he decides to depict them. Case in point: the opening credits cut between a slowly burning American flag (which stops its incineration in the shape of an X) and the real-life footage of Rodney King's vicious beating at the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department. This blunt and brutal opening both elevates Malcom X to almost untouchable status, eviscerates the idea of the American dream in a provocative way, and instantly makes you aware both that racism is alive and well in modern-day America (as it unfortunately still is, even over thirty years after this film's release) and that Spike Lee has no intention of tiptoeing around the issue or placating those not prepared to reckon with this harsh reality. While the remainder of the film arguably struggles to be as impactful as this deceptively simple yet instantly gripping opening promises it to be, it still manages to resonate on multiple levels and be every bit as important as it ought to be. It broadly follows the formula of biopics, but it inserts just enough style and urgency to avoid most of the pitfalls of its genre despite technically walking straight towards them. The final sequence, in particular, is phenomenal, building a palpable sense of ominous portent as Malcom X slides towards the venue of his final speech and erupting in an inevitable ruthless explosion of violence and tragedy. It also helps that Denzel Washington seems physically incapable of not commanding each and every single scene he's in, something which is more impressive considering how much of the runtime is dedicated almost solely to his performance. He is, unsurprisingly, really good, capable of portraying his real-life counterpart convincingly in each stage of his existence. Surrounding him are several other strong players - including Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassett, Albert Hall, Al Freeman Jr. And even Spike Lee himself - alongside a few notable cameos from the likes of Karen Allen and Peter Boyle. Plus, a young(er) Giancarlo Esposito and a pre-'Sopranos (1999-2007)' Michael Imperioli both turn up in the final hour. Ultimately, this is a resonant, ever-timely and often moving true story picture that's entertaining, horrific, inspiring and sweeping in equal measure. It's a really strong effort and it proves that Lee doesn't lose his sting when working with a bigger budget. I didn't appreciate the last-minute Bill Cosby jump scare, though.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Slick But Spiked With Too Much Bias,"Here we go with more Spike Lee bias. I'm not talking blacks vs. whites. We've come to expect that with Lee's films. What I'm referring to in this picture is another thing Lee does in many of his films - take cheap shots at Christians. What better stage than this one about a man who leaves his Christian roots and converts to Islam?Here, Lee goes out of his way to have the KKK mentioned several times and how they are ""good Christians."" An accomplice to many of Lee's bigoted films, unfortunately, is the fine actor Denzel Washington. Check how often Washington and Lee collaborate on films and how many of them play the ""race card."" Too bad because Denzel is a likable guy and a great actor. Lee is neither.At 201 minutes this a long film but an interesting one nonetheless. I can't say I was ever bored watching this.

Exciting,"The character of Malcolm X had always intrigued me, as well as that of Martin Luther King.This film, as long as it is fascinating, allows us to immerse ourselves in the story of Malcolm X, alias El-Hajj Malek El-Shabazz.The autobiography relates in detail the three key passages of his life:the beginning of his adult life, where he takes the path of illegal business and burglarieshis decade in prison, where he found his faithhis rise to become the famous pastor we know and all the vices and misfortunes that surround popularity, especially for an African American in the 1950s/60s.Spike Lee does not hesitate to depict the shocking words that Malcolm X could hold through a brilliant and charismatic Denzel Washington. We can also observe the wisdom that Malcolm X obtains through his experience. An experience that he obtains thanks to his multiple years spent fighting for the black cause in the United States.If like me you are interested or passionate about American history and Malcolm X, then the film will interest you. The direction and the actors are excellent in my humble opinion.A masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Fight Forward, Not Back","Malcolm X is one of the most prolific public figures of the 20th century. His journey and path to what he became and represented by the end of his life is one of the best examples of gaining wisdom with age. In his life, as shown in the film, he went from hustler, to prisoner, to an islamic black supremacist, to a loving Muslim, and then a martyr. He discovered for himself that fighting forward would be more beneficial for all in the long run, than to simply fight back.A Spike Lee classic. And i'd agree it got snubbed a best picture nomination.Denzel Washington did as good a job as any man could have done in portraying Malcolm X. He's gone on to became one of the very best actors and people in Hollywood, and I'd have to say one of the most respected. A Spike Lee classic.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An inspiring tale of man's capacity for change...,"... by examining the life of one man, Malcolm X, who changed tremendously over his lifetime.The film starts out focusing on Malcolm's life as a young adult. He was a zoot-suit wearing minor criminal who ends up in prison when he turns to burglarizing the homes of wealthy white people. There he meets an inmate who converts him to Islam, and specifically to Islam as practiced by the Nation of Islam, which called for total racial separatism.Out of prison, Malcolm rose to the top of the movement due to his great intelligence and gift for public speaking. But then the disillusionment begins - he discovers Elisha Muhammed is a corrupt person. And he also makes a pilgrimage to Mecca where he met people of faith of all races. His transformation into a much more inclusive person was not well received by many, and well known complications ensued.Interspersed with this is the tale of Malcolm's childhood - his fathers (probable) murder, his mother's resulting descent into mental illness, and the family being broken up.Spike Lee's direction is meticulous, ensuring that each phase of Malcolm's life is explored with nuance and historical accuracy. The film does not shy away from Malcolm's controversial rhetoric, nor does it diminish his later embrace of a more inclusive vision of racial unity. Instead, it presents a complex and multifaceted portrait of a man whose ideas and legacy continue to spark debate.The cinematography and production design vividly recreate mid-century America, from jazz-filled nightclubs to the fiery speeches Malcolm delivered to enraptured crowds. Terence Blanchard's score complements the narrative beautifully, and the inclusion of historical footage further grounds the film in reality.The acting is excellent. Many people have lauded Denzel Washington's performance, but if you've ever seen archival footage of Elisha Muhammed, Al Freeman Jr. Deserves kudos as well for his excellent performance.Some interesting things I noticed? That the Muslims in the film quote the Bible more than the Quran. Maybe that was because in 1992 the largely American audience would not know anything about the Quran, but they would recognize the characters and general teachings of the Bible. Also, I realized that perhaps cults sometimes have a usefulness, at least temporarily. Malcolm as he existed before he converted to the teachings of Elijah Muhammed was reckless, addicted to drugs, and into crime. Nothing short of extreme structure and a sense of purpose was going to change that. The Nation of Islam provided these things. Once Malcolm had reformed and could think for himself he outgrew the Nation and could see the corruption at the top and that people of all races were deserving of empathy.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Long, Slow, Too Wordy And Biased","Denzel Washington is a swell, pure gold actor, he can save and grace any movie he is in, and yes, he is great here, but this endless, unimaginable 3 hour and a half mammoth kills all his endeavors and assets burying them under a lead stone sheet of pretentiousness, boredom, and what is the worst offender, a very heavyweight preachy tone which becomes more and more acidic sour and then simply makes you cringe and run for some lightweight family comedy. What is also wrong? Bad pacing, very badly conceived flashback scenes and a very very tedious plot. Generally, such films are often a victim of their own weight - they sink like a marble brick, and they are too wordy. Like here, it is the same endless amount of smart speeches and oratories, but after two hours you feel a strong desire to switch to Mr. Bean or Benny Hill. Malcolm X was not a good man and he fell a victim of his own faith, we know that, and what he preached was wrong. So, no matter how much Spike Lee and Denzel tried, they failed to make us like this cold, ruthless, icy man of no sorrow. I felt no sorrow either for him or for his work, and the documentary footage of great late Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr only proved how much better this Baptist minister was than that loud and brash preacher. The film only hit the nail on the right head",2.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Classic,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music****Note this will be my last entry for this legend actorToday's movie review is director Spike Lee's epic screen biography portrayal of Malcolm X (1992) which stars my man Denzel Washington as the civil right leader. From the get go we cross to the police beating of Rodney King where the American flag is burnt into the shape of the letter X. It jumps to World War II era where we see a younger Malcolm X living as a hustler and see flashbacks of his parents where his father was murdered by the Klu Klux Klan. His hustling days turn into crime and imprisonment. In jail we see a transformation as he is introduced to Islam through the teachings of Elijah Muhammad. Rejecting his slave name, he adopts the name Malcolm X and once released from prison works with Elijah Muhammad and is a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. From here we see his marriage, his public speeches, the dissection within the Nation of Islam and his further transformation - renouncing his separatist beliefs and embarks on a pilgrimage to Mecca. During a speech in 1965 Malcolm X is assassinated.Now this is how you make a biopic, Lee's passion of this character definitely can be seen with over 3 hours long you can tell the director Lee gave it his all, it is literally his masterpiece with covering the relevant dressing, music compilation and the feel of what Harlem was during three different eras. The movie is controversial, bold and information - I didn't know the full details of Malcolm X but watching this movie with so much detail was enriching both at an entertainment point of view and at a spiritually sense where you see the transformation of one man's life from a street hustler to a separatist and finally overcoming his own prejudices and becoming a lifetime important leader, not just in the Afro-American groups but for everyone especially Muslims.Lee brings all manner of styles and tones in the chapters of Malcolm X from his troubled youth as Little and his other alias Detroit Red, his conversion to Islam and his transformation as Malcolm X, his ministry and his pilgrimage to Mecca. And Denzel delivers in all different stages of the life of Malcolm X. Lee's masterpiece is due to Denzel at the helm playing a complex individual at ease and convincing where at times I actually thought Malcolm X was Denzel Washington and the fact he lost the Oscar is shocking and amazes me the movie did not receive any other recognition. Through his performance you can see the internal struggle, the spiritual changes in one man's life, his inner fire, intellect, insecurity, pride and how one man doesn't let fate deal all of the cards but rather how each of us have the power to change our own lives - that is Malcolm X. Very inspirational and educational, a timeless movie for all time - overall 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A perfection of history and one special man 8/10,"Malcolm X is a perfect movie that depicts the life of a nation's great leader. Malcolm X was a truly special person and so a movie about him is a great idea. One of the african american nation's biggest leaders deserves a well made movie and Spike Lee offers one. Denzel Washington proves again that he is among the best actors ever, I think I already said it before. The imagination between him and Malcolm X is crazy cause they look exactly like each other. Even Spike Lee appears for quite a while on screen. From how I see it, in my point of view. The movie is divided in to two parts: the first part of the film is the life of Malcolm before he turned to Islam and became a public figure and the second part of the film is when he already is a public figure till his death. I mostly love the second part of the film when you see Malcolm at the rise of power and how he has become one of the more famous public figures. How he gets in to arguments with the nation of Islam and his ultimate downfall. The cinematography was brilliant with a lot of great colors and dark light. I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and learned more about the famous human rights activist than what I knew already. Even though his way and many of his acts were extreme, much of what he did was the opposite of other national leaders. I still find his character to be interesting and clever.

The Quintessential Black History Film,"""Malcolm X"" is a three and a half hour historical epic from legendary filmmaker, Spike Lee. The film is a retelling of the life and legacy of American civil rights activist, Malcolm X. It's based on ""The Autobiography of Malcom X,"" co-written by Malcolm X and journalist Alex Haley. Denzel Washington leads the cast as the titular role. The supporting cast features Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz (wife of Malcolm X), Albert Hall as Baines (Malcolm X's mentor), Al Freeman Jr. As Elijah Muhammad, Delroy Lindo as West Indian Archie (Malcolm's former gang mentor), Kate Vernon as Sophia (Malcolm's former love interest), and Spike Lee as Shorty (Malcolm's childhood friend). ""Malcolm X"" is Spike Lee's sixth movie - and one of his greatest achievements as a filmmaker.Denzel Washington is the star of this film. By a large margin, Denzel leads the cast with such courage and grace that echoes the aura of Malcolm X. Denzel is unyielding in his portrayal. His delivery is stern and bold. He steals each scene. As an actor, Denzel successfully conveys Malcolm's progression throughout the different stages of his life. As younger Malcolm, Denzel embues immaturity. His delivery of lines is light. There's no strength or bass in his voice. His posture is more soft. In contrast, as Malcolm progresses into the Muslim activist recognized throughout the annals of American history, Denzel evolves. His demeanor is unshaken. His posture is intense. His delivery is strong. He transforms into the muse of empowerment that Malcolm X was. Angela Bassett holds her own with Denzel. Her potrayal of Betty Shabazz compliments the titular character. She is soft, yet not meek. Strong in every essence. Bassett's portrayal of Betty is a match to Denzel's portrayal of Malcolm. She exudes elegance and beauty in each scene. Simply put, Denzel and Bassett are a match made in heaven. The supporting cast a fine pieces to Lee's greatest puzzle. They each lend a sensation of authenticity needed to speak on the amazing life of such an influential figure.This movie is epic. Each stage within the film is projected with accuracy - and once again, authenticity. From Malcolm's childhood living in a small home - you feel the isolation and terror he experienced. Malcolm's childhood is associated with the helplessness that comes with being a young victim of racism. Spike Lee and cinematographer Ernest Dickerson successfully capture the horror of prejudice. Malcolm's years as a young adult are showcased through the wonder and spectacle the Harlem Renaissance. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter use of hue on the clothing within this period is amazing. The use of bright colors and lively jazz makes the first hour of the film hard to step away from. The streets of Harlem feel like they were ripped right out of a 1950's technicolor musical. This portion of Malcolm's life is vibrant, yet chaotic because of his immaturity. Lee and Dickerson showcase this by making this time in Malcolm's life feel like a party that went entirely too long. The after party is not pretty. Malcolm's stint in jail is portrayed as another period of isolation - however this time its isolation for the sake of consequence and self-growth. The film transforms Malcolm from an immature street gangster into the legend he's recognized for being. This period is portrayed as very dull and bare. It feels like a period of introspection. Lee and Dickerson succesfully capture this by making scenes feel small and less grandeous. The shots are tight - and at certain times, the setting feels suffocating. When Malcolm goes from little to X, the world and scope of the film becomes bigger. The set feels full. The cast feels grand. The stakes feel much higher. Malcolm transforms into a bombastic figure - at times iconic. One of the film's best moments are the scenes in Mecca. Being the first flim ever shot in Mecca, ""Malcolm X"" portrays the Islamic faith as a religion of beauty and brotherhood. These scenes felt as epic as watching ""Lawrence of Arabia"" for the first time. Lee and Dickerson made this film a visual mastercraft. Epic is an understatement.Thematically, ""Malcolm X"" touches on many hard topics. Race is the centerpiece of the narrative. Spike Lee addresses race in a manner that is tangible. He does not aim to guilt, nor finger point. Rather, he highlights an ugly time in American history. It's an honest portrayal of race and racism in America. He uses the different stages of Malcolm's life to reflect the different stages associated with racial consciousness. Malcolm starts his journey assimilated into white culture. Overtime, he grows to resent whites. By the end of the movie, he accepts white people and opens up his mind to the concept of racial equity and harmony. The progression is natural and poetic. The film addresses Malcolm's flaws and strengths with truth. Religion is another topic discussed within the film. Lee juxtaposes Malcolm's muslim faith with the systemic teachings of Christianity. Often, Lee showcases the practice of the islamic faith with grace. He also addresses the hypocrisy associated with organized religions in general. Religion is a core part of the film - and it never feels offensive, nor inauthentic. Largely, ""Malcolm X"" was written with a mature audience in mind. It opens discussion for the rational - yet leaves much room for interpretation and contrarian viewpoints.Overall, ""Malcolm X"" is the quintessential Black history film. It's unwavering in its portrayal of many ugly American truths. It's a visual monument to one of America's greatest historical figures. Undoubtedly one of Spike Lee's greatest contributions to cinema. It's Black high art that polishes the legacy of an icon - who built a bridge between race and religion By Any Means Necessary.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X Film Review,Malcolm X is someone that is known by many. A iconic black activist and leader that tried to make a difference. He was assassinated in 1956 but his legacy and memories still live on. This movie was in a sense a tribute to him and was a great movie to watch. The actors performance was phenomenal and each scene was excecuted very well. There are many different biographies and movies about iconic people in history that don't always do it justice however this movie did it's part.

A great story reduced to a series of cinematic snapshots,"The film charts Malcolm X's metamorphosis from Harlem hustler to one of the two most important African- American leaders of his time, but , in emotional terms, it doesn't dig very deep. One understands how Malcolm X changes but not why he changes.  The scenes--some of which are extraordinary --are self-contained, they don't  link up emotionally with one another. The result is a cinematic slide show (""first this happened, then this... then this"").  And the coda (much like those in Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan) is unnecessary and embarrassing.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Graphic but striking strong messages that are still not heard today,"I'd like to start by saying that I enjoyed Malcolm X more than Do the Right Thing. Spike Lee did a better job here with the storytelling, the plot was more polished and the message was clear. If Do the Right Thing left me with mixed feelings, then Malcolm X made me respect Spike Lee's work. I might not agree with every decision he made but I can respect him now. I talked about this movie with some of my friends and, to my luck, one of them actually met Spike Lee when he spoke at my friend's university. Spike Lee talked about how hard it was to make this movie. Tackling a historical figure is always hard but the graphic historical situation of Malcolm X and his civil rights movement proposes a few extra challenges as well.Denzel Washington's performance was spectacular in this movie. I've seen a few of his films, mostly action flicks, and I never knew of his acting capabilities as a spokesman. Some of the language coming from his mouth surprised me too. At least he made the 3-hour runtime interesting. Spike Lee had a smaller role in this movie but he used his screentime well. Or at least he didn't have enough screentime to piss me off this time. The scenes with a large number of people were the most impressive ones",8.0,Anonymous,History
As good as it gets,"Why the movie and Denzel Washington didn't get ""Best"" Oscar's is beyond comprehension. Washington, Hollywood's best actor, gives it all he's got and Lee has made an epic and, certainly his best work. Washington has to play Malcolm at 3 very different stages of his life. The film is filled with top notch supporting cast, like the always watchable Angela Bassett, Al Freeman Jr., and nicely interwoven voice overs by Washington. I've seen it six times, because I think acting doesn't get any better. A superb film with a first rate cast. A recent issue of Forbes had an article on what actors bring in the most money per film. Needless to say, Washington, who has had very few duds, is Hollywood's top moneymaker. No surprise.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Most underrated film of the '90's?,"This is a brilliant mosaic of a man changed by words, ideas, emotions and strong beliefs. It surpasses in emotion the film ""Ghandi,"" and at its heart is really an urban ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I was left numb viewing the scene of X's murder. His death was so needless, so wasteful. Yet Spike Lee does not over-glamorize X, who at one point tells a willing white girl that there is nothing she can do to help blacks. This is certainly one of the best films of the 1990's. One may not agree with X's views or beliefs, but you have to respect the man who will walk what he talks. And also respect Spike Lee for directing Denzel Washington's career-defining performance.

Spike Lee's Finest film,"I consider ""Malcom X"" to be Spike Lee's finest film, better than ""Do the Right Thing"". Denzel Washington gives the performance of the decade in the title role of ""Malcom X"". This film is 3 hours and 21 minutes long and it is never boring for a second and is always entertaining. This film tells the entire story of Malcom X, from a street thug to an civil rights activist. Spike Lee makes films about race relations in america, and I feel that he really got his point across with this film. This is a powerhouse film not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
X Misses The Spot,"I was keen to watch this bio-pic of the life and times of black activistic leader Malcolm X. I've recently watched a Netflix series principally investigating his murder but also documenting his past and have a general interest in the politics of the 50's and 60's, including the Civil Rights struggle in America.Perhaps that was my mistake. I was pretty captivated by the real Malcolm I saw in the documentary, impressed by his appearance, speaking voice and latterly his message, once he freed himself from merely spouting the teachings of the Nation of Islam religious group. Denzel Washington, being the prominent black actor of his day was, I guess the natural choice for the lead and it was no surprise to see the film directed by Spike Lee either.I have to come out and say though, that I found the film to be way too slow and long. We get well over an hour of Malcolm's formative years with it seeming obvious to me that Lee was much happier filming this part of the movie as we check out some sharp-dressed black individuals shucking and jiving on Harlem, none sharper than the young Malcolm himself, throwing themselves around on the dance-floor. Naturally, Lee again gives himself his own customary good part in the process as Malcolm's buddy Shorty. The choreographed moves and flashy outfits, plus for no real reason, an appearance by Billie Holliday seem to me to have no other purpose to be in the movie other than to fan Lee's vanity and own sense of wish-filfulment.Finally though, after a long spell in jail for housebreaking, Malcolm is converted to the Nation of Islam adopts the name Malcolm X and through his eloquence, intelligence and industry rises through the ranks to become the organisation's second-in-command directly below its figurehead, the Honourable Prophet Elijah Mohammed. From there he becomes a national figure in America with his provocative speeches advocating active black resistance to the oppression of the white man, before he breaks with the group over the Prophet's personal behaviour, siring numerous children with attractive young female followers and with ill-considered offensive remarks of his own made directly after JFK's assassination. It all ends up with frighteningly real depictions of the fire-bomb on his house, with him, his wife and four young children inside which occurred just a week before his inevitably brutal assassination at the Audubon Ballroom in New York, reportedly by House of Islam disciples.It's clear that Lee was determined to raise awareness of Malcolm in the public consciousness, which is all very laudable but I think he goes overboard in almost sanctifying him by lining up a bunch of school-kids to say ""I am Malcolm X"" to the camera and even garnering a cameo appearance by Nelson Mandela singing his praises. I also felt that Washington didn't get sufficiently inside the character to convince me he was Malcolm and doesn't even try to adopt his distinctive vocal delivery.Like I said, on the whole I found the film too wordy, too static and too imbalanced to really work as a movie. I appreciate that back when the movie was made there was perhaps a case for this adulatory, non-critical examination of his life but if you want a history lesson on the man and his mission, I think there are now a number of documentaries as well as books out there which will give a better rounded picture of this complex, charismatic and in the end tragic individual.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Spike Lee at his best.,"A movie like this demonstrates the extraordinary talent of Spike Lee. Amazing on all levels.  The direction, cinematography, acting, script, etc could not be improved upon.The story is compelling as well, although naturally it fits more to Malcom X's interpretation of historical events.  Other biographies of X have suggested some inaccuracies in his perception of history, but that is only natural.  Anyway, it demonstrates that Malcom X was a hero, worthy of universal praise.  Before and after his reform he spoke the truth.  I prefer the pre-Mecca Malcom more than post (even though I'm white), and this movie concentrates on that era of his life as well as his early childhood and days as a criminal.  Excellent history and biography, as well as understanding of the workings of the man by Spike.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Best Movie of 1992 without any doubt,"I really figured this movie would not get best picture but to my surprise it was not even nominated.. It's too controversial a movie to ever win a best picture oscar and as has been shown before the idiots at the academy hate different movies (Apocalypse Now, Clockwork Orange, JFK). This movie is powerful throughout and once  get hooked in it u stay hooked in it. the first hour introduces us to Malcolm and the events in his life that shaped him as a grown man and figuring how his father was killed by the KKK and his family split by a government agency, there really can't be any blame towards him for his hatred of whites along with the fact that blacks were abused and treated unequally at that time. Spike Lee gives a great analysis of Malcolm X and doesn't stoop to making him a heroic myth but rather portrays the truth and contrary to most critics he doesn't put in his racial bias.. When a white student asks Malcolm if she could help him with his struggles, he replies no and walks away but instead of just ending it there we see the hurt look on the student as he walks away.. It's a great movie and a great tribute to a great man and the speeches in the movie tremble with fury and grasp u.. the prologue has got to be a highlight.. The Rodeny King tape airs as if to reinforce Malcolm X's speech showing how things are still the same today and when the flag burns to an X, its as if his words are breaking the very foundations of America and exposing its injustices to the world.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Self indulgent and way too long,"I remember reading during the production of ""Malcolm X"" director/writer Spike Lee saying in an interview that he needed this movie to be over three hours long. He said that all of the great movie biographies were over three hours so this movie would be too. If a lengthy running time is a director's primary goal, his priorities are out of wack. A director's primary goal should be telling a good story. However, the very long running time isn't the only problem with ""Malcolm X"". The first half (the weaker half) is filled with distracting costumes, camera movement, dance numbers and endless cameos. For a while I thought this movie was going to have more cameos than ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Another problem is Spike Lee's misuse of music. It pops up at the wrong times and takes you out of the drama of the scene. On the plus side, the acting is very good. When this movie was released film critics Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert said that movie was made for all audiences. That not true. ""Malcolm X"" was made for a very specific, very small audience.

A hallmark to humanity.,"With this epic biographical tale of Malcolm Little who becomes the great political, religious, and cultural leader known as Malcolm X Spike Lee ascends from the platform of good directors to the pantheon of the great. This film is an excellent example of what a director like Spike Lee is capable of when he is willing to set aside his agenda and simply tell a story about people, places, and moments that are very meaningful to him. Malcolm X is at once one of the best among biographical and spiritual films (And spiritual without shoving religion down the viewer's throat.) and is perhaps the most enlightening film I've ever seen.  This film has everything.  Great photography by Ernest Dickerson who has worked with Lee on many previous productions, but seems to be even better here, a terrific screenplay, astounding performances by Denzel Washington and Angela Basset, and all of it comes together brilliantly to encompass an individual's life in a way that perhaps other productions have never as fully succeeded. Throughout the course of the film though you may not always agree with Malcolm's philosophies, actions, and words you can at least appreciate the metamorphosis he goes through.  I don't know if I've ever seen or heard of an individual growing as much as Malcolm X does in this film, constantly transcending yesterday's mold and always aspiring to something greater. This is truly a great film.  Lots of films have style, some have content, few have depth, but this one is an amazing amalgamation of all three and is a great tribute not only to Malcolm X, the makers of the film, but to the indomitable spirit of humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Engrossing effort from Spike Lee,"Although this is clearly not Spike Lee's best film which is without doubt the brilliant ""Do The Right Thing"", Malcolm X is an engrossing film which manages to captivate you for three hours.

Following Malcolm's autobiographical text the film deals with the turbulent career of this often controversial leader. On a parallel with the film Denzel Washington in the lead role improves as it goes on, pulling off Malcolm's mannerisms very effectively.

An Excellent Biopic about a Civil Rights Icon,"Spoilers ahead.Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is a highly worthy biographical drama that rightfully stands alongside ""Gandhi"" as a timeless classic. This movie goes deeply into the life of Malcolm X, and analyses the decisions he made in life that led him to be one of the most important figures in the American Civil Rights Movement. This movie does not shy away from discussing such important events as Malcolm's ""Chickens Coming Home to Roost"" speech regarding JFK's assassination, which resulted in him being silenced by Black Muslim leader Elijah Mohammed. Malcolm's pilgrimage to Mecca, his conversion to mainstream Islam, and his gradual realization that not all white men are evil, and that even Christianity need not be rejected as a spiritual guide for black people, was shown so subtly and gradually that the audience can accept such a transformation as credible. The audience sees Malcolm X's evolution as a human being and they are convinced that, while he was a genuine and powerful leader within the Black Muslim religion and a heartfelt spokesman for their cause, he was also a consistently evolving person, filled with self-doubt and prone to making mistakes. Spike Lee has done in excellent job in presenting the full story of the life of Malcolm X, while also humanizing him and even going so far as to counter the criticisms that Malcolm was a spokesman for ""violence"" and racial hatred, as opposed to Martin Luther King, Jr's message or racial equality and peaceful civil disobedience. The movie shows that Malcolm's sermons and viewpoints were much more complex than simply advocating racial separation. Spike Lee analyses Malcolm's views with such details that the viewer will at least empathize with Malcolm and understand his speeches and why he felt the way he felt.I highly recommend this movie for people interested in American history, or those who are simply fans of biopics. This was a movie that was worth all the hype it received back in 1992.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Golden film in the history of cinema,"Malcolm x is an icon of freedom and human rights for Negroes in USA and he was the second side of this evolution for Negroes beside Martin Luther King the Christian side for this evolution an X was a Muslim side in this time to make a great change in the American society by destroying the system of Rascism in America.Denezel Washington succeeded in his mission for playing this role in a goodly way which was the great reason for him to be a great actor in this time beside Sidney Poitier , Dany Glover , Will Smith.The script of this film was justice and pure by making a balancing for X with double sides of his life (good and bad) in the beginning of his life as a prisoner because of his crimes and the great cause of his hating to white people after their killing to his father who resistant the racism of white people in America. Iam so happy to see an important point in this film that it showed the turning point of his life after his entry in the Islamic religion and this religion is the great cause of entering and recording his name in the pages of eternity and that is the evidence for western people around the world that Islam is the religion of building not a religion of destroy, the film said that between their scenes that the thermometer of making the goodness or badness for anything the humans by the bad use of Loniga Mohamed the religion for his special principles and Malcolm x understood the factual core of Islam after his journey to the holly land in Meca at the occasion of Haj and for the Egyptian land an the rest of countries in Islamic world and the scene of his praying in mosque of Mohamed Ali in Cairo is looks like the factual photograph in reality.At the end after the assassination scene The cleverness of film s, stuff that they choose Nelson Mandela the great leader of Africa and the icon of freedom that he said his principles that the legacy of humanity said that we are in equilibrium by living in one land with the same tools and principles without making any racism between different colors and at the end all children in the school said in one tung and quote (Iam Malcolm X).",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Brilliant Portrait of a Misunderstood Figure,"This review comes from the perspective of a white male who was raised in a predominately white, rural, and conservative Midwestern town. The history we were taught of the civil rights era in America seemed to skim over a lot of the perspectives of black activists at the time and shed perhaps a little bit too much self-indulgence on the ""good"" white people who helped end Jim Crow. It is breathtaking to watch all of this unfold and to learn a lot of truths and a perspective on racism in general that I lacked beforehand. I can understand Malcolm's (Denzel Washington) frustration with the white supremacist society that he lived in (something that I believe we are still under, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent today than back then). A lot of his teachings were completely contradictory to the myths that I had heard about him growing up; I was taught to think of him as something akin to the inverse of a white Klansman. Which is a bit silly when you think about how black people had been (and still continue to be) oppressed for so long in this country and most of what Malcolm preached was for black people to embrace self-love and dignity. He did preach a few things earlier on in his life that were slanderous of an entire group of people, but he made strides to amend those statements and came to a more refined and enlightened point-of-view towards the end.I wish that the movie contained a little bit more on his post-Mecca life, where he embraced true Islam and shed a lot of the cult-like legitimate white-hating beliefs that the Nation of Islam spread. That portion of his life admittedly only took up less than a year of his life, but it would have been interesting to see his ""the Ballot or the Bullet"" speech and his lone interaction with Martin Luther King. The movie's a little bit long in the front end and brushes through to finish.Denzel Washington is great. This is an amazing eye-opening biopic from the 1990s that is still very relevant today as America still deals with a lot of the same issues.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"One of Spike Lee's best movies, featuring one of Denzel's best performances","Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" is an ambitious biographical movie about the life of the titular human rights activist, a controversial figure whose influence has been considerable. Regardless of your opinion of the man, his life makes for a fascinating subject as we trace his early years as a criminal, his time with the Nation of Islam and his acrimonious break from that group, culminating in his violent death.First of all, Denzel Washington was made for the title role. He not only looked the part; he effortlessly captured the essence of what made Malcolm X a powerful presence. His Oscar-nominated performance was undoubtedly awards-worthy. There were also standout performances in supporting roles from the likes of Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo & Albert Hall, among others.In the director's chair, Spike Lee successfully brought his vision of an epic biography to the screen. The varied cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and the evocative score by Terence Blanchard (both frequent collaborators of Lee's) were important contributions in this vein. Frankly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher that a film with such impeccable production values only garnered one Oscar nomination in the technical categories (in this case, for costume design). Even Spike Lee was unaccountably snubbed.With a runtime of over three hours, the script provides us with a story that's engrossing enough to captivate our attention from beginning to end. Some of the political viewpoints espoused are questionable to say the least but, ultimately, a compelling case is made for Malcolm X as a positive influence on civil rights. If anything, the openness to showing multiple sides of the man makes the film all the more intriguing.Overall, I think that ""Malcolm X"" is a fascinating epic character study in the tradition of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Awards recognition may have been minimal at the time of release but I think that the movie has definitely stood the test of time, as its 2010 induction into the National Film Registry attests.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Evolution of a Man,"This film is probably the most successful attempt at penetrating the biography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley. Previous generations have attempted to dent the literary text by adapting it for the screen, as well as numerous stage shows (of which Denzel appeared in one), but this offering is the only work of art that paints Malcolm X with careful brush strokes. Is this down to Spike Lee's direction? or is it a result of what Denzel brings to a period drama? This film is Spike's only period drama. He tends to make social commentaries on contemporary society, but this installment was an exception. Denzel Washington has a natural home in period dramas ('A Soldier's Story', 'Cry Freedom', 'Glory'), and it was this project that enabled him to shine as a historical figure. If anyone else had played the role, then I don't think they would have captured Malcolm X in the same way. Therefore, I would say that this is a Denzel Washington film as opposed to a Spike Lee film because Denzel excels in period dramas whereas Spike is a social commentator on contemporary urban society.",,Anonymous,History
Spike Lee's Great Epic,"Spike Lee is an uneven filmmaker: some of his films are great, some are, well, not. This is one of the great ones, probably the greatest.The performances in this movie are tremendous, led by Denzel Washington. What makes his achievement particularly impressive is that he essentially has to play two completely different characters. First, Malcolm Little, the fast-talking petty thief and hustler who travels back and forth from Boston to New York. And second, Malcolm X, the serious (but human) preacher and public face for the Nation of Islam. Both are utterly believable and essential for the success of the film. Secondary parts are also uniformly excellent.The story of the film is very detailed. The movie follows the Alex Haley book pretty faithfully. Sure, there are a few things added to move things along. For instance, Malcolm's conversion in prison wasn't quite as dramatic as portrayed in the film (he had originally heard about Islam in letters from his family in Michigan, for instance). But by and large it was pretty close to the book. Perhaps even too faithful, considering that the movie clocks in at over 3 hours long. I think there may have been some things he could have taken out.Malcolm X was a complex man. For good or ill, Malcolm X was not someone to do things with a partial effort. When he was a criminal, he was a determined, almost crazy criminal. When he converted to Elijah Muhammed's Nation of Islam, he believed in his heart and soul in that, and preached the NOI party line even though he himself was obviously a natural leader. When Elijah Muhammed betrayed him, he became a more orthodox Muslim and preached that with equal vigor. Hate him or love him (and over the years, he said many things which deservedly were met with scorn by blacks and whites alike), he was a force to be reckoned with, and this film does an admirable job of bringing that out.",9.0,Anonymous,History

As Malcolm X he projects so well, but it was his attitude of revenge against the whites and authorities that brought him down.

Should have won an Oscar,Malcolm X was an excellent movie. Many say that Malcolm was a contraversial character. But in truth he wasn't. He was the black product of the centuries of racism and opression that blacks endured.  His father was murdered by the Klan. His mother couldn't understandably handle the stress and ended up in a mental institution(That part was in the book by Alex haley The Autiobiography of Malcolm X on which the movie was based) him and his siblings were split up by the state. Malcolm once told his teacher that he wanted to be a lawyer and his white teacher told him that it wasn't a black man's profession and that he should be a carpenter or plasterer(I forget which). If most men faced what young malcolm did by their 21st birthday most would have gone mad. true he was also a criminal in his youth and went to prison which was a saving point in his life. He then does a complete 180 degree turn in prison and gives his life to Islam.Although he hated whites during his NOI days he goes to the Mecca and sees Muslims of all races and starts to lose his hatred for whites. Case in point is that Malcolm's life was about constant change. Without change we cannot adapt and thus cannot hope to survive.,,Anonymous,History

One of the top 10 Films of all Time.,"Make NO mistake:It is HARD as heck to do a bio-picture, I don't care WHOM it is about.To do it as a major release feature film is even harder but Spike Lee pulls this off and it is as great and as epic  -- even moreso -- as any bio film out there.It tells the story of Malcolm Little who becomes Malcom X, one of the most recognizable names of African American and American History of the 60's.

It shows a man -- a very strong but conflicted man and his changes, but a man none the less who believed in what he believed in to the dismay of many in a time, not to long ago in America, where the voices and ideas of minorities were stiffled.The very important element of this film of course of the casting of Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. This is one of those rare instances where you forget about ""nice Denzel, the actor"" and he becomes that lead character. His Academy Award Nomination for this character was very well placed.Another rare and haunting roll was that of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad played by Al Freeman Jr. on the same Academy Award calibre as Denzel's performance.Spike Lee's direction (what a wonderful ""eye"" he has!), Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Production Design by Wynn Thomas, the Casting of Robbi Reed-Hume (who won the casting society's award for casting of Malcolm X and rightfully so!) and the acknowledgement of any and everyone to get this film COMPLETED is also what makes this an excellent achievement.Whatever YOU think of Malcolm X is your right. But this film does not make ANY opinions, it just goes through and presents. It's not a pretty life, there are racially charged as well as religiously charged points in this film and as I've written before, it will surprise those who think they knew what Malcolm X was ""all about"" and ""who"" killed him. It will be HARD to do films like Malcolm X in this day and time, being his ""being"" was controversial, but I am glad this one was accomplished by the team that did it.Beautifully made, painstakenly made, top notch performances by all actors and actresses, great production teams, great direction teams, excellent adaptation, excellent music...an excellent film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Denzel Washington is absolutely amazing as Malcolm X, an influental and controversial black leader that moved a nation.  Spike Lee directs this perfectly and he proves he can direct wonderfully.  All of the other actors and actresses in this portray their characters perfectly and they were all awesome.  The only problem was not with this movie, but with MTV's video movie awards.  Now what kind of idiots try to spoof an influental black leader and that is so idiotic that they would do that.Overall the movie is awesome and I think that Denzel should have won the Oscar.

Simply too long,"I've never been drawn to long biopics that detail huge swaths of a person's life. The fact that Malcolm X did that, and also did it in extraordinarily long fashion meant it was simply not going to be a film that I was going to love. The story is told well, and Denzel Washington is extraordinary in the role (how did he not win an Oscar for this performance?) However, I simply don't latch onto a film that goes into this kind of minutiae and takes three and a half hours to do it. That being said, I do think Malcolm X is an effective motion picture. It educated me on the history of Malcolm X, which I was never properly taught in school. I had a false impression of him, and appreciated that Spike Lee did his best to reveal the heart of this man that isn't celebrated as much as other figures in the Civil Rights movement. By the end, while I was definitely ready for the film to reach a conclusion, I was still heartbroken by what happened to him. I don't dare to guess how accurate Malcolm X might be to actual historical events, but it certainly felt like a faithful retelling of history. I appreciate the fact that Malcolm X impacted me and gave me a better understanding of the titular character, but it's not a movie I will ever want to watch again.",5.0,Anonymous,History
'X' marks the spot,"****Starring: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr.This story follows the life story of the influential African-American Preacher, turned Islam.  Washington portrays the controversial man.  Bassett is his wife, and Freeman is a prisonmate who helps him.The performances by the actors/actresses are brilliant.  Washington should've taken home the Oscar.  The movie is a wonderful film that will make you want to watch it over and over again.Too bad the Brady Bunch attempted to make fun of it.

On of the best films ever??? You bet it is,"When I didn't see this films on IMDb 250, I started to believe that this list didn't really contain the best films ever. When you see pulp fiction, the lord of the rings trilogy,the shining, Reservoir Dogs and No Country For Old Men at the top list, you'll feel very sorry that films like these get on the top lists and films like Malcolm x are not even mentioned to be great films.Malcolm X is great because of many things and one of them are the performance by the actors(especially Denzel Washington), the director excellent work and the story it self.Don't worry about how long the film is, believe me you'll enjoy every single second of the film, and at the end you'll feel sorry because this film is underrated.Ten stars",10.0,Anonymous,History
Denzel Washington Becomes Malcolm X,"I can't say that I'm particularly knowledgeable about Malcolm X - the controversial black nationalist leader assassinated in the '60's. Having said that, I really felt that this movie provided an insight into the life and growth of a truly fascinating man, who was brought to life superbly by Denzel Washington. I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington's work, and think he's one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This is perhaps the best performance I've seen from him in a lengthy list of great performances. It seemed to me as I watched that Washington was having an almost out of (his own) body experience, truly becoming Malcolm X, as Malcolm's life was traced from his childhood, as the son of a black preacher who was killed by the KKK, to life as a young man as a hoodlum, to time in prison where he converted to Islam, through to his ultra-black nationalist stage and finally to a more moderate point, in which he was willing to work with others (even whites) - which earned him the hatred of the radical Nation of Islam, and eventually led to his death.The supporting performances here were fine, but you won't really remember them. This is Denzel Washington's movie. There are a few scenes that perhaps go on a little bit too long, but there's not really very much to criticize here. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
A film of power that gives an amazing look into the man's life,"I had the privilege to finally have the chance to view Spike Lee's film on the controversial black Nationalist Leader Malcolm X. The film is near a 3 1/2 hour biopic of the man named Malcom X who in 1960 opposed Martin Luther King Jr as one of the most important civil rights leader. With the controversial director Spike Lee behind the camera and Denzel Washington giving it his all on the screen, Malcolm X has stood the test of time since its release in 1992 and was a privilege to watch for me.As stated above, the film is a biopic of Malcolm X. The story starts with his early 20's. He is a junkie, a thief, and a criminal in all aspects of life. The film has many flashbacks to give us an idea of his childhood and what he has endured thus far and why he is where he is. Soon he is sent to jail where he maintains his hostility towards life and all other people. But a transformation is on its way, one that will put him into the public spotlight and become one of the most influential members of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Now I usually don't watch many Spike Lee films. I respect his work and I have seen some of his work but I tend to not watch his films. Don't know why. Malcolm X to me is the best of his work I have seen. He tells a story, he doesn't lie to the viewers or tone anything down, he tells the story exactly how it was. This has drawn heavy criticism from the white community which views this film as a tad bit demeaning to their race and along with some racial overtones.I myself am I white male and I did not find the movie to be racist. Yes there are the use of the word n*gger and several other racist names but these are not intended to single out an audience, it is part of the story. Spike Lee is a controversial director because he does not use stereotypes. He portrays people exactly how they are/were in life. He shows that not all white people in life are good, he shows not all black people in life are good. There is no controversy in my mind in this film.Denzel Washington is... how can I put it into words... MAGNIFICENT. His portrayal of Malcolm X is exactly how I picture the man to have been and that is human. A man who had the will to never give up and the ability to overcome any obstacle thrown at him in order to achieve his goal in life, to obtain equal rights for African Americans. Denzel shows all of this on screen through brilliant acting and character typing, something very hard to achieve.At first I found the film to be a bit choppy. One second you're in one place, the next you're some place else. Characters coming in left and right, all within the first 20 minutes. It is quite confusing in the first 20 minutes. I do realize that Malcolm X's early days were confusing and he was probably trying to obtain that with the audience in order to relate to him but I still found the start to be a little much. But after the first 20 minutes, the film is spectacular.The emotion behind Denzel's words and the support of the rest of the cast makes the acting in this some of the best I've seen. The cinematography and sets are top notch in their own respective areas. The film does go slow at a few parts near the middle and the end. It does grab your attention though when it needs you with a powerful montage of scenes to close out the film.4/5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,History
The reality is out there,"This movie is about reality. The reality which we see and live in everyday although we don't do, say or think anything about it.Racism was and still is a problem of human-beings. People still judge others by their colors or by their looks. People still judge others by the religion they practice (Or even if its only written on their id cards). People like Malcolm X are still needed on this earth. Power still has the same effect on humans. People who have the power to change doesn't mainly create change. The power changes them. They get obsessed with power. They don't use the power, the power starts using them.Now lets get to the movie. The director is Spike Lee and therefore naturally, the movie has an aggressive touch to it. There is also an aggressivity to the screenplay as well. However, regarding the days that Malcolm X has lived through, this can be understood.Denzel Washington is one my favorite actors today and the reason is he is incredibly capable of wearing the pants of the character he is to play. He has done a great job in this movie and in others as well. It is a great pleasure to watch him featuring as Malcolm X himself.In fact there is not much needed to be said. It is a great movie, but the story being told in the movie is much more important. The person who is picturized in the movie is just a symbol of that era, but what he said and tried to explain is still valid today and unfortunately will be valid for every minority society in the world.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Inspirational, educational and powerful",First hour was just unnecessary long. Could have been concluded in 10 to 15 min. The transitional period in prison was where the film kicked in and never let go. As Muslim I was also provided by an unexpected message. Religious sects and parties are susceptible to corruption of its members and initial message which would normally be built upon some truth to reach the masses. At the end its not God whom they serve but their own goals and interests. Malcoom X was among the few who realized this corruption and broke free from it but everything comes at a price! May Allah reward him for what he's done. This is also true and would apply to other religious communities.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X,"So concerned with making a powerful movie are some directors (Lee) they disdain the making of an entertaining one. Charming moments will imbue both player and message with a trust that viewers embrace and then recall with warmth for years to come, the secret ingredient to every movie masterpiece. The best freedom epics are peppered with such scenes (In the Heat, LoA, Robin Hood (38), 1970 New York Knicks). Had Spike this recipe in mind, Malcolm X might've pleased more movie palates (2.5/4).",5.0,Anonymous,History
The man and the movie,"Making a Biopic is hard. The movie always is judged by the opinion critics have about the central character in study, not the movie itself. Most of the past reviews have tried to assess this movie from what Malcolm X should've been and not what kind of person he was. It seems that many people (""the good, compassionate"" white folks) were depressed that Malcolm was shown as a racist. They also wanted more harsher criticism of NOI. They all wanted to see Malcolm X discovering the 'truth' that white men can be his brothers. Sadly, if they want this movie to be true, they wouldn't get a chance to see all that.I've heard from Malcolm's own words - speeches, interviews that his trip to Mecca and his experience with 'blond haired, blue eyed men who called (him) brother' NEVER changed his opinion about the race relations in America. He still believed that the only way blacks could gain their human rights was to lead their struggle themselves. He held this view till the day he died. In his own words after the pilgrimage,""No religion will ever make me forget the sufferings of my people"". I have to say, to the chagrin of many readers here, that Malcolm X did not become another Martin Luther King before he died. A month before he was killed in a meeting he asked the whites sympathizers what he had asked always - to stay out of the black revolution - and if possible, convince the black man that he has to fight this revolution himself.This movie made Malcolm X a cult figure. Many learned about him after watching it. He went from a forgotten black separatist activist to an icon appearing on posters and in rap lyrics. The imperialists now adopted Malcolm, made him their own - one who they could institutionalize, merchandize and at last use to counter struggles of living men today.Malcolm as a person sure deserves admiration for his conviction, clear goals and for his struggles against adversity in life. But the ideas he espoused are much greater. It's certainly not the movie's fault, but these ideas were lost somewhere in the hype.",,Anonymous,History
Denzel Washington is Extremely Convincing,"Whatever one thinks of the Nation of Islam or of Malcolm X, this is an outstanding film with superb acting by Denzel Washington as Malcolm and by Angela Bassett as Dr. Betty Shabazz, his wife. Malcolm X was a complicated personality -- an ex-con who became an effective religious proselytizer for the Nation of Islam, who eventually turned against its leader, Elijah Muhummad, and who dropped the anti-white rhetoric toward the end of his life, just prior to his murder, presumably by agents of the Nation of Islam. Washington captures Malcolm X's complexities and makes his transitional moments -- from jailbird to religious convert to eloquent spokesman to rebel to spokesman for a different vision of Islam -- seem very real indeed. Angela Bassett is a shining presence as Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz. The tense period leading up to Malcolm's assassination is rendered with great skill. The movie might have been considered too controversial for the Motion Picture Academy. Otherwise, it would surely have won Denzel Washington an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great...I'm very glad Spike Lee decided to direct this.,"All I have to say about Malcolm X is that Spike Lee made this film human, portraying the civil rights leader as a person and not an angel as in almost every other biopic that is spewed out by American studios these days. Norman Jewison was originally slated to direct this film but was replaced with Lee after Lee stated that a black person should direct this film.  I am very glad he did, because after seeing The Hurricane, Jewison would have probably left out all of the mistakes Malcolm Little made during the earlier parts of his life and made him out to be a saint like he did with Ruben Carter. The intention of the biopic should be to accurately portray a person, not to make that person larger than life...Spike Lee did a great job of this...I only wish he would have directed the Hurricane.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A very in depth and big swallow of a movie,"Malcolm X, I wrote a paper on him for my political science class and this man, even though I didn't agree with most of his views, he was a very fascinating man. So, I was excited to see Malcolm X and learn a little bit more of his life or Spike Lee's eyes of the man. This is an incredible movie, I mean 3 1/2 hours! Wow, I couldn't believe that I made it.The acting and sets are just over the top but very impressive. The story seemed very accurate, but over all it made me very angry on how people treat each other. It always did hurt me that people could be so vicious to each other. But I think that's why I could understand Malcolm was a very angry man, but I remember reading that he was having a change of his views before his murder. So I give him a lot of credit because life is too short to hold on to so much anger. Malcolm X is a great movie and I would highly recommend it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
a powerful story,"This a powerful story that needs to be told, but in the end it seemed less a story to do with civil rights and white racism than the internal politics that results in organisations turning against their own.For that reason I wish the film had concentrated slightly less on Malcolm's early life and more on the events leading to the assassination in 1965, especially given that two of the convicted assassins were pleading their innocence and have since been exonerated.Ultimately it is a depressing film. The early part of film seems to suffer from some strange edits as it hops back and forth in time to his own father's death. The exuberant dance room action also seems out of place. Other than Sam Cooke's 'A change is gonna come', this isn't the time or place to celebrate black popular music - especially dance music.I was left wondering about the many emergent leaders who were ultimately killed by their own people, and the unseen manipulation of those who deliver the fatal blows.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Biggest Oscar snub of the 90's.,"In this film, Spike Lee tells the story of Malcolm X (Denzel Washington), touching lightly on his younger years, and detailing the change going to prison brought on in him, and the change leaving Elijah Muhammad's (Al Freeman Jr.) Nation of Islam to become orthodox.  We also get to see X's private life away from the camera's, from the influence Baines (Albert Hall) had on him to the life he lived with his wife Betty (Angela Basset).I was already familiar with Spike Lee's work before this film, but this is the movie that turned me into a Denzel Washington fan.  Before I saw this, I brushed him off as another star gliding by on his looks - not because of his choice of roles or anything, but because I had never seen him in any films and tend to be skeptical about everything.  When I saw this, I realized what a powerful presence he has.  The glimpse we get of Malcolm X's transformation has Washington virtually portraying three completely different people.  The scene where he breaks down when he meets Elijah Muhammad for the first time is one of the most powerful moments on film.  I suppose the soundtrack helped that scene, but both Washington and Freeman Jr. were breathtaking there.Basset was great, but she always is.  Not to diminish her talent, but to be honest, I haven't seen her give a merely average performance yet, much less a poor one.  So, I wasn't expecting any less of her.  Lee was very unbiased in his portrayal of X, showing the audience how angry he was, and how when he first converted to Islam, he didn't do it because of religion - he did it almost as a means of channeling his anger.  I also like how Lee shows him eating with white Muslims in Mecca at the end.  Some of my family adhere to the Nation of Islam, and they seem to forget that Malcolm quit hating white people near the end of his life.  It is just too bad that his life was ended by other black nationalists.  In Islam we have something called maktoub - you cannot escape fate.  So, I suppose he was meant to go down for taking a stand.  Very sad, yes, but out of all the ways to die, it's probably the most honorable.Both Lee and Washington were amazing here.  I used to keep up to date with Oscar nominations (until films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan started sweeping the awards - they were good, but not the best), and out of the 1991-2000 decade, Washington's nomination for Best Male Actor was probably the biggest snub.  But, who cares.  It's a good film on it's own, one all people should see.",,Anonymous,History
excellent,"Denzel Washington gives a tour De force performance as Malcolm X and the best parts of the movie are when he is preaching to the masses. The worst part of the movie though is Spike Lee's character, a fictional guy named ""Shorty."" Lee's role seems to be mainly for comic relief but this movie didn't need it. Lee has rightfully complained about stereotype depictions of blacks in cinema and then turns around and plays the only stereotype black character in his definitive movie about one of America's greatest black leaders?For a movie that addresses racism, there isn't a single white character in this movie who has any redeeming features.

Spectacular!!!,"Having studied Malcolm X in Black History courses and having read the autobiographical book, I had a heads up on what Malcolm's life was like before the movie came out.  To my surprise, the much publicized and long awaited biopic painted such a vivid picture about the legend behind the man. The combination of Denzel's accurate portrayal of the slain civil rights leader, complementing Spike Lee's shrewd direction made this film one of my all time favorites.  Denzel is surrounded, much to his benefit, by a great cast of actors such as Delroy Lindo and a wholesome Angela Bassett.

The Spike Lee Masterpiece?,"Biographical epic of the controversial and influential Black Nationalist leader (Denzel Washington), from his early life and career as a small-time gangster, to his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam.I think people would generally say ""Do the Right Thing"" is Spike Lee's masterpiece, but that film is challenging and hard to swallow at times. That may make it powerful and artistic, but it is hard to compete with ""Malcolm X"", which tells true history and explains much about the black man's plight in America. And with Denzel Washington, one of the greatest actors, in the lead, it is hard to deny its wide appeal.Lee is a great director for pushing ""black cinema"" (if such a thing exists). And this is the film that really makes it real, gets to the heart of what is wrong with how mainstream (white) society treats the black man. This should be required viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
As good as it gets,"If this film were made 40 years ago, it would have been relevant. A blockbuster? Definitely not. Most southern theaters would not have shown it. And the ones that did would have certainly faced, at the least, protests, vandalism and most likely financial ruin.Fast forward twenty five years and those same southern theaters could show Malcolm X. Sure, there would be protests, but the theater owners would not have put their livelihoods on the line.Today, this movie would be a cog in the cycle of the movie year.How times have changed.Watching Malcolm X today (5/20/06) for the umpteenth time, I was struck by how timeless it is. Made in 1992, it still plays as a current film. It is an outstanding movie; one that is studied and will continue to be studied for ages.Regardless of your politics, the life and times of Malcolm Little as portrayed in Malcolm X is a true American story. In a capsule--suppression, poverty, education then success. His life was the triumph of an individual above all odds. The film celebrates the cognitive revelation of a truly exceptional person that changed not only the United States, but also the world for the better.Purists will surely take umbrage with the liberal telling of his life story, but that is sour grapes. Malcolm X captures the essence of Malcolm Little as a man with a pure message.

Must see cinema,"Spike Lee's masterpiece. An incredibly powerful film about an electric, complex man, beautifully told. Lee's filmmaking is fantastic, with wonderful period details, beautiful cinematography, and honest storytelling about an intelligent man who was flawed, but went through an incredible arc over his life. The film is true to 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' and every bit as intriguing. Denzel Washington turns in an extraordinary performance, truly evoking the man in all aspects - physically, his fiery oration, the depth of his thought, his integrity, and in stating his controversial views. The rest of the cast, including Angela Bassett as Betty Shabazz, is excellent too, and there were no false notes to me. Every single moment in this film, every frame, seems important, and the 201 minutes flew by.As for Malcolm X's views, I don't agree with all of them, and some are simply wrong (e.g. his misogynistic belief that women should be dominated), but he was so dead on in the gist of what he was fighting for, one of the earliest to yell WAKE UP to both black and white America, that he's an important figure, unfairly marginalized. He spoke about the whitewashing of history, 400 years of violent, brutal oppression, religion as a means of pacification, economic suppression, and yes, the evils committed by the white race all over the world. He spoke eloquently, truthfully, and with great courage. I was shocked by the callousness of his ""chickens coming home to roost"" comment after JFK's assassination when I first heard it, but if you look at his explanation, referencing America's (then) recent assassination of Patrice Lumumba and attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro, its history of violence to others, as well as its domestic terrorism, things that American history books have always downplayed (hence fueling the affront at what he was telling us), you can't help but see truth there.The fact is, Malcolm X was ahead of his time and spoke brutal, painful truths, those that white America in the 1950's did not want to confront or acknowledge, and which the country is still struggling with today. Spike Lee was also ahead of his time in making the film in 1992, and it's mind-boggling that he wasn't even nominated for best director, no doubt clouded by the haze of racism in this country, and how incendiary Malcolm X's views were to the status quo. Cleary, Lee and Washington should both have won Oscars. It's a legendary pairing of actor and director, an epic biography, and a very important film to this day.Some quotes from Malcom X, over the phases of his life; it would have been fascinating to see where his path would have led him had he not been tragically cut down at 39:""Any person who claims to have deep feeling for other human beings should think a long, long time before he votes to have other men kept behind bars - caged. I am not saying there shouldn't be prisons, but there shouldn't be bars. Behind bars, a man never reforms. He will never forget. He will never get completely over the memory of the bars.""""For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, 'Do you hate me?' The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone else of hate!""""I read, I saw, how the white man never had gone among the non-white peoples bearing the Cross in the true manner and spirit of Christ's teachings - meek, humble and Christ-like.""""Well, I believe it's a crime for anyone who is being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself. If that's how 'Christian' philosophy is interpreted, if that's what Gandhian philosophy teaches, well, then, I will call them criminal philosophies. ... If it must take violence to get the black man his human rights in this country, I'm for violence, exactly as you know the Irish, the Poles, or Jews would be if they were flagrantly discriminated against.""""In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments of all white people. I never will be guilty of that again - as I know now that some white people are truly sincere, that some truly are capable of being brotherly toward a black man. The true Islam has shown me that a blanket indictment of all white people is as wrong as when whites make blanket indictments against blacks.""",10.0,Anonymous,History

Uncompromising,"I turned this film on accidentally last night, and just left it on screen while I found something better to watch.  An hour and a half later I still hadn't turned it off.  Utterly engaging central performance by Washington.At first (once Malcolm X gets to prison and meets Brother Baines) one is impressed by the power of the arguments used, and the value of truly understanding the history of black repression.  Your heart goes out to Malcolm because of what he is trying to achieve, which is that the African Americans take control of their own destiny and make their own prosperity, by eschewing crime and drugs and all the other easy escapes, and instead to promote a moral life of education and achievement.  Then, gradually, almost without you noticing it, the other aspects of Malcolm X's views come out: the sexism, the Anti-Semitism, the segregationism.  This is what I meant by my subtitle.  This film does not compromise in its portrait of a figure it admires - it does not sweep the uncomfortable facts under the carpet.  I also like the way the film sees everything from X's viewpoint.  We don't find out about Elijah Muhammed's shenanigans until Malcolm X does, and there is only the slightest hint that the NoI leadership had turned against X before he finds out the full shocking truth.If Spike Lee has a fault, however, it is in not allowing powerful images to speak for themselves.  The demonstration outside the police station comes to an abrupt end when X raises his hand and points:  everyone shuts up and quietly shuffles off.  A brilliant scene with an unmistakable message.  So unmistakable, in fact, that the police chief, Peter Boyle repeats it for our benefit: ""That's too much power for one man to have.""  Hey, Spike!  Malcolm demonstrated the power of the masses, and his own power over them, in a brilliant, non-violent way.  We got it!Of course the most egregious example of this was the coda, which repeatedly told us that Malcolm X is a much-denigrated figure who nevertheless deserves our honour and respect.  Well, why did Lee spend millions of dollars making a 3 hour film about him then?  Did he suddenly lose all his confidence as a filmmaker?  Did he think that, having sat through all three hours, we would still not quite understand whether Malcolm X was admirable or not?  Hey, Spike!  Anyone can put together a montage with an upright-sounding voiceover.  Only Spike Lee can make ""Malcolm X"".  You did a good job, leave it alone!",,Anonymous,History
Why is Malcom X as good as it gets?,"Simply, it's the story, the life, the inspiration it gives. But besides these facts It's Denzel Washington and Spike Lee at the height of there careers. As a dedicated follower of Denzel Washington I found Both Malcolm X and Mo Better Blues to be at his best performances. Washington is convincing as Malcolm X, a role which allows him to display some more then later flicks like the Mancurian Candidate or Man on Fire. It has become time for Washington to rise up to the level he has in Malcolm X again! As far as the life of Malcolm X concern's; It's still astonishing to see that we haven't learned in all these years. We good once again use someone like Malcolm X to shake us all up.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X,"I being from India had heard of a revolutionary person called Malcolm X from US, who was shot dead at a young age, but did not know much about it. So when Malcolm X was referred to by African staying in UK as one of the most influential thinker, I thought let me see this movie.The movie is based on the ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" co-written by Alex Haley and published in 1966 one year after Malcolm X's murder. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X.The movie narrates the story of a kid Malcolm, as a bright student who is not allowed to study further due to people's prejudice towards black. As a youth Malcolm leads a smoke, drug, alcohol, sex and burglary life that lands him in prison. In prison, he is influenced by a man named Bimbi, and the teachings of Islam through a prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm studies and graduates from prison and joins Nation of Islam organisation of Elijah Muhammad. Here he takes the causes of African people, preachers and gives speeches against the atrocities of white people. He demands the right of African people who are here in American by default and not their own will. His daring outspokenness makes him popular among Africans and controvesial figure, but this also isolates him from everyone. He is thrown out of Nation of Islam and after a pilgrimage to Mecca his outlook changes a little bit and he starts his own organisation Muslim Mosque Inc. Within a few months he is shot dead.This is a very good movie to understand who was Malcolm X? If someone does not want to read his life story and get incite in 3 hours. Hats off and kudos to Spike Lee, who undertook this daring project of great scale and magnitude, when he was only 35 years of age. No doubt that Spike Lee is considered one the best directors of Hollywood. Denzel Washington is so authentic in the role of Malcolm X, that it is hard to believe anyone else in that role. He lives the role to its cells. There is also an uncanny resemblance of Denzel with Malcolm X. Brilliant! It is so sad that Denzel did not win an Oscar that year  may be a reality check on his being black!!? One gets a very good idea of Malcolm X through this movie. He was a confused person, and one gets an impression that as lots of lost minds, he too got a hook in to cling on. Like Christianity, Judiasm, Hinduism, Nationalism etc. Malcolm also found his hook called Islam. Many things he spoke were so true and he dared to speak it out loud and clear. The only problem was he became mis-represented because he was wearing a garb of Black Muslim in American society.The build up to the movie is slow and it takes nearly 1 hour for the movie to actually take hold of one's attention. The editing could have had been more tight. The most diluting part of the movie was its ending where Spike tried to normalize his life to a caricature black leader. Spike showed a street named Malcolm X, he made Nelson Mandela speak for Malcolm X, he made small children rant  ""I am Malcolm X"" and it was so sorry and laughable to see that at the end of such a wonderful and dramatic life story.I think there was no need to explain or justify Malcolm X, the presentation of his life's story was in itself enough. That's all  nothing more. Like any other leader we see  Malcolm X was also a great confused leader.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spike Lee's best by a country mile.,"It's a good thing Spike Lee was finally able to scrape together the necessary funds to finish this film and make it his way. Lee had never made anything even close to this good before it, and will likely never make anything this good in the future. His low-budget films are usually watchable, but ultimately too self-indulgent to really hit the mark completely. Malcolm X however is nothing short of great film-making. Denzel Washington couldn't have done it any better as allows the slain civil rights activist to in essence rise from the dead and acquaint himself with a whole new generation.The film clocks in at an amazing 202 minutes. That's three hours and twenty-two minutes for those who might not be used to seeing films longer than an hour and a half. Despite the film's length, it is so well made that none of it really causes the viewer to daydream. Maybe we didn't need to see so much of Malcolm's life prior to his conversion to Islam, but I did not regret seeing so much of it. We see almost everything illegal from his past: drugs, robbery, racketeering, you name it. Malcolm was into some serious stuff in his youth. The film hits it's stride once he's sent to prison and meets up with one of the higher-ups from the Nation of Islam. We see Malcolm take to his new religion like a fish to water, and once he gets out of jail, he's preaching the gospel of the honorable Elijah Muhammad to anyone who'll listen.Over time, we see Malcolm rise to great prominence within the Nation, until he eventually runs afoul of the leadership and has to start his own ministry. Once this happens, Malcolm is a marked man, and his violent demise is just a matter of time. Malcolm only lived to age 39, and Spike Lee shows us just about everything of note within his lifespan.The film has numerous strengths. It is incredibly well directed, acted, written, and photographed. The supporting cast all hit the right notes with their roles. Delroy Lindo plays Malcolm's old number running boss. Albert Hall is cold and stoic as the man who introduces Malcolm to Islam, then later turns against him. Angela Basset is typically outstanding as Malcolm's wife Betty. Has this woman ever given a bad performance in anything? Al Freman Jr. is also quite memorable as Elijah Muhammad. When all is said and done, he is the character we the audience wish to know more about. Spike Lee is also there as you might expect in the early scenes as Malcolm's hustler friend Shorty.This film belongs to Washington, though. Many who remembered the real Malcolm X claim his performance is right on in physical and spoken terms. Washington was nominated, but lost out to Al Pacino (Scent of a Woman) for the Best Actor nod. Was this justified? Hard to say. Al can be tough to beat.The film was a decent enough success at the box office to the point where you would have thought Lee would try bigger films like this more often. He hasn't produced anything nearly as good since, but he's his own man and he's presumably making the kinds of films he wants to.By all means necessary, Malcolm X is worth 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An unbelievable life story,"Right to the point: I've got nothing but love for ""Malcolm X"".Less a biopic than a sweeping American epic, it details the man's staggering journey from guttersnipe to cultural firebrand. It's absorbing on that aspect alone, but Denzel Washington in the lead role is another matter entirely. This is an actor who manages to embody the character, nearly disappearing into the role and making it come alive. Washington's skills at the pulpit highlight the ferocity of this character who inspires rebellion among his congregation. This is a resplendent film, well-mounted and carried out with conviction. It's easy to get wrapped up in and hard to forget once the credits role.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great! Was surprised that Spike Lee did this.,"I just got done watching ""Malcolm X"" today and I have to say it was a great film. This is the only film of Spike Lee that I thoroughly enjoyed. The acting in in top form. D. Washington deffinately deserved a oscar nomination for his great performence. The rest of the acting is good too. The directing is pretty good! I thought it was very well shot. The story and the dialouge flows smoothly and flows along perfect. I suggest this film to anyone who has 3 hours to watch this movie and if you do not I hope you make time to watch it. I strongly hope you do. 8/10",,Anonymous,History
Great Movie About a Hero & Amazing Human,"This movie was one of Spike Lee's best. I am not a big Spike Lee fan but this movie was able to really showcase the greatness of Malcolm X.Malcolm X is a hero not only to blacks but all people of color. He found enlightenment after years of doing wrong. Unfortunately, he went with a crooked organization in the Nation of Islam. However, through them he discovered the truth and later broke free from their clutches to see the true light.Whites of European descent have long wanted to control the narrative. Films have been a big way for their to push their version of America into popular culture. It is always great to see movies that start to showcase the real America.The issue with racism that engulfs American society is a white European problem. It is not a problem created by people of color. As America evolves into a country with a majority of people of color by 2041, whites will have to own up and fix their issues. How they do this is up to them and will determine how their future in America will be.The negative reviews on here are mainly those who want everything to be ""all inclusive."" The same people who push out an ""All Lives Matter"" narrative to take steam away from a real movement with real merit.These people tend to live in bubbles and want to push myths and lies to the masses. Their purpose to hijack important messages to play in their favor.This movie showcases the importance for people of color to unite. The importance of orators with profound messages to speak to the masses. The importance of not relying on white European allies and instead the importance of bringing people of color together.The one part I wish they spent more time on, is Malcolm's realization that all people of color are connected. No matter if one is African, Asian, Hispanic, or Native, they all share a common reality. Once people of color in America unite, there is no hope for injustice and inequality that has been pushed to these people for centuries.A great movie and message. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Strong Denzel Performance!,"Malcolm X is a really good, albeit long portrayal on the controversial civil rights leader, Malcom X. This film proves that Spike Lee is a very good director who has a big passion on civil rights and race equality. As a person who studies American history, I was very interested in Malcolm X and how his personality is the exact opposite of another famed civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr.Spike Lee's film is obviously about the life of Malcolm X. This movie goes through the major changes of his life. This goes through his days as a guy on drugs and deals with gangs and ends up in jail to a guy who found his calling by joining a Muslim group led by Elijah Muhammad to a guy who found his true spiritual nature on his pilgrimage to Mecca.Denzel Washington is definitely the right man for the role. I don't think anyone else could have done this role. In fact, Denzel and Malcolm X look very similar to each other.Overall, this is a powerful, emotion-filled film with a strong message to it. The montage at the end of this film is worth the price of admission alone. This film is a little too long and a scene or two in the beginning dragged on for a bit. But other than that, this is nearly flawless. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Profound Film,"By far, in all of movie history, this ranks among the top. I first saw this film in the theater in 1992. However, it did not have a major affect on me until years later when I watched it again at home. Only then did I realize exactly what Mr. Lee was trying to achieve in this movie. Those who know little outside of media information about Malcolm X need to see this movie. It brings Malcolm X to light--by showing the audience a phenom, someone who finally understood his life. Someone who was never allowed to realize their full potential. There are many movies about this man but none portray him as he truly was. What I find most heartbreaking(but not surprising) however, is the total lack of media-praise for this movie. This film was not just for African Americans. This movie is about a part of American History. Here is why I can say this:  I noticed when I was on my way out of the theater there were more whites present than there were blacks. Most of the whites were old enough to remember Malcolm X being alive. The look many had on their faces at the end of the film surprised me. I took note of a range of emotions; mostly sadness but best of all--enlightenment. It did my heart good to see this becuase the film accomplished exactly what it was supposed to. Not create more hate but to show one man's transition from being a victim of racial hatred to pro-actively findng a way to end it-- by creating an attitude for African Americans that up until that past few decades was not allowed: Self sufficiency, self pride, high standards of education, and love for ourselves. If there is ever any doubt in your mind that Malcolm X was not a thinker, philosopher, healer, and one of the greatest men that have ever lived, then please see this movie. I am only sorry that I never knew him personally. I am not sorry that someone took the time to introduce us via film.",,Anonymous,History
Masterpiece,This is an absolute masterpiece of film. It's Spike Lees best film followed very very closely by Do The Right Thing which is also a masterpiece. Denzel gives his most powerful performance and he is masterful in every second he is on screen. When he gives Malcom's speeches he commands the screen with his energetic and powerful voice. The story of Malcom X is incredible and he was such an important part of the civil rights movement and he was becoming even more influential to people after his pilgrimage to Mecca. This film covers Malcolm from the very beginning and captivates you as the story goes. The runtime doesn't even seem to be real as this film seems to fly by because the material is so interesting and the film is so well done that you are completely taken by it.Everyone should watch this film. You will not be disappointed and when you finish do yourself a favor and watch Do The Right Thing.

Masterpiece,"9 of 10 stars. Most Film Historians consider Malcolm X to be a Masterpiece. No argument here, I agree, it's a truly great piece of filmed cinema.I don't think I can overstate what a powerful and influential Film this was when it was released, a cultural phenomenon that influenced and re-directed social thoughts of teens and young adults at the time; an intense, adamant and passionate re-direction. I don't think it can be overstated. And now that it has been over 30 years, it's good to see the Film is still revered as a Masterpiece.It stars Denzel Washington, alongside Albert Hall and Angela Bassett. Bassett and Hall do good in the Film, delivering good Performances.The rest of the cast delivers as well in their smaller but important roles. Spike Lee, who Directed the Film, even does very good in his smaller role; and Al Freeman knocks it out of the park in his amazingly important role, captivating, subtle, dainty, dynamic-flat out works. The legendary Christopher Plummer has a small part, and as I would expect, he's brilliant in his role, and watching Denzel and Plummer together is an absolute treat, 2 Masters going at it, with neither over-reaching but somehow creating intensity, what those 2 do together simply can't be taught. It's a treat. Then there's Delroy Lindo, and he absolutely turns in an amazing Performance that is pivotal in bringing depth to the Film, a Film that was already layers deep without him. He commands the screen and I can't take my eyes off of him in his smaller but amazing role.I'll get to Denzel Washington later, but then there's the Directing of Spike Lee; brilliantly captured and Directed by Lee, envisioned and passionate Directing. He nails it, usually does, and this Film is no exclusion. He's had such a great career as a Director to this point, including Masterpieces like She's Gotta Have It (1986), Do The Right Thing (1989), Crooklyn (1994), Get On The Bus (1996), 25th Hour (2002), Inside Man (2006) & Blackkklansman (2018), to name a handful. This is a student of Directing, with a deep respect for the craft, with the passion and ability and greatness to capture the delivery there of.Then there's Denzel Washington. He is absolutely captivating in this Performance, an absolute Masterful Delivery with nuances and intricacies that few Actor's in history could deliver. He can Perform between the tip of his nose and his chin as well as some some capable Actor's can with their entire being, but we don't just see the bottom of his face, we get to see his entire body.Every generation, if we're lucky, a talent like Denzel Washington comes along, an emotionally dynamic Performer that captivates.I think Denzel is one of the 10 best Actor's in history. It's an impossible list as there are 50 I want to have in my Top 10; but I would say these are the 10 best Actors in history (listed in order from oldest to newest):Charlie Chaplin, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Joaquin Phoenix, Leonardo DiCaprio, Philip Seymour Hoffman & Shia LaBeouf.Most Film Historians would say that Denzel Washington has starred in 15-20 Masterpieces thus far during his career. I believe if I talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, naturally they would all have slightly different lists, but I believe if they came to a consensus, this would be Historians Top 10:1. Glory (1989) 2. Much Ado About Nothing (1993) 3. Malcolm X (1992) 4. The Tragedy Of Macbeth (2021) 5. Inside Man (2006) 6. American Gangster (2007) 7. The Hurricane (1999) 8. Fences (2016) 9.

A somewhat cumbersome but moving portrait of a controversial figure,"Roger Ebert said it best: It took guts to make a movie like this. Mohandas Ghandi was a safe subject, as was Oscar Romero. But to directly take on the life of one of the most combative personalities in American history, don't pull any punches about his criminal past or controversial views, *and* manage to make something amazingly informative *and* entertaining...that's not just guts, that's an achievement. Yes, I remember the hype, but in this case, it was more than deserved.It drags a *little* at times, particularly near the end where it's all over but the inescapable tragedy. Probrably not worth a purchase unless you're a big fan of Lee's work, but every free-thinking American who's not afraid of an issue as turbulent as race relations should see it.Malcolm wasn't a superhero or a prophet, just a very determined human being devoted to a righteous cause who ended up paying a terrible price. For my money, that's someone worth knowing more about.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Vidiot Reviews,"Malcolm XThe only rights African Americans had in the 1960s was to witness their leaders being shot.This biography focuses on one of those assassinated activists.From his hoodlum days in Boston to his later incarceration and conversion to Islam, Malcolm X's (Denzel Washington) life has always involved racial inequality.Over time, Malcolm's anti-white philosophy not only attracts the attention of disenfranchised blacks, but also the CIA and the ire of his own faith.Eventually, Malcolm's hard-line approach softens but his willingness to work with other civil rights leaders for a common goal is cut-short.An epic portrayal of America's most complex black leaders, director Spike Lee does a masterful job of capturing the social climate of the 60s, while Denzel dazzles in one of his most convincing roles to date.And while the 60's laid waste to most civil rights leaders, thankfully, we still have half of Al Sharpton left.

Very Influential movie,"Spike Lee's Malcolm X is one of the most influential movies made to this day. It covers one of the most controversial figures in U.S history and tells his story bravely. Although it does it very differently from the book, I would say it does a better job. The book is honest and helps you get to know Malcolm and understand his point of view, and why he is who he is. While the movie captures the emotion and shows what an inspirational figure Malcolm X really is. Spike Lee does a great job of staying true to the story, but at the same time you like Malcolm more in the movie. Lee uses a lot of Lowkey lighting in the first half of the movie and filters to give this Hollywood-Esq feel to the movie. Personally I did not find this effective and thought the movie lacked a lot of content at the beginning. The way his childhood flashbacks were showed was not effective as well. Quick transitions into them and very fast pacing during them. Its not until Malcolm goes to jail when the movie becomes alive. The intense natural lighting with the darks, reflects Malcolm's mood as he is lost in life and wonders what is next in life for him. Spike Lee's most noticeable technique is his very long movement shots. The shot were brother Bane is talking to the inmates in Jail outside was one of the best shots in the whole movie in my opinion. Its a long tracking shot going left to right, as he speaks to them. Its a medium shot that views only their face and some of their body language. It is very effective as you view how Bane's words affect these inmates. Although the first half was questionable, the second half of the movie does a spectacular job of recovering and I think you can easily look past it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's about Malcolm X that's what made this Spike Lee movie actually good,"I know it's 18 years too late but I want to review this. I was watching a documentary on Muhammad Ali on TV two days ago so one thing led to another therefore I was watching this. Spike Lee is a very weird director. I've seen a couple of his films like Inside Man, He Got Game and Clockers. All these films were watchable but they were made with such weird techniques.So initially you get that Spike Lee smear when you watch the first hour of this film which chronicled Malcolm's teenage years in Boston and Harlem. However when you think about it was filmed that way just to indicate how buck wild the young Malcolm was.Once the movie enters the stage of Malcolm's incarceration and transformation that's when you see less of Spike's running gags and more substance from the man Denzel himself.Great film, I learned what I needed to know about the most complicated figure in the Civil Rights Movement.",9.0,Anonymous,History
X-traordinary,"Let me dry my eyes. I knew what was coming and I still couldn't hold it back.Although I was born 13 years after Malcolm X was assassinated he is still a hero to me.

I was in high school and a lot of us were wearing X beanies, caps, and jackets. This movie was going to be a big deal. Well, I refrained. I wasn't emotionally ready.It took me 26 years to find the fortitude to watch this movie and I still broke down at the end. I'll be the first to say that I'm not a fan of Spike Lee's earlier works but this one was splendid. I think he and Denzel Washington did an honorable job paying tribute to Malcolm X. It was important to see his transitions from early hoodlum, to prisoner, to Elijah acolyte, to independent man. He was a living example of what liberating one's mind can do for an individual.As a production, this was fantastic. There were a couple of Spike Lee-isms that could have been removed (e.g. himself as an actor and the invasive soundtrack at times) but overall I was pleased.

This set of details really helps one understand the evolutionary progress on Malcom's intellectuality.All of it is supported by an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington who seems to re-incarnate Malcom X bringing him back to life in a such a shocking way that it must have scared some of Malcom's acquaintances.

Uncompromising...,"I must admit, I used to despise this film. I had to watch this tedious bio-pic as part of an assignment for a sociology class and write an analysis of it. Needless to say, I did not have a paper to turn in. I just did not think (and still do not think) that Malcolm X was a very pleasant person. Like Jerry Falwell, and Louie Farakhan, he had a tendency to push the wrong buttons in the statements he made. He seemed to be driven by pure hatred most of the time. And even after his conversion to orthodox Islam, following his Hajj, currents of racism still remained in his philosophy. That is what the Black Nationalist movement is/was. Keep blackie in one corner of the room, keep whitey out. That isn't reconcilation. That is segregation. What a way to move forward!But I saw the movie again on BSTRZ and imagine my surprise...I enjoyed the heck out of it. It is completely uncompromising unlike the pathetic ""Hurricane"", which tries to sanctify an unpleasant person who was probably a murderer. Malcolm X presents the man as he was, based on what he said, what he did. It does not pull any punches. Most people will not come away from this with a greater sense of respect for Malcolm. Unless you believe in the things he said. Apparently, Spike Lee does, yet, he does not attempt to whitewash (pardon the pun) this controversial figure. And in that sense, this film is very enjoyable, historically accurate and heck, it is quite moving too. I did find myself thinking a bit differently about some issues.",,Anonymous,History
We started this fire,"The Civil Rights movement was such a broad area in history, and with the countless number of events that took place, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the sit ins, it's a wonder why we haven't been bombarded with films focusing on those events. I have no doubt that one movie could possibly focus on everything that happened in the Civil Rights era, but I doubt it could do a very good job. Spike Lee has chosen one of the most unsung leaders of the movement, and has constructed, from the ground up, a film over three hours in length on him showing his humble beginnings, his rise to power, his self-assessment, and his tragic death.The leader is Malcolm X. But before he was an historical figure, he was Malcolm Little, a small-time thief who would concoct schemes to steal money with his best friend, Shorty. He was a smart boy, with a preacher for a father and a white woman for a mother. Despite being very smart, he was ostracized by white teachers who said that his dreams of becoming a lawyer wouldn't happen and that he should stick to ""working with his hands."" Little's adolescence consisted of running around with white girls and devising burglaries with them and Shorty. This streak didn't last long, with Little and Shorty being arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Without a doubt, prison benefited Little in unlikely ways. He was taught the ways of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, and got help for his addiction to cocaine by a fellow inmate.Muhammad's teachings eventually inspired Malcolm to become a motivational speaker, before becoming one of the many voices in the Civil Rights movement. He adopts the name ""Malcolm X,"" he claims, because ""X"" in mathematics represents ""the unknown."" For a while, X preached the direct opposite from Martin Luther King Jr. King believed in integration, that would hopefully result from a nonviolent practice. X thought integrating with ""the enemy"" was not intelligent, and questioned why would we want to integrate with a group that has subtracted our rights, raped our women, and has dehumanized us? For a while, the only thing X said he liked integrated was ""his coffee."" I tried to put myself in the shoes of a middle aged African American, living in the south, in the 1960's, and contemplated who I, myself, would've sided with. King would probably have been the initial person I would've sided with, but after many months that proved little to no success, I would've likely started to follow X and his teachings of self defense and segregation.The entire film is marvelous in every sense of the word. Spike Lee has proved himself to be one of America's greatest directors with one stellar drama after another, focusing mainly on racial tensions. Here, he brilliantly documents an underrated leader whose philosophy may have been sketchy, but wrote speeches that were undeniably powerful.X is portrayed by Denzel Washington, who utters every line with sophistication and always occupies a convincing state. The whole tone of the film can be summed up in one scene that comes rather late in the film. It shows Malcolm X walking up the stairs to Columbia University, where he is stopped by a white woman asking what she could do to further his movement. He coldly replies ""nothing"" before marching on his way. The camera is left focusing on the frozen, heartbroken woman. The great thing about a scene like this is that it wasn't motivated by a comic relief. Lee adds hints of comedy throughout the film, but not many seeing as this is a touchy subject. He feels he should attack it with brutal honesty rather than turn the whole movement into a laugh riot. Other performances, like Angela Bassett as Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, provide the film with some of its strongest material as well.I believe the reason the character of Malcolm X was so interesting is because he is capable of delivering self assessment and self criticism. Not many leaders are still developing their beliefs, but are rather wholly confident in what they preach. X finally realized he had flaws as a human, and went through a change of heart upon traveling to Mecca, an event that is captured beautifully in the film, and came back a whole different person. Instead of attacking Civil Rights leaders, mainly Martin Luther King Jr., and making them feel inferior, he agrees to work with them to pursue the dream of equality in the world.Malcolm X is one of the most surreal and extensive biopics I have yet to see. Its script is extremely powerful, and refuses to become dry and noneventful. Lee's direction is pitch perfect, and the tone either feels coldly realistic or unsettling even in when it reaches its brightest instances. Just like the man himself, Lee's film has proved to go under the radar, not boasting a great deal on the surface. But when put into an intricate focus and dissected delicately, it is one of the best films that deals with racial tensions, next to De Niro's A Bronx Tale, and one of the smartest films of the nineties decade.Starring: Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman Jr. Directed by: Spike Lee.",10.0,Anonymous,History
larger than life but so Malcolm was,"It was almost inevitable that any work that attempted to tell the story of a personality as large as that of Malcolm X would fall into larger-than-life schematics and all too many Steven Spielburg skies. So it is particularly fitting that the first major film work done on the life of Malcolm, Spike Lee's MALCOLM X, was generated by one of U.S. film making's most controversial talents. MALCOLM X was released at a time when all too many Black Americans were hungry for work about African American icons that stepped outside of the Budweiser Corporation type representation of Black experience seen on tavern walls, so it shouldn't surprise that the first Black film maker to take on so ambitious a project sometimes fell into spectaclist technique. People need legends and heroes, and Malcolm is certainly a heroic figure.Malcolm's story has become increasingly familiar to people outside the Black community. A man with a strong sense of self-identification from his youth, he moved through several identity changes, from shoeshine hustler to railroad porter to borderline gangster to convict to minister and organizer of the Nation of Islam, to the dynamic articulator of African American struggle that he was in his final push for the Organization of African American Unity. His life was the flip side of what is called the American Dream, and when he was murdered at the age of 39 in 1965, he was well on his way to becoming the leader of a revolutionary democratic insurgence in the United States. In short, his life was the stuff of legend.So along comes Spike Lee, and assembles this remarkable cast in telling the story of his life: Denzel Washington as Malcolm, Angela Basset as Dr. Betty Shabazz, Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Mohammed, Delroy Lindo as Malcolm's street ""mentor"" West Indian Archie, Albert Hall as his prison associate, Brother Baines, and Giancarlo Esposito as one of Malcolm's assassins, Thomas Hayer. There are numerous cameos from Hollywood glitterati, and even unlikely personalities such as the late and notorious radical attorney William Kuntsler appears in this film as the judge who sentences Malcolm to his prison term. There are also a number of clever black and white footages that, when shot, bore so close a resemblance to the newsreels some of us grew up with, they become difficult to tell from the originals. Denzel comes that close to the real man's carriage and timbre.I do regret that Spike Lee did not feel the need to acknowledge the contributions made to his screenplay posthumously by James Baldwin. It seems to me several portions of this film are loosely lifted from Baldwin's stillborn film biography of Malcolm, ONE DAY WHEN I WAS LOST. But I suppose that's an issue for the legatees of Baldwin's estate to work out with Lee.The bottom line is that this was a timely film (1992), Disney-like crescendos and all. The movie was released in the wake of the Los Angeles Riots that followed the verdict on the LAPD beating of Rodney King. The work gave younger and older Black people an event to talk about and do some mutually respectful sharing of ideas about cultural integrity and critique, and if that's all Spike Lee accomplished with MALCOLM X, that's good enough for me.",,Anonymous,History
Oscar??,"It's taken me a while to watch this film. I have to say that it's got it's problems. Mainly, the beginning is way too long and looks like it was shot for a different movie. And there are other nits.However, Denzel Washington shines. He gets better and better and better as the film goes on. Wade through the first 30 mins, because the rest is well worth it.I agree that Russell Crowe got gypped during the Academy Awards for ""A Beautiful Mind."" But Denzel clearly deserved the Oscar for ""Malcom X"" (Pacino won it that year for ""Scent of a Woman""). Does this make it all fair? Not really, but maybe a little.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X disappoints...Denzel doesn't!!!,"To see this kind of political movie l always put a foot behind about the main character, l was very anxious to see this movie that l'd missed in the past about this iconic person, but after watched the picture l stayed entire disappointed with Malcolm X the character, he was involved by a bunch of haters whom preaching against non black people, very frustrating when he meets a white girl who doesn't have any racial prejudice asking him if could help in some way he replay ""absolute nothing!!!, After he was banned by the leaders he goes to Meca and became a new person, apart the history the movie is fantastic even directed for a person like Spike and what he thinks about black's rights Lee whom is very similar with Spielberg about Jews's rights, l'm very carefully about both, besides the movie is very impressive portraying the real life this controversial afro-American religious leader, Denzel deserves all kind of honor for a stunning performance as always, l recommend the movie only, however not the real Malcolm X!!!Resume:First watch: 2017 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 8",8.0,Anonymous,History
Denzel's Stunning Portrayal does Justice to the Icon,"One of the most controversial Black Nationalist figures of Racially Segregated America, Malcolm X's life is a wild but tragically short ride. Spike Lee goes through the whole spectrum, from his horrific Childhood ruined by the Ku Klux Klan & the Child Protection Services, to his rose-tinted youth of street hustling & inevitable incarceration, to him embracing Islam & Elijah Muhammad as his Savior, to the ultimate betrayal. And each of those phases of his life was portrayed exceptionally by the Great Denzel Washington. This movie is way too long but its solely his performance that keeps you glued to the screen. Except the young Malcolm phase, the whole movie runs very flat. But Spike Lee does a commendable job to present that enigma's life & his extreme views in a very unbiased manner.",8.0,Anonymous,History
History of metamorphosis,"I don't know if it is a biographic movie. Or only story about ideals and self - definition. Denzel Washington makes a great role. And the atmosphere is created with care and precision. Slices of an existence, the film is only beginning for a personal picture of Malcolm X. Warm and delicate, this portrait is homage and sketch, subject for new debates about the American way and description of politics nuances. A movie like an autumn rain. Leaves in park and gray walls. Strange colors and pools of hope. And, a metamorphosis. A honest man, hero of lost age for who the religion was the answer to troubles and anguish circles. Evening of another mahatma. And the ways of continuous fight.",,Anonymous,History
Mr. X,"This film about Malcolm X is a film I would recommend to you if you want to learn more about the civil rights movements throughout the 1950s and 60s. I find it does go pretty in depth due to its long runtime and seems like they didn't let any second of it to waste. Longer runtimes I feel like could explain some things more in depth depending on the subject matter (I find sometimes movies go too long but some others feel like they could be longer). Malcolm X was a key figure in civil rights and I find it'll be good to learn more about him. I find movies could be a good way to learn about events as it gives a visual aid, with books being more about words than pictures (I know picture books exist, oftentimes those are for basic knowledge where kids could understand and don't go in depth like word-only books with a couple hundred pages). I like that at times it does have clips like those of the news broadcast of the 50's and 60's. That does seem fitting. Overall I like this as it gives a very in depth view of this civil rights activist.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ferocious Biopic from Spike Lee,"""Malcolm X"" is Spike Lee's ferocious biopic about the legendary and controversial civil rights activist.But don't let the word ""biopic"" scare you away. This is not your usual dull, paint-by-numbers biography. Lee's film is dynamic and propulsive, and though I had to watch it over multiple days, I could easily have sat through the 3 1/2 film in one viewing if circumstances had been different.Denzel Washington was justly nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Malcolm X. I was put off by the film at first because it's so histrionic and cartoonish at the beginning, but Lee makes the decision to have his movie mature as the character of Malcolm X matures. The second half of the film is more sober and restrained. But that's not to say it's ever stuffy or boring. It's gripping throughout, and it has the added benefit of being visually spectacular.Ruth Carter received the film's only other Oscar nomination for its costume design.Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of The Best Movie Biographies,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Denzel Washington's filmography, I come to Malcolm XMalcolm X is one of the best movie biographies, around. The film is inspirational and educational, and it is also an entertaining movie. Watching it now, I was surprised that I have never revisited this movie.It's a long movie, but there is certainly a lot of ground to cover. Malcolm X lived many lives and Denzel is amazing playing all the different chapters of his life.the whole cast was great, there wasn't one weak link. Though it wouldn't be a Spike Lee movie, if he didn't cast himself in a prominent role.Divided into three sections, the begins with Malcolm Little's troubled early years. The second is the prison years and Finally, the third in which Malcolm (now Malcolm X) becomes the most prominent disciple of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.Denzel was nominated for his second Oscar, this time for Best Actor, in what I personally considered was the hardest year to call an Oscar winner. Losing to Al Pacino for Scent of A Woman.Malcolm X grossed $48 million at the box office and was the 32nd highest grossing movie of 1992.",8.0,Anonymous,History
admirable   work,"it escapes from each desired verdicts. or definitions. not only for the admirable performance of Denzel Washington but for the inspiration of Spike Lee to explore, with grace and precision, a not real comfortable way of a symbol of American XX century history. and the result is great. for the nuances and for the science to give a realistic portrait of society more than of man. for the admirable courage to not build a statue to a hero but to show the evolution of a honest, vulnerable man. for give the picture of an American society for who the radical positions are result of a huge pressure. and to use the shadows for a clear image of a leader and his powerful convictions.",,Anonymous,History
Spike Lee's finest film.,"Spike Lee's finest film, ""Malcolm X"" is a vast, sprawling three hour plus epic built around a magnificent, career-best performance from Denzel Washington and opening with credits that might recall ""Patton"" as Washington castigates White America over images of the American flag as it bursts into flames. Of course, it was inevitable that a biography of Malcom X, one of the great figures of the 20th century, would be filmed at some stage and equally inevitable, given his track record, that Lee would be the man to do it.As a political picture it does follow a predictable trajectory but from the beginning it's obvious that Lee wants to make something more than just a conventional biopic. Lee's film is nothing less than an epic account of the history of Black America in the second half of the twentieth century. It's tragedy isn't only that Malcolm X was assassinated but that very little has actually changed in the interim despite Obama's tenure in the White House.Washington may dominate the picture but there's superb work too from Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall and Al Freeman Jr. In Lee's huge cast and thanks once again to Ernest R. Dickerson's cinematography it's also a fantastic looking film. Naturally, in 1992, the Academy almost totally overlooked the film with only Washington and Ruth E. Carter's costume designs getting nominations. As I said, very little has changed and it's taken a rule change by the Academy for diversity to fully get the recognition it deserves. Had it been made today, this might actually win Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Denzel's best?,"Denzel's natural intensity is perfect fit for Malcolm X. He carries this film from start to finish (all 3 hr 20 min) and should have one the Oscar for Best Actor. The film does sometimes over-glorify Malcolm and sort of laughs off the reporters that accused him of being a black supremacist (especially in the eulogy at the end). However, overall it does a good job of tracking Malcom's various transformations and changes in viewpoint. Perhaps Malcom would have eventually become an advocate for peace like MLK. Malcolm X is a unique and important piece of movie history that shows the life of America's civil rights leader. I love everything about this movie from Denzel Washington's performance, Spike Lee's direction and the script. I have nothing bad to say about this movie because it really shows realism and emotion to the man who changed America forever.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Denzel X,"Does it even need to be said anymore that Denzel is amazing? It's more or less just a fact, right? He's in something, he's going to be incredible, don't need to question it. Cool? Cool.Never saw this before but I get why this film in particular probably helped launch him into the stratosphere. He becomes Malcolm X. Even when I know it's still Denzel, it's Malcolm. Aside from him though, I think my favorite thing about this movie is how human they made him. Malcolm X is this larger than life figure. A man with tremendous shoes to fill, whose actions have reverberated through culture and modern history and it would be so easy for a movie to build him up as this mythical figure. However, I don't think this did that. For most of the movie, Malcolm is a pawn. A blindly obedient servant to his religious overlord. That's not something I expected to see on the screen and yet it was captivating. He's white hating, he's sexist, he's an extremist. Through this, potentially overlong, saga we get to see him go from the punk to the prophet to a moral human being simply trying to create a better world for his people. We watch him grow and evolve and as someone who is admittedly under-educated in the life and exploits of Malcolm X, I deeply appreciated this film for the portrayal.The drawbacks, such as they are, come from more technical aspects than anything. There were stretches where I thought the sound was bad, poor quality or just super quiet for some reason. I don't have perfect hearing but most of the movie I was fine with but there were definite points I was glad to have captions on. The movie also repeatedly went to clips of real events and I found that to be distracting. This story is interesting enough. Tell it. Don't pull newsreel footage, let Denzel do his thing. Lastly, its long. 3+ hours is... Tough. Its probably the main thing that will keep me from revisiting it in the future. That's a lot of time that could be spent with other things.Strongly recommend this one. You'll have to carve out a chunk of time, but this is a subject that seems to only grow more and more important with time. Beyond that, Denzel is demonstrating why he is one of the best in the business here and that alone should be enough to warrant a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
disjointed,"I read the Autobiography of Malcolm X and really looked forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately, I saw only about an hour of this before turning it off. Besides starting off with the much taken out of context Rodney King beating, this film makes me wonder if indeed Spike Lee knows how to tell a story. His camera movements might be good, but I found myself very confused by how the story line kept jumping across. I remember one scene where, out of nowhere, the scene cuts to X's father being killed.The best way to have done this movie, in my opinion, would've been the way the book did. Start it with X meeting Alex Haley at the end of his life and have the movie go chronologically with X providing voice-over narration. The acting I did see was good, so out of four stars, I'd give this film two.",,Anonymous,History
Malcolm X,"Washington is brilliant as Malcolm X, but Spike Lee's direction seems strained and forced. The film runs entirely too long and you find yourself looking down at your watch after the first 2 hours. Although long winded, it's still very entertaining with Albert Hall and Al Freeman Jr. in stand out supporting roles. Lee himself has a small part but does nothing with it.",,Anonymous,History
