The Last Of Its Kind,"I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Really really good,"Amazing acting, great story lines and some twists. Loved how the story was told through the eyes of De Niro's character as he was at the end of his life.For anyone that likes gangster movies, it is worth a watch - high quality actors from across the great gangster films. The only negative is that it lasts 3.5 hours. This would put me off watching it again soon, but definitely worth seeing for the first time.Kept me glued throughout - defo give it a watch.

Latest entry in the Emperor's New Clothes Club,"You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.A scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an ""action"" scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.This is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.Again, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.There are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.The plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.Here? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or ""cinema"" any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.As someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Just amazing,"Classic Scorsese . De Niro is the best he's been for years . Pacino is really magnetic and charming . But for me, Joe Pesci is the standout. Quietly deadly, magnetic , loyal, complicated, its him that will get the Oscar . Saw it at the cinema ( sorry Netflix but I am not watching Scorsese at home ) and it was superb.
Oh Anna Paquin is used quite cleverly as well. Good actress . Decent performance
Go and see it at the cinema . You will remember the masters returning for one last ride",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Almost Perfection,"Other reviewers at the top, when sorted by Helpfulness, have already covered much of what makes this film so exceptionally good. As such, and knowing that I have a tendency to sometimes exceed the number of allowed characters, I'd like to add just a couple of small things.First, the sets and costuming were near perfection. Every SINGLE piece of clothing which the characters wore, down to cuff-links, handbags, hair pins and shoes were of the era. That kind of meticulous detail can only bode well for a film. If the creators care enough about the small details, imagine what they do with the big ones.Secondly, in many films now, where there is a well-known and varied cast, you find that the screen time each devotes in comparison to the film run time, really leaves a little to be desired. That is not the case here. Almost every second of every scene is filled with one or more of these masterful actors, actually acting. Performing. Pulling you in to the world they are creating. All, without the need of heavy CGI or filler. As Hoffa might say: they get right down to brass tacks - and, pardon the pun, deliver.DeNiro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel. Enough said. Leave politics at the door, and enjoy.Excellent film all around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Sorry Scorcese, TLDR.","Some might hate it but here is a little bit of truth about the Irishman, against the 8s and the 9s and the 10s:
It is a ""Too long didn't read"" kind of movie.
What is the reason of this enormous more-than-three-hours runtime? Probably to enjoy as much as possible Pesci, Pacino and De Niro working together.
But folks, this time has come and gone...
Goodfellas, Casino etc. and anything Scorcese did is amazing.
But getting mob-type genre back in play in 2020 needs a bit of a twist and taste for the different audiences. 3' 24"" is outrageously long and slow even for the fanatics.
I watched it on Netflix and it took 2 days to go through the movie.
Very slow character development, which is absolutely not necessary, as we as audiences are already trained in this genre.
If you don't like this mob-type genre and these actors, there is almost no chance you would watch this movie or you 'd drop it after half an hour.
Only plus is the good acting of course and the great directing but...if you are new to this genre, start from the classics!

The Irishman,"The Irishman is a companion piece to Martin Scorsese's other gangster films, Goodfellas and Casino.It is also a teaming up of his old pals for one last ride. Robert De Niro has not appeared in a Scorsese film since Casino. Neither has Joe Pesci who basically retired from the movies in 1998. Harvey Keitel last worked with Scorsese in The Last Temptation of Christ. Al Pacino is the new boy, his first time working with Scorsese.The Irishman is less violent than Goodfellas and Casino. It still packs a punch although Scorsese has been more careful not to make these gangsters look as glamorous as in his previous films.Spanning 40 years, Frank Sheeran (De Niro) recalls his story. A World War 2 veteran who fought in Italy, a truck driver who delivered meat who went on to become a man who painted houses (a hitman.) Sheeran got involved with Russell Bufalino (Pesci) a Pennsylvania gangster who kept a low profile. It brings him into contact with Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) the leader of the powerful Teamster union who loaned money from its pension fund to organized crime. Sheeran went on to become close with Hoffa and a union organiser.Scorsese has called The Irishman a chamber piece. It is mainly about its three main characters and only De Niro, Pesci and Pacino go through the digital de-aging process. They are made to look in their late 30s/40s for the early part of the film.The film has the best cinema performances that De Niro and Pacino have given in years, mainly because the quality of some scripts they have been offered have been far from the best. Pacino plays Hoffa differently from Jack Nicholson in the movie Hoffa. Pacino's interpretation is of a man who likes ice cream sundaes, hates tardiness and unwilling to see reason because he thought the Teamsters owed him the leadership as a right. Pesci in contrast with his volatile Goodfellas character is a more thoughtful wiseguy here.The film clocks in at three and half hours. It is too long and one hour could had easily been excised from it. The de-aging has been done sympathetically. It works mainly because we are never told how old they were when we see them at their younger age. However, you can make an actor in his 70s look thirty years younger, you cannot digitally make them move like younger men. You can spot De Niro gingerly climbing some rocks in one scene.The treatment of females in this movie is superficial. Sheeran's and Bufalino's wives are just there to chain smoke. Only Sheeran's daughter Peggy shows unhappiness as to her father's chosen profession. Even then the old Peggy is wasted. At one point I did wonder why the film had a de-aged Holly Hunter playing Peggy. Only to realise she was played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for playing Hunter's daughter in The Piano.Despite the reservations, Scorsese has crafted a wonderful film, getting together the actors he relied on from his own early days as a director. There is an air of elegiac nostalgia to a style of cinema that might be passing away which Scorsese reflected on with his comments about Marvel superhero films. Ironic that The Irishman only got a limited cinema release as its main platform is Netflix.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Disappointing by Scorsese standards,"First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"To call it ""good"" is to call DaVinci a finger painter",I'm going to steal something I read from a food critic once-this deserves a zero because it's so good it'll ruin everything else for you.

Simply Brilliant,"I was worried about the length of the film before i attended the screening, but i can honestly say, i was gripped all the way through, De Niro back to his best, Pesci was fantastic, Pacino was electric, Keitel was menacing & Stephen Graham held his own amongst this legendary cast.A return to this world that Scorsese has mastered with some of his best films & this film sits right up there right next to them.Get comfy & enjoy the great story telling ability of these masters at work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Several Oscar nominations incoming,"The Irishman is another outstanding Scorsese film. De Niro gives one of his best performances in years. His narration is spot on and he makes us genuinely feel for Frank Sheeran. I believe his first Oscar nomination for years is inbound. Pesci is also great in a somewhat reserved role, but it's Al Pacino that really shines in this film. He gives his typical loudmouth performance and should be considered the favourite for best supporting actor, in my book. The film has a good pace to it. The nearly three and a half hour runtime flies by... for the most part. Midway through the second act, things can get a little slow but by no means is it boring. Perhaps it's the kind of film you watch on Netflix rather see it in cinema. The character development overall is excellent. We get a good grasp of every character by the end of the film due to the run time. However, we don't hear a huge chunk of information regarding Frank's Irish background. It is merely mentioned with one or two references. I personally had no issue with the de-aging. I think it's done really well. At no point was I distracted or thought it looked unrealistic. The ending and/or final act as a whole is conclusive. You leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I see a best picture nomination incoming for The Irishman. You should check it out when it comes to Netflix November 27. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A mafia movie that takes the time to talk about different topics in life,"Martin Scorsese grew up making gangster movies, for over 40 years he became the mainstay of modern gangster movies, along with Coppola marked a before and after in the genre, Scorsese immortalized gangster movies with Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino, films full of moral dilemmas, corrupt and proud characters and the typical final act of the film of the descent into misery. The Irishman brings all these elements together in a more existentialist and reflective way, despite being a movie about the mafia it feels more two-dimensional than most crime movies, especially because it is a very personal story told by Scorsese himself, unlike most mafia movies, The Irishman takes time to reflect on the passage of time, repentance, devotion, loyalty, and oblivion, all these doubts drown Scorsese and the main actors of the film who they have reached old age and are reflecting on their own lives.The Irishman has all the features of the Scorsese cinema, long shots, sharp and precise dialogues and dynamic camera movements, every time there is a shooting Scorsese manages to make it look more stylized than the previous one, we all know that the scenes of the Scorsese movies where the violence overflows are excellent, except for the scene of Frank kicking a man in the wax, De Niro's performance is quite disappointing considering that he is a 78-year-old man playing someone in his thirties. Like any Scorsese film, the story is marked by one betrayal after another, the mafia world is not the best to trust other people, loyalty is ephemeral, except that of Russel and Frank that is maintained until the end, when someone makes mistakes the mafia has no other solution than death, Frank was on the verge of making mistakes on multiple occasions but Russel was always there to rescue him as a sign of his true loyalty.The Irishman has an unconventional epilogue for the Scorsese films, we are used to seeing a spiral descent by the characters into madness or misery, or in both directions as is the case with Goodfellas. The Irishman for his part presents a reflective, emotional, sad and cold epilogue, Frank is alone in an old age telling us his story but continues to remain faithful to his ideals, this is demonstrated when he prefers not to tell the police about Jimmy Hoffa even after that all the mafia he knew is dead, that is his loyalty to his religion, the mafia.There are several peculiar scenes in this epilogue filled with a strong emotional charge, the ending leaves a strange feeling of mixed feelings, nostalgia, euphoria or confusion, but above all satisfied when seeing a film that refreshes the current cinema as only Scorsese could have done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
No wide cinema release? I understand why.,"Watching the wax museum version of De Niro for more than three hours wasn't the blast I hoped for. The CGI is not there yet. Dead eyes.

He completely outshines wax-De Niro here.Oh, and by the way, Scorsese: there were no twin towers in the late 60's.I can rewatch 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' over and over again.

A Master Class in Film-making,"Seen this afternoon at the NYFF.This film will doubtless go down as ""The Godfather"" of its generation, with Pacino and De Niro both on hand to assure continuity. Neither of them has done anything remotely as brilliant as this in decades, and the great revelation of the film, Joe Pesci, hasn't done anything at all. It has taken Scorsese's alchemy, back at its peak, to bring the three of them together in ways that surpass the sum of their considerable parts.Although (or because?) much of the film concerns the bleakness of old age, each of them, Scorsese included, is here restored to his astonishing peak capacity: the film's dirty little secret is that much of its substance concerns the process of human subsidence and movement toward the grave (some -- many -- more expeditiously than others, of course, with titles accompanying the first appearance of so many of the minor characters to tell us , laconically, in which appalling way this was accomplished), its principals seem to have discovered the fountain that restores, if not their youth, at least their youthful talents and energy, albeit with a world-weariness that we should all heed.Don't worry about the film's amazing length -- it goes by at warp speed, and if if not for slowing down of its own accord (and logic) in its final half hour, you may feel deprived by how swiftly it is dispatched.The professional reviews. out today, make much of the digital ""de-aging"" that allows the principals to be portrayed in early and late middle age, as well as closer to their natural ages. I confess that I don't see a problem with this, nor, I suspect, will most viewers. Under Maestro Scorsese's baton, all of them are fully convincing at each of these phases of life.Interestingly, it is De Niro (who played the young Vito Corleone) to whom the elegiac moments, poignantly and all-too-realistically portrayed, are given, whereas it is Pacino, to whom those unforgettable solo moments as the middle-aged Don were given, whose role here ends as it began -- in the total intoxication and lack of self-awareness of the powerful and unscrupulous. Pesci's self-awareness and watchful, controlling understanding of the realities of power, obviates the need for introspection -- he never wavers in his understanding of where the chess pieces stand on the board, and how they must, inevitably, be moved, and only fleetingly does he seem to perceive the cost of all that. Far more than his past scenery-chomping roles for Scorsese and others, Pesci's character here is, in this sense, the most terrifying figure in the film.The political messages are oblique (history unfolds largely in the background, on TV sets), but the core Scorsese message about the utter corruption of American life and the impossibility of combating this -- if only because the alleged watchdogs, up to and including Presidents, are , in turn, so easily corrupted -- comes through loud and clear. It's hardly an original message, but Scorsese (like Coppola before him) dissects these dynamics with exquisite precision. The message for our current politics couldn't be clearer, or scarier.Mention must be made of the flawless ensemble cast which backs up these principals, including the amazing women, who play such important, but background roles. (In mob films, as in Catfish Row in the great revival of ""Porgy and Bess"" now at the Metropolitan Opera, ""a woman is a sometime thing."" )I feel privileged to have been present at one of the first public screenings of a film that will certainly join the pantheon. But I must get back to see it again and again, such is the richness contained in almost every frame and sequence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Gangster Avengers born for Netflix,"This film is super long. Too long to sit in the cinema for as fantastic as it looks.

Grossly Overhyped,"If your one of those people thinking about getting Netflix just so you can see this dinosaur, please don't.
Watching Robert DeNero in this film is almost sad. He plays the part of a guy in his prime, but the CGI face doesn't work. It looks animated at times and his body moves like a very old man ... even for DeNero's age of mid 70's.
The grocery sceen where DeNero beats up the store owner is just embarrassing to watch.
Joe Pesci comes out of retirement for this one and shines. He has a stare that burns a hole through you.
Al Pacino as the flamboyant Jimmy Hoffa works well.
Harvey's Keitel in a small mob boss roll is solid too.

Great Film,"""The Irishman"" is really a great film. When the viewer watches a movie with 3h 29min running time and does not stop or take a nap it is an indication that the film is attractive and holds the attention. The screenplay is excellent, disclosing in flashbacks the life of the gangster Frank Sheeran performed by Robert De Niro. Martin Scorsese is certainly one of the best directors of Mafia films. The cast with the veteran Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel is the indication of maybe the best in the genre in the contemporary world. The effects in the make-up are amazing and it is hard to know who they are in the present days. In the end, ""The Irishman"" is certainly one of the best (if not the best) production by Netflix.

It would still be as dull and terrible even if it was a one hour movie.It's not about the story, the story would make a great movie if it was executed differently.The pace, the writing, the dialogues, the script the screenplay the character buildup, introduction and the acting. Everything was monotonous and painful to watch and follow.There was literally nothing in that movie that would make anyone keen on watching more than one hour of that movie. I seriously want it to give up after one hour as I decided that was enough terrible waste of time and energy. It felt like 4 hours of deadly boredom already.That movie is (by far) the worst Movie Scorsese has made.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Joe Pesci is back with a bang.,Joe Pesci delivers a powerhouse performance as Russel in a movie crowded with great performers and performances. Not a dull moment in this classic Scorsese film where we see all the usual suspects one finds in his movies. Robert Deniro delivers yet another flawless performance . Jesse plemons does not fail us either. The turning back time software used on the faces of the actors is good but you can't software back the body of a 70 year old and it shows.

Worth the wait.,"After anticipating this like a madman for nearly a decade, I'm glad to confirm that all my hopes and dreams came true and it's a masterpiece.The storytelling structure is mostly in the same vein as GoodFellas and Casino, but with much more room to breathe (which makes sense when you consider the runtime). Less needle drops, more contemplation. Many brilliant scenes, some very intense moments, an insane amount of hilarious moments... and of course Scorsese directs the absolute hell out of it.Frank Sheeran, while being a bit of an enigma, is easily the most introspective Scorsese mob character ever. And the final 30 minutes or so are an aftermath we've never seen before in a Scorsese crime film.And De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci are all absolutely brilliant. The talk of De Niro being internal and Pacino being external was kind of right, but De Niro also has many funny, charismatic, and noticeably intense moments. Arguably his best moment comes in what may be the most awkward phone conversation in the history of film. Pacino, as you'd expect, nails all of the Hoffa speeches but also has rarely been this funny. And flawlessly portrays Hoffa's desperation (or... brazen lack thereof). Pesci is nowhere near the ""go f- your mother mode"" many were probably expecting. He's kind of the wise old man of the movie, while also being an ice cold mob boss. If he stays in retirement after this, it'll certainly be one of the GOAT swan songs. The film heavily relies on Sheeran's relationship with both Hoffa and Bufalino, and it wouldn't succeed nearly as well as it does without these three actors.Stephen Graham, Bobby Cannavale, and the legend Harvey Keitel are the only other cast members that really get a chance to shine... and they all bring it with limited screentime.And enough can't be said about Thelma's editing here. The film somehow flies by while also feeling like a lifetime... Frank's lifetime. I'm not sure the power of the final act would hit quite as hard if you weren't somewhat exhausted by everything that came before it.The culmination of many careers, and a film for the ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Horrifically Enthralling,"This movie was a different animal then Scorsese's other gangster films. Something about it was disturbing that after viewing I still can't quite put my finger on. It's hard and not really fair to compare Irishman right away to Goodfellas and Casino, which I've seen a hundred times each. I will say that after subsequent viewings, that even if I don't like it better then those two films, the Irishman is better then The Departed, Mean Streets, and Gangs of New York imo.During the Wolf of Wall Street (which I don't count as a real gangster film as great as it was), I kept checking my watch because I was having such a good time I didn't want it to end. The Irishman took on a different form of enjoyment where I never once looked at the time because I was so absorbed with what I was watching. The first hour reminded me of Goodfellas, the second hour kind of reminded me of Gangs of New York because of Scorsese giving us another history lesson about America's underbelly, and the last part of the film reminded me a bit of Casino with an undertone that felt to me like a horror movie. Even though we know what's coming to Hoffa, it doesn't make it any less disturbing to watch when we see it.I never watched any of Scorsese's religious movies like Silence so I can't give an opinion about comparing the ending of the Irishman to the tone of those films. I'll just say I felt like I was attending a bittersweet funeral at the end.Enough has already been said about how great the actors were so I'll just end my review by stating that Stephan Graham was another standout besides the other three main stars. He more then held his own and brought an eclectic, elictrifying mix of comedy and toughness to the story. An excellent villain in a movie full of bad guys.I hope others enjoy the movie as much as I had. It was great for nostagilia to see these powerful movers and shakers, from my grandfather's WWII era, brought to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

old man Scorsese,"Elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) in a nursing home recounts his life in the mob. He murders prisoners in WWII. He drives a truck and steals slabs of beef from the back. He is caught but he wins his trial. He is introduced to various mob bosses and befriends Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). He becomes the right hand man of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).They don't make directors like Martin Scorsese anymore and they don't make movies like this anymore. Quite frankly, at two and a half hour, this may fit better as a TV mini-series. Only his name makes this a cinematic experience. While it is beautifully filmed, nothing really screams big screen. It is detailed and methodical. The problem is that it is a movie about a cold-hearted character. He is unmoved about his violent ways until the last act. His criminality is not fun. His brutality has no humanity. He is psychopath and not an enjoyable one. It is a movie from the past, by the past, and about the past. While I am in awe of the filmmaking expertise, I find the character has limited appeal. Scorsese is going over old grounds. His perfect movies have already been made.

"Review the movie for what it is, not for what it's not","A very common thing that many people do when they review a movie is doing so based too much on what they were expecting. And I understand, everyone had high expectations for this film, and it's normal to be disappointed, but that's not necessarily the movie's fault.Many people disliked The Irishman because they were expecting to see another Goodfellas. I mean, if you want to see something like Goodfellas so bad, then go and watch Goodfellas. Don't blame The Irishman for not being something that it's not trying to accomplish.As you may guess, I thought this movie was great. I sit throughout the shortest three and a half hours of my life, and I was so impressed that I had to watch it again the very next day. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are finally acting for real again, and Joe Pesci makes a great comeback with his greatest performance since, well, Goodfellas.The only thing that I didn't find so marvelous was the CGI used to make the protagonists look younger; at times, it can be very distracting, specially seeing that the characters at a certain age move and talk like older people. However, this didn't ruin my experience at all.I think that what makes Scorsese so great it's that, despite his age and his long career as a filmmaker, he's still making movies as good as the ones he made 30 or 40 years ago (can't say the same about Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Ridley Scott or other directors that were once great), and I'm sure that he is not going to stop very soon.After Parasite, The Irishman is by far my second favorite film in a year that has been great for cinema, and I can't encourage you enough to watch it, as long as you know what you're going for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

So Much Ado About Nothing,"The Irishman isn't a bad movie. Actually, it's beautifully made and, from a narrow filmmaking perspective, it is flawless. However, something is missing from this movie--something which isn't missing from Scorsese's early gems such as Taxi Driver, After Hours, or Casino--namely: ""mission."" The Irishman lacks mission. For over three hours I was floored with spectacular cinematography and state-of-the-art acting by De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. But once the credits hit the screen, I felt cheated, shortchanged. The Irishman is well-made, but it is easily forgettable. I cannot think of a single scene or theme that has stuck with me from this whole visual epic. It somehow feels like a watered-down version of another movie which got lost somewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It's too long and they are too old,"When we went to the start of the Irishman's career, I was honestly baffled a couple of times. What motivates this senior man to start stealing and hanging out with mobsters at his age? Is this young girl in his household his granddaughter? And they are now christening a newborn... his own?! De Niro was in mid-seventies so his character was at least 40 years younger! Makeup and visual effects can only do so much, he looks 55-60 in his ""youth"".It was a bizarre decision not to use a younger actor. Imagine Godfather II with 50 year old Marlon Brando playing his young self. That would be a smaller age difference. One of the most problematic scenes is when the Irishman's De Niro beats up a grocery store owner. He jogs stiffly instead of running and attacks the grocer with all the realism of a pro wrestling fight. I couldn't help but remember James Caan's savage street beating of Gianni Russo in Godfather I. Compared to that, this was pathetic.The movie is also unnecessarily long. You could cut an hour out and improve the pace. Too many slow scenes, discussions that don't advance the plot, driving around... For instance, there's a wedding of two characters we don't see elsewhere in the movie and we go to a slow motion study of the faces, dresses and so on. Why even show the wedding, let alone in slo-mo?On the positive side, the cast is all great actors and when they play their own age, they are perfect.

A Movie to Appreciate for Unappreciated Reasons,"In the past ten years, I have had to sit through some of the most average films that were garnering Oscar-attention to try to see what the fuss was all about. I would sit there with an open-mind trying to see, or extract, what exactly was so good about these ""hyped"" movies.Take just the last year or two for instance. As I peered hard into stuff like Roma, A Star is Born, or 3 Billboards, and similar stuff, it was like searching for a grain of sand in a field of tall grass to find what was so ""classic"" or special about them, compared to my four decades of watching and rewatching true greats and classics. By the time I got done, the best I could do was shrug and say, ""I guess"" (guess it was decent). But the truth was that none of these movies satisfied. The best you could say was that one or two scenes were good or that it was ""artistic"", but that doesn't mean much when there is no plot and it's just visual scenery.So the thing with the Irishman is it is understandable this movie will not be for people who don't like to sit through long movies at about 3 and a half hours long. So it will get it's fair share of casual movie-goer criticisms. However, when you really read these reviews, one thing almost all of them have in common is that they are very superficial. Nobody is arguing the merits of the actual true story, how good the acting was, or how good the director was. They are just stressing CGI effects of deaging, the actors are too old (I don't understand this one since Hoffa has been normally shown historically in photos to be at least in his 50s in most news coverage when telling his story, and that is fairly old), or that the movie is too long. Some are just dullards with short attention spans who even admit they only watched the first half hour or so and are trying to critique an epic story that unfolds, which is just dumb. So the criticisms are actually shallow and perfunctory.Now, here is the experience that I got. I went into it unbiased and with relatively low expectations. First off, the lengthy run time scared me a little, and I thought I may be in for a snoozer. But let me tell you right off the bat that within the first half hour I knew I was watching a vintage Scorcese movie due to the style, the editing, the music, and the top notch acting performances. That, first and foremost, got my attention, and then before I knew it an hour and twenty minutes had gone by and I had held in my need to use the bathroom, it was that compelling and riveting; I didn't want to miss one line or one scene because every single scene (and there were many with so many cuts and edits) was imperative to the story.Unlike in most of the years of the past decade, I truly felt like I was watching a true movie that I didn't need to squint at to try to extrapolate some level of quality that wasn't actually there to try to justify the warranting of critical acclaim and Oscar-buzz talk. It was unforced and naturally immersive, and this is something to really appreciate these days imo.To be naturally taken in by a good story with great acting, with surprise elements (such as the repeated inclusion of historical events like the JFK victory, the Bay of Pigs and Castro, how the mafia had casino investments in Cuba, Kennedy's assassination, Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General going after the mob despite the fact that the mob was one of the reasons why Kennedy won in the first place, and subsequently even the Nixon years) was a true pleasure each and every scene. While the glass-half-empty people can criticize the deaging CGI, nobody can argue for one minute that all 3 lead actors were at least good, and this is not to mention all of the solid supporting characters (I mean to have Harvey Keitel as like a secondary character in a movie like this is a luxury with his menacing glare and wise-guy presence).Best of all, this is all based on a true story so all of these people really existed, and I would be lying if I told you I didn't laugh several times throughout the film, including at the screen stoppage and captions that revealed when and how many of the side characters eventually died (which was usually something like ""1981, 8 shots to the head"" or ""1980 six gunshots to the back of the head""), or the conversation in the car that extends and Pacino asks Sally Bags what he knows about fish (""Have you ever even caught a fish?""). Being real people and based on true historical events is an incredibly understated asset of this film. Even the road movie aspect of it, how it is in the present day and they are driving through Pennsylvania and stopping for smoke breaks for Pesci's wife on their way to Ohio I found to be pleasingly realistic.For most of the movie, especially Pesci, it doesn't feel like the actors are acting at all. Sometimes DeNiro had some forced scenes, and Pacino always goes over the top at times, but overall the acting was just excellent.Even though I fell asleep at 5am about halfway through the movie on the first night it was released, which was already way past my usual sleep time, I still couldn't wait to finish it the next day. But I'll be honest, I thought it was going to get boring since it had slowed down in the middle a little bit. But later in the day I returned to pick up where I had left off and I was in for a big surprise as to the rest of it.Reminding me slightly of the Aviator, the ending of the movie goes into DeNiro's/Sheeran's later life and old age, as well as Pesci's. These scenes were all gold and well done, surprisingly, I truly appreciated the maturity and realism with which Scorcese constructed this portion of the movie and its scenes and themes. I don't understand some critics who saw this part as Scorcese himself as atoning for his violent movies at all, although that's a fine interpretation if that works and perhaps it has some truth to it. Instead, what I saw was the humanity of this gangster (gangsters including Pesci) being shown to the audience as he struggles with ailments and immobility. I'm not going to lie, but personally, I was immersed and saddened by this final half an hour.Sure this guy was a killing SOB, but in old age, I really felt bad for him. I'm not sure what exactly that means. It's not that there haven't been other movies or shows that didn't make you feel bad for the villain. But one thing it did mean is that Scorcese made this movie more soulful and emotional than it really needed to be, he ended it with that, and that will probably make it ultimately memorable in a unique way. Anyone who shut the movie off in the first 30 minutes or halfway through doesn't deserve to catch the final 30 minutes because they don't have the depth to access and appreciate such raw material and emotional truths about life anyway.I was just appreciative that I finally got to see a real movie about real people, who weren't overly glamourized as say in The Wolf of Wall Street, or as boringly evolved as in the Aviator. I got to see a truly good movie that easily deserves its Award-buzz without feeling like I was trying to find a piece of sand in a tall field of grass, and for that, I'm appreciative.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A modern gangster drama masterpiece,"""The Irishman"" is a modern masterpiece and one of the best gangster dramas of the past decade. It is an absolute joy watching Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci star together in a Martin Scorsese picture.Frank Sheeran is recounting his old days when he was a hitman for the Bufalino crime family. The movie is based on the book ""I heard you paint houses"" by Charles Brandt and revolves a lot around the suspicious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.The story is quite intricate and might require a second viewing for full appreciation. There are a lot of characters to remember but the story is always entertaining and thrilling. ""The Irishman"" deals a lot with sentimental subjects such as nostalgia and regret which few other gangster dramas do.The technology which was used to make the actors look younger is surprisingly great. But despite their best efforts to make the actors look younger, it is clear that they are not that young by looking at their movement. They move like 80-year-olds when they are supposed to be 50.Robert De Niro who plays Frank Sheeran does a terrific job. His narration adds a lot to the film. Al Pacino was also exceptional as Jimmy Hoffa. The most incredibly played character is that of Russel Bufalino, played by Joe Pesci.Pesci usually plays unpredictable, loud, and violent characters. But Russel Bufalino is different. In ""The Irishman"" Al Pacino's Hoffa is the hothead whereas Bufalino is the voice of reason. Russel Bufalino is a very powerful man, but he's reluctant to use his power. Bufalino prefers diplomacy over violence, resulting in one of the most restrained (and best) performances of Pesci.The cast alone should be your reason to watch this movie. It is a must-see and expertly crafted masterpiece. It is a great piece of filmmaking with some of the best performances of 2019. It is sad watching these legends getting older and knowing that one of these movies will be the last. Let us enjoy it while we can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

What a mess of a movie,"I cannot fathom two things: how this movie cost so much to produce, and why they wasted so much money doing so. This movie was like watching a documentary about a political campaign that never ends. Seriously, save yourself 3 hours of the most boring and monotonous mash up ever. There is virtually no action or incentive to keep watching. It's 90% people talking at tables with lines like ""Who said that?! Oh he said that?!"" or ""Ok, well you talk to him Frank!"" and then Frank talks to him, and then Frank talks to the other guys, and then Frank talks to him, and rinse and repeat. Occasionally a few seconds are spared for shooting someone in the head and then that's it. You are constantly left searching for a reason to keep watching, but it never comes.The acting is not even that good either. With the exception of De Niro and Joe Pesci, it seemed a little awkward. Al Pacino walks, talks and acts funny. They may have de-aged faces but the postures are very out of sync with their ages for almost all the actors. There was a scene where De Niro beats up a grocery guy that looked more like a rehearsal rather than an actual scene. I'm shocked they let it pass. I only laughed at one scene that had to do with ears and that's it (which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1).I also gotta say that the ending was so anti-climactic and long-winded that after the movie I seriously sat there for a moment and contemplated why I wasted all this time on this hyped up monstrosity. Everyone claiming this is a masterpiece is either paid to say so or are saying so because of all the fancy names attached to this title.

"A Profoundly Moving Tale of Loyalty, Betrayal, and Guilt","Scorsese's mob films (I'll lump Wolf of Wall Street in with them) are harshly critical of organized crime and the destruction these criminals bring down on everyone around them. However, those sequences when the world comes crashing down around the main characters are explosive and fast, never leaving enough time for reflection on the crimes committed and the lives ruined. 'The Irishman' takes the time to focus on the guilt-ridden aftermath. That focus turns the film into a profoundly moving piece.I will first say that the otherwise masterful editing is weak in the opening 45 minutes. The film inter-cuts too often between the establishing scenes and events that take place much later. Without any context, these edits struck me as awkward and pointless. This is a nothing complaint, just don't be too worried if the opening feels a little odd.The foundation of the film is the moral struggle of De Niro's Frank Sheeran. Sheeran is both a trusted associate of the mob and a trusted friend of Jimmy Hoffa's teamster union. The tensions between Hoffa and the mob place Sheeran in the middle of two stubborn and powerful forces. De Niro's acting is subtle beyond belief. Sheeran is a cold hard professional, and any melodrama from the character would be a misstep. The film itself effortlessly sidesteps any cheap emotional frills where they easily could have surfaced. Nevertheless, we can always see into Sheeran's head and understand the moral questions he is facing.The aftermath of the struggle is where 'The Irishman' shines though. We see what happens to these men in old age. Powerful mobsters don't often die of natural causes. Throughout the film, we are greeted with slightly comical blurbs telling how and when various mobsters died (often via violence). But what about those who live to see 80. These men didn't build lives to last, and so we see them limp on to deeply depressing deaths.That is the point of 'The Irishman.' Even when mobsters live, they live only to see that their lives were pathetic. It is a reflection on the price that a mob life inflicts on those who live it, and those around them. That makes this the ultimate mob film. The sense of fun that lasted to the final scenes of 'Goodfellas' is overridden by somber reflection. There cannot be anything but a depressing ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

What Martin Scorsese accomplishes here is something of a cross between GoodFellas and The Wolf of Wall Street, with sprinklings of the rest of his work throughout.The de-aging (which seems to be the talk at the moment) is pretty solid. Once you adjust your eyes, you forget it's even there. I will say though, the actors are old now, and they clearly don't move like they used to. So it's not so much the 'younger skin' that would be a giveaway, but the way in which the actors move and carry themselves.It is a long film. But not once did I feel like it was outstaying its welcome. The last hour and a half was particularly enjoyable for me - there were some real nice moments between several characters. The script is juicy, with a mix of hilarity, preciseness, and even a little poignancy.It may be the post-film hype talking here, but I think The Irishman is Scorsese's best. It's certainly my favourite piece from him. It feels like a farewell. We'll see how that fares when I rewatch next month on its official release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Far too long, but the existential and eschatological elements make up for it","Based on the 2004 book byCharles Brandt, ""I Heard You Paint Houses"": Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and the Inside Story of the Mafia, the Teamsters, and the Last Ride of Jimmy Hoffa, written for the screen bySteven Zaillian, and directed byMartin Scorsese, The Irishman is about aging, loss, taking stock, regret. To a certain extent, it is to the gangster genre whatThe Searchers (1956)was to the classic western. One of the best-reviewed films in years, although I certainly don't disagree that it has (many) masterful elements, I felt it's just too long. Shorten it by just 20 minutes in the mid-section and you have a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no problem with long films - I'm a fan of pictures such asThe Godfather Part II (1974),Once Upon a Time in America (1984),Dances with Wolves (1990),The Tree of Life (2011),The Deluge (1974), andSatantango (1994)(all 442 minutes of it). However, such length has to be narratively justified, and I just felt that in The Irishman, it wasn't, with the film's 206 minutes occasionally feeling padded and (dare I say it) self-indulgent. Nevertheless, the acting is universally superb, the directing is more contemplative than we've seen from Scorsese in a while,Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is predictably awesome, andRodrigo Prieto's cinematography is flawless.The film opens in 2003 as we meet an elderly Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) living in a nursing home and close to death. Wanting to go with something of a clear conscience, he begins speaking about his time as the go-to hitman for the Bufalino crime family in Pennsylvania. In 1954, Sheeran becomes friends with family patriarch Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), and soon, Bufalino has him carrying out various hits. Loyal to the family, and adept at his job, Sheeran quickly moves up the underworld ladder, and Bufalino introduces him to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The president of the Mob-funded Teamsters union, Hoffa is facing federal investigation and is struggling to deal with rising teamster Anthony ""Pro"" Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Bufalino wants Sheeran to babysit the volatile, unpredictable, and confrontational Hoffa and try to keep him out of trouble. Hoffa and Sheeran hit it off, and soon Sheeran is Hoffa's unofficial bodyguard. However, as the years go by, Hoffa continues to antagonise his Mob backers, and some of them soon come to see him as more of a liability than an asset.Originally set at Paramount, when The Irishman's budget started pushing $150m before shooting had even begun, the studio dropped it. Then came Netflix, who not only put up the money, they also offered Scorsese a near unheard-of degree of creative control. Netflix's involvement is an interesting situation because here you have a film that simply could not have been made through the modern studio system (at least not in its current form). Many are predicting that streaming services such as Netflix will ultimately destroy the cinema industry entirely, but in this case, it's hard for a cinephile not to celebrate their salvaging such an ambitious and auteur-driven film. It was a great PR move, sure (and they really, really want a Best Picture winner in their catalogue), but it was also a massive financial risk. In terms of the real-life background to the film's narrative, most historians dismiss Sheeran's account of how important he was to the Bufalino family, maintaining he was a low-level goon with a drinking problem who was never assigned to any important task. Indeed, several of his claims have been explicitly proven as fabrications, and several people who knew him have stated he did none of the things he claimed.Irrespective of this, however, The Irishman is a film written in regret. Much of this is tied up in Sheeran's daughter Peggy (played byLucy Gallinaas a child andAnna Paquinas an adult). An almost completely wordless role, Peggy is introduced in a scene in which she watches her father viciously beat the grocer for whom she works because he pushed her, a scene which speaks to his sociopathy if not necessarily his psychopathology. The impression of him which this gives her is something Sheeran spends much of the rest of the film trying to ameliorate.Another important thematic element is that as each gangster appears for the first time, a subtitle tells us who they are, and lists the date of their deaths and how they were murdered. There's no better illustration of just how concerned the film is with the nature of transience - every single one of these guys is a colossus in their own mind, and each deems themselves invincible (as do we all when young). Yet none of them make it out of life alive. In the film's last act, this theme is distilled down to its very essence, essentially positing that the only important thing you leave behind is your relationships with other people, and Sheeran has badly mismanaged his, resulting in him sitting alone in a nursing home at Christmas. InGoodfellas (1990)andCasino (1995), the protagonists lose their wealth, possessions, and status, but in The Irishman, the loss is more existential - Sheeran loses his soul.As the violence settles and the zingers dry up, the film's last act is remarkably bleak in a way that the last acts of GoodFellas and Casino aren't, and as we watch Sheeran sitting in that nursing home, taking stock, spelling out his regrets, reminiscing about his actions as a young man, it's impossible not to see the meta dimension - Scorsese himself looking back on his career, remembering the classics of yesteryear, keenly aware that old-age is stalking him.In terms of the acting, the closest we get to a poor performance is Pacino, who portrays Hoffa as if he was playing, well, Al Pacino. Look at footage of the real Hoffa, then watch both The Irishman andHoffa (1992)in whichJack Nicholsonplays the character, and tell me who gives the more authentic performance. Don't get me wrong, Pacino is fun (I would gladly watch an entire film composed of nothing but him and Stephen Graham insulting one another), and most of the laughs come from his over-the-top antics, but it's not an especially accurate depiction of the real man. As for De Niro, this is his first not-phoned-in performance in decades, and he imbues the character with real interiority and complex psychology, without diluting the inherent inhumanity. However, the real standout performance is Pesci, although those looking for the fireworks of Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro will be disappointed, as this is literally the inverse of such performances. Bufalino is quiet, calm, considered, highly intelligent, but cold and sociopathic, the kind of man who wouldn't beat your head in, but would order someone else to do so without a second thought.If the film has a single problem, it's the runtime. As mentioned above, the last act is devastating; there's little tension as such, but there sure is pathos. However, by the time we got to this point, I was starting to feel the film had outstayed its welcome, when I should have been the most heavily invested in the story. This has been a recurrent problem in recent Scorsese films, but this is the first time he's strayed from over-long into self-indulgence. The film simply doesn't warrant this length; whole scenes could easily be removed without compromising the story, character beats, or emotion.Another problem, albeit a smaller one, concerns the digital de-aging. It's a little jolting at first, but easy to get used to. What stood out, however, was the tired bodies beneath those de-aged faces. This is most notable in the scene where Sheeran beats up Peggy's boss. Except the beating is pathetic - the kicks are about five miles away from the man's face and De Niro's exhausted stomps wouldn't flatten a wet cardboard box. It's a shame as, it's a good scene, but the lack of correlation between face and body is undeniably jarring. Another issue is one that has cropped up in all of Scorsese's Mob films - glorification. Obviously, The Irishman is about the toxic masculinity of this world and the lonely endgame (if one even gets to the endgame), but much as was the case with the (frankly stomach-churning) softening of Jordan Belfort inThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013), Scorsese runs a very real risk of glamorising what he claims to be condemning.For me, The Irishman was a very good movie, but not the masterpiece many have felt it to be. But that's just me, and I can certainly recognise and celebrate such ambitious filmmaking, especially coming at a time when more and more it feels like films are being made by committees rather than by artists. Arguably Scorsese's most eschatological film, certainly sinceKundun (1997), The Irishman is the story of how one man lost his soul, and, by extension how the world for which he lost it, dehumanises and degrades those who participate in its rites. Although Sheeran is brought down by old-age, abandonment, and the merciless nature of human existence, Scorsese refuses to afford him an easy out - he made his choices, and he must now live, and die, with the consequences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
So bad on so many levels,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made. The best explanation for this movie is that it was like an Alzheimers ward put on a reenactment of Casino or something. All of the characters/actors are slow to get the lines out. The lines are very choppy. Kinda like they only did one take, no more. Having DeNiro act like a""young"" person was terrible. His cautious body moments and hand trembles gave him away. Not to mention the fact that the de-aging process only seemed to take them from 85 to 65. Apparently the technology is still not powerful enough.The plot and the scenes were not interesting in any way. Don't have any reason to root for any of the characters. I stopped halfway through. Just couldn't take any more.If you see any score higher than 6, it is not a real score. This film has no business being rated anywhere near as high as it is.

Scorsese's Second Best Film,"Goodfellas is the third greatest film ever made; just after Godfather II and I (in that order). Those rankings put The Irishman at #4 all time. I've watched it at four times, and it grows on me more each time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A lot of Idiots in This Review Section,"Spoiler alert! This is not Goodfellas. Anybody who went into watching this film anticipating that it would behold any similarities to Goodfellas was setting themselves up for disappointment. To refer to this movie as anything lesser than great is disrespectful, and demonstrates an utter intellectual inability to recognize story depth. If you are looking for easy and mindless entertainment, don't bother watching this film: it is laced with methodical story telling, prolonged character development, and various deeper meanings. This movie was not to reminisce previous Scorsese ""Mob Movies"". This movie was intended to stand on its own. The story may not contain a similar amount of action when compared to his previous works; however, his ability to embed deeper meaning within a biographical piece is remarkable.the movie is slow and methodical in portraying the life story of Frank Sheeran. While Goodfellas focused primarily on the chaotic lifestyles of mobster, The Irishman focuses on how this lifestyle can destroy relationships, ruin lives, and precipitate nothing but sorrow for those involved once they reach old age. This cannot only be applied to those characters in the movie, but also to people in general. Frank Sheeran personifies an individual that gradually coaxes through life obeying what others tell him do, which ultimately leaves him miserable and dying with nothing but notoriety and regret. His relationship with Hoffa represents morality and the person he desperately wishes he was, while his relationship with Russ represents the person he currently is and will have to deal with the consequences of. In my strong opinion, this movie not only entertainingly portrays the unfamiliar story of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa, but also serves to provide an introspection on life.Al Pacino and Joe Pesci deliver brilliant performances, as they both masterfully compliment De Niro's quiet-spoken approach.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Look past the mildly distracting de-aging, and you will see a masterpiece","The Irishman is a film with its own breathing, beating conscience. Throughout the film, we are introduced to characters with the details of the gruesome fates that await each of them plastered on the screen. There is no mistaking many of these are dead men walking. Men with their fates sealed into the actions we are concurrently reliving through the retrospective lens of an older, wiser person.The movie is long. Please, please see it in theaters, as it may be the last new Scorsese film you can do so, but start it with an empty bladder. It's no Wolf of Wall Street in pacing, but it's paced exactly where it needs to be, and never gets slow or disengaging. It's apparent that a lot of thought goes into instilling these moments with extra meaning or tension, from smelling something fishy to giving alcohol metaphors as someone who strictly doesn't drink.Acting is superb from the entire cast. Pacino is very Pacino, Pesci carries an intimidatingly loud silence, De Niro is great in every scene, and Anna Paquin gives a phenomenal ghostly presence. She may very well have given the Oscar-nominated performance with the fewest lines in history (we'll see, Judi Dench...).The de-aging effects have a Polar Express-y softness most noticeable in the early scenes. Makeup is only occasionally distracting (e.g. De Niro's bright blue contacts). And there's an early curb scene that should have been re-shot to be less old man.The Irishman (""I Heard You Paint Houses"") is complete and wholesome cinema. It gives the Netflix generation a hangout sesh with some of cinema's most beloved actors dishing out their same gangster core, but with the mental burden and guilt-ridden glances that haunt an aging hitman. The opening song contains everything Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran is about to unfold for us over the next 3½ hours. Over that time the narrative weighs down the tune with a growing heaviness, all the way up until the poignant final shot.This is Scorsese matured and in true form, doing what he does best as a veteran filmmaker and master storyteller, only with the introspection, wisdom, and humanity that confront and reflect on his life's work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Legends back on form, yet it just doesn't all add up for me","It's a return to the tried & trusted formula for some of the greats of cinematic history. Scorcese directs in his familiar field of Italian American mafia & gangster life, and with Pacino, De Niro, Pesci and Harvey Keital all leading the film this is one of the most stellar casts of any film in many a year (if not ever). Ably assisted by more recent star names like Stephen Graham & Bobby Cannavale, it all bodes well.For me, De Niro and Pesci are giving their best roles for many years, possibly could be Oscar nominations.Yet I feel this just doesn't fully add up. So much good to say, in terms of direction, style, fashion, humour and realism but was quite self-indulgent, and Pacino was just faxing in the same shouty role he has done for years. The film is almost 3.5 hours long, and it feels like it, it could have been shortened without any loss.The storyline drags, and I only found it at its best in two areas. One was the relationship between De Niro's character and his daughter Peggy, and then the last hour as all came together. However, there's a lot to get to these points, and I was engrossed yet not always engaged. It's a slow burn gangster film, more about corruption centring round union man Jimmy Hoffa. Maybe Americans will find this more appealing than non-Americans, as they can relate & understand the full underlying politics relating to the characters.There is a lot of good to say, and Scorcese will have another hit on his hands. Recently he has criticised tent-pole films like the Marvel films for not being cinema, which is churlish. Cinema is a wide cross-section of story telling. Thankfully there is still room for films like 'The Irishman' but in truth I think it could have been just so much better. Not disappointing, just not a classic for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Don't listen to the negative reviews,"I would like to start off by saying this movie is a MASTERPIECE, Scorsese hasn't worked with Robert de niro since Casino (24 years ago) the soundtrack, cinematography, editing of this film is incredible and De niro, Pesci and Pacino's performances were amazing. To all the people saying this movie sucks because of the length time they certainly haven't seen films like The Godfather Part 2, Once Upon A Time In America, The lord of the rings trilogy, and these films are masterpieces, and for the de-aging it's not awful and there's really no young people to replace them.

Nobody can still dunk the ball and it will take for ever to run up and down the court. Although art is not sports and not depented on mobility and physical skills, it is obvious that this cast and director looked simply tired and worn out to carry the task. The movie lacked the flare of Martin's previous masterpieces and gave the impression that it was just a reunion of old friends.

Every actor here did extremely well Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci and even Stephen Graham did extremely well fitting in with the Hollywood legends but for me Al Pacino was amazing and although him and DeNiro between them haven't done much in years shows they still got it in them under the right director.

"One of Scorsese's bests, please ignore spamming by Marvel fanboys","The Irishman is a prime example of real cinema. Fantastic characters, writing, cinematography and pacing. This movie will put you through the emotional wringer by the end. Each shot of the film is precise and picturesque, something Scorsese has better refined in his old age.The movie is about the relationships we build in each other and the terror of getting old. This should resonate with anyone who isn't a teenager, it's the true singular vision of an older artist who deserves the creative control he is given.Unfortunately people aren't used to films like this anymore. Audiences want movies which are created by a entertainment board of producers, with each scene crafted to appease as many people across all ages as possible. These movies are loaded with flashy but ridiculous action scenes and corny jokes, precisely plotted to intervene whenever someone's attention span begins to wonder.If I did have to complain about The Irishman I would say digital de-aging still looks rough. Certain scenes make De Niro's face too smooth and it can be momentarily distracting. After the first 20 minutes you get used to this effect, and to me it's hard to fault the overall film due to this. This is a technique the industry as a whole hasn't been able to perfect, beyond the first couple minutes of the new Terminator.The Irishman is an incredible film, I can't recommend it enough.

"Stylish, classy, but indulgent and LONG","The Irishman is a beautifully shot, terrifically acted movie. It's reminiscent of these fine actor's earlier gangster epics, but it is not without it's issues. Some of which are glaring.Firstly, and most noticeably is the running time. Don't get me wrong. I have no issues with attention span. In my view a movie can be as long as it wants. So long as it fills that time well. The Irishman could have easily been reined-in by 45 minutes at least, without ever hurting the plot or feel of the movie. Sadly, I found myself clock watching on a few occasions in it's three and a half hour run time, and my partner...well she fell asleep at two hours twenty.
As an example, almost an hour of the movie is essentially De Niro going ""you gotta calm down, Jimmy"" and Al Pacino replying ""I won't calm down, Franky"". We get it already, he's stubborn, the mob are annoyed.
It is still watchable at this length, (if you have some grit) which is testament to those involved, but it's pushing it and pushing it hard. At times feeling over indulgent. I imagine it would have suffered harsher reviews, had it been a cinema release. The comfort of your own couch, bathroom and access to coffee goes a long way here.The other issue for me, was the use of Pacino and particularly De Niro, in portraying their characters younger selves. I can't help but feel it would have been more effective to use younger actors of a similar appearance to portray these characters in their earlier years. I have the utmost respect for everyone involved in this, but there comes a point when you have to accept that these guys are no spring chickens. There is some skilled use of makeup (CGI?), but no amount of makeup could hide Pacino's aging posture. He is pushing 80 after all. Yet Here at stages in the movie, Pacino is supposed to be Jimmy Hoffa in his 50's and 60's, possibly even younger.
Worse still, De Niro's character Frank Sheeran is frequently referred to as ""kid"", yet even with makeup/effects/hair dye he appears to be in his 50's or 60's. Not bad for a guy pushing towards eighty, right?... Not so great when you consider the reality that Sheeran was in his mid twenties when he met Russel Bufalino and began working for the mob. No amount of 'Just For Men' is pulling that illusion off.Negatives aside, the scenery, attention to detail, costumes and cinematography are all excellent, as is the acting by everyone involved. And, even if you already know the history surrounding Hoffa and the unions, it's still a fairly compelling story.
I found it watchable and enjoyed it in part, but I feel it would have had a lot more impact at a shorter run time. I would have easily given this 8 or 9 out of 10, had it cut to the chase a bit sooner and maybe not leaned so heavily on the makeup team.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Sustained Pain,"I have to admit it. This genre is far from my favorite. These guys really have no redeeming qualities. Still, I have great appreciation for Scorsese and his stable. How can one go wrong with DeNiro, Pacino, and Pesci and the gang? They are in a class by themselves and have sustained that excellence for as long as I can remember. Virtually my entire life, even pre-Godfather. Here we have a speculative fiction that evolves around Jimmy Hoffa and those who adored or abhorred him. DeNiro plays his right hand man who will go to the wall for him. But it is Pesci who ultimately runs the show. This movie is entirely too long and, of course, the ending tells us that we are dealing with the spoils of our simple or sometimes destructive lives.

Yes there is still a place for this sort of thing but sadly that place will be a quiet dusty corner of history as this falls well short in terms of story & relevance. Of course film critics will lap it up & fawn over Scorsese' greatness but length of film does not equal great movie & Scorsese should have left at least an hour or more on the cutting room floor.

Jesse Plemons has the acting range of a wet paper towel, but a lot of the acting could be described as unexceptional so I guess it's on theme.

Misunderstood,"The Irishman is a title that you should bother watching only if you're a die-hard fan of mobster movies, for which it was made. The movie isn't about tense scenes, action or even story at that point. It's about enjoying the atmosphere that it creates, the same atmosphere you would feel watching Goodfellas or the Godfather. It's about the small talk, the way they behave, the ""gangster"" vibes the entire movie has. You shouldn't even bother trying to listen to every bit a dialogue - I was out of the loop for quite the bit of the movie's length and I still enjoyed it. It's like when someone comes to a nice expensive cafe and complains about the prices - it's not the drink you pay for that's expensive, it's the pleasure of the atmosphere you're in at the time, drinking coffee in your room and on a patio with a nice view isn't the same thing. And that's what this movie is all about. The atmosphere. So don't come in expecting it to be realistic to what actually happened, don't expect memorable scenes or Casino 2. Expect to get a good vibe, which surely will happen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""If they can whack a president, they can whack a president of the union.""","""If they can whack a president, they can whack a president of the union."" That's basically the quote from the Irishman that sets the stage for Scorcese's latest Magnum Opus. I am probably not the best person to trust for this sort of review because I tend to love Mob stuff that is done right, hell my Cover photo of Goodfellas tells it all I suppose. I will say that I did love it and was it too long at 3:29 minutes? I could watched 3 more hours but again I am bias but I was not bored for a second.Joe Pesci once played a Homicidal Psychopath named Tommy Devito in Goodfellas and won best supporting actor deservedly so. This is a more understated role but make no mistake about it, after 18 years away from acting Pesci has not lost a thing, his portrayal as Russel Buffalino is amazing and was my favorite character in the movie, he may not be a Volcano about to blow his top like Devito was but he is just as dangerous and maybe more so as he pulls a few more strings.Pacino has always been an over the top actor, some love him some think it's too much but to me he was perfect for the larger than life Jimmy Hoffa and he has a Grandiose performance that fits like a glove IMO, like Icarus Jimmy Hoffa flew to close to the sun and this is that story and what a story it is.Deniro is The Irishman Frank Sheeran and this is the best performance I have seen from Bobby D in a long time and what can you say that has not already been said about the man, he is the company man who toes the line and does what needs doing and he really shines in the third act and I'll leave it at that.My final review is 4 out of four I loved it and don't have many gripes about the movie at all, would have liked to maybe see a little more of Frank Sheeran's family and how it fell from his grasp.

Brilliant,Why they don't get to see movies like this one every year ? This is nuts . Thank you Martin Scorsese,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
What a disappointment...,"When is saw that Martin Scorcese is directing a gangster film based on the novel by Charles Brandt, titled ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" a true-life account of Frank -""The Irisman""Sheenan, a mafia hitman who according to the interviews he gave to Brandt claimed that he is responsible for -more or less- twenty-five murders, including that of Jimmy Hoffa. For those unfamiliar with James Riddle Hoffa's story, it should be mentioned that he was the leader of one of America's biggest labor Unions, ""The International Brotherhood of Teamsters"", one of the most powerful and influential in the country. Hoffa was the President of the Teamsters from 1957 till 1971. Hoffa was a highly controversial figure who dared to oppose some of the most prominent figures in the American political life of 60s and 70s and one of them was Robert -Bobby- Kennedy, the bother of the legendary John Fitzgerald Kennedy who was murdered in Dallas in November 1963. Robert was also assassinated in June 1968 and while being the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Racket Committee he blamed Hoffa openly for corruption. Hoffa was known to have connections to organized crime and it was rumored that he was a personal friend of some of the most notorious gangsters in the country at the time. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years for attempted bribery, jury tampering, and fraud. Finally, he was pardoned by the Nixon Administration on the supposition that he resigned from the union's Presidency. Nevertheless, the main reason that the name of Jimmy Hoffa is familiar to all Americans is his mysterious disappearance in 1975 which remains unexplained till today.As can anyone imagine any book or movie regarding Hoffa is of special interest, especially if one of them claims to know the truth of what finally happened to him. Furthermore when the cast is announced and you learn that one of the most important thespians of his generation, Al Pacino, will portray the erratic and impulsive Teamsters leader the excitement is doubled. The icing of the cake was that Robert De Niro, an actor whose collaboration with Scorcese in the past delivered some of the most iconic films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Mean Streets"", would play Sheenan.The result of the above was that my expectations of ""The Irishman"" were perhaps a bit too high so one can claim that I was doomed to feel unsatisfied or disappointed with this film. I was eager to watch it so I devoted some of the most productive hours of a day in order to absorb every single aspect of the movie. Unfortunately what I comprehended was that it is best for some great actors to retire before their age becomes a burden, tainting their reputation and directly influencing, in a negative way, their performances. The sight of De Niro playing Sheeran in his fourties was hard-to-watch as his body movements were that of an old man struggling to imitate those of a person half his age. Apart from that, there is no brightness in his performance, nothing reminiscent of De Niro's brilliance that the audiences loved in the previous decades. Al Pacino plays more himself than Jimmy Hoffa and his overall performance is significantly worse than the one by Jack Nicholson in Danny De Vito's, ""Hoffa"" (1992). The only member of the cast that does a truly good job and doesn't seem out of place is Joe Pesci who portrays and elderly gangster who initiates Sheenan in the criminal underworld and lifestyle.The narration of the story in the first hour of ""The Irishman"" brings to mind Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" with short segments of dialogue and action, montaged in a really fast tempo and lacking a clear central storyline. The plot thickens only then Hoffa is introduced in the film and Sheenan becomes his right-hand man. We watch as Hoffa's life gradually crumble and his friends decide that they finally have no need for him or his services and decide to kill him. Sheenan claims that he was the man that actually pulled the trigger and the movie stays loyal to the book, not altering any major plotlines. If you haven't read Brandt's book or if you are unfamiliar with the whole Hoffa case, then watching ""The Irishman"" may prove an instructive as well as entertaining experience. On the other hand, all those who hope that this gathering of stars in this production will produce an unforgettable result, equal to their mythical status in the world of contemporary American cinema will feel betrayed in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Absolutely AWFUL!!!!,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was so awful we gave up watching mid way without a care in the world as to how it ended.The so called de-ageing process was ridiculous. De Niro's character is supposed to be a young man in the beginning but has the face of a 50 year, ( it's bemusing to hear him being referred to as a ""kid""!) and clearly the physicality of an old man. It simply did not work on any level. Why not allow actual actors to play a younger version of the character? Give an actor an opportunity to make a mark like someone gave young De Niro an opportunity in the Godfather 2? How about Scorsese shines a light on young talented actors rather than rely on actors who have had their breaks and basked in the spotlight?Aside from this de-ageing farce, the movie is stupendously dull, repetitive, played out formulaic gangster/mafia schtick. It is neither a slow burner, interesting, insightful or even just entertaining which is the greatest sin committed by a movie that is boring.The acting is almost non existent: men who are going through the motions and their boredom is painted on their faces.These old men need to step aside and let some fresh young blood show them how it's done. Sorry, guys, you were great in your day but stop hogging the limelight!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Scorsese's most mature and tragic work in years. Stripping back the glamour and allure of the gangster lifestyle and focusing on themes far more personal and painful.,"The first half is Scorsese, the familiar. Gangsters roam around doing nefarious, no good. Tracking shots, wipe fast editing, grisly violence and your Dad's favourite 60's and 70's playlist are all present. Only, this time with an added touch; a slight remove and sprinkles of melancholy. An element which truly comes into play during the movie's second half, which is the director at his most subtle, most deconstructive and possibly, most painful. De Niro's Frank Sheeran is not a far removed character from any previous Scorsese anti-hero, but he is quite possibly his most tragic. A man entirely void of emotional understanding to the people closest to him, the times he lives in or the life he's created for himself.At 3 and half hours it's a butt numbing experience and bloated around the middle, but breezier than you might expect and funnier. Furthermore, the cast is unbelievably packed and very few names are sidelined. Keitel, Paquin, Cannavale and Graham may appear than disappear at random intervals, but their presence (and relevance) remain forebodingly intact.
Higher up the ladder are of course Pacino and Pesci (the crowd favourites) and they are, who guessed it, incredible. With the exception of some hard to conceal stiff limbs Pacino is as energetic and electrifying as anything from his golden years. Pesci, almost the polar opposite of his previous Scorsese outings, opts for a calmer, far more controlled presence. Which frankly only makes the moments where his darker nature takes the wheel, all the more chilling.
But this is of course De Niro's show and he is the best he's been in a very long time. For Scorsese he opens up his every pore of talent and restrictively infuses the emotionally stunted Frank with pieces of humanity where ever possible.Ultimately though, what sets this apart is Scorsese. If you're a fan, it's his most mature work in decades and possibly his most personal since 'Raging Bull'
And if you've never heard of him, I recommend watching first 'Means Streets' and/or 'Goodfellas' if you'd like a crash course in the rise and twilight of the man's relationship with gangster cinema. A sub genre he himself breathed new life into over 50 years ago, that's still being mimicked today (mostly to gratuitous effect though).
So it only seems fair he gets to be the one to strip it down, put it on a scale and have final analysis on what a life of crime and violence is worth, in the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws.","The Irishman is supposed to be THE film for Netflix. With a $160 million budget and this year's most wanted de-aging technique (ref. Gemini Man), legendary director Martin Scorsese's long awaited new film has a lot of eyes and hungry fans to please. It's definitely made to be seen on a streaming platform, but with a 209 minute runtime, will this be a hit for Netflix?A mob hitman, Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro), is a man with a lot on his mind. The former labor union high official and hitman, learned to kill serving in Italy during World War II. Recalling his possible involvement with the disappearance of his life-long friend, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Scorsese's mobster tale is a classic in the making. But it isn't flawless. The well known director makes some interesting choices to tell The Irishman's story. We see old Frank in a retirement home, sharing the events of his life with the audience, just like grandpa used to do when visiting on a Sunday afternoon. We go back and forth in time, sometimes up to 40 years back. With the use of de-aging VFX, we see De Niro and co.'s faces through an Instagram-filter, to make them look 40 years younger. It's not a bad technique of visual effects, and it's important to tell the story, but it doesn't work as well as you'd hope it would. Especially in the very first scene, you notice how flawed the technique is when wrinkles are ironed out of Pesci and De Niro's faces, yet when zooming in on their hands you can clearly tell their real age.Blue-contacts-wearing De Niro, gives a typical calm and collected De Niro-performance. He's a good actor, and his more nuanced work in this film is near the end when he gets to work with more emotional material. A very touching note to end the film on. Joe Pesci, who plays Russell Bufalino, knocks it out of the park. His comeback to the big screen is powerful, captivating and career-defining. But the one actor I didn't expect to like as much as I did, is Al Pacino. His performance as Jimmy Hoffa is both spiritual and worthy of every award coming award season. It was like as if he was possessed by the outrageous Hoffa himself - memorable and uncanny.What bothered me throughout the film, was the use of music. I don't mind a piece of music to distinguish certain parts in a story from another, especially when you're going through so many different decades, but Scorsese uses so much music here, sometimes unsuitable to what's happening on screen, it takes away the power of the event. Robbie Robertson's score however, was delightful. Steven Zaillian's screenplay, based on Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"", is strong when it wants to be and reminded me of Tarantino's heavy dialogue work, but is mostly inconsistent in pacing and engagement. The film is three and a half hours long, you're going to have some slower bits, but at least hold your audience's attention. The jokes rarely land, but I'd like to say humour is subjective. I feel like some of you might absolutely love most of the script's boffolas, it just didn't land with me.The supporting cast is substantial. From under-utilised Oscar winner Anna Paquin (as Peggy Sheeran) to celebrated Hollywood star cameos such as Harvey Keitel - everyone gets a little screen time in what's already packed as it is. But a lot doesn't get discussed. The families behind these powerful leaders barely have anything to do and just sit around as extras. Although, an unrecognisable Stephen Graham makes a long lasting impression as Hoffa's nemesis, mob boss Anthony Provenzano.The Irishman is like watching a compilation of Scorsese's oeuvre. It's prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws. This beautifully crafted film is quite small in scope compared to its running time, with perfect production design and the mighty incredible performances make it worth sitting through to the very end. The fact Scorsese decided not to release this piece of work as a mini-series, but as a full length feature film, shows confidence and a little bit of cockiness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Somewhat like Goodfellas - Reprise,"Scorsese is never going to match that film in my opinion. It was the pinnacle of his career. The soundtrack, pace, edittng, acting were all just marvelous. And it gave you a look into the mob from ""the working mobster's"" point of view that made all similar mob movies look like garbage, before and after.The Irishman is definitely worth your time, telling the story of mobster Frank Sheeran (De Niro) from his point of view, as he talks about how he befriended and ultimately executed James Hoffa. Realize that this is an unproven theory based on Sheeran's deathbed confession. Of course, how are you going to lose when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci reunite with Scorsese. I'm not sure Pacino has ever worked with Scorsese before, but he's the pro he always was as Jimmy Hoffa.Since Pesci has been retired from acting for twenty years, the thing that struck me was how OLD he looked. It is actually jarring. He plays De Niro's brother in ""Raging Bull"", and a protege a generation younger than him in ""Goodfellas"", but here he is his elder! And then I look it up and Pesci is actually De Niro's age! So, leaving all of that aside, you get the great performances you'd expect, and the intimate viewpoint and story will hold your interest through the long running time. It is just very similar to Goodfellas in technique, and that is not a bad thing except it seemed like I had seen this film before.The one unique thing about it? You get to see these mobsters as they get to very old age and have a chance to reflect and maybe have some regrets. In Goodfellas, the main character is in his late 30s when circumstances force him out of the mob.I'd recommend it if you have ever liked anything that the actors or that Scorsese have done before.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Well acted, thoughtfully crafted, painfully slow","Martin Scorcese is not the first elderly director who decided to slow things down. It's not uncommon; age seems to cause some auteurs to become fascinated by the slow pace of real life and try and emulate it in film.Anyway, The Irishman is slow. It's a fairly interesting story with interesting very well-acted characters, but every scene plays out fully; you don't just get the basics, you get all the digressions and pauses and irrelevant asides. Any ten-minute scene in the film would be a five-minute scene in most movies.What happens in these slow scenes is sometimes very interesting. And at times there is a horror underneath that is underlined by the calm, leisurely attitude of the principles. But this all still requires a lot of patience. And I've always preferred Scorcese's fast-moving films (After Hours, Taxi Driver) to his slow ones (Raging Bull, Last Temptation of Christ).Maybe at 60 I'm just not old enough for this movie. Sure, it's interesting to watch a movie that follows gangsters from brutal youth to doddering age, but it's not *that* interesting.

THE OVERBLOWN,"I like movies with this theme. Crime, mafia, illusions of power, gang-wars and the lessons learned when reviewing this life-style. It entertains because the vast majority of people at large do not actually act like this or do the things as depicted and the rest of society is drawn into seeing it rather than ever doing it. The Godfather broke some good ground as did Goodfellas, Casino and Kill the Irishman and some of the oldies prior like Al Capone with Rod Steiger, The Untouchables and even the Black Hand or Pay or Die with so many others too. They all follow the same theme of bad guys getting away with what they do, the rise and fall of power, what that money, fame and power buys and how those that live this life all end up i.e. dead. Now saying all that, the hype with this film was/is the stars who have established themselves with the Director and with that a marketing blitz took-off. As presented, who can find fault? What remained is to watch the movie and be entertained. However, seeing old actors trying to capture past successes only goes so far and Scorsese did not break any new ground here either. What we have is seeing the same old Pacino, Pepsi and De Niro replicating what worked for them but it is old, tired and all covered by now. One system that I use to judge movies on that many fail is this: Is this a movie you would see again? Does it have memorable scenes? Is it a comeback experience? The fact is either it is this type of movie or it is not. Once you have seen this movie assuming you didn't get bored you will not visit it again. I don't like it when things are presented larger than life (hype) and then I go in believing this and get let down. This is that case too. All concerned got very well-paid upfront and now they want to capture the costs and then some proving it was a fun and profitable romp at the viewers expense?

Too short! A masterpiece!,"Reading the negative reviews makes me sad and nervous for the future of film and art. All of the comments about it being boring and too long are absurd. This is acting at its finest with some of the greatest actors and one of the greatest directors in the history of film.I watched it twice in two days. It really deserves a second viewing. There is a lot to take in on the first viewing. On my second viewing I really felt the performance by DeNiro. So much emotion in an amazingly powerful performance. Pacino gives the best performance of the year, and Pesci is subtly brilliant. I hope it sweeps the Academy Awards.The de-aging worked for me. I got wrapped up in the story and it never distracted me at all. This is what people want to focus on? Most of the film they are playing somewhat close to their actually age. It's not like we are watching 3 hours of all of them trying to portray 30 year olds.This is a late career masterpiece from Scorsese and I would say it's his best since Casino. If you like classic cinema and love these actors there is no way you will not appreciate and admire all the work they put into this fantastic movie!I loved it and I am so glad it was made! Great job to everyone involved!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
One of the year's finest,"The irishmen: a awesome scorsese epic that is the best scorsese movie since Casino.The good: the story is very complete, it shows you the whole like from Frank, it show you how it started, and how it ended.
The actors are outstanding, Robert Deniro hasn't been that good since Casino. He is a character that express him selve with the eye looking, he is quiet but you feel he's pain and what's he's going trough. He starts as an intimidating assassins but slowly begins to have a relationship with he's friends and family, and he begins to make himself soft. Al Pacino is brilliant, this is the kind of characters he is meant to be, screaming, yelling , cursing and being stubborn. Joe Pesci is not that much in the movie, but when he appears, he steals it, in a slow, quiet but intimidating characters. All these actors have a remarkable ark and their lines don't feel scripted. The story is Martin Scorsese style it has some serious situation but some funny ones. It has many characters but it adds such a unique style. The soundtrack is amazing, is such as good as casino. The editing is gorgeous, it's impress how many things they can tell you in a single shot. The CGI is quite impressive, they look 30 years younger.
The bad: yeah it's very long, hitting with a 3hr 29 min, but personally I don't find it long, it was very interesting and impressive to see.Conclusion: the best movie of the year so far, amazing Scorsese epic, drama, that is on the top 5 of Scorsese best films.

A must see for mafia aficionados,I have spent my whole life (59) reading and watching gangster related themes and this movie has been as enthralling and captivating as anything I have ever seen. Scorsese has managed to take us on an all to familiar route with his inside analysis of psychotic behavior and drawn us in. But what excites me is that I too have grown over the last 40 odd years with the ensemble cast which is such a delight. Thank you for a masterpiece in cinematic history.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"A good movie, but definitely not a masterpiece","Scorsese is a god among directors, he made a lot of movies that are big classic such as Goodfellas and Taxi Drivers. Even his most recent jobs, such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Boardwalk Empire are memorable. So, when The Irishman was announced I was hyped.I logged in my Netflix account a few days after the release date, and I started watching it. A lot of people said that the movie is too long, 3 hours and a half are in fact way above the average, and my suggestion would be to pick a day where you don't have anything to do and enjoy it. I never felt bored and even if, especially in the end, you may feel the weight of its length, there is always something going on screen. It is just another way to tell the story. Nowadays cinema is too fast, sometimes we need this old style storytelling, that takes his time to develop characters and events in the proper way. Unfortunately the attention span decreased a lot from the audience and speaking with friends and colleagues, a lot of them were not able to watch it all at once. A real shame, because this movie need to be tasted slowly and you need to appreciate every single gradient of the story. Very well curated and very dynamic.The other big critic is the CGI used to rejuvenate actors. I have to tell that critiques are not completely wrong on this. The work done is... decent, but not perfect. For example, I did not understand why they needed to edit so heavily De Niro's eyes while he was young. And you can see that even if they are young, the movement from actors it is slower than expected. There, even the most advanced technology cannot do much. Anyway, I think that too much importance was given to this aspect of the movie, this is not the reason why you are watching this movie, it is not a Marvel movie, so even if special effects are not perfect, you can easily forgive them.Even if the movie is well done, we are not at the same level of big classic such as Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, I liked how Scorsese portrayed the mob during the 70's, and also the rise and the fall of the Irishman, but when you have setted the standard so high with your previous movies, it is difficult to do better. Scorsese is a Master and we are lucky enough to see him alive and to keep producing and directing this kind of productions, even if they are not trending anymore in the mainstream cinema. Sometimes is good to have a reminder how cinema used to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Nostalgic Disappointment,"The Irishman isn't a bad film. In a lot of ways it's a decent one. It's just not anything above good. The nostalgic feel makes for a feel good familiarity, but don't be fooled. This is far from a Scorsese masterpiece. Pesci and Pacino are outdated and miscast. Still wonderful actors but sadly often show their true age trying to play characters who are nearly thirty years their junior. The story is long, drawn out and too unoriginal to rate as highly as it does and certainly not a best picture candidate. Enjoy it for what it is - a decent flick that is better than a lot of movies out there, but not a new classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The Only Film I've Seen All Year,"This is the only film I've seen all year.Now don't get me wrong, I've seen a whole lot of moving images with weeping actors and swelling music and pretty lighting and expensive CGI and all that. But they weren't actually FILMS, just a bunch of stage directions and cliched gibberish thrown together by lethargic boardroom committees of affirmative action-hired hacks and screentested before herds of ADD-afflicted cattle.This, on the other hand, is a genuine work of cinema, with every scene a pleasure, culminating in the kind of thoroughly satisfying, harmonious whole that at some undisclosed point in the past decade became just a thing of the past. It's now true to say they don't make them like this anymore: there's no identity politics, no feminism, no product placement, no hiring quotas, no awkwardly-inserted fashionable causes or talking points. Just a really good, solid story, perfectly told, beautifully shot and immaculately acted by every single player in the film. EVERYONE brings their A-game. No-one coasts and grabs the money and runs. It's as if everyone knows this is almost certainly the last mob film Scorsese will ever direct, and they all want to be a part of history, which this is. It's an instant classic.True, it may retread ground we've walked before in earlier Scorsese movies like Goodfellas, and even later TV shows inspired by those, such as The Sopranos. But we don't care, because that ground is such a rare and rewarding place to be.Really, the only weak spot I can think of is that de Niro never once looks or sounds like an Irishman, and his blue contact lenses occasionally make his eyes look like some kind of alien lizard. Which is a little distracting. Also, the digital de-aging was possibly not needed. But that's honestly all I can complain of: it's his best performance in over 20 years, all the way back to Jackie Brown and Casino. And it's the best Pacino has been in all that time, too. Amazing to see him working with Scorsese at last.I don't know how much of the story is true, but then in this case I don't really care all that much, I was just glad to be along for the ride. And even after 3½ hours, I didn't want that ride to end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"I get the criticism, but I thought it was excellent","As someone who loves (most of) Martin Scorsese's work and especially his old gangster films, 'The Irishman' was always going to be a must-see for me. As I usually do when seeing a movie, I went into this without watching the trailer and with as little knowledge or expectations about the story/film as possible, and I was not disappointed.'The Irishman' is excellent, another masterwork by Scorsese and up there with my favourite gangster films, though probably not quite on the same level as the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'. It looks fantastic with great cinematography and some smart use of CGI for anti-ageing effects. I really enjoyed the storyline, which has depth yet is relatively easy to follow, and the characters are very convincing.If it has any flaws they are certainly very minor and did not affect my enjoyment of the film. I would normally tend to agree with the criticism of the excessive length - nobody want to sit staring at a screen for three-and-a-half hours - but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'The Irishman' as it held my interest throughout. A fantastic film and another Scorsese classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Golden Age.. Lost again,"I know it is better to get into a movie with low expectations.. but whatever you expect from Scorsese and De Niro this movie wont match it.Many have said it but I should start with: The movie was too long with the wrong pace and missing any tune. For the first hour and a half it was like watching a huge amount of pictures one coming after the other.. I really don't know what went wrong with the directing and editing.. and all that time it felt like the narrator was just introducing the personalities involved.... it felt like nothing really is happening.From what I heard I expected to see outstanding acting.. Pesci was fine but his role was small.. the same for Romano. Al Pacino was average, overacting at some points... and for De Niro he was simply unable to perform especially in the scenes where he was supposed to be young (one example mentioned by many is the fight at the grocery store). The few good ones were when he was playing the old Frank.For such a movie there was no personality study.. the actors did not age well.. the CGI de-aging technology was annoying.. that dark funny side in Scorsese's movies was missing and a lot more to say if we continue...Many movies fail to entertain but it is only an issue when you have De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, Keitel and others coming one last time together with Scorsese to remind us of the golden age.. and disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Honestly, it was nice to see a movie that wasn't PC","Aside from everything being top notch in this movie, an unforeseen joy for me was seeing something that wasn't a board room movie. The story is told how it should be and cast just how it should be. There wasn't anyone forced unnaturally into the cast to fulfill a demographic. And that really helped the movie. I'm not racist or sexist in anyway but when the focus is on making a movie PC and not the story then the quality of the movie is going to suffer.And everybody picks up on this, including the people that they are spoon feeding to. Look at the recent PC board room movies that have come out: Terminator: Dark Fate and Charlie's Angels and they have bombed. People want good movies, not crap that thinks it's culturally aware.They need to return to this style of movie making, letting the director's make their movies and not demographics.

As good as movies get.,"It plays for 209 minutes so yes, it could lose around thirty minutes or so towards the end when the pace noticeably slackens and that' it, really, my only criticism of Martin Scorsese's magnificent new movie ""The Irishman"", a valentine to De Niro and Pesci, Pacino and Keitel and a homage, not just to his own classic ""Goodfellas"" but also to The Godfather films and the television series ""The Sopranos"". In many ways it's like an anthology of gangster movies but not in the way you might expect. Yes, there are a lot of 'hits' on view, (Gangster Movies Greatest Hits?), as De Niro goes around despatching, with a few bullets to the head, not his enemies but those of his associates and employers. He is literally a gun for hire, even when the victim is someone he might really care for. In this respect the movie most closely resembles ""Goodfellas"" but what really makes this a great film rather than merely a very good one are the conversations. This is a movie full of really good talk delivered by some of the greatest actors alive today. There were times when I was wriggling in my seat out of the sheer pleasure of seeing De Niro sit down with the likes of Al Pacino and Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel and simply talk. Indeed, I could have been doing with more of Keitel whose part is really reduced to just one great scene, but what a scene it is.Early reports of the film made much of a new digital process whereby the actors appear as their younger selves. To be honest, I found this hardly noticeable particularly where De Niro is concerned. Only Pesci came as something of a shock, (he looks like he's wearing a rubber mask in his early scenes), but then Joe has been absent from our screens for so long now it's difficult to know what exactly he does look like. To find fault with the process is really a minor quibble; it's just a joy to see this cast in the one movie.De Niro himself is hardly ever off the screen and his performance is certainly one of his finest in a few decades, (I'd long give up hope of ever seeing him in a part this good again). We also owe Mr. Scorsese an unending debt of gratitude in coaxing Joe Pesci out of retirement. This isn't the Joe Pesci of old, the volatile little firecracker from ""Goodfellas"" but a measured old man who knows all he has to do is raise his little finger, not his voice, to get what he wants. His character here might be what Tommy DeVito would have become had he not been bumped off, resting on his laurels but a killer to the end. He should win the Oscar for this.Of course, they and others in the cast, are Scorsese regulars. Pacino, on the other hand, is Coppolla's boy and is working with Marty for the first time and initially he seems out of place, like he's drifted in from another movie altogether and what we are getting here is 'Shouty Al', 'Roaring Al', Al at the top of his lungs and his performance is in marked contrast to the subdued work of De Niro, Pesci and Keitel. For a moment I thought he might unbalance the picture until I realised this is just what we needed. His Jimmy Hoffa is an adrenelin shot in the movie. Like his co-stars he is an actor relishing the best role he's had in years and like them he has his own great little moments, (dancing with Anna Paquin as De Niro's estranged daughter we could be watching an ageing Michael Corleone). Of course, even actors this could would be nothing without the benefit of Steven Zaillian's marvellous script or Scorsese's sublime direction. When the film was over I thought no, it's not one of Scorsese's masterpieces, it needs trimming, but twelve hours later I have revised my opinion; warts and all, this is as good as movies get.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"same old-same old, much too long","This is not one of Scorsese's better movies and it does little that is fresh and new--just mining the usual Mob vein with lots of talk among the wise guys, punctuated by periodic murders.

Not a theme park ride,"You may or may not be aware of what Scorsese has said.

Seeing Pacino and De Niro together is a treat. But one of the underappreciated performances in this one is Joe Pesci!

a holiday gift for cinephiles,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Copacabana tracking shot in GOODFELLAS in etched not only in my brain, but in cinema lore. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese teases us with a similar shot as the opening sequence in his latest. The camera snakes through the dank halls and rooms of an assisted-living center before settling on the well-worn face of wheelchair-bound octogenarian Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Sheeran is the titular Irishman, and he narrates the story of his life, at least as he recalls it. His is a life story that connects the mob to history and politics in a no frills manner surely to provoke thought, skepticism, and a knot in the tummy.Oscar winning writer Steve Zaillian (SCHINDLER'S LIST, also GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN) adapted Charles Brandt's book ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" for the film. Mr. Brandt was Sheeran's attorney and worked with Sheeran on his memoir. The book title is highlighted by Scorsese at both the beginning and end of the film, as well as through a line of dialogue in the first phone conversation between Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Mr. Sheeran was a WWII veteran turned truck driver turned mob hit man (and good soldier). He tells his story with little fanfare and in a way that we understand no glamour is associated with this lifestyle.For those looking for the next GOODFELLAS or CASINO, you'll likely be disappointed. This one is not as flashy or stylish as those two classics, and instead is a 3 and a half hour introspective look at the men who are efficiency experts in power. Violence is merely one of the tools in their box. The presentation is contemplative, not action-centric. The hits are abrupt and jerky and realistic, not the stylistic choreography of shootouts in films like JOHN WICK. There is a skewed theme of friendship and male bonding ... even mentorship. It's unlike what we've seen before from mob movies.After a chance meeting over a timing belt on a delivery truck, Sheeran is taken under the wing of Philadelphia mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). This is Pesci's first onscreen appearance since 2010, and he is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of ""the quiet Don."" His performance is 180 degrees from his comedy in LETHAL WEAPON (2.3.4) or HOME ALONE, and 180 degrees the opposite direction from his roles in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, where he was a bombastic man (not a clown) on the edge of violence at all times. Mr. Pesci has spent the last decade playing jazz under the name Joe Doggs. It's such a joy to have him back on screen, especially as the father figure-friend-ruthless businessman. His Russell is always calm and calculating, whether plotting the next kill or putting up with his wife's frequent smoke breaks on a road trip.It's Russell who directs Sheeran to connect with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Pacino flashes his blustery best as Hoffa in a couple of scenes, but is also terrific while spewing one of his countless ""c***suckers"", or savoring one of his beloved ice cream sundaes - a simple pleasure in a complicated life. Sheeran and Hoffa develop an unusual friendship in their many years together, and Hoffa's real life unsolved disappearance in 1975 is the basis for Sheeran's recollections.We learn that Sheeran's time in WWII taught him to kill ... there is a scene involving POW's digging their own grave while his rifle is pointed at them. In fact, most of the story is told in flashbacks that bounce between different eras. Scorsese, as has been reported ad nauseam, has utilized the de-aging process from Industrial Light & Magic to show DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino and others over the years. The effect is a bit distracting at first, but the story and these characters are so intriguing that we simply roll with after the initial jolt. It's also obvious how Scorsese worked to make DeNiro look like the hulking presence Sheeran was in real life (think Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies). Camera angles, should pads, and shoe lifts are used to make us think DeNiro towers over the others the way Sheeran really did. DeNiro is excellent in portraying Sheeran as a good soldier, reserved in mannerisms - even flashing a slight stutter at times. He's a proud man who simply looks at the mob work as his job.In addition to the three stars who each excel in their roles, Scorsese has assembled a huge and talented cast. Harvey Keitel is chilling in a couple of scenes as Angelo Bruno, Ray Romano plays mob lawyer Bill Bufalino, Bobby Cannavale is steak-loving Skinny Razor, Jesse Plemons is Hoffa's adopted son Chuckie O'Brien, Domenick Lombardozzi is Fat Tony Salerno, comedian Sebastian Maniscalco is ""Crazy Joe"" Gallo, Louis Cancelmi is bespectacled Sally Bugs, Jack Huston plays Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and even Steven Van Zandt plays crooner Jerry Vale.You are probably wondering, 'Where are the women?'. While there is no Lorraine Bracco (GOODFELLAS) or Sharon Stone (CASINO), Scorsese makes the point that with Sheeran, and these other mobsters, it's all business and real family relationships are non-existent. Stephanie Kurtzuba plays Irene Sheeran (Frank's second wife) and Katherine Narducci is Carrie Bufalino (Russell's cig-loving wife). They have some brief but entertaining moments on the road trip, and Marin Ireland has an effective scene late in the movie as Carrie, one of Frank's daughters, while Welker White plays Jo Hoffa. But it's Sheeran's daughter Peggy who is the quiet moral center of the story and his life. Played as a youngster by Lucy Gallina and later by Anna Paquin, Peggy is a mostly silent observer of her father, and whatever conscience he has, is impacted by her glances. Ms. Paquin is especially good with one question ... ""Why?""Worthy of special mention is Stephen Graham who plays Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provenzano, a friend-turned-rival of Hoffa. Graham and Pacino share two standout scenes - one in prison, while Hoffa scoops his sundae, and a later meeting where Hoffa takes offense to Tony Pro's late arrival and attire. Both scenes are remarkable in that there is underlying humor balancing the surface anger. In fact, the film is filled with memorable scenes. Hoffa's guidance on self-defense in guns vs. knives, and most every scene between DeNiro's Sheeran and Pesci's Russell. DeNiro and Pesci have a chemistry few actors share. It dates back to RAGING BULL (1980), and I believe this is their 7th film together.The film reminds me of the 1970's movies that fueled my movie obsession: THE GODFATHER I and II, THE CONVERSATION, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, CHINATOWN, and even THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Sheeran may or may not be a reliable narrator, but these are real people - even if we don't know the specifics on every hit. Captions are periodically included to inform of us how a particular mobster met his maker - again providing some dark humor. What is a bit surprising is the male bonding, even friendship, between guys in such a brutal profession. And watching how the story weaves in and out of history with the Bay of Pigs, Cuba casinos, and the Kennedy assassination -""If they can whack a President ..."" is a bit unsettling.Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (SILENCE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN) is a good fit for Scorsese's vision, and you can catch the varying camera styles for each character - and don't miss the stunning shot of the illicit guns in the river. Composer Robbie Robertson (The Band) delivers Scorsese trademark musical riffs, and 3-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmacker is in peak form editing this epic. This is the 8th film collaboration for Scorsese and DeNiro, but the first in 25 years (CASINO).I'm a little concerned. In fact, I'm a little more than concerned. This feels like the end of an era. It's not the end of Scorsese films, but it's the final chapter of his mob films. No other filmmaker comes close in this genre. With the bookends of Sheeran reminiscing in the assisted-living home, this is quite the holiday gift for cinephiles ... and a last one (providing Netflix survives).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"A mob film with a difference, The Irishman is another Scorsese masterpiece","I'll readily admit to the fact that on more than one occasion I feared for what The Irishman could become.After what seemed like years of gestation, setbacks and industry murmurings, how on earth could the ever aging yet evergreen Martin Scorsese possibly pull of the most audacious films of his long standing career?Well shame on me for ever doubting, as Scorsese biggest passion project yet The Irishman is both a stunning feat of modern day filmmaking technology and old school craft, as the crime genre kingpin creates a balancing act for the ages while allowing audiences from around the world one last ride with a gang of cinematic legends that here combine forces for what's a fitting swansong to decades worth of hard work and generation defining roles.Clocking in at a whopping 209 minutes, Scorsese and screenwriter Steven Zaillian's adaptation of Charles Brandt's book I Heard You Paint Houses takes its time in telling the story of Robert De Niro's Irish-blooded mob enforcer and hitman Frank Sheeran, as we follow his 50 year plus journey navigating the ranks of the Bufalino crime family under the guidance of Joe Pesci's patriarch Russell, while also illuminating Sheeran's long-standing friendship with influential American teamster Jimmy Hoffa, played by a fired up and typically gusto Al Pacino.By utilising cutting edge de-aging effects, Scorsese and his tech team have managed to allow for these screen legends to be there for every moment of their characters screen time and while at first it's a little off-putting seeing these esteemed figures in such a way, but before long The Irishman will have you wrapped up in its web of friendships, betrayals and life musings and the scarily well done CGI work will become just a part of the scenery.It's no mean feat that this works so well, but Scorsese is perfectly in-tune with this tale and thanks to this The Irishman very quickly establishes itself as a very different mob movie to the one people perhaps expected as it increasingly steers further and further away from the frantic Goodfella's and the over the top Casino to become a meditative examination of the organised crime world that is more interested in asking the hard questions of mortality, family and growing old than it is delivering action or polished shootouts.All aged well past their 60's, The Irishman is reflective of those that inhabit its world both in front of the camera and behind it but it's not to say the men of this film aren't up for the challenge with everyone bringing their A-game to a film that feels like the perfect clashing of time, place and people.As good as they've been in years, De Niro and Pacino wind back the clock in magnificent fashion here, both delivering considered and restrained awards worthy turns, while the much-missed Joe Pesci quietly walks away as the films MVP, in what becomes the performance of his career as Bufalino, a man very far removed from Tommy DeVito or Nicky Santoro.While quietly spoken throughout and barely raising a sweat, the subtle nature of Pesci's performance here stands out as one of the highlights of Scorsese's bladder testing epic, an epic so well put together, so full of memorable dialogue wonderfully played out by a cast one could only dream of that you can't help but sit back and savour the chance to see master's at work, for could well be one of the last times.Final Say -A stunning ode to old school filmmaking and storytelling that molds together seamlessly with modern day technical marvels, The Irishman is a mob movie unlike any other. Featuring an array of top-notch performances from some of cinemas most revered figures as an added bonus, Scorsese's most ambitious project yet has overcome the odds to instantly become one of modern cinemas greatest singular events.5 watermelons out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Fundamentally BORING,"I've watched a lot of gangster films I'm not one for long reviews and this is my first review on here, I think more people should mention just how drawn out this film is.I couldn't even finish it after trying to watch it at different days, this could have reduced down to 2 hours maybe even less, and if they improved some of the poor acting and had more action it would have been pretty decent.Unfortunately that is NOT the case.To give a comparison this feels closer to Godfather 3 which IMO was more about the stresses and struggles of being a highly in demand business man rather than about being a ""Godfather/gangster"" Now this film is more exciting and better than Godfather 3 but not by much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Irishman,"A great movie that was directed by Martin Scorsese and excelled in acting Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. I came out of the film in my head that life will eat everyone. One of the best gangster films. Not winning an Oscar is a crime against the film. I hope Netflix movies are of the same level The Irishman",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
the uncanny valley is strong in this one,"Let's start with this. The 3 main characters younger facial reconstruction is just deep down in the uncanny valley. Especially De Niro's. I found it really hard not to get sucked out of the movie every time they're on screen. I get it that the film's appeal relies a lot on their casting. But i'd have rather had less emblematic actors doing the job without CGI makeup and with classic makeup for the scene in which they're older. Scorsese is a huge name enough to not have to cast these 3 as the main characters too. They could have played smaller roles and left some room for the next ""them"".
The CGI is sometimes very good and sometimes it's botched. When you're focused on that kind of stuff you cannot help yourself from watching the blurry chins, the hair lines that don't match, etc.
When you've seen several Pacino and De Niro movies you are used their younger body shapes and moves, and in this movie they just don't match. They move like older people, you can definitely feel it.
This is why I think traditional cinema should stay away from CGI and that kind of trick.De Niro and Pacino just play too much a parody of themselves. It's like they were polyvalent actors when they were young and lost it by being typecast way too many times. This has a tendency to suck the audience out of the movie too : when you think ""oh De niro is doing the De Niro inverted smile again"" instead of just staying in the movie's flow. Don't get me wrong : they do the job really well, but it's like watching a brand new movie about someone saving the world, and BAM : it's Bruce Willis, and he's making jokes. BTW Pesci nailed it, he didn't ""Pesci in Goodfellas""-ed his role. All the other actors are just top notch, with some very pleasant surprises, such as Stephen Graham as a mafia boss.Scorsese does the job. Like always. Although he rested on his laurels and did almost not take any risk. There are very few directing stunts compared to his other works. But that's ok, it looks it was the point of the movie : stay classic. Or maybe... knowing that there would be a huge CGI work on the movie he chose not to make any complex camera shot. Maybe the veeeery academic frame compositions were just a way to make the CGI work easier.The editing isn't perfect. Some cuts just don't match. And it's not some Nouvelle Vague effects, those are supposed to be obvious enough to create their effect. It's just details, such as body position or stuff like this, and it sucks you out of the movie too.
That's a lot of stuff that breaks the flow of the movie and make it hard to follow.The OST is efficient. Same trick as in his other ""historical"" movies : using music as a time marker.So nopes. Definitely not his best work. Still my favorite director.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another Scorsese Masterpiece,"In the current year, one could easily be forgiven for having difficulty in giving The Irishman the time of day. Clocking in at three and a half hours long, the type of filmmaking on display here could be argued to be a relic of a bygone era that typically would not connect with modern audiences, which is likely the only reason that Scorsese was forced to seek out funding from a company that goes against all of his beliefs on how Cinema should be viewed.
In this digital age, Western audiences are evidently attracted to more succinct and easily digestible movies that have more in common with episodes of TV than lengthy film epics like Raging Bull, The Godfather and The Deer Hunter. Most people seek movies that they can give somewhere between 1% and 50% of their attention to (allowing them to give the other 50%-99% to their phones) and a film is only considered to be good if it can catch enough of their attention to compete with the limitless entertainment machine in the hands of consumers. This is, of course, with the exception of the big Hollywood franchises including the MCU, Star Wars, etc. and big scale television shows such as Game of Thrones, which people cannot help but give up all the time in the world for. While the emotional impact of these products are certainly not to be disregarded as many Film snobs would have you believe, they rarely are able to produce a nuanced exploration of the human condition that delves deeper than surface level. This is precisely what Martin Scorsese was referring to when saying that these are not 'films', but another, highly significant form of entertainment, that has more in common with Disneyland than The Shawshank Redemption.A film like 'The Irishman' was therefore destined to fail with mainstream audiences. Ditching all of the excess and pulpy entertainment on display in The Wolf of Wall Street, that provided a truly thrilling experience like no other and pleased both audiences and critics alike, this film offers a slower, more contemplative experience that's biggest strength is its thematic resonance more than its moment-to-moment entertainment (although this aspect still had me captivated from start to finish).While not without a number of minor technical shortcomings (weak CGI blood, odd editing choices, some poor stunt-work) that one would next expect in a film from a director/producer of this calibre, this film is arguably Scorsese's most mature, poignant, and flawless insight into the human condition since Raging Bull. The film is ultimately about death, growing old, and how easy it is to let one's life slip away by focusing on the day-to-day struggles that are ultimately meaningless. While the first two acts of the film were incredibly entertaining, funny, and tragic all at the same time, the last act of the film contextualises the entire piece in a way that presents an utterly haunting message, prompting one to consider their entire life as a whole and remember that no job, sum of money, or amount of respect from peers is worth the same as genuine human connection - the true meaning of life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Wrong Casting is Throwing Me Off.,"I love me a good gangster movie, and this crew has made the best ones that will ever grace the screen. But the casting in this is so wrong that it's hard to watch.

A fabulous movie-its length gives depth to the greatness of cast and director.,"The Irishman is not a film for everyone.

Having said that, it is a film for film-goers who enjoy the slow development of story and who enjoy an afternoon of continuous story manipulation: of character, of time sequence and historical operative.The final substance of the film dealing with Teamster boss, Jimmy Hoffa allows Pacino to dominate the screen with a pizazz that only a Great like Pacino can manage.Diane and I missed this magnificent film on the Big Screen and watched it on our home small screen but by whatever size screen, make every effort to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
brilliant film with a gimmick not ready for prime time,"I won't go through the plot. I will say it was a joy to see Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino. Joe Pesci, Bobby Cannavale and others in ""The Irishman."" There are many reasons to praise Scorsese's work but I think for a film to last nearly 3-1/2 hours and move so quickly is amazing and a tribute to his artistry.The acting is superb. The three stars manage to create characters that are completely fleshed out. In many ways it's a sad story, with DeNiro's character, Sheeran's, last scenes heartbreaking.In actuality, according to a Hoffa expert of 40 years. the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa didn't quite go down as portrayed. Like ""JFK"" the source is one person, and there are conflicting stories. Nevertheless it's compelling.Now I'll go into why I gave this film a 9. I'm sorry and I don't care what anyone else thinks, CGI isn't there yet. Both DeNiro and Pacino looked as if they had scoliosis and no necks, wearing clothes too big for them. I found it very distracting. In one of the first scenes, DeNiro is a young man driving a truck. I didn't recognize him. Too gimmicky. The aging - and I think they made these guys look older than they are - was much better than the deaging.If it didn't take away from anyone's experiences, I'm glad.

Most of the Critics of This Movie,"Are revealing everything wrong with society in today's world, and it's tied to the fact that they are also Marvel and DC comic book groupies, as well as Star Wars Episode 73; The Rise of Leah and Episode 91; Jabba the Hut's Background Story anticipators.Rather than respect these accomplished and proven great actors and the director for 5 decades of excellence and classic performances, they long for one of their B-list younger actors to have showed up and made an appearance. There is no respect for character or their elders. They would rather live in fantasy delusion of the Star Wars Empire and planets that don't exist, or live in a city like Gotham or Superman's city...again and again and again. They probably couldn't find Dayton Ohio or Philadelphia Pennsylvania on a map.This movie isn't as fast paced for them as Fast and the Furious part 8 or the remake of Baby Driver. There's no zombies or dragons roaming around to cause them arousal. There's no Knight King and zombie death armies or villains wearing masks, costumes, or capes. So they can't get into it since their reality is too distorted. To compensate, they focus on attacking 3 of the ""proven"" greatest actors in the history of cinema for their superficial looks based on the CGI. They would rather have one of the young pretty boys who can't act but is a generic cardboard cutout who just came off of the casting couch play the younger roles. There's no respect for their elders, but only respect for The Emporer, Darth Vader, The Scarecrow, The Joker and whatever other 100th character remake they are looking forward to seeing.Also, some of them don't even like Goodfellas that much, but they are citing it to gain some credibility to their review. They probably dozed off during Goodfellas at many of the quiet conversation parts and husband and wife scenes, but then they woke up for Pesci stabbing somebody and when they jumped the guy at the bar after insulting Pesci, and then they took a nap until the ending when Liotta talks to the camera. But that's it. They were never fans of these guys anyway, and just Goodfellas bandwagoners.In summary, don't watch this if you can't appreciate a realistic, true story and great multi-award winning actors who are icons. This is for mature audiences only. It's a relatively mild-paced movie loaded with attention to detail, truly excellent acting performances, and it's based on a true story during the Kennedy and Nixon presidencies. If you are looking for Caped Crusaders, untalented young B-list actors who can't act, and some cliched horror movie, then you will surely be disappointed.As for Scorcese movies, I will take this over the ridiculously overrated and overhyped ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (just an awfully overrated and almost a bad movie), ""Hugo"", ""Shutter Island"", and yes, even ""The Departed"", which is the best of the four mentioned. The Departed was very good, no doubt, but for me, this is just better than it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It is what it is,"The Irishman (2019) - It is what it is - a masterpiece of cinema. It's Scorsese's brilliant direction, choice of subject, pure distilled camera angles, and the pure method-driven performance given by the three titans of cinema - DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino. I had a silly smile on my face all through the film as I watched the greats effortlessly talk to each other portraying dangerous (and larger than life) characters from a tumultuous part of American history, people who were sworn to their own personal causes, leading a power-driven life in a society undergoing massive changes.History is present throughout the film, in news clippings, snapshots, snippets of television news and you hear about the Kennedys, Cuba, Las Vegas, but you realize that you are watching a secret history in the film itself - a undercurrent that was running parallel and controlled by shadowy ""kingmakers"" or ""king killers"" as they influenced society, the country, and by extension, the world.It's interesting to note that this is a layered chronological film that is disruptive, but also smooth as silk in Scorsese's hands.It is a ""hidden"" film - on the one hand, you have the history that we have all read about, then you turn a dark corner with the mysterious assassinations of the Kennedys, and the mysterious disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa - and all of this happening while the USA was engaged in a disastrous war in Vietnam. Then, you see an old Frank Sheeran recollecting and narrating a secret history of what ""really"" happened, which is curiously interesting as well, because the listener is never shown - who is Frank talking to?As the audience, we are also hidden, secret viewers to a secret history. And as we delve deeper, we go into the recesses of Frank's memory as he saw it and experienced it, and within it, we see and hear rumblings of a further past in Sheeran's life in the war, how he followed orders to ""hurry up"", how the Kennedy killing was a secret mob hit, leading us to Hoffa's death later in the film.Finally, it is Scorsese himself, who remains hidden, behind the camera, directing the history from the viewpoint of a book (I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt), which in itself is a view of a writer. There are multiple other instances of ""secrets"" in this film - both literal and metaphorical that I am not including here, but in all honesty, this film is like a dark Matryoshka doll, ""a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"", but essentially offering a possible key to some of the greatest mysteries and conspiracies in the world.It is also interesting to see how Scorsese has mixed genres like a masterclass chef - The Irishman is a road movie, a mafia movie, a drama, an action film, a thriller, historical fiction, but most importantly, it is epic.Finally, on the cast, no amount of praise will do justice to DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino. They are exemplars of the craft, living industry standards, and with Scorsese at the helm, this was a match made in heaven.Thank you sirs for making this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Tedious,"I enjoyed the Sopranos and Goodfellas, multiple viewings of each, but this one was just tedious, and I really wanted to like it.

The detail is completely irrelevant to the plot. I had a hard time believing the film got so much positive press. There are no likable characters, the sound track is in places just a depressing low drone, there is no real suspense, and all the characters are hard to keep track of. Most bizarre are the on screen titles telling us how just about everyone violently dies, and when, though that has not much to do with the plot either.

Stunning Movie By A Master,"'I heard you paint houses'Martin Scorsese's latest film centres around Frank Sheeran who we first see in a care home for the elderly reminiscing about his life. He recalls his time in World War 2 and then after this lovingly remembers the scam he had when he is working as a meat truck delivery worker (he regularly siphons off some of the contents and sells it to local mafiosi) when he crosses paths with mobster Russell Bufalino who he is then reintroduced to some time later. This proves to be a turning point for his life. It's through Bufalino that he is introduced to Jimmy Hoffa, teamster and celebrity. This marks another turning point for his life and the film's narrative.I had to smile when I saw some of the major players from Scorsese's canon of masterpieces reunited in this film. It was more than awesome to see De Niro with Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel again.But there are also new actors who more than hold their own. Al Pacino is predictably brilliant and it's great to see such a legendary actor under the direction of such a masterful director. Stephen Graham shows that he's just as brilliant in a Hollywood film as he is within the quality TV productions that he's starred in here in the UK.There has been much made of Anna Paquin only speaking six words in a three and a half hour film. When you see the film you'll see why. Her looks and mannerisms throughout the film convey much more than lines and lines of dialogue as her role is akin to some kind of silent but all seeing sense of conscience or moral judge regarding her father's dastardly deeds that she knows are happening even if he tries to disguise them to convey himself as a honest working man. Instead of basking in fake outrage (are we really getting to a point where numbers of words uttered by male and female characters will be tallied up and compared when it comes to movies?! Are we really getting that ridiculous?) how about thinking what an amazing actress she is that she can turn in such a genuinely awe-inspiring performance by just using her facial expressions alone and what is implied rather than said out loud. Y'know, by using her acting skills and stuff! There should be a mention here regarding how brilliant Lucy Gallina is as Peggy between the ages of 7 and 11.This movie is a sprawling epic that spans 1945 to 1990. The narrative shoots forward and backwards through time so effortlessly and effectively that it reminded me of Once Upon A Time In America (thankfully theres no panpipe music in this movie though). With this kind of timeframe being used it's been widely reported that Scorsese used CGI to make the leading characters look younger in some scenes. Whilst this can be noticed in the first couple of scenes in which this device is used, it blends into the movie as a whole and is quickly forgotten about as the viewer gets used to it. It also becomes unnoticeable because the film is so captivating for the viewer.There was a point early on in this film that felt very familiar. There is a bar setting with an old 60's hit playing over the soundtrack whilst a plethora of mobster types are doing their thing. I thought to myself 'Oh God, I hope this doesn't turn into a GoodFellas clone.' I remembered the good but not great Casino feeling like 'GoodFellas Go To Vegas'. But The Irishman doesn't play out like this. It's a film that quickly veers into new territory plot wise whilst exploring themes such as age, reflection, mortality (on many levels) and how choosing to live such a thoroughly deplorable life whilst hiding under a veneer of respectability can impact the loved ones of the people who have chosen to take the dark path.I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen yet it was a very uncomfortable experience. The movie is 3 and a half hours long and whilst it's an amazing ride it's a painful experience in a cinema seat. My aching posterior was so bad through the second half of the running time that I felt that I was wriggling around more than an eel. But the length of the film was probably intentional for Scorsese as this was made for Netflix- home of the 'binge watch' to be watched in the comfort of your home on the comfort of your sofa.One more touch that I loved about the movie were the captions that accompanied each new secondary character as it stated his name and how/when he died.This movie might end up in the Guinness Book of Records also as I don't think I've heard the word 'c*ocksucker' used so much in one movie before. This is a great accolade in my book.The Irishman is a cracking movie. Fans of Scorsese will love this, as will fans of intelligent and innovative filmmaking. There will be several raised eyebrows as to the level of poignancy that the film holds. Which again makes me think of Once Upon A Time In America in that the audience is made to feel sympathy towards a character who the film has shown to have committed some heinous acts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Remember the end of Goodfellas/Wolf of Wall St,"Where the fun comes to a complete HALT, and everyone starts getting busted and paranoid and it just kind of feels wrong. Thats the last 2 hours (out of 3 1/2) of this movie. The first half is this historical epic about friendship and conflict, then after a certain celebratory dinner the movie just takes a nosedive into modern Clint Eastwood levels of old man sloth time. Call it what you want ""meditative, reflective"" but holy baloney that 2 hour ending is just so boring, and exposes Deniro's underwritten character. For a 3 and a half hour movie your lead needs to be strong, but Deniro lacks any opinion the entire film. After everything I need a rewatch but given its runtime i dont see that happening for a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Best FIlm Ever Made? Probably... see for yourself,"9 + 1/2 out of a perfect 10 score.I saw The Irishman in Washington D.C. yesterday in a packed theater. A sold out Sunday morning at 11am showing. I bought my tickets in advance because I've heard the stories of shows selling out and tickets selling on stubhub for as high at $200 each. (because of the extremely limited theater run)I'll skip all the details about how awesome it is to see a film in such an exquisite cinema house as landmark E street. I'll skip how much fun it was to sit there right next to the capital and the white house watching a movie about people who shaped the history inside those buildings. I'll skip explaining how fun it was to travel hundreds of miles and watch this in a place filled with avid, smart and excited cinema fans.The film had so much hype about it, that I was a little worried it would not live up to said hype... So I was ready for anything (including disappointment)What I got for my $24 matinee ticket was 3 and 1/2 hours of total Scorsese immersion. This isn't ""Goodfellas part 2"". This isn't ""Casino the follow up"" This is its own film. While the faces on the screen are the same, the characters are different. And EVERY ONE INVOLVED came and brought their A-game!!!!Seriously..... the pace was pretty quick for 3 1/2 hours. and you get a lot of info shoved at you in that amount of time. The sensory overload is incredible. It really was impossible to take it all in and comprehend everything to a few paragraph summary untill a good 24 hours later. The more you sit and ponder what you saw on the screen, the more you fall in love with this film.I'm not going to spoil a second of this. But you GOTTA GO SEE THIS IN A THEATER! SPARE NO EXPENSE! YOU WILL REGRET NOT DOING SO!For the past 24 hours I've tried to come up with any reason not to call this the finest achievement in Martin Scorsese history. I keep trying to tell my self reasons why I can't call this the greatest film ever made. But the more I ponder what I saw in those 3 1/2 hours, I seem to be losing reasons to say this isn't the most important epic film ever produced. How can anyone compare Iconic pictures with one being better than another? the moment you say ""Raging bull"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""FIll in the Blank"" is better than ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Citizen Kain"" or ""FIll in the Blank"" you subjectively enter into a realm of thought that is only opinion based upon your own likes and desires of what is great film making.My only complaint and the reason I give this film a 9 and 1/2 star rating out of a perfect 10, is that there was no 10-minute INTERMISSION in the middle of the film.Come on, Gone with the wind, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, It's a mad mad mad mad world, Woodstock, all had an intermission. Why should anyone be forced to have to miss a second of this amazing film in lieu of a bathroom break? every last second is important in this masterpiece ... It HAS TO BE SEEN ON A BIG SCREEN.DO your self a favor. travel, or do whatever you have to to see this film. It was a life-changing event for myself. A fan of Scorsese and a fan of perfection made cinema.
Again I'm not going to say it was the greatest film ever produced, but I really can't say it isn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Expertly crafted...just not the sort of film I love.,"When you read my review for ""The Irishman"", please keep in mind that I am not a big fan of gangster movies nor am I a huge fan of director Martin Scorsese. It's not that I think the movies are terrible and I know that Scorsese is a great director...but I never would have even seen the film had it not been featured at the Philadelphia Film Festival this past October.The film is a very long saga about the live of Frank Sheeran, a real life mobster who brutally murdered quite a few people. At about 3.5 hours, the story did keep my interest...though I do think about 30 minutes could have been shaved off the story. This is my only complaint about the film....and it's minor. On the plus side, while the film is very violent, it's not as intensely violent as some of Scorsese's other pictures....though it's hardly in the category of his brilliant flop, ""Hugo""!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

It's time we all accept the days of these guys doing mob movies are far gone. Sorry, but The Departed was Scorsese's last and best, and that's 16 years ago, with much younger actors and updated plot for the new millennium. This is dated, boring, and basically it just sucks.

"Outstanding performances, but that's it","I'm a fan of Scorsese, but 209 mins is ridiculous for this film. This could've been so easily trimmed to a max 120 mins by deleting many unnecessary and pointless scenes - or at least trimming them down, and it would've been a great film. I'm not sure if Steven Zaillian was bored and had nothing better to do than write a never-ending screenplay, as I feel an amateur writer could've assembled a better and more coherent script. Editing towards the end even got lazy. Scorsese's camera work was great, and the attention to detail in the production sets and costumes was incredible. But what stood out for me were the outstanding performances by De Niro, Pacino and the rest of the all-star greats, but Pesci stole the show. Great to see him out of retirement for this one.

The Resurrection of Classic Cinema.,"In the year 2000, Martin Scorsese appeared alongside Roger Ebert to discuss his picks for the top ten best movies of the 1990s. At number four, Scorsese chose Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut. He said of it, ""I cherish the film because it puts you in the authoritative hands of an old master, with a style that flies in the face of every modern convention."" Those words hold truth. It seems the very best movies are the auteur pictures. The ones with a guiding hand that shakes you in your seat, directs you through the story, and pummels you with images of power and grace. And that is how I would describe Scorsese's own film, 2019's The Irishman. This sprawling mob epic/ intimate character examination/ eulogy to a lost film era, is a gift. Through all three and a half hours of The Irishman, I was awash in a kind of deep gratitude. I had the surreal sensation of witnessing an all-time classic reveal itself before my eyes. It was like discovering The Godfather in 1972 or Goodfellas in 1990. I felt the warm truth the actors brought, and the ultra-confident hands of a filmmaker who may one day be recognized as the greatest artist of the medium. The Irishman is Scorsese's Eyes Wide Shut; a master director 's masterpiece, a towering beacon from another era, somehow, gloriously existing in this one.The most apt descriptor of the Irishman may not be the first thing to come to mind when you look at the pieces involved. For all its small time thugs, cozy interiors, and countless scenes of meetings, phone conversations and casual dinners, The Irishman is an epic. Epics seem to come to Hollywood in waves. For every boom time (1920s, 1960s, 2000s), there are long droughts where nary a single movie is made that can rightfully claim the title. We are in the middle of such a drought. Many movies are overblown and overlong, but none truly epic. The Irishman, which has gotten plenty of ire for its daunting three and half hour runtime, is one of the only true epics if its decade. And not just because of its length. The story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a supposed mob hitman and crucial cog in the rise and fall of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) seems very much of a piece with Scorsese's other, smaller mob movies, Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. Those films teem with energy, but they don't match The Irishman for scope. Here is an adapted screenplay by Steve Zaillian that traces the breadth of the Golden years of American crime and filters it through the eyes of a handful of characters. Following Frank from the end of World War II to the beginning of the 21st century, Zaillian and Scorsese create a story that feels enormous. The script somehow manages to weave together a slew of major world events into Frank's story a la Forrest Gump, but in a way that feels real and inevitable. This movie is huge. Scorsese holds nothing back; no idea, no bit of color, no set piece or character moment. It's all in there. Yes, The Irishman is very long, and it feels long. It should. This is a journey. The film sweeps you along for its entirety. The sumptuous technical craft and storytelling involvement make it next to impossible to tear yourself away from its embrace. You savor every single moment of The Irishman. It's a feast. The canvas is enormous and every inch of it is painted with exquisite detail.The Irishman is cast like a film lover's ultimate fantasy. The epic crime drama is populated with many of the finest character actors working, as well as a few inspired outsiders, and it stars three of the all-time titans of the industry. But fantasy this is not. What's better is not just that this film exists, for real, in our time, but that everyone is at the very top of their games. Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran roars back into the world of acting after a long hiatus as a human cartoon character. His Sheeran is an extremely tricky challenge for an actor. He is asked to play a man who is a bit of a dolt, but is still racked with unrecognized guilt. It's an internalized performance if ever there was one. DeNiro plays it absolutely right. He doesn't command the screen like we know he can, but instead wisely chooses a weak, almost bashful, but kind of charming naïveté. The heavy lifting comes from the supporting players. Specifically, the two other legends brought back from the cinematic grave, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Pacino plays Jimmy Hoffa in a towering performance worthy to stand alongside the very best of his legendary career. His entrance in the film brings a thunderbolt of classic acting energy. If any living actor understands the power of commanding theatricality on screen, it must be Pacino. His Hoffa is a shining example of the tremendous power of acting joie de vivre. The beating heart of The Irishman is, however, Joe Pesci. His very appearance is a shock, having been retired from acting for 20 years, but almost more shocking is his unprecedentedly subtle brilliance as Frank Sheehan's mob mentor, Russell Bufalino. He is far away from the volatile goons on which he made his name. Here Pesci is relaxed, sagely, and world weary. His presence onscreen is awesome in an almost religious sense. It's literally like watching someone rise from the dead, wiser and more ethereal than before.Who knew this was possible? Who knew these legends who seemed to have faded away into history long ago, still had this intensity, this sensitivity, this skill? Maybe they never lost it. How lucky are we, then, to have gotten this showcase script for them to shine in? The Irishman's detractors have hid behind certain ""controversial"" elements, such as the CGI de-aging used to assist the actors in portraying their younger selves, the film's length, or its distribution on Netflix. None of these trivial hang ups negate what Martin Scorsese and his collaborators have done with The Irishman. This is a classic that will hang in the annals of film history. A film to stand alongside The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the other greats of the genre. The simple fact that it exists brings me immense joy. The fact that it is a perfectly crafted piece of art, overflowing with meaning and themes and personal connections to its auteur brings me something else entirely. This is why I watch movies, why I never allow myself to get too discouraged by modern sensibilities. Because the masters are always a spark of inspiration away from returning to glory. Don't lose hope, there is still room for new classics.98/100",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A dream come true!!!,"Scorsese has always been one of my favourite directors. His films are simply spectacular and I always look forward to what he brings next. When I heard that he was revisiting the mob and crime genre I was thrilled but when I heard that it starred De Niro, Pacino and Pesci my excitement went through the roof. Having seen it, I can confirm that this is one of the best films of the year.The Irishman follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver, who gets involved with the Bufalino crime family and Teamster Jimmy Hoffa.It felt so good seeing a Martin Scorsese film after a long time. Goodfellas is one of my favourite films of all time so to see another crime mob film with three legends in the lead roles was just a dream come true. However if you're expecting something like Goodfellas, you may be disappointed because The Irishman is very different compared to it. This movie takes its time. It takes its time by fleshing out the characters and creating the feeling of that time period. A lot of the film is dialogue heavy which, by no means, is a bad thing because writer Steven Zaillian brings this world and its characters to life through it.The dialogue is constantly investing and does not get boring at any point. You are sold on the fact that these are real people and not actors portraying them which goes to show how strong everyone's performance is but it also shows the talent Zaillian and Scorsese possess as both are able to keep the story and its people interesting through the film's 3 hour 30 minute runtime. Scorsese's direction is mesmerizing. There is no particular style to it but then again it did not have to have one as the film itself is quite old fashioned. He once again proves to us why he's the best in the business.The acting is outstanding. This is De Niro's best perfomance in a long time and the same goes for Pacino. It felt incredible to see Joe Pesci acting in a film after his retirement. All three had amazing chemistry with one another and it's sad to think that this may be the first and last time we ever see these three together in a Scorsese film. The supporting actors Ray Romano, Stephen Graham, Harvey Keitel and many more were also great in their roles. The CGI used on the actors may be distracting at first glance but as you learn more and more about the story and its characters, the CGI becomes seamless and less of a distraction.The music used is also very appropriate for the time period the film is set in as it creates a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. As mentioned before, the film is shot beautifully but the final shot is one that is quite thought provoking. It really made me think a lot about the many themes the film presents itself with.The only problem I had was to do with Anna Paquin's character. Her character plays a big part in De Niro's character arc but I felt it was not explored as deeply as I wanted it to be.All in all, The Irishman is a fantastic film. Scorsese has given another film that will definitely win some Oscars next year. It felt really refreshing to see a mob film this well executed with three absolute legends acting alongside each other.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Thank you Mr Scorsese.,"I was so nervous sitting down for this film but in hindsight I should have never had any doubts. This is 3 hours and 30 minutes of classic Scorsese film making.The script, dialogue and cinematography made this feature feel like a classic Scorsese gangster but with it's Goodfellas and Casino feel there is also something very reminiscent and coming of age about this film, not only for the viewers and the characters but for the legendary cast.Robert De Niro and Al Pacino really do give us their all here but to me Joe Pesci stole the show. Usually depicted as a ruthless hot head he is a very calm and controlled mob boss who with just a stare can say so much.Despite the de aging technology not being flawless you do get use to it.To Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and of course Mr Scorsese, thank you for making a film of such class, beauty and attention.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Been there, done that.","It's not to say that the actual film wasn't impressively assembled and acted.But it really screamed that I'd seen all this before. Many times.Sure, genres do repeat themselves several times. Not as succinctly as here.Within the many engaging vignettes, there really wasn't a driving force in the very long 3.5 hours. Amusing to see brain-dead mobsters talk all that brain-dead mobster stuff. Been done to death: Suits. Cussing. Killing each other. Got it. No insight into that horrid lifestyle. The effects of such, but nothing how they could consider it the norm.The de-aging was not as bad as I expected and heard of. But it wasn't impressive. Looks very animated and didn't get deNiro down under looking 45, even when he was suppose to be in his 20s. Seems like it'd make more sense to use deep fake with images of deNiro young. Not like there ain't plenty. The message was that deNiro was used to killing in WWII, but was only depicted in one quick scene. (And why'd he have the two Germans get out of the hole when they'd be in there anyway?)If you must, be very aware of the 3.5 hours, as it feels like 3.5 hours.And this also brings up the perplexing state of affairs at Netflix.

Worth a decade of waiting,You know a great movie when you spontaneously think about it the coming days after you've seen it and boy this story has been haunting my thoughts! As a 90s boy I've always wondered what it was like to see the greatest hits of the 70s as they were first released in cinema. When i first heard about this movie 10 years ago I realized this is the close as it's gonna get and prayed for it to be made.What I loved about the movie is its substantial originality that makes it differ from other Scorsese's gangster movies. It's not about the glamorous lifestyle of made men but rather involved emotionally and in what makes human .. human. It's the greatest most authentic farewell marking an end to a genre that's made people attached to the big screen for decades.I can't but feel sorrow that such a great masterpiece may not be recognized by the young generation. This takes me back to the days when I was a teen watching all the titles of the 60s and 70s and not being able to share the feelings with my peers. At the end I'm just greatful and thankful this was made.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Great Film - Another Scorcese classic,"To start with, the cast. Anything with Pesci, De Niro and Al Pacino is going to be a hit. All of them do an excellent job at playing their roles, and it is wonderful to see the masters at work.How anyone can rate this film below 8/10 is beyond me, and reading some of the most negative reviews is sad. Scorcese does an excellent job in the manner we all expect and the poignant ending is tribute to his career as he himself gets older, as well as the actors we have all come to love on screen.Only a couple of small reasons why I didn't give this a 10/10. It certainly helps to have an understanding of the story of Sheeran/Hoffa before seeing this film. Although it is a long watch, at times the story feels dragged out and at others it goes by very quickly and you are left trying to work out what is happening, especially early on. Not a major hitch, but having an understanding of the story certainly helps and my understanding was definitely emphasised by reading into the story in excitement before watching it.However, seeing De Niro absorb the main role with such dedication and an excellent piece of memorable acting does leave the audience with a turbulent mindset of feeling both sympathy and sadness.Wonderful piece of art, and I truly enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Marty misses the mark,"As much as I wanted to love this movie it missed the mark, a last hurrah for such an iconic and masterful film maker which unfortunately feels flat.I'll start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Mr. Scorsese, especially his early work. The ensemble cast is something dreams are made of but I feel as though the movies success is carried by such legendary names, look past this and you'll find a bloated, lifeless, and flat shadow of a film. As many people have mentioned the CGI is off putting and in many ways contradicts Scorsese's philosophy on film. The actors simply cannot convey the movements of a younger man which is required, this is nothing against them individually but the choices made by Mr. Scorsese.Going into a Scorsese movie (especially a Scorsese gangster flick) one carries certain expectations, one such expectation is of course a killer soundtrack! Marty was well known for handpicking his soundtracks from his carefully curated collection of 45's and over his career this has become a staple of his movies. To put it blatantly the Irishman's soundtrack is non existent.Secondly one expects to be hit by that pure cinematic magic that has immortalised the likes of Goodfella's and Casino. In this regards the Irishman felt like a long drawn out slog of information with no real heart and soul. This may be down to the Frankenstein camera rig that was used, nothing beats the brilliance of 35mm and the quality it brings to the screen, the Irishman felt like a TV movie.My final gripe with the film was perhaps a personal issue, it depressed me immensely. Seeing the greatest actors of their generation wilt in front of my eyes was truly sad. The great Bobby D, Joe Peci, Keitel (underutilized), and Pacino now all old men playing shadows of themselves, it was sad. The thought that we will undoubtedly lose these great actors washed over me at the end of the movie and left me feeling truly sad.I feel as though this movie is being measured by the weight of the names involved alone (wether positive or negative) and not as a stand alone piece of cinema. Take away ""Directed by Martin Scorsese"" and the movie could be easily overlooked, sure it has the stellar cast but is anyone truly convinced?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Forgettable,"It's almost breaking my heart when I say this, that it's a pretty forgettable gangster flick by the legendary Martin Scorsese. Fist off, the run-time of the movie feels really long and that's never a good sign. Secondly, the 'de-ageing' gimmick is just too irritating - The technology is just not here jet. Finally, the actors where too old to pull it off. It really feels that this film is made 20 years too late.

Scorsese returns with thought provoking classic,"Martin Scorsese is, for good reason, one of the most treasured filmmakers in cinematic history. He has a barrage of classic films and he influenced countless. Once I heard he was making a new mob epic, I was ecstatic. However, many (including myself) did have a worry about the film itching in the back of our heads going in. Many feared that this movie be Scorsese trying to relive in gangster classics like Goodfellas and Casino. Though, When I watched it, all those worries were completely blown out of the water. The Irishman is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.The cast is phenomenal. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino all give the best performances they have given in a long time. The Irishman is also extremely entertaining, so don't let that 3 in a half hour run time scare you. I really don't think a minute is wasted in this film. The filmmakers just had a lot to say. The Irishman is of course a gangster epic, but it is far different than something like Goodfellas. I have never seen Scorsese this vulnerable. This movie is far more intimate, personal, and meditative than Scorsese's other gangster movies. It burns slower, taking its time to meticulously build the themes. The film obviously features much about the mafia, but this is the most I've ever seen Scorsese really dive this deep into the emotional consequences of a life of crime, such as the one Frank Sheeran lives in this movie. The third act of this movie is incredible and other than the movie Silence, I have never been this emotionally impacted by a Scorsese movie.This is my fifth favorite Scorsese movie, and it's good to know Scorsese is still at the top of his game.

"The Irishman leaves you with a swallowing sense of regret, loss and frailty!","Missed 'The Irishman' during Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival with Star. It has taken me four days to watch it in bits and parts. Finally, watching it, is done. 😁The Irishman leaves you with a swallowing sense of regret, loss and frailty. In a brilliant scene, Pesci's character tells De Niro's Frank Sheeran, ""Look how strong I've made you. No one can touch you."" The statement is starkly contrasted by powerful men who are assassinated, imprisoned, betrayed or weakened by age. Most devastating is watching a man achieve his peak power, and then see his slow realisation that he has lost the love of his children.It will be revered as one of the greatest films ever produced about organised crime, and might very well be the definitive statement on the genre, because it's difficult to imagine anyone eclipsing what Scorsese has done here.It is obviously long but it's never less than compelling -
#MartinScorsese, #RobertDeNiro, #AlPacino and #JoePesci, all in their mid-to-late-70s, are each carrying a lifetime of work, with practiced ease.If you fortunately see them all together for 4 consecutive days, your happiness multiplies. 😁",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The winter of life,"This movie is plain and simple a masterpiece. This is more Raging Bull than Good fellas, what is a good thing. It also has Once upon a time in America and The Godfather as cousins. It is not really a gangster film, it is a film about life, friendship, regret, old age and betrayal. Fastest 3 and a half hours ever. Robert Deniro as Frank Sheeran, the Irishman, gives a outstanding performance, so are his Co stars Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. What Pesci does in his rol as Buffino is so good, not a fals note at all, Pacino, also great, is amazingly good as Hoffa. Editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is again proof why she is the best editor ever in film. Score and music department by Robbie Robertson is again nail on the head, classics from the 40s till 70s, and his theme from Irishman is honey to my ears. Speaking of ears, the movie is not only touching, its also very funny.... the big ears scene, Hoffa eating a steak and many more! Scorsese really has comedic brilliance in him, but that is after 50 plus years nothing new!

Watch for the film for what is is and not what it isn't,"This is a very good film, maybe not a great film, but a very good film none the less.
Maybe the low scores are from those who are expecting ""Goodfellas"" but I think if you take the film for what it is, a (true-ish) story about Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran and his involvement with the Bufalino crime family then I think you will enjoy it.
Personally, I thought the CGI was good and didn't detract from the film at all and the acting from everyone was pretty top notch.
My only gripe is that the film does feel a tad too long, but hey if you are watching on Netflix, what's stopping you have a break?

"Ofcourse it's not bad, but most of all it's hugely overrated","It's like Scorcese, Pacino, and DeNiro fans just háve to be lyrical about this movie, out of some kind religious conviction.I realise this is just my opinion, like so many others here, but i think this movie is hugely overrated.
No, obviously this movie almost cant be bad. Not with this director, not with this budget, and not with this cast.In short: i get the bliss of freedom it gives a director when there are no time constraints to the final cut. But how is it me, a simple consumer, and not Scorcese the genius director, who can see the obviousness of how a tension curve suffers when the movie's runtime is so long?
After 2 hours i felt i was still watching the introduction chapter.I wasn't bored, but watching 3,5 episodes of The Sopranos back to back would have been significantly more entertaining than watching this story drag out.
Don't get me wrong, i love this genre, and i love all the other epics Scorcese has created. I've probably wished Casino or Goodfellas or The Departed could last longer, like 3,5 hours.
But i honestly think The Irishman pales in comparison to those 3 movies.Another thing, i thought Al Pacino wasn't all that much in this movie.. yeah i know, it pains me to say it as much for you to hear such blasphemy. He just did what he always does. And not even that because i saw no real Pachino tantrum. Just him being old, sitting around, acting out his lines.And the CG. I've read numerous articles of people praising how well they CG'd DeNiro to a younger version of himself. I totally disagree. I felt i saw no progress whatsoever in comparison to a much earlier try at good CG human faces like, say Tron Legacy. Uncanny valley, shiny plastic mask faces all over again.And the story, i think i've mostly forgotten again since i saw the movie like 2 weeks ago or something.Come to think of it, i think 7/10 is still pretty generous.

Badda Bing! ... Badda Buzzkiller!,"Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, ""A Bronx Tale"", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!Sadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10.

Meticulous start to finish,"The movie The Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese ( whose movies include The Wolf of wall Street, Shutter island, The Departed.....). The movie is 3hrs 29min long and revolves around teamster Jimmy Hoffa. Every scene in this movie is very well directed. Robert De Niro plays the role of Frank Sheeran, the Irishman working with and working for many Italians . Jimmy Hoffa (played by Al Pacino) is enthusiastic about truck drivers and teamsters. Frank takes care of problems and solves problems in a very silent but ruthless style. Frank is meticulous in his work. Another mobster Russell Bufaine , played very well by Joe Pesci (who almost disappeared from Hollywood after the movie The Casino) understands Frank very well and relies on Frank to get job done in eliminating people. The movie is very interesting and shows how Frank mastered the art of eliminating problems. It was truly interesting to watch Frank get a casket for himself. It takes a great Director to keep the interest of a packed theater for entire length of the movie. Robert De Niro is excellent as Frank and worthy of Oscar nomination. Excellent Direction.

The Perfect Encore,"We can not begin this review by focusing on the previous exemplary performances by everyone involved in past cultivations of brilliance. That would be too easy.I will try my best to explain, and perhaps illuminate the magic that Scorsese has truly grasped in this wonderfully adapted biopic, without spoilers due to the fact that this is still under limited viewings, and will not be streamable for another 5 days.The fact of the matter is, this film is literally the pinnacle of mafioso, 35mm, fable over action story telling that we may never see again. Scratch that, one of the best films that we will ever experience with the direction film making is going in the next 20 years.If there is one thing about Scorsese, it is his amazing attention and experiences with the nuances that make all of us click or indulge, not just in the movie, but also adapt to the lifestyle and story that all films hope to pull you into. Scorsese does this trick with absolute ease and magic, like he doesn't even try, like you never had a chance in hell to be able to escape his grip, a tidal wave in a swimming pool, an Italian carving his way into the American dream.This film has it all. If you've seen Goodfellas specifically, or any of his previous work you already know what I mean. The scores playing in the distance, the silverware clattering on fine china, the density of the wine being poured in real crystal. It is all there and then some.Cleverly titled The Irishman, surprisingly it's only about one, or two Irishman who was in an Italian landscape in some of the greatest turmoiled times that America has experienced covering many decades. With that being said, a movie for many generations.My fiancé who is a first generation Italian couldn't believe the language, the accents, the body language that was displayed in a film that could never be anything except a Scorsese masterpiece. I felt the exact same way, even when she was the only person in the cinema who understood some scenes, and me being Irish, some of the smaller forgettable ones.This film tackled the family dynamic of a toxic situation, of a war veteran who had an unspeakable skill set, and the absolute sorrows that will follow an undesirable life that so many of us may follow based on decisions that we have no internal control over. I doubt the validity of the direction, as I have read ""I Heard You Paint Houses?"" as a teenager, but this didn't matter.You will be lost, unsure who to vote for, it tackles serious political issues that are still a mystery in the public's conscience. All the while dancing with your emotions of what is right and wrong.The ending, felt like a eulogy for this form of brilliance and story telling, which I'm not sure was the hardest part. Or was it the realization that this is the top of the mountain performance, that I've seen come out of all involved?Again, I am completely torn and lost. Time will tell, and that is what this film will leave you with. The realization of time, the bewilderment that cinematic nuances can make you feel like it all slipped away. This ending left me wondering if this was also a climatic approach for Scorsese, Pesci, De Niro, or Pacino finalizing their place in this world with their greatness. I really hope not, because just like the characters involved: time waits for no man, and with that eventually, our legends are all erasable no matter how much good or bad we end up living with. Time will leave all of us empty handed.Leaving the film with that, I almost would have preferred a snub .32 as soon as I stood up.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Scorsese epic on Hoffa is well-crafted but very, very long, likely praised out of sentimentality","The long-awaited Scorsese film on Frank Sheeran, the man closest to Jimmy Hoffa, is brilliantly acted by De Niro, Pacino, Pesci and an exemplary supporting lineup that includes Keitel, Romano, Cannavale and Anna Paquin, whom I haven't seen in a movie in nearly two decades. It also boasts extraordinary period detail, masterfully recreating an America that spans the 1950s to the mid-1970s. And the final chapter of the film is quietly menacing. The total absence of a soundtrack in this part of the film makes for an almost unbearable sense of dread.What prevents this film from reaching greatness? In short, the film's vast, interminable running time. Some supporting characters seemingly disappear for an eternity in this film as their presence is dwarfed and sometimes completely forgotten on account of the film's never-ending trudge to its haunting conclusion. The film has a ghost-of-glories-past feel to it, with Scorsese's heaviest hitters all teaming up to make one last big mark. That might be the main reason it has been so overwhelmingly acclaimed.There's no denying the craft at work here. Unfortunately, Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker did not cut nearly enough to render the tightest film possible and instead the final product is a lumbering behemoth of a film that, although very good, more than likely could have been even better.

A gangster epic deserving of being an end to the great mob dramas and the twilight of Scorsese's career,"The Irishman (or should I call it I Heard You Paint Houses, as Scorsese intends) has all the wonderfully crafted mob interactions and great performances you expect, but could be considered a thematic foil to Goodfellas. While Goodfellas was a great mob movie showing the duality of crime in its glory but also its insidiousness, The Irishman is a more philosophical consideration of aging and the fickleness of the seemingly all-important world of crime. All three lead performances are excellent, and maybe I'm being drawn in by the fact that it's the most showy performance, but I thought Pacino in particular was wonderful. De Niro is undeniably great and I wouldn't be too upset if he won best actor, and Pesci plays a great quiet power role, but Pacino's layering of doubt and uncertainty beneath his brashness stood out to me. While the first two acts set up the characters well and show great writing, it's the final act that ties the movie together and makes its thematic points. Its climactic scene and the way it happens quickly, just like the other house paintings in the movie, was very well done but absolutely devastating. Watching Frank age and watch everyone around him die or go to jail with him, we see how everything that was so important his whole life, all he did, is irrelevant in the modern world. Nobody knows who Jimmy Hoffa is anymore, and none of his friends are still around, and he's left contemplating what his life of crime really meant. The actions he took to be strong and keep his family safe only alienated him from them, and really cut him off from everyone outside the crime world. Was taking the climactic action really worth it when you see how it affects everyone, and when he was never truly fulfilled by the life he led? Seeing these struggles as he ages brought the biopic-style mob movie full circle, as we truly understand his entire life of crime and where it left him.There are plenty of smaller elements that will definitely be sticking in my mind for weeks. The contrast between Russell and Jimmy was a really interesting one, and was a clear contrast in how random mob guys and Peggy reacted to them. Russell was always cold and reserved but universally respected, but never had emotional connections, exemplified as he tries to reach out to Peggy as a child many times and she never engages. Seeing him dying in jail was so affecting because we saw how his respect and importance didn't provide him anything in the end. Jimmy's story was still tragic but in an opposite way: he was the antithesis of Russ, brash and aggressive but also charismatic and loving. Peggy always cared for him, and he was the only person who seemed to love Frank. His downfall came from his unwillingness to play the political game everyone else accepted, and from assuming his friends would keep him safe over playing the game. All three men's stories end in tragedy, but each in a different way. The violence and crime dynamics are great and well represented, but it's the contemplative tone that keeps me thinking about the film. The de-aging technology was completely satisfying for me, even if their movements were a bit stiff, and the direction and cinematography are top notch of course.

It's an elegantly shot and wonderfully performed film, again a rise and fall story of an associate used as a pretext to look back at several decades of American history.It's really nothing we haven't seen before from uncle Marty, but the fact that he brought back his Italian American mob cinema BFF's for most probably the last time makes it a touching operation, like some kind of testament for future filmmakers. Its placid tone, together with some final considerations on old age and death, is what makes ""The Irishman"" different from the adrenaline and excesses of Scorsese's previous mob films. Unfortunately, Frank's character has close to zero development over the course of the film: he just keeps going on with what he has to do until he gets too old for the job, with no particular remorse or change of view when looking back at his life.However, I have to say that Frank's character has very little development. He just goes on with what he has to do until he gets old.The episodes spoken by Frank Sheeran along the highly demanding 209-minute running don't contribute to the plot, but are essential to helping us connect with the characters on a deeper level and eventually making the ending as emotionally dense as it is. The film is mostly made of dialogues with very little movement on screen, but I liked how what is not said is what shakes the most, how the camera indulges on the characters' faces to show their reactions instead of having them speak their feelings out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Consistently engaging, filled with talent, and with a satisfying reflective sunset feel to the whole thing","There is much to admire in this film just from the names involved alone - on paper it looked terrific due to the amount of talent coming together to make the film, and that it is in a world where similar combinations of people have made classics before. The use of de-aging technology added to the reasons to talk about the film before it was out, and generally there was a lot of hype around it. In the key areas that matter, it lives up to the hype. The narrative unfolds slowly and has lots of moving parts and jumps around in time, but it is compelling throughout; I thought I'd watch this split over two nights but in the end the film passed really quickly despite how incredibly long it is.From the very start it roots itself in old age, in reflection, and it uses this approach very well. Where Goodfellas was youthful energy and excitement, The Irishman has a much different tone in the way it is melancholic throughout, and how it lets us breathe around the characters. De Niro's lead is excellent at this; it is a very muted performance but his numbness to violence is consistently portrayed. The final scenes in particular are not ones of guilt or regret, but just numbness with a tinge of fear; the loneliness of it all is what is striking, and how much of it he is feeling. Similarly Pesci is very understated and his character is played consistently; when he is in business he is silent and threatening just by his presence, and I liked that the film took the time to show that this was not something he could switch on/off - with the daughter he was unintentionally 'off' in his communication and manner. The daughter scenes also allows Pacino to show us that he was a more genuine character by virtue of making that connection with her. Okay he is 'full Pacino' here but his noise and energy makes him stand out from the 'real' threats - he convinces in the nuance of someone who thinks he is in this world, but ultimately is not.In terms of structure and direction, the film looks and sounds great, and is edited together in a way that moves through time and places but makes perfect sense in content and flow. All the elements click - for instance the wardrobe and sets are a big part of the film keeping the viewer informed about where we are. In terms of the much discussed technology, it is impressive, but the most impressive thing was that I didn't notice it very often. Mostly I just took it at face value that this is what the person looks like, much like I do whenever someone has really good make-up for the same effect. Here and there it looked a little odd, but it was never a big problem, only a positive.The length may put some off, but it is a benefit that it was on Netflix, because it is easier at home with breaks and self-pacing if needed. I didn't need it as I found the story-telling and the use of the many talents involved all produced a great film which has violence, an engaging story, sadness, reflection, and a very real sense of a sunset.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

It was an emotional movie since I'm 50 and to see these well respected actors who gave such an excellent performance in this final film was awesome.

Brilliant. A masterpiece by Scorsese.,"I've had it with people whining about this movie's running time. 3 and a half hours are definitely a long time, but I didn't mind them. On the contrary, I enjoyed every single minute. It was slow at times, to be frank, but nonetheless, I thought The Irishman was as good as Scorsese's Casino and Goodfellas.One thing that really irritated me a bit was Al Pacino's overacting.

"Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a fine epic tale starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci","After months of only knowing about this Martin Scorsese picture, I finally watched this on Netflix. It's quite a compelling tale about an aging hitman's (Robert De Niro) telling of his association with a mafia boss (Joe Pesci) and Teamsters Union head Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The movie is a little more than three hours so it takes it's own time in going over several decades of the narrative. In doing so, it also uses new technology when depicting those three actors being much younger and older. Quite convincing, those aging and de-aging processes are.

DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!'n,"What an incredible work of art. Scorsese delivers not only one of his best films, but a great film PERIOD. Despite what some small minded viewers may think, this is NOT a film with washed up actors trying to revive their once promising career. No, this is a work of art, worth every minute, with veteran actors, writers and a director who knows the art of story telling.DeNiro (Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran"" delivers an emotional performance giving us an incredible insight into the life a reputed mafia hit man and glorified body guard. By the end of the film you can't help but almost feel bad for Sheeran and the loved ones whine were effected from his actions.Side Note: I've read a lot of peoples reviews complaining because in the movie Sheeran doesn't have an Irish accent.. The real Frank Sheeran, even though he IS Irish, was born in Darby, Pennsylvania and he spent more time in Italy during World War II (411 day in combat) than he ever spent in Ireland. So that's a really poor reason to give a low rating for this movie.Pesci comes out of a 20 year retirement to play the Pennsylvania mob boss Russell ""The Quite Don"" Bufalino. If your expecting Pesci to be the brutally violent and aggressive mafia soldier as he once was in Casino or Goodfellas, you've come to the wrong place. However, it's almost victorious to see Pesci portray and actual BOSS, as if we've seen him rise through the ranks of gangster cinema through the years and finally put him where he belongs. Pesci delivers a firm performance, mesmerizing the audience with his subtle body language and menacing stare downs as he vaguely orders certain hits throughout the film. If we don't see another film with Pesci in it again, I couldn't be more happy with this one we've been blessed to see.Pacino absolutely steals the show! Jimmy Hoffa was one of the most famous people in the United states at one point, and DeNiro couldn't have said it best: ""Young people nowadays have no idea who Jimmy Hoffa was.."". As sad as that is, it couldn't be more accurate. I've read numerous books about Hoffa and Pacino did an incredible job bringing the late Teamsters President to life on the big screen. I've also read negative reviews about Pacino saying he ""plays the same role he always plays"" and that he just ""screams"" and ""looks old"". What people don't know is that Hoffa was an incredibly intense
Individual and cared about two things, and two things only: His family and the union. It breaks my heart to see Hoffas demise being that he was given numerous chances to buckle down but he couldn't stand by and let, what he thought, some low life gangsters come in and take his union over just because who they were or what they did or who they were connected with.All in all, this film is an incredible work of art, mixed with subtle yet forgotten parts of history that shaped the future of this country forever (World War II, JFK election/assassination, Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuba and the Havana Mob, Fidel Castro, The CIA, Nixon and Watergate"". I feel like because Scorsese made an honest remark about the current popularity of super hero films, he will be getting more people saying negative things about it because based on bias opinions. Avengers: Endgame (Which I loved) was 30 minutes shorter than this and I never heard anybody complain, even when the best parts of that movie was the last 30 minutes. I love super hero movies ALOT. Im a huge fan. But The Irishman is an incredible film, no matter how you categorize it (Gangster/Mafia film, Drama, Crime, History, Based On Books ETC) it should and I think WILL, go down as one of the greatest films in our lifetime. 10/10, 5 stars, 100%, 2 thumbs up.

A sad swansong for 3 guys who were legends,"Some parts of this movie were quite brilliant but unfortunately it was ridiculously drawn out with some mind numbingly dull parts that were hard to watch in their dullness.Basically as a film it was far too long and would have worked better as a 3 part mini-series.
Nothing against long films if they keep the audience on their side like Once Upon A Time In America did brilliantly over 4 hours in 1984. A movie I've watched a dozen times. This will be one I won't repeat that experience of even twice.The writing and acting was not up to the usual Scorsese standard and the old geezers Pesci, Pacino and De Nero looked like they were just there for the pay check in some parts.The de-ageing scenes were in one way great to see but in another very sad as these guys are in their 70s and the 30 year old segments reflected that in the way they moved. One fight scene highlighted this as a 70 odd year old bloke playing a 30 odd year old in a fight looked pretty silly.Overall it wasn't bad and told a good story in a decent way. The veracity of the story we will never know and 3 and a half hours telling that story probably made the viewer not really care as they were exhausted. Hopefully all the old guys will now retire for good as they don't do their Legacy any favours with a film like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"An Outstanding Achievement, And An Unusual 'Gangster Movie' that you must try to see in a Cinema","I have seen this movie twice now, and have my 3rd viewing booked for next week before it leaves the Cinema.If you are going to watch it at Home, treat it with respect, do it in one sitting with no distractions...maybe have an intermission around the 90 minute mark (when JFK leaves the story...)... But this movie is a true cinematic experience.I would describe it as Goodfellas mixed with Once Upon A Time In America, but without the Cocaine, or Opium.... Both of those are all time Classics, and I feel The Irishman is going to be seen in the same class...it is fantastic.One thing I found very unusual.was how little cursing or bad language there is in this movie... I don't know if more than a few were used, if any even...this movie is mainly about older guys doing their jobs to feed their loved ones, and Frank Sheeran is a guy caught between two masters, and is eventually made to decide one over the other, and the ripples through his life because of this life he has led.Pesci and Pacino are a joy to behold, as the faces of his two masters...you just find yourself smiling away at how good they are to watch.

Too much and not enough,"There's a very good movie on here somewhere, but as presented, it could really use some tightening up.Younger bodies should have been used with CGI age-reduced heads. It's very weird early in the movie having a young men's heads on what are clearly hunched over slumping old bodies. I understand the reason for not using younger actors, as the draw is the all-star cast, and there's usually a disconnect to the character when actors are swapped out mid-movie.There's a lot of repetition and over-abundance of detail here that could have been streamlined to make the same moral and plot points happen.There are characters included that barely contribute anything. Jessie Plemons at least got to have an argument about a fish during a pivotal scene, but what was Anna Paquin doing here? I think she's supposed to be Frank's conscience at certain points, but it doesn't resonate much, because you don't really know her.The acting throughout is fantastic as you would expect.

An Epic Masterpiece of Monumental Proportions,"Believe the hype! Scorsese has crafted an epic masterpiece of monumental proportions. This sprawling epic takes on The Godfather as the greatest mob movie of all time and honestly I like Irishman more. Full of breathtaking technology and powerful performances by everyone involved, this film will leave you in awe of the masterclass in acting that is present. Robert DeNiro gives another career defining performance, which given his pedigree is a hell of a statement, but true nonetheless.The real stars here though are Al Pacino who is on fire as Jimmy Hoffa, giving one of his best performances in 30 plus years.Then there is the ever amazing Joe Pesci, who thankfully agreed to return to acting for this role as his every move in this film will have you in a trance.I predict both Pacino and Pesci will be nominated for Best Supporting Actor with it being a 50/50 shot at either winning. I think at this point any of Supporting nomination will just be a space-filler as it comes down to these two. (Sorry Mr. Hanks)As for the de-aging technology that was made famous by Marvel, it is flawless In this film. I spent my time trying to catch some hint of cgi and yet there was none. It literally feels as if you are watching them in that era of their lives.Essentially what I am getting at is this is a modern masterpiece. Not only is this the best movie of the year. But this is the best movie in decades. Every single person is on their A-game and it shows. Does the film run long at times? Yes, but at this point Scorsese has earned the right to make a 7 hour movie if he pleases, and even after 3 and a half hours I still found myself not wanting it to end.The hype is real and this movie needs to be seen.If you can make it to a theater showing it, you definitely should as it demands to be seen on the big screen, otherwise check it out November 27th on Netflix.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A mosaic of moments.,"As Scorsese once again returns to familiar territory of the gangster epic one would expect some diminishing returns; the film's deep structure is substantially similar to Goodfellas and Casino. Add in that the main actors are Scorsese mainstays and there was a real chance of this being warmed over hash. Instead, the similarities to earlier films works in the film's favor as Scorsese continues to hone the form. The intertext content causes us to re-examine the prior works.The film is as much about examining a life lived as the inner working of the mob. The story is told in retrospective and the script repeatedly meanders in the way an old man telling a story does. De Niro and Scorsese both lean into Frank telling the story (it is a quasi confession) and this allows for a strong sense of time passing; of a life filled with ill fated choices and regret. At 3 hours and change the film is long but the length is for a rich fullness. This is a wonderfully comprehensive film.Scorsese handles the special effects well. The film has some nonlinear editing that helps sell the de-aging. The visual effect themselves are quite good; I was surprised to learn that no make up was used for the three main actors. I had thought it was a blend of practical and CGI work. Even on the basic level of technique this is an interesting film.My favorite aspect of the film is Pesci. It is not only good to see him again but his performance is a masterwork of icy understatement and malice. I don't know if it is a better performance than Goodfellas-the two characters are so different!-but I loved that Pesci choose to be restrained and controlled here. It acts as irony within the film and within his career.This is one of the best films of the year.EDIT: nth viewing thoughts; The final 30 minutes of this film are extremely sad and painful to watch. Sheeran is a contemptible figure but De Niro's skill makes one feel for a man who is a wreck with regret and grief.David Hume famously claimed that there are some art works that are appreciated by younger folks (no children, late teens and early adults) and works appreciated by older folk (later than midlife). This doesn't make much sense within his philosophical framework but as brute experience I think Hume onto something here. I recently re-watched this and Goodfellas-both outstanding no matter which lens is looked through-but it really does strike me that the two works are the same tale. But Goodfellas is a young man's work-vibrant, loud, striking-and this is an old man's work-smooth, meditative, subtly flavored. I would be hard pressed to say which film is better. I imagine that has I grow older this film will become even more towering.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Oldfellas,"Having Pacino, DeNiro and Pesci in these roles 25 years ago would have been perfect. They were 3 of the screens best mobsters, right up there with Cagney, Bogart and EG Robinson. But unfortunately old age and/or death comes to all of and this trio are respectively 79/76 & 76 which makes them far to old to play characters that exist in a time frame from 1955-75, for about 90% of the the 3:30 running time, which is long even for a Scorsese film. But then Hollywood loves to sanitize war and cop movies by usually having guys in their 40's & 50's in positions that in real life would be filled by young men who tend to believe they are immortal and in an effort to prove their manhood will do incredibly risky things. My guess is that OC works much the same way-most of the foot soldiers are younger although the old mobsters remain targets. In any case, ""The Irishman"" is an interesting film, bringing back a number of other actors who previously worked for Scorsese on his other mob films or appeared in ""The Sopranos"" or ""Boardwalk Empire"" among others. If you can get past the age discrepancy it's not bad although DeNiro's perpetually laconic and laid back portrayal of the title character worked better for Robert Mitchum in his day. Way too long though-could have easily edited an hour from this. My guess is Netflix might eventually break this up into a 4-5 episode series, probably other footage they could throw in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
another Italian-American movie... really..?,"This movie is a eulogy to the fake Italian-American accent gangster movies reproduced by Martin Scorsese. The acting was good, the story was good but I felt the story was over flooding with content to cover. The story was trying to make a screen adaptation of ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" about Jimmy Hoffa's rise and fall and his people that were there for his rise but not his fall, and then there was the original thought provoking story of Scorsese's gangsters getting a reality check. It was hard to keep watching after two hours, but I'm glad I kept watching. The digital makeup to make the actors look younger was uncomfortable to watch because I knew there was old men under there, but I think that was the point. Scorsese loves to make his watchers uncomfortable, and I appreciate it. Movies should challenge our emotions and thoughts just like a painting or book.This movie is great for anyone who loves the long dialogue, suspenseful, violent, Italian-American gangster Scorsese films.

I couldn't stay awake.,"It's been said often enough in other reviews: younger actors should have been used for the younger years, and the pacing was set for a turtle race.

I was looking forward to this,"I was looking forward to this film so much but I don't feel it's the masterpiece it should have been.Nobody can deny the skills of Al Pacino, De Niro, Scorcese and al, but I think this film was made too late.
Too late not because people don't want this kind of story anymore (they do); too late because the actors are too old for the roles.
While Al Pacino can pass as his character and the deaging looks ok on him, making him the most believable of the cast, the deaging really didn't work on Pesci whose neck is a dead giveaway of his real age, and both him and De Niro don't move and talk like younger mobsters with the bodies of younger men. Ultimately, they look like old men using a Snapchat filter, not multi million technology. Additionally the blue lenses on De Niro are just too distracting making him look he's got an eye disease, is high or both. Acting being also through the eyes, the lenses take away from that too much.As for the story itself, it would have benefited from being shorter. At times it drags on too much making it boring. There are some really good moments, especially the scenes involving Hoffa (Al Pacino) where you get to understand the relationships and personalities. Other scenes don't feel necessary to advance the story or the characters.It is a good film but with flaws. As much as I wanted it to be, it's not a 10/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Exceptional Movie With a Single Problem,"Overall, I think The Irishman is a pretty exceptional movie. Primarily due to Robert De Niro's performance. De Niro, brings his seasoned talent to the table, embodying the essence of Frank with remarkable depth, honestly one his best performances that I have seen.However, as much as De Niro's portrayal is commendable, it's impossible to overlook the film's ambitious CGI de-aging technology. While visually impressive, allowing us to witness characters across decades, it doesn't escape the fact that De Niro's voice and mannerisms still reflect the age he was during the filming. This disjunction between appearance and behavior, especially in the context of an elderly character trying to emulate youth, occasionally disrupts the otherwise amazing experience.Scorsese's direction, as always, is phenomenal, capturing the nuances of the mobster world with finesse. His keen eye for detail and mastery of storytelling shine through in every frame, creating an immersive experience for the audience. What I always liked about Scorsese's movies is his ability to delve into the psychology of his characters, humanizing even the most hardened criminals, and this film is no exception.While The Irishman may not surpass the legendary status of Scorsese's own Goodfellas, it undeniably stands as a brilliant addition to the mobster movie genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Wanted to love it but...,"Seems critics and individual reviewers praise this to show their appreciation for Scorsese, Pacino, Pesci and De Niro. Fully understandable, fantastic entertainers who have created masterpieces in the past. This movie, however, is not one of them. The idea of using these old guys portraying young persons doesnt work, the movie is much too long and slow and the whole formula just seems very yesterday and so much worse than the original.

The Godfather of this millennium.,"They do not make movies like this anymore, and one can see why Scorsese was anti-comic book movies.To sum up how great this movie is, 3.5 hours feels like 2.5 hours.

An ensemble of legends,"Martin Scorsese makes a huge comeback with this brilliant crime drama. While certainly a long film, Scorsese has managed to yet again create a thrilling yet human story about the lives of the people involved in organised crime. This film would be as good as it is however, without its cast of legendary actors. Joe Pesci manages to be a very menacing yet quiet mob boss with very little screen time. Al Pachino brings his usual angry, out of control style for another solid and enjoyable portrayal. Robert DeNiro stars as a hitman who makes increasingly evil choices (giving his best performance since Taxi Driver).

An Hour Too Long...,"It's an okay film, but far from Scorsese's best. The last hour gave me a sense of deja vue, haven't we had this dialogue already? Incidentally, the dialogue is pretty basic, I can't think of one witty or memorable line. It's dull.
It's well shot with some interesting angles and effects, but the CGI should have rendered the bodies as well. A middle aged face on an obviously elderly body just looks wrong. De Niro moves like he has arthritis.
Maybe in a cinema with a big screen and full on Dolby this would have been better? But streamed on Netflix on my lowly 23 inch HD screen and stereo sound it was very disappointing and not worth the wait. Pacino shone out as Hoffa, I think he really relished this role, and helped save it from being a 5.

"Had great potential, fell short","I've been following the development of The Irishman with great interest since it's initial development and was looking forward to seeing Scorsese reteam with DeNiro. I was eagerly looking forward to a crime flick that would be a fitting addition to Goodfellas and Casino, both movies that are faultless.Unfortunately I was left less than impressed, the movie still has the fingerprints of greatness, and from
Any other director it'd be their crowning achievement, but Scorsese has previously set a high sets serf for himself and this did not live upThe anti ageing SFX in some scenes looked uncanny, but in others looked like the same animation used in the Tintin movie, not helped by the fact that the 'youthful' DeNiro still moved like an elderly and arthritic old man, especially evident when he gives a beating to the store manager that shoved his daughterThe running time was excessive, normally I'd hope for longer running time but this was about an hour longer than necessary. This is the first Scorsese movie I actually got bored watching.DeNiro's character was supposed to be a hulking menace, a man that had killed many in the war, and killed many on the streets as a hit man and yet he portrayed the character as an eager to please guy who lacked conviction and seemed to not have a great degree of confidence, he seemed a reluctant passenger to PacinoSpeaking of Pacino, he stole the movie with his performance, dominating every scene he was in.All in all, too long, dodgy SFX didn't quite do it and DeNiro didn't bring his A Game",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Good, But Not a Favorite","(Just a little background.) I am someone who hasn't watched a ton of Martin Scorsese movies, nor movies with De Niro or Pesci. To the extent of being familiar with the genre of mafia, I've watched The Godfather and many TV shows involving crime syndicates.On the whole, I liked The Irishman. The way the movie was filmed felt very classic. Nothing too fancy, no frequent cuts to close-up shots, no quick successions/sudden jumps. The shots were clean and well-framed. I'm not sure why, but I liked the lighting of many of the scenes too.Cinematography aside, the movie was long, because it traced Frank Sheeran's life from how he joined the mob to pretty much the end of his life. The first third (not too sure-time becomes hard to tell once you're watching the movie) dragged. I kept wishing more would happen. The middle with Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino, was more exciting. Not only is Pacino a fantastic actor with some funny moments, but the dynamic and scenes between him and De Niro was realistic. You really get a feel for the friendship, but also the tension with regards to their loyalties to different sides. Joe Pesci's intimidating yet calm demeanor is a quality I live for in movies and TV shows; not every actor can pull it off, but the ones who can do it beautifully. The casting of Frank Sheeran's daughters wasn't the best; they barely looked anything like the younger versions of themselves, leaving me a bit confused at first on who they were when the second flashback caught up to the first. The last half hour of the movie became slow again too. I suppose the purpose was really to highlight how Sheeran's job impacted his life and led to his lonely ending.There were too many characters. I started getting confused with all the white males and each person's role and place in the hierarchy. I don't want to spoil the ending, but part of it felt sudden and confusing too.Nevertheless, I did enjoy it. It is definitely a mafia movie that harkens to an earlier time when movies of this kind were highly popular. The Irishman doesn't really bring anything new, but it's nice to see these legends all in one movie.

Almost a masterpiece,"I could not start it, because it's 3,5 long and was always afraid will not finish it in one sit. Last night I finally managed to convince myself I will just stop in the middle and watch it in episodes like a mini-series.Oh boy was I wrong! it was impossible to put it down and i ended up watching it till 2AM.While the movie could maybe (and maybe not) benefit from a little shorter exposition it is fantastic. While chaotic at first and hard to follow as you jump back and forth in the stream of time you soon realise that this is how a memory of an old De Niro works as he tells the story of his life, friendships and betrays.After the first hour or so it clicks and then with every passing hour it becomes so much more and zones into the human nature, and pain, and unexpected territories only to end on a soulcrashing discovery in the end. Scorsese has deliverd us a masterpiece!I really enjoyed it and it's a pity it did not win any Oscars. Having just watched it in May 2020 it is the first great movie of this year for me and one of the best I've seen in years.It would have been 10/10 if not for some strange CGI moments with edge on the uncanny valley effect. Sometimes the young version of actors are just a tad creepy. They look super real, but still there is something off.

A Headliner Cast - Still Not Enough To Make It A Classic,"Sadly this wasn't the swan song movie for DeNiro it's been hyped to be. With a runtime of 209 minutes, it's about 89 minutes too long. Filled with far too many ""talking heads"" scenes, with DeNiro and Pacino rehashing how he's got to do what the mob wants but he's not going to do what they want about 5 times too many. Okay already. We get it. Hoffa was a badass.This coupled with endless scenes of Pesci & DeNiro's wives smoking, wanting to smoke or arguing about not being able to smoke was beyond a waste of film and time. It would have been fabulous if Scorsese would have used even a fourth of that 89 minutes to showcase Harvey Keitel. Instead we're left with seeing him maybe twice or three times with less dialogue than a glorified extra. It was truly disappointing.While the film was good, it was far from great. It seemed like the Goodfellas met Scent of a Woman. At the end, the film shows us that DeNiro and Pacino have really not grown as actors as we've been led to believe. Gone are the edgy characters like DeNiro's Taxi Driver and Leonard from Awakenings! There was no hint of Pachino's Bobby Deerfield or even his Michael Corleone. We're left with the typical gangsters they've given us over the decades. Pesci, on the other hand, while still giving us a mild taste of Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas with a dash of Vinny Gambini from My Cousin Vinny, stole the show from the Trio of Headliners.Is the movie one you should pass on altogether? Not if you enjoy these three stars or gangster movies or even the genre from the Jimmy Hoffa-era. Is is an Oscar winner? Well, it sadly doesn't get my vote but at the end of the (long) night, I am glad I watched it if for no other reason than to see DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino & Keitel all on the same bill.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Wasted potential,"I have a huge admiration for Scorsese, but this was not to the best of his ability. The pace was slow and it felt like there was too much repetiton and rumination of irrelevant details, while also glancing over the reasoning and motifs for some of (what seemed to be) the crucial points in the story. In my opinion the 3 and the half hours this movie is long is poorly used.
I like the idea of the movie and what it was *trying* to portray, but with so many characters showing up every 20 seconds in the first half of the movie and the general vagueness of what the focus is on in the partucular act, it leaves you with the weird combination of confusion, anticipation and boredom. The ending was sort of anticlimactic, although it fit with the general atmosphere and I particulary appreciated the symbolism in the last scene.
The acting was superb as expected and Robert De Niro never fails to amaze.
Lastly, I loved the experimenting with de-aging cgi contrary to the backlash and I'm excited to see how it developes and improves in the future of filmmaking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The Irishman,"The Irishman is directed by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and tells the story of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro),a mob hitman who recalls his possible involvement with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa.
The Irishman, as of now, has been long awaited by many, including myself, and I personally believe the result of the film is worth the wait. Scorsese is with no doubt a master, and The Irishman is masterfully helmed. His skilful using of the de-aging visual effects is impressive and respectable enough, however, he remains a strong storyteller throughout the entire film, as I found The Irishman thoroughly engaging throughout, despite the 3 hour 30 minute runtime which, thanks to the excellent editing from Thelma Schoonmaker, was never present in my mind.
The Irishman is also excellently written, features stunning acting from De Niro, Pacino, and Joe Pesci, and makes excellent usage of the mise en scene, as the period of time, as well as constant progression of this time, was very well conveyed without the needing to explain directly to us.
Although riveting, I suppose The Irishman could have been trimmed down slightly, and the relationship Sheeran conveyed with his wife and family could have been better developed. There were also some very minor technical issues, mostly in the visual effects, yet, on the whole, I thought The Irishman was excellent, never resulting or feeling the need to be a challenging piece of art, but instead meeting that perfect balance of being an accesable, crowd-pleasing feature, meanwhile conveying enough flair and unique qualities to cement it as something more different to the typical Hollywood film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
I love it,"Classic Scorsese . De Niro is the best he's been for years . Pacino is really magnetic and charming . But for me, Joe Pesci is the standout. Quietly deadly, magnetic , loyal, complicated, its him that will get the Oscar . Saw it at the cinema ( sorry Netflix but I am not watching Scorsese at home ) and it was superb. Oh Anna Paquin is used quite cleverly as well. Good actress . Decent performance Go and see it at the cinema . You will remember the masters returning for one last ride
I was worried about the length of the film before i attended the screening, but i can honestly say, i was gripped all the way through, De Niro back to his best, Pesci was fantastic, Pacino was electric, Keitel was menacing & Stephen Graham held his own amongst this legendary cast.A return to this world that Scorsese has mastered with some of his best films & this film sits right up there right next to them.Get comfy & enjoy the great story telling ability of these masters at work

"Friendship & Betrayal over a lifetime, masterly told.","If Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was a take on middle age via the conceit of an actor (& his stunt double) looking around and asking himself, ""Is that all there is?""...The Irishman is a reflective take on old age as 3 players in and around the Mob face the consequences of their choices, with the last man standing having the final say.I started out in children's theater, and our best writers used to say that the stories were really about real people - but it's more fun to tell them through the lives or royalty, witches, giants and such.In The Irishman, the stories are about real people from history. And there is plenty here about unions, gangsters, politicians. In one of his last interviews, Gore Vidal told Bill Maher that grade school writers of classroom textbooks really don't get enough credit for the great care and skill they take to make history dull. Nothing dull here.But the metaphors are also there for the average person, and the not-so-average alike, in the changing relationships between the 3 main characters (De Niro, Pacino and Pesci). Friendship & betrayal, over a lifetime - what life and death are all about.In what little criticism I heard about the CGI de-aging that was used in a more advanced way for the 1st time here, I was impressed and glad to see I disagreed. The critics miss several points. The fact that the changes are so subtle is a marker of how good the tech is. Also, the high quality of the actual aging for the final scenes deserves credit - that may have been traditional makeup. But the remarkable thing is you cant tell whether they are using makeup or CGI. Scorcese is right, they were able to use CGI as if it were makeup.As always, among the celebrated filmmaker's mastery of skills is his use of music - one could write a nice chapter on his choice of songs alone. I'll just mention that he's set ""In the Still of the Night"" as a kind of theme song, opening and closing the picture with it. Among other things, as a colleague with a guilty conscience once said to me, it's at that hour, alone, that one thinks about the awful things one has done to those one claims to love.As a last thought, on this 1st viewing, I noticed that the film began to take on a disturbing urgency in Act 3. This is notable because we all know more or less what is going to happen. And as with every great tragedy, I found myself rooting for an outcome that I knew was not possible.That's how good this movie is.As always, Scorcese works with the best - and the best are happy to work with him. No need for me to list them here, but thank you everyone, especially writer Steven Zaillian, DP Rodrigo Prieto, editor Thelma Schoonmaker.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A Modern Epic,"The Irishman follows over 30 years of the life of Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran, a Teamsters Union truck driver and hit man for the Philadelphia mob. Robert De Niro, as Sheeran, is taken under the wing of mob boss Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci). Once he gains Russel's trust, he is offered a job as bodyguard to Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). A natural friendship grows between the two as the lives of Sheeran, Buffalino, and Hoffa become more and more intertwined. As he serves two masters, Frank faces the question who he will hate and who he will love. Robert De Niro offers a subtle, but chilling, portrayal of Sheeran. Without the move of as much as a muscle, we see him methodically execute his tasks with no remorse. Joe Pesci plays a character unlike what is his norm. Unlike the insufferable and rambunctious mobster so often seen in Scorsese's films, Buffalino is soft spoken. He need not raise his voice to make himself heard. The silence of his presence carries an eeriness with it. Al Pacino's portrayal of the larger than life figure, Jimmy Hoffa, not only captures all of attention when on screen, but it stays with you. Once past a myriad of swearings, once his eccentricities fade away, Hoffa is revealed to be a true and loyal friend. The de-aging technology for the film is nearly flawless so that it is barely noticeable when the jumps from different time periods are made. The cinematography, costume/set design, and editing work exceptionally well for the story that is being told. The screenplay is exceptional. At times, it makes the audience laugh and then fall dead silent. It captures the dangerously light hearted mood the mob has about their crimes. Lastly, Scorsese's direction of the film is simply brilliant. He ensures that a glance or even a sharp breath tells the audience everything. He is a master story teller. The Irishman is a modern epic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The bones of a good film,"Structurally speaking this is a good film. The story, however far fetched, is interesting and compelling. Most of the acting is excellent. It was great to see Joe Pesci return to a mob role. This time Joe is very subdued, measured and calm. A different kind of mob role for him which he does well.Now the bad parts. The de-aging used on Deniro looks like a character from The Polar Express. Why not cast a young actor to play the part? Almost ruined the film for me. Secondly, and I know this might be unpopular, Al Pacino is a terrible, terrible actor. The worst choice to play Hoffa imaginable. He was amazing in his day. That day is over. The movie is going along and here comes Pacino, seemingly from a different film, crashing through the wall like a hammy scenery chewing kool aid man. Awful.

It's kind of methodical you could say. It was weird for me to see the life of a man, who on the outside looks like a good person, but then just kills some people like it's a routine without giving any thought to it.

"A beautifully filmed, outstandingly presented and powerfully resonant masterpiece of an epic...","'The Irishman': Martin Scorsese directing a three-hour plus biographical-gangster epic starring Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci with an abundance of supporting roles including Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Ray Romano and many, many more. It wouldn't be far from the truth to say that I was hyped as anything to watch this movie. And I was truly not disappointed. If anything, I was rewarded.Despite it's hefty run time, the movie never feels slow. Now, the first half of the second half is a bit uneven in the sense that it's time jumping montages aren't too clear and make the movie feel a little bit sprawling, but it never for a second seems to drag or feel boring. In fact, it's as brilliantly entertaining as anything. The lengthy duration is needed for the emotional weight and to introduce, build on and develop the complex relationships between its characters, and even then, you barely feel the run time thanks to how explosively fun this movie makes itself. Every scene is packed with either information, tension, comedy or character-development, and it never feels like a chore. The dialogue of the screenplay, first-off, is amazing. It feels real and gritty, but also stylised and epic. I don't know how Steven Zaillian managed to pull that off, but he did. Scorsese's direction is constantly electric, packed with energy when it needs energy, and melodrama when it needs melodrama. He knows exactly what to show the audience to bring suspense in later scenes, while also knowing what not to show the audience to keep the mystery. The lush production design cannot be understated either.Another point that adds to the entertainment value, is of course the cast. This is probably my personal favourite DeNiro performance I have ever seen, and that's saying something. His character isn't one with too much emotion, but you can feel what he's feeling and think what he's thinking even when his character's face is blank-slated and his character's mouth is silent. You can fully comprehend the complex emotions of their characters without a single expression or a single word. I don't know how, but both those guys manage to do it. Pacino and Pesci are undoubtedly great as well. DeNiro is full of bleak emotion, Pacino is full of energy, and Pesci is full of mystery. Anna Paquin's character doesn't have too much to say in this movie, but her character's presence is strongly felt throughout thanks to the immediate sympathy we feel for her character, played both as Paquin as an adult, and Lucy Gallina as a child. And her character might just turn out to be the most resonant of all.The cast brings me on to a commonly discussed aspect of the film: the CGI de-ageing. You can sometimes tell when the CGI has been used (particularly in the eyes), but honestly, it's never distracting. It just looks like a super high-quality video-game and if anything- it's good.Now onto the flaws. I talked a bit about how the narrative sprawls about a little bit during the start of the second act, and that's the only real flaw I have, but there's many VERY small, VERY picky flaws that I think I should so for the sake of the review. Thelma Schoonmaker is, of-course, legendary for her editing, and the editing in this film is great, both in the smaller, tighter scenes, and the sprawling, time-jumping montages. It's not only perfectly timed, but also rich with subtext. But there are just two choices she made that I didn't fully agree with. There are many instances in the movie where characters discreetly attempt to hear other's conversations, but there's no change in camera angles to signify them doing so, and I didn't understand why. It was most probably intentional, knowing she has the capability to change conversation scenes, but I don't know why. The second choice is a VERY picky one, but I'll say it anyway. The character of Hoffa has, understandably, a lot of build-up, and it pays off tremendously thanks to Pacino's performance, which always feels enthusiastically charismatic and larger-than-life as it should be, but the first shot we get of him could have used more build up. It just feels so casual. Sure it's with an immediate close-up, but as it's on a phone scene with DeNiro's character, I just think it should have taken it's time to reveal the character, like maybe hear a few of his words first, to keep us anticipating, then BOOM- showing Pacino for the first time. I guess it was to give it an element of surprise? That's probably why. But that's about it, really. There's one more REALLY picky nitpick I have, but this time, about the cinematography. It's fantastic, both visually and artistically, but, without trying to give too much away, there was one thing I wish could have been added: There's a scene where two characters are talking about how much trouble another character is getting into, while he's on the other side of a railing. This was a great opportunity to use put the camera right behind the railing, and make it appear as if the character was caged, or barred, to symbolise his troubles. Scorsese has done this many times before, but I don't know why this particular shot wasn't shot this way. Maybe to make it seem like the character is free in his own sense and doesn't know how much trouble he is getting into? I don't know. I hope so.Now these flaws are REALLY, REALLY picky, and I'm sorry. But I still gave this film 4.5/5 stars for a reason. Now I would have probably only given 4 stars (still good) if it wasn't for one thing: the third act of the film. The third act of this film is probably my favourite of any film I have ever seen in my whole life. It lasts just over an hour and is a complete redemption of any flaw, big or small this movie may have. It starts off with a gripping conversation that changes everything we ever thought about how this film would go, and then, Scorsese enters a roughly 20-minute long sequence that's easily one of the most suspenseful, heart-pounding and intense sequence ever put on film. Instantly classic. It shifts between silence, thought and a conversation about fish, and it ends with an absolute bang. By the, the plot is practically over. Yet there is still around 40 minutes of the movie left. It is like an epilogue to tie up all the loose ends and give an emotional closure, and I would go as far as to say that the epilogue wasn't a conclusion to the film. Rather: every second of the film lead up to this gigantic epilogue. It is in this epilogue that we see the main philosophy, the main moral compass, and the main theme that this movie was exploring. It's genuinely one of the most profoundly poignant and emotionally resonant end I have ever seen. And the sad ending lingers on for a long, long time. Now this is the not the kind of sad that makes you want to cry- it's the kind of sad that makes you sit completely still in silence, and just think, as all the complexities of the movie are allowed to wash over you. And that feeling is only added thanks to one of the best closing shots in film history, that can be interpreted in a number of ways. Truly amazing cinematography shown here.It really is a beautifully made masterpiece with a profound moral message, and it's honestly one of my favourite films ever.CONCLUSION:
'The Irishman' is genuinely a beautifully filmed, outstandingly presented and powerfully resonant masterpiece of an epic from Martin Scorsese and an explosive all-star ensemble cast, with two and half hours of truly extraordinary development of its many full-fleshed characters and their relationships that bridges and builds up to an hour-long third act which masterfully contains an overwhelming amount of tension that then explodes into a sombre, melancholy and deeply emotional epilogue that easily redeems the film of it's small flaws with an ending that lingers on in the transfixed minds of the audience long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"In a time of endless boring reboots and superhero movies, Martin Scorsese shows audiences what a real movie is","The Irishman is real cinema and the sad fact of the matter is that in the current era of cinema the only place Scorsese was able to find a home for this amazing film project was on a streaming service.What is perhaps most amazing about The Irishman is during a time when younger filmmakers are de-aging and using CG models for dead actors like what we saw in Rogue One or the de-aging in Mandalorian of LukeAlong comes Scorsese who is now 80 years old and yet so in touch with filmmaking innovation that he has been able to do de-aging far beyond anything we have seen so far. There is a sensation of uncanny valley but you really can't see it or point to a single thing and say oh that's CGI de-agingThe amazing de-aging technology and technique aside the film story and acting as to be expected from a Scorsese film are just outstanding a great adaptation of what is in essence a non-fictional story (a real story with true events all the way throughout)Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci really are something else and the last of their kindAs is ScorseseAnd I wonder how many people realise this but where is the new talent?Hollywood has become closed off to creating and fostering new talent and it is a shame as once the generation of the greats have retired we will be left with just endless reboots, endless remakes, endless superhero flicks with crappy CGI and 0 story 0 actingSuch a shame, but for now we have the Irishman to still enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Scorsese assembles the old crew for one last hurrah,"The Irishman brings back together screen legends Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel. Stephen Graham also appears. Directed by Martin Scorsese The Irishman charts the story of truck driver turned hitman Frank Sheeran played by De Niro and his part in American History. Robert De Niro is fantastic in this film, the best i have seen him in years bringing one of his classic performances to the table. The only actor to outshine him is Joe Pesci. Coming out of retirement specifically for the film Pesci is outstanding here. Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is good but we do have the shouty Pacino on display which i have always found a little over the top. Stephen Graham also plays a strong part and more than matches the legends in the scenes he is in. A lot has been made of the CGI de-aging and for me it works most of the time. A couple of scenes it is a little obvious and distracting but more noticeable is when the actors are meant to be the younger men the way they walk and kick clearly demonstrates an old man. The Irishman is a very long film but doesn't feel its length, in fact a lot of the supporting characters could have used more screen time. For me the third act was the strongest and was tinged with pathos and highlighted mortality and how our actions define us. The Irishman isn't quite classic Scorsese but is a film which really involves the audience and gets you thinking. It is a film which i feel bears a repeat viewing as so much is happening with so many time shifts that little nuances are bound to be missed by the audience the first time. Ultimately though it is great to see these legends in this genre one more time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Made 20 years too late,"I like all of the actors in this movie. The story was good. Old school mob movie. The problem was all of the actors were too old for the roles they played. Robert De Niro was 76 at the time of this movie and was playing tough guy gangster. In the scenes he beat someone up it was awkward. Just the was a 76 year man moves it wasn't realistic. Joe Pesci kept referring to him as ""kid"". Bottom line, if you like the mob movies these guys have made in the past you will probably like it but the movie should have been made 20 years ago or with a younger cast, and not just De Niro and Pesci.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
So Much Talent Soo Much Time.,This film has two things that almost immediately jumped out at me as a viewer.

"""I heard you paint houses.""","I have only ever seen this film one other time, and that was back in 2019 on its release, and I have to say I think I enjoyed it slightly more upon this second viewing.This film, I must admit, challenges me. It challenges me both as a fan of crime/dramas and as someone who does his best to view things objectively. Both my subjectivity and objectivity are at odds with each other.On the one hand, this film is well made, and the script is well written. The story is good, and the cast delivers fantastic performances. It contains all the earmarks of a great Scorsese film. On the other (and this is where my subjectivity kicks in), I feel the storytelling could have been better or perhaps if the film was more compact and not so long. But the length is almost necessary to get across the feel and tone of the film as well as the relationships of every character. There's a lot at play here and a lot to unpack.Most of my enjoyment of the film came from the first and third acts, and the second act is where things at times felt stretched out. Then the films conclusion (and this is where it challenges me a bit as a crime/drama fan) I feel was neither satisfying nor unsatisfying, and I think that is the point. It felt to me for lack of a better word, and I'll quote them in the film: ""It is what is."" In the case of most crime/dramas, conclusions are more finite. Here, however, it felt drastically different from what I'm used to in the genre. Perhaps it's not as deep as I'm making it out to be, but it does invoke thought, at least for me, it did.Overall, while it's not my favorite Scorsese film and I have my own issues with it. I must admit it was a good movie and one that I think will stick with me.IMDb: 8/10

Mournful epic,"With The Irishman, Martin Scorsese returns to the genre he's most infamously associated with and brings all the experience gained along with him. There's none of the catharsis of something like GoodFellas, instead it's a mournful epic that uses its extended run time to really show how the crimes committed in a person's youth really stay with them all the way into their later life.This film is a stacked cast led by a central trio of screen legends giving real powerhouse performances. Robert De Niro is phenomenal, leading it with minimal power, always happy to serve and unaware of the cost until it's too late. With Jimmy Hoffa, Al Pacino has a perfectly matched character giving him plenty of time to be as boisterous as ever.Joe Pesci on the other hand, may be the strongest of the three because of how completely against type he is. Known for playing loud mouths who are incapable of being quiet, here Pesci is quietly restrained in a way which gives everything he does a real power.Martin Scorsese's direction is superb, the violence is quick and harrowing, it absolutely earns that run time whilst flying by and with Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography it's visually immaculate. Robbie Robertson score is amazing thanks to its understated sense of foreboding that adapts to the different eras.The big talking point is obviously the de-aging which manages to be the best it's ever been whilst still running into the usual problems, mainly the initial uncanny nature and the movement doesn't always match the age. However, it goes unnoticed fairly quickly and from then on is no longer a concern.Frequent Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker knocks it out of the park with the editing here. A three and a half hour crime saga that spans six decades in a non chronological structure that starts at the beginning and the middle then catches up to itself by the end and it's all done seamlessly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Great masters should be indulged,"Old age is eerily creping up on all of us, rich and poor, a saint and a gangster. The snag is that gangster's chances of ending up in a nursing home are pretty slim. Something or someone else usually prevents that. But here we have Frank Sheeran, enforcer and killer for the mob in a nursing home telling his grim story to the camera. Martin Scorsese is of course a legend and a grandmaster of his craft. Everything is marvelously well put together and there is a cast of old pros doing what they do best, snarl and growl and shoot and kill. The movie is almost 3,5 hours long and could've easily be shorter an hour. One could almost feel that this is a sort of farewell of old friends before they themselves end up in a old folk home counting pills and regrets. Nevertheless, enjoyable gangster flick with it's own resolutions of the greatest American puzzles, the assassination of Pres. Kennedy and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. Great masters are entitled to their own quirks and they should be indulged. After all how many great masters do we have. Less and less every day, so it seems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Scorsese brings back the old Mafia crime movie feeling with his new movie.,"The Irishman is a new crime biography directed by Martin Scorsese, the director of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas.The film is about the hit man of the Mafia Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) about the missing and later murder case of the American trade union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The two were lifelong friends and the judicial authorities suspect that Frank knows more about the disappearance and death of Jimmy Hoffa. During this trial, Frank looks back at his life on all the decisions and actions that he has made in his private and criminal life.With this film, Martin Scorsese manages to put down a mafia crime film again, just like the earlier ones were made. As he did with his older crime films such as Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese also allows the different story lines of the film to run through and past each other in a good way. This way you get a better idea as a viewer how the characters feel or what they think about certain situations they are experiencing. Because of this good way of telling the story of the film you do not notice that the film actually lasts three and a half hours, because once you are in the story, time flies by.Thanks to special effects, they have also succeeded in rejuvenating or aging the cast. After getting used to how the cast looks rejuvenated or outdated, it soon comes across as if you are watching an older film of the actors when they were really young. Because of the appropriate film sets and clothing of the cast, the film also looks realistic as if you went back in time with the characters.The acting work is also done well. The cast consists of a star cast of Oscar winning actors. It's great to see this talent under the direction of Martin Scorsese. Robert DeNiro has played a good major role in this film since The Intern movie of 2015 as a mafia gangster with whom he used to become known as an actor. Since the 2015 film Danny Collins, Al Pacino has again played a good larger role in this film. This is also the first time he has been in a Scorsese film. It's nice to see these two film talents working together on a film. Actor Joe Pesci even returned from his retirement for this film, because since 2010 he has not been featured in films. Despite having been out of the film world for a long time, he still knows how to deliver good acting as a mafia boss. He is a bit quieter and quieter for this role, but he still shows that he can be a danger to his enemies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Maybe in another decade of computer development this technique will work better, but DeNero just looked like an old man with make-up and blacked hair. Beyond that there was a deeper problem, Old men cannot walk like young men. No matter how good an actor - and these guys are the best, you cannot hide the depletions that the years have on your musculature. Old people walk with stiffness and economy, through the necessity of aches and pains. This shows through.Moments where you see the artifice, throw your attention away fro the story and back to reality.

Let's Get Real For a Second...,"While it's nice to see Scorsese do another proper gangster flick, there's a few things I just can't get past with this movie. For starters, it's way too long!

No amount of makeup or hair dye can get me past that mess.Then, there's Pacino, who occasionally tries to talk like Jimmy Hoffa, but then in other scenes talks like, well, like Al Pacino.The movie isn't terrible. In fact, it has echoes of Goodfellas and Casino in it. But Marty should have hired younger actors for the flashback scenes, someone that could pull a legit effort at Hoffa, and cut out the nonessential scenes, and this movie would be what everyone seems to think it is. I miss Scorsese's gangster movies as much as the next Paisan, but this movie is getting its bag of jewels fluffed, and big time!Well worth a watch if you have nothing planned for a half-day, are good with inconsistent acting, and if you can get over octogenarians playing thirty-year-olds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

If you are starting out on this genre then i recommend goodfellas and the taxi drive.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
USA build on thugs,"Production of the movie was splendid. Did the period time piece wonderfully. The Deepfake was kind of bit off at times, but considering the technology at that time was still at its early stages, it is then forgiven. The movie was a bit tad too long, but I guess for the story progression they needed the time, which is understandable. But what I took from the film is that we always complain about gangs and criminals of our modern time, but the entire livelihood of the American lifestyle and the American dream is build on murder and scheming by ordinary mafia thugs in all walks of life. Kind of sad if you think about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Great,"This movie is great. It's not the classic Scorsese's mafia movie. It is a movie in which the director gets out of his comfort zone to make a deep portrayal of how crucial brotherhood, betrayal and loyalty are in mafias.
Although the duration of the movie is very extense (209 min = 3h 30m), it makes the whole experience worth it by the end of the film. Anyways, I'm not lover of long films, so that's a factor that I personally did not like of this movie.
The acting is very good, Scorsese's ways to direct scenes is wonderful and as a Scorsese lover you will see this while watching the film.

Scorsese still top of his game,"Truck driver Frank Sheeran tells his story of how he gets involved with Russell Bufalino, climbing the ranks to become a top hit man and also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa.Directed and produced by Martin Scorsese and written by Steven Zaillian this offering from the legendary director is based on the 2004 book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. Its long run time has perfect pace, but don't go expecting the roller coaster ride of Goodfellas or Casino, this echoes classics like The Godfather's and Once Upon A Time in America's pacing with the feel of JFK to name a few.It's poignant, funny and the violence boldly plays second fiddle to the characters and their relationships. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are on fine form along with Harvey Keitel (whose screentime is limited) with their ageing special effects holding up for the most part (Pacino looks a little off at times). A casual viewer probably wouldn't notice as they age from the 1950s onwards, it touches on many periods with great recreations.For completion, it's only crime is not including Ray Liotta and Johnny Depp.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Confessions of a home decorator.,"Scorsese's return to perhaps his most potent genre is a subtle slow-burn that maybe comes the closest out of any of his prior titles to outright decry the lifestyle it depicts. This is done via a phenomenal epilogue that sees the piece simply fade out, around thirty minutes after what's essentially its ending, rather than explode in some sort of blaze of glory. It's a remarkably effective choice, ensuring that any waylaid claims of glamorisation are put to rest before the lights come on. In this regard, the difference between this picture and, say, 'Goodfellas (1990)' is rather slight; it's certainly tangible, though, a definite effort to compound its message rather than leave it completely up to audience interpretation. Though comparisons between 'The Irishman (2019)' and its previously mentioned ancestor are inevitable (and, even, valid), the two movies couldn't be more different when it comes to everything other than their genres and their bare-bones plots. This affair feels decidedly mature, an underplayed exploration of character that uses crime more as a backdrop than a narrative focus. It crafts a palpable world whose terms are written in euphemism and whose debts are paid with blood. It never feels preoccupied with its seedy dealings, refusing to revel in them and instead nonchalantly presenting them as a fact of life for its characters. Its violence is quick, dirty and effective, nothing more than a means to an end. There's less focus on it, even if it's still as prevalent as ever. The narrative moves at its own pace, presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by its protagonist. It seems like the elaborate, matter-of-fact and occasionally confused confession of a dying man desperate to get his misdeeds off his chest before they finish him for good. For the most part, this works well, going some way in justifying the flick's fairly messy structure. It's necessary, even if it sometimes runs into the technique's usual issues with telling instead of showing, and it's delivered excellently by 'old man' DeNiro. The performances are great across the board, with many actors playing against type and turning in some of their best work. Pesci, especially, is great, returning as a major player after a twenty year hiatus from such roles. The digital ageing is a little rocky in places but it isn't distracting. After a while, you forget about the special effects wizardry and focus on the time-hopping narrative. It's probably the best way such a narrative could be presented, actually. The entire affair is decidedly considered, seemingly conceived to be exactly what it is. It's an assured experience that actually makes some relatively bold choices - especially when it comes to its flashes of 'arty' filmmaking. It does have issues, though. For one, it's very long - I mean, it's literally the longest film I've ever seen - and you can feel its length. It seems like a good half hour could have been excised to no real detriment. It also seems more suited to a mini-series than a movie, mainly thanks to its episodic nature. It takes ages for its main point to become clear and, even then, it's only really evident in retrospect. Its main dynamic is potent, don't get me wrong; in fact, the flick becomes better and better as it bubbles to the surface in the second half. It just takes a lot of time to kick in, that's all. The thing is quite tonally inconsistent, often undercutting itself with extended, out-of-place humour. Sometimes, this adds a little layer of charisma to the characters; other times, it reduces the intended effect of the scene in which it's inserted. The picture is presented so sincerely between its comedic beats that any deviation from its usually straight-laced nature is jarring at best. Still, an odd tone can't stop the story from being as successful as it is, even if it does occasionally dampen its effect. The experience is always engaging and, usually, just as entertaining. It works better on a scene-by-scene basis until far later than it should, but it ultimately makes for compelling, worthwhile viewing that says something without shouting about it. It's well-made, distinct and enjoyable. It's a shame that, unlike me, most people won't get to see it on the big screen. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It is GREAT but not EPIC.,"So I watched the movie yesterday on Netflix. Because I've seen, that the movie is 3.5 hours long have prepared myself for some maybe ""boring"" parts, but there were NONE. There was always something happening. Action non stop and tension almost non stop. Acting of those 3 gentleman (De Niro, Pacino,Pesci) is more than great. Yes, everyone of them has a bit of self-touch to a character, maybe even what we have seen before. But in one word, acting was just GREAT, especially Joe Pesci. I haven't seen Pesci, till this movie acting so serious, so confident. The CGI thing, it was OK. You can see in some scenes (moments )that is not really that convincing, because we know how the actors look now. Especially you can see it on De Niro. I was expecting maybe more emotional scenes, but there wasn't plenty of them. Not too many in-family interactions. Maybe because they are Mafia and cold blooded killers. Not to much to be expected on the emotional side. But maybe I expected too much. Directing is great and convincing, skript too. I think that Martin Scorsese told this story like it should be told.

"""I HEARD YOU PAINT MASTERPIECES""","It is a master in complete control of his craft, it's Scorsese at the top of his game. Scorsese's recent magnum opus of mob genre is the best film experience I've had this year.Film Starts with iconic Scorsese tracking shot though the hallway of and Old Folks Care centre, and at the end of it we see and aged Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is sitting in a wheelchair. This is the story of this Irishman spread over several decades, Frank was a WWII veteran who fought in Italy, that is why he speaks Italian and that's why he's merciless when killing people. Frank narrates his story that goes back to 1950s when he was working as a truck driver, delivering meat, but then he started stealing it for a local gangster. This eventually drops him into the orbit of Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci), who is a national level mobster, a soft spoken Mafia don who is part of a body that controls Philadelphia. Russel tries to be a good person, but he's a person who will scare you by just talking. After Sheeran proves his worth as friend and Hitman for Bufalino, he eventually meets Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Frank forms this enduring bond with Hoffa over the years, and he becomes Hoffa's confident, his go to person. Hoffa makes this bond with Sheeran's family especially his daughter Pegy who for some reason is scared of Bufalino, she just can't look at him properly, but with Hoffa it's different, there's love and respect for each other between them. But then tension starts building up between Hoffa and Bufalino and things start going south for everyone especially Frank.The Irishman is masterclass in terms of story telling, the film is dark, brutal, gritty but somehow manages to be funny at times. Scorsese allowed his character to not fight and kill all the time, they sit they talk and just stay quiet at times. It has iconic Scorsese violence, people get shot in the face so many times that you'll not be able to keep the count. It is a master dealing things with full control, he gets the best of his actors and performance are absolutely breathtaking. Robert De Niro being Robert De Niro, he's just at so ease when acting, he's been in some pathetic movies lately but The Irishman is a proof that De Niro is not an actor for films like Dirty Grandpa, this is what he's made for. Al Pacino is known for roles when he's yelling at the top of lungs, when he's angry or when he's showing extreme emotion, full of passion, that is what he's doing as Jimmy Hoffa. He's fierce as Jimmy Hoffa. Joe Pesci is although playing a character totally opposite of his reputation. He's quite and terrifying, he's a guy you don't want any trouble with. He will kill you and then will go on with his normal life like nothing happened, he's that cold, and Joe Pesci is astonishingly good as Russ Bufalino. When the film is into its final act, these are the moment so priceless it's hard to put in words. The tension is built with impeccable camera work, Scorsese just suddenly cuts the background music and there's complete silence in the background and De Niro and Pacino are acting like it is their last time, few words more expression, and then The Irishman becomes an instant classic.A film for the ages, you will love it and cherish it for years to come.

Good film but not great,"The premise that Frank Sheeran was behind the murder of Jimmy Hoffa is tenuous at best and so this movie postulates what could've happened versus what did and among the many theories espoused about Hoffa's disappearance this one has much less credibility.

To keep a viewer interested in a three hour flick is a tough act with the best of stories but there just wasn't enough meat on the bones of this story to hold my attention for that long. To me this film was worth watching for Joe Pesci alone and while De Niro and Pacino but in a solid effort I found nothing really all that worthy that they didn't deliver in other films of higher caliber.

Weak plot with little direction.

Watching an aging, depressed Sheeran gives you both sadistic pleasure and pure sympathy as he experiences a change of heart after it is far too late. The final minute is the best splice of cinema it's size that I've ever seen. The final scene is aesthetically simple and purely heart-wrenching.

A well-made film that falls below expectations,"Attended the first day of the limited release (Nov 1st) in Los Angeles. I've always been a huge fan of Pacino, Deniro, Pesci and Scorsese, so anticipating the release was exciting.The actors, cinematography, costume design, music and overall capture of the period piece is absolutely phenomenal ... it is no doubt an amazing overall directorial achievement by Scorsese coupled with the amazing talent of the actors.My complaint is the screenplay (which seems to be the continuous plague in Hollywood today) and the unnecessary amount of extra scenes (thank you Marty), especially towards the end. I'm glad I wasn't the only one who found this film to be ""slow-moving"". I'd say you could have easily cut out at least 30 - 45 minutes out of the film and would have would up with a masterpiece.Overall, I saw it in the theatre since Deniro, Pacino, Pesci and Scorsese collaborated, but if you ask me had I known what I know now, I would have told you I'd skip this one and instead rewatch ""Heat"" (1995), ""Casino"" (1995), ""Once upon a time in America"" (1984) and ""Godfather: Part 2"" and would get a much better ""fix"" than watching the film.However, since art house flicks like this one are a dying breed, the Oscar season is coming up and if you're a fan of the actors / director, go see it ... it's always amazing to watch Deniro, Pacino and Pesci together on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Jack Nicholson did a much better job as Hoffa in a previous version. THe film is fast-paced at times and drags at other times.

Pacino was Pacino and De Niro was De Niro. Maybe these aged actors have become too big that now you only see them as themselves or maybe they are out of touch or too egotistical to try something different. It like eating plain cornflakes everyday of your life, if you've have had one bowl then you know what's coming. Also speaking of forever, it was like Scorsese was desperately trying to fill in the gaps with long drawn out scenes , the 30 mins of irrelevance at the end and menial tasks like standing in a queue being shown.

But then I watched it for a second time....I watched it for the second time at home, alone and with subtitles on; and I enjoyed it on a whole different level. I was able to understand what the right way to watch this movie is. This is not an action movie where the actors are explosive and fiery. This is a movie where conversations are extremely important. You need to pay attention to what the actors say to each other, or what the narrator says. Another element that really stood out on the second viewing was the music. It is subtle, but present in most scenes and it is so amazing.

Good but weak for Scorsese,"An elderly Mob hitman (De Niro) recalls the people he knew (Pesci, Pacino) and the decisions he took which defined him.I think knowing a bit about the subject matter might have helped with this movie. Scorsese takes for granted the fact his audience know what's gradually unfolding. I didn't and although it's coherent and well scripted, it's lacking tension and, in the first half, a sense of direction. I suspect on subsequent viewings it will come together more nicely.Whilst not on the same level as Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall Street or Taxi Driver, it's still a decent film but its length does it no favours.The main negatives, aside from the running time, are the awful use of CG to make the cast younger and the cartoonish blood effects when people are shot. The choice to use ageing actors and youngify them rather than young ones, with prosthetic make up, proves a bit odd looking.It's a good movie but one of Scorsese's weaker ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

That would be interesting, and didn't get much attention.Also, I didn't get the sense that the lead actors were really inhabiting their characters, although some of the face-to-face dialogue between the leads was very engrossing. But not because they were inhabiting the characters, but rather because they are just so good at delivering lines. It was sort of like being at an acting class.The screenplay was, I thought, very powerful, but it didn't get translated into flesh-and-blood conflict that made the audience care (unlike The Godfather, say).

I'm fine with long movies if when there are artistic reasons to make them long. This is not the case here. ""The Irishman"" just feels unnecessarily turtle-paced and long-winded, like an old man's story. That's what it's supposed to be, too, but that is not a reason to inflict at least two hours of unnecessary footage on the viewer.Second - and I am sorry to say this - they are too old for most of the story. The point of the story is largely to show the key characters go from powerful wise guys in their prime to old men who wasted their lives. But the main actors were already 75+ and I'm sorry to say that no amount of makeup or effects could make them look like they were in their prime. It's impossible to suspend disbelief when Pesci's character calls 75-years old De Niro ""kid"". He does not look 24, or 54 for that matter. He's very obviously a man who could have great-grandchildren. Casting the same old boys to play characters over a 50+ years lifespan was a huge gamble and it did not pay off.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Tribute to the Legends of Hollywood Mobster Royalty,"As I was watching it quickly became evident to me this was Scorsese's way of giving De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci their proper send offs into Hollywood's Mob Movie Valhalla for the rest of time.From what I understand, Pesci had to be coaxed out retirement ""several times"" for the film, and now I can see why. It's tough to see aging actors trying to recapture the magic of their youth, and no matter how hard everyone tried, they never quite got there.All three looked way too old, even with special effects, to play their character's much younger selves. For example, De Niro as ""Frank"" had a brood of daughters who looked like his granddaughters from the moment they were introduced into the picture.The story was actually very good and I didn't even mind the long running time, but no matter how engrossing the plot became ie the ""Hoffa Mystery"", I kept getting stuck on their physical appearances.My favorite of the three by the way was Pacino as Hoffa, mainly because he made me laugh with his superb ""Pacino Only"" abilities to deliver his lines in total harmony. He's always been a genius in that way, and age has had little impact for his impeccable approach to acting. He is truly a Hollywood Legend.As I said, this was one last rodeo for the guys we all grew up loving as our favorite gangsters, a sort of romantic romp through a better era of film making and story telling. I don't think anyone could or will ever do it better. Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
you'll want to watch it over & over again,"Absolutely brilliant.. pure art in every small detail.. in the world Scorsese creates.. in those moments of silence on DeNiro's face that say it all.. in Pacino's endless energy.. and in Pesci's remarkably quiet intensity.. the work of true geniuses.. It is long, but when it ends.. you'll probably want to rewind and watch it all over again.. Because although a story about real life gangsters.. at the heart of it is a story about life..
That's why it will be a timeless work of art.. a new classic and may be one last chance of seeing these guys all together",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Long, kind of Mafia formula movie","6.5 This is long and draggy.Deniro is too old for the part of the young Shearan. He also walks like an older man.His body looks it's age. The aging only works for the end scenes.It is not a great concept. You never get a read as to what made Shearan into a killer.His experiences inWW2? Shearan in real life was a large guy at 6' 4"" .BobbyD. does not look like him. This movie had a similar concept as Goodfellas,the same type of music, similar to A Bronx tale. It's not the Godfather ,just as long.Pacino stole the show as the stubborn Jimmy Hoffa. Joe Pesci is a rather low key benign mafia guy. Are we supposed to think a for hire killer would want or need a daughter's love? If you say so but it was not convincing.

'We did it again...did we??',"I don't understand why Scorsese made The Irishman. Nothing new under the sun, old wine in new bags.Or... Scorsse created a 'swan song' to honor his own career of beautiful maffia movies . If that is the case, then he has more than succeeded. But not for the reasons he might have hoped for.
First of all - in terms of storyline - the lives of the main-characters run somewhat pathetic to their end. This depressive fact is reinforced by Scorsese's casting; his old friends and loyal actors. They gave us the most beautiful performances - most of the time under Scorsese's direction. But after that, these men went down career-wise, acting in forgettable trash and they grew older....much older.
So, Scorsese pulled these actors somewhat posthumously out of their creative lethargy and pushed them into this far too long film.To ""do it"" one more time.The hopelessness of this attempt is even more emphasized by the fact that due to poor make-up, these hero's of the past, officially old and winkled, are - in the mostly flash-back sequences - walking around like display-mannequins. Its irritating.This could not have been your intention, Mr S.
The Irishman is a failure not only in terms of script - nothing happens - , not only because there is a serious mis-cast in terms of age, but also because the actors play so bad; the energy is gone. Are they bad actors? No, they simply have to act an energy that doesnt fit the energy of their age; the 'age-gap' is simply to big.PS: IDe Niro - who is know to me for these somewhat chilly, surious little eyes - has now, older, these large, deep, emotional and compassionate eyes and expression. Beautiful in full close up. Put this actor in a role that fits his age - an Eastwood movie, or something like On Golden Pond - and he will deliver a power and depth he never had before.And why do i rate this movie a 7? Well......because the production is really beautiful and Scorsese and these old men, after all, gave us so much beauty before. Too much to be nullified by this superfluous vehicle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Even gangsters grow old,"I watched the Criterion Collection two-disc set of The Irishman. The second disc, with lots of commentaries and detailed analysis, gave valuable insight into the world of Scorsese.The movie revisits some of Scorsese's old favourite themes of loyalty, friendship and betrayal but compared to his previous Italian mafia films, it has a more quiet contemplative pace, especially main character Frank Sheeran (played by Robert Deniro) who revisits his gangster life with the hindsight of old age and its losses and regrets, leaving him alone and resigned in a nursing home.The film brought together giants like Deniro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel who are all -- except Pacino -- longtime collaborators with Scorsese. The ""de-aging"" technique used to allow same actors playing their own role over a few decades was not very convincing but the story felt more coherent in this way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Same old same old,These guys cannot hide the fact that their old men now. De Niro gives the same face he's been using for the last two decades.

"Imperfect but compelling - more like ""Raging Bull"" than ""Goodfellas""","First the imperfect;CGI was a little distracting at first, but I got used to it as I settled in to the story. It was mostly with Deniro's character, and that had to do with the fact that they ""made his brown eyes blue"". It did make him look Irish, especially when he was looking off in the distance. I felt like I was looking at my immigrant grandfather at times.The beating - apparently some people couldn't get past this, and I'll concede that it was bad. But come on- you really stopped watching the movie for that? It was thankfully brief, but I'm not sure why they left it in the film. I suspect indulgence from somewhere.On to the compelling;Joe Pesci - Brilliant, understated portray of the kindly uncle/ruthless gangster Russ Bufalino - maybe his best work to date. A simple line like, ""There's been a change"", delivered so offhandedly but with the gravest of implications, is simply chilling.Al Pacino - Best performance since ""Glengarry Glen Ross"". I hate to keep using the word ""understated"", but that is a very relative term for a guy who has been accused of overacting at times. He portrayed both Hoffa's insecurity and hubris with equal aplomb, and he made him sympathetic. I know what's going to happen, you know what's going to happen, everyone knows what's going to happen, except Jimmy. Pacino made you just want to reach across the screen and shake some sense into him.Speaking of which, Robert Deniro;I can't decide which character he had better chemistry with, Jimmy or Russ, and I don't think it really matters - it was just a real treat to watch. He was a good, loyal soldier from start to finish, caught up in the conflict between two juggernauts, and despite the genuine love and resulting equity he had built up with both Russ and Jimmy, found himself powerless to change minds or events.
He really was the glue that held this movie together.Good performances, if limited, by Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano, Domenick Lombardozzi, Jesse Plemons, and Stephen Graham. Kind of fun to see Welker White (Lois from ""Goodfellas""), too.Loved the historical context as well, with snippets portraying Kennedy's assassination, Nixon's downfall, Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc. It was like a ride in a time machine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Classy Scorsese movie but a long, dreary watch","One can't blame movie lovers for putting this movie on their "" must see"" list since it a Martin Scorsese product with acting talents of the calibre of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. The problem is that perfectionists like Scorses get so involved in the making of a movie that they wind up with a final cut of 3hour 29 minutes knowing very well that any film crossing two and a half hours like this one becomes a tedious watch even if it has a marquee cast. (It is worth recalling that Scorsese had recently berated the producers of Marvel films for lowering standards of Hollywood films. They have however had the last laugh as Avenger series have been loved by the masses and this movie was not commercially successful. The bottom line is that a feature film is a commercial project and there can be no pride in a classy film which doesn't make money ).This movie chronicles the Union politics of 60s America through the eyes of ex truck driver De Niro, the man Friday of Jimmy Hoffa. Hoffa played with usual aplomb by Pacino finds himself being targeted since JFK is POTUS, and his brother Bob is Attorney General. Brutal killings take place in crowded bars as well as dark corners and this gory process of elimination continues periodically. Both lead actors well into their seventies have a hard time struggling to perform the way they are known for. To make things worse they are also made to play their younger selves with the help of special effects. Pacino particularly overacts playing the paranoid and confused Hoffa. ( A far cry from his first rate acting in "" The scent of a woman ""). Similarly De Niro is unimpressive as Frank Sheeran.Credit is due to director Martin Scorsese for his deft handling of the ever mobile camera to bring to life the atmosphere of America of those times, but the scenes become repetitive and boring after some time. The movie's duration should have been around two and a half hours. It is definitely overrated and overhyped.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Not as much a film for the big screen as a Netflix miniseries,"Size matters... or not, depending on the point of view of who is opining. But length matters for sure, independent on enything else. 3 h and 20 min???... are you sure Mr. Scorsese you have enough to tell to fill every minute of the footage with reasonably interesting scenes and dialogues?. Well, I understand that Netflix would not have put such a huge amount of money to gather such an splendid cast and offer such great production values should it not have received in turn a product that could be splitted in 3 or 4 parts for streaming broadcasting. But hey!, we went to the cinema to watch it, and the rules of the game are different here. No less than 1/3 of the film is redundant, uninteresting and lacking of rythm, and the second half ends up really boring and tiring. Interpretations are fine in general, great Pesci and Keitel, good De Niro, Ok Pacino (in line with his performances of the last 45 years); a pity that Anna Paquin and her character were not given more time and relevance in the film and instead so many tough guys hard-talk that goes nowhere is allowed so much footage time.Finally, was it really necessary yet ANOTHER Mafia film with basically the same premises as the old good ones we all have in mind and in this occasion centered in a dark, and nowadays forgotten, personage as Jimmy Hoffa??. Silence was also a flawed film, but at least it had the interest of showing us some relevant historical events that are very unknown by the public. However, In the case of The Irishman, it all feels as a Déjà vu, a product crafted specifically for the show of a bunch of actors in the very last stages of their (otherwise) brilliant careers.... 6/10, mainly for respect to Mr. Scorsese and most of the actors, but actually it would deserve less.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Many ups but as many downs....,"Whoa...this was a looong ride! The Irishman is a mammoth movie trying to do many things, perhaps too many to succeed in all of them.
Let's start from the goodies: undoubtedly the movie is sustained by extraordinary acting performances, especially remarkable those by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. What De Niro (and CGI) does with his facial expressions all along the movie is just in itself worth the money of the ticket. On top of that, the dialogues are incredibly juicy and the movie overall is extremely well crafted.
On the less positive side, The Irishman struggles to keep the story focused, with some outstanding peaks and some moments of lull - understandably so given its length; I mean, even masterworks like the Odyssey and the Iliad (just slightly longer than The Irishman) have inevitably many highs and as many lows, so Scorsese's ambitious work does not escape this everlasting law. Moreover, he introduces so many characters that he makes it very difficult for the viewer to keep track of them and of their relationships.

Lengthy and old-fashioned,"The movie was dragged out too much, which significantly thins out the suspense of the plot. Although the acting performances are good, they focus too much on a few men.

a bit Alzheimery,"You're going to be extremely confused watching this movie. Characters are haphazardly introduced with no explanation as to who they are, what family they are attached to, what position they hold in the hierarchy and why that matters in relation to Hoffa.
The movie was enjoyable to me, as I've watched every mob documentary under the sun and I literally fall asleep every night watching the ""Inside The American Mob"" docu-series (seriously!). So I had a base with which to place these characters inside the story.
Another issue I have with this movie is, it tells a story revolving around Jimmy Hoffa and never discusses Detroit or the Detroit family, who I could argue were more powerful than most of the New York families because the Detroit Mafia controlled The Teamsters. And thus, the Teamsters pension fund (as well as the Teamsters trucks, which were importing all the heroin into the U.S. from Canada at that time).
I found De niro's mumble mouth, stuttering narration to be extremely obnoxious and distracting. That guy is falling apart.
Pacino sucks in his old age. Nicholson crushed him in his portrayal of Hoffa.
Pesci was absolutely incredible in this. The man has still got it! A true master of his craft, unlike De niro and Pacino, who are all about the money these days and not crushing their performances.

SLOW BURN,"Okay, first off - if you're expecting 'Goodfellas' then you'll be disappointed. This film lacks the 'snap' of the aforementioned movie - the sense of adrenaline-fuelled fear that Jimmy Conway et al induced is nowhere to be seen. De Niro's character seems tame compared to Conway and there were moments when I longed for some of that menace to show through. Pesci looks and acts aged and I was unimpressed with his portrayal of a mob boss. Pacino delivered to some degree however, throughout the movie, I had the distinct impression that he had forgotten some of his lines. The scene in his office was laughable and I found myself wondering why somebody hadn't shouted 'CUT' halfway through his rant. The real gem, for me, was Stephen Graham's performance. His face off with Hoffa in prison was electric and it has to be said he certainly held his own against Pacino. The final meeting between Frank and Hoffa played out way too fast - there was so much opportunity there to take those characters to the edge and it didn't deliver. All in all, and I'm a huge fan of De Niro, I was disappointed with this movie. I feel it failed to live up to expectations when you consider the calibre of the cast. Graham was superb.

You Can't Go Back,I went into this expecting a high energy conclusion to the Good Fellas/ Casino era..a kind of trilogy to the mob influence on American culture. While the movie did attempt to deliver on this the conclusion was a kind of geriatric ward for once robust acting giants. I was most excited to see the return of Joe Pesci and all we got was a husk of a performance. He seemed half asleep and frankly it felt like he didn't want to be with here. DeNiro just bounced from scene to scene making faces and kind of got through it adequately. Harvey Keitel was hardly in it.The one saving grace was Al Pacino. He ran away with every scene he was in. He didn't just coast on a once relevant reputation. One of his best performances in years.Scorsese's direction seemed a little off..overbloated script with sudden bursts of violence that weren't very memorable.

An absolute cinematic masterpiece,"I was lucky enough to land my hands on the UK BFI gala satellite screen ticket for selected cinemas in order that I managed to see this masterpiece first hand on the 13th October 2019. This is a date I'll remember forever - for this is the day the I saw a true 10/10 movie - and there are only about 6 of those.Weighing in at three and a half hours, by the first scene, your immersed. I didn't look at the watch once - not once in all 210 minutes of the presentation.The acting is sure to throw up Oscar wins, and if the films doesn't sweep the board I'd be amazed. The CGI takes a little getting used to (they still cant de-age the eyes very well) but on the whole the production is epic. No expense spared on location and filming. The film is a picture perfect window on the 60's 70's and 80's.Joe Pesci takes the academy award for supporting actor, Pacino will take best actor and the film will walk best picture without a chance of opposition.It's not Goodfellas, but it didn't want to be. This is a film about a man's lonely demise and fight with remorse (or lack of it) over a 50 year period. There's no one left now....the old country is dead.Enjoy.

Really enjoyed this movie,"Yes, this is a long movie, but the time is definitely need in order to fully tell the story and detail their lives. This movie covers in one nonstop movie what parts 1 and 2 would for a typical film. I'm happy with being able to watch The full story without waiting another year+ for a sequel. This movie also isn't boring, but I can see why it is to some. Because of the 3.5 hour runtime, the story is allowed to unfold in a timely manner simply because they don't have to cram the story to fit a 2 hour window. Watching all of these great actors in the same film was really enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Goodfellas"" Redux","""The Irishman"" is the most ""Goodfellas""-ish movie from Martin Scorsese since 1995's ""Casino."" That's a long time for devotees to wait to see the master director return to the format he virtually invented. Is the wait worth it? Yes and no. ""The Irishman"" is no ""Goodfellas,"" but I'm also not sure it's trying to be, though it's almost impossible not to compare it. For the first half of the film, it's hard not to be dogged by the sense that we've seen all this before but by artists (many of them the same artists) who had more energy for it twenty and thirty years ago. But then late in the movie, we realize that this film has more on its mind than being yet another retread of a mob life epic, and it's the film's last, quiet moments that earn it a place of its own in Scorsese's canon rather than just a Scorsese rip off of Scorsese.""The Irishman"" is very long, but I didn't feel its length that much. And it's the last half hour or so that gives the film it's punch, and only because of everything that's preceded it, so I wouldn't want it to be any shorter. This movie continues past the point where films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" end and suggests that the sometimes hellish life of being a gangster may be nothing compared to the hell of growing old. The main character, played by Robert De Niro, is a mafia ""yes"" man, carrying out orders while trying hard not to think too much about them. As a result, he gives pretty much his entire allegiance to one man (played by Joe Pesci), while alienating everyone else in his life, from his family to close friends (notably Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino). What happens, then, when the man from whom you've always taken your orders is no longer around to give them? What happens when everyone else who has comprised the very small world in which you have lived has died and left you behind? What happens when you have nothing but time to reflect on the man you have been and the things you have done? What happens when the one thing that made you feel vital no longer exists? It's not hard to believe that Scorsese the filmmaker is using this film to ask himself some of the questions he asks of his characters, and that's what gives ""The Irishman"" a sense of ruminative pathos and makes something richer out of what could have been a glib genre exercise.This is a pretty engrossing, always entertaining, and at times very funny film. But there is one major drawback that I had a heck of a time getting past, and I'm not sure I ever did completely. And that's the fact that everyone in this is simply too old to be playing the characters they're playing. Robert De Niro, vibrant as he may still be, is 76 years old, and, de-aging digital technology aside, he cannot pull off thirty and forty. He and Pesci, similarly de-aged, just look weird and kind of creepy for a good part of the film, and even if the technology can make De Niro look somewhat younger, he still moves like an old man, something most noticeable in a scene where he kicks the crap out of a grocery store owner. At times the movie smacks of a bunch of kind of sad old dudes who are past their prime trying to recapture the glory days of their youths, but then again, given where the movie goes, maybe that's part of the point.One thing, or rather one person, I can heap unqualified praise on is Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa.

"Pointless, disappointing","I was super excited about this movie, as am sure most people were (especially ones who enjoy majority of deniros, Pacino, Pesci and Scorses movies). Unfortunately this was a big let down, just like the season 8 of game of thrones. I sat through the whole movie and watched it hoping for a good ending, which never came, and was just a weak story and script, weak acting by deniro, pointless scenes by his daughter that never materialized.
I know they are no longer in their prime, and just felt like an old mans movie on all aspects, specially deniros scene where he beats up the guy at the shop ..
Not Scorsese best stuff for sure.

People Calling for Younger Actors are Missing the Entire Point and Substance of the Movie,"Of course there would be some CGI complaints based on the age and all, but people who think younger actors should have been used are missing the entire point of the movie; every main actor in this movie is a Legend. They earned that title through a career of heading up ""classic"" and ""masterpiece"" level movies that are among the greatest of all time.No ""young"" actor alive today is anywhere close to their level for this genre. This isn't like placing DeNiro in the Godfather II since DeNiro was far out of the league of today's young actors when he was a young actor in the late 70s and early 80s. Today's crop of snowflake metrosexuals could never play dominant, masculine, testosterone-driven ""men"" like these guys, guys with balls of steel who you believe. Maybe their high-pitched, estrogen-laden voices could somehow convince the viewer they were a ""boss"", but it would be the same viewers who can't wait until James Bond is played by a female, which is fitting since real manly actors don't even exist anymore.But besides the fun banter, nobody could play these legend roles other than these legends themselves, and no ""young"" actors could even come close to carrying their weight for these heavy parts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Like listening to an old man tell an interesting story,"Watching The Irishman is, appropriately, a lot like listening to an old man tell a story. It drags on a little too long and sometimes it loses focus about where it's heading, but it's interesting stuff. And after it's over, you're glad you listened to it. This movie feels like an epilogue for Martin Scorsese's work, featuring his favorite subject matter and actors. This film didn't blow me away, but it's still a well-made organized crime drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A massive failure.,"I've seen Scorsese's classic: The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf of Wall Street, Ragin Bull, Taxi Driver, etc. This movie 'The Irishman' isn't in the same league as the his other movies, it's not even the same sport.Some may think a rating of one star is harsh but given the director, the actors, the massive budget, this is hugely underwhelming. A massive failure to deliver on the hype.The movie started off as a story about a hitman played by Robert De Niro. I think the main character was suppose to be a very interesting person but for me he wasn't. Al Pacino's character (Jimmy Hoffa) comes in to the movie about an hour in and I was more interested in his story than anything else. After Hoffa's inevitable disappearance there's another hour of old men shuffling about in prison, picking out caskets, where they are going to get buried, etc. It turned in to a snoozefest.The CGI was hyped up about how these guys were made to look younger and older. It was suppose to be amazing - It's not. It's jarring as hell. There's this strange blue eye effect going on that I couldn't quite understand. Despite changes to their faces they still move around like geriatrics. There's one scene De Niro is beating someone up and it's hilarious because he can barely stamp on the guys hand properly. Keep in mind De Niro is in his mid 70s and it shows in the body language. They should've used younger actors.When the end credit came up I was like 'what the fudge?! That's it?!' This was just a truly forgettable experience. I will never watch this movie again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Did not disappoint,"Everyone delivers. From Marty's artful shots to each of the cast members.

Worth the wait.,"I though It was an excellent movie. De Niro gives a great performance. It is particularly powerful in the very late stages of the movies. There are times though when he has that De Niro look on his face. I mean that look people in the entertainment business put on, when they want to imitate him. His face looks so tight that you might wonder if it can move at all. Other times he is more relaxed, and looks younger. But I am not sure if he was supposed to be younger. I wasn't always sure, where the movie was chronologically. But what really convinced me initially of the quality of his performance, was his superb narration. It is in the closing stages of the movie, with De Niro, as an old man that his acting becomes as good as anything I have ever seen from him.I kind of found it hard to gauge Pacino's performance. The thing for me is that Pacino has given some great performances in the latter part of his career. So his performance here doesn't hold any great surprises for me. Whereas De Niro seems to be coasting along for a long time lately. His performance here makes me remember why I once thought of him as one of the greatest actors ever.1 view.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Movie of Epic Proportions,"Scorsese has finally done it. He has done what only Sergio Leone before him was able to do: make a 3 hour gangster movie with amazing acting and a good script. The Irishman is ""epic"" in every sense. And this is precisely it's downfall.I have great respect for Scorsese and the work he has done in his field. I have equal respect for DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino as well. The talents of all four of these men are brought to life in this movie. At the same time, however, I can't help but think the run time was kept the way it was just to get all the actors decent screen time. I would expect Scorsese to want to get the most out of his actors and have them show their prowess. They do, but it really is at the expense of the movie-pace. Had the script been a tad bit shorter, it would have been a much better movie.The script is another thing that needs to be discussed, as it is impressive. The dialogue is outstanding between characters and really let's us know their personalities, thoughts, and feelings. The movie is gritty, as you would expect, with un-stylized violence that makes you feel every punch and gunshot. The realism takes you deep into the ruthless world of organized crime, where even the most respected capo can become a target. Rare is a movie that is able to be so real and get away with it.Overall, I am conflicted on the score to give this movie. Had the run-time been shorter, I would have given this movie a 10. But the additional hour of movie creates slogs that just can't be ignored, or saved by a powerhouse actor. Once Upon a Time in America blended together the epic, the violent and the fantastical into one masterpiece of a movie. The Irishman tries to do the same...and almost succeeds.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The best Mob Movie of the 21st Century,"From start to finish this movie is a 10. The movie is on par with any of Scorsese's prime films, from Goodfellas to Taxi Driver this will go down as one of his bests. The only thing you can knock this movie for is the 3 and a half hour runtime, but that's where it grips you. The writing in this movie is one of the bests in Scorsese's library, but it is one of the best maybe even the best of 2019. The funny part is in the movie there is a lot of dead silence just the camera lingering on whomever is on screen after a conversation, but it's not just some gimmick to get you to sit there for 3.5 hours. Whenever this happens in the film it's a time when something said or something done is being thought about by the character and it gives you the time to resonate before moving on to the next scene. Scorsese brings the whole gang back for one last go around, and boy what a way to go out if this is the final film for these brilliant men. De Niro has been goin steady the last couple years but this was the De Niro we know best. His performance is wonderful and deserves a nomination. Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa is the best we've seen from him in a long time. But if you ask me the one the only Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career. Pesci's roles have given him this reputation of being this loud mouth fight first ask questions later kind of guy that we all came to love, and that is why this is his career performance. This is a role that has come at the perfect time for Pesci. When he is on the screen you feel that every word he says is precious time being spent on you. He is cold he is calm he is calculating he is the man of the film for me. Everything in this film is perfection, the cinematography, the score, the pacing, acting, writing, directing. If you had asked me yesterday what the best movie of 2019 is I would have said the Joker easily, but not anymore.

Delivers what was expected,"Like eating comfort food on a cold, wintery day, sitting down to catch the latest Scorsese/DeNiro mob movie filled me with a warmth that was satisfying for it's familiarity. It is a film landscape mined by professionals who know this genre of movie well.There is a terrific film in this 3 1/2 hour epic - if only ""Marty"" would have trimmed the fat to find it.Telling the real-life story (with some conjecture and fabrications), THE IRISHMAN tells the tale of...well...Irishman Frank Sheeran (Robert DeNiro) a working stiff who rises in the ranks of mobster Russell Buffalino (Joe Pesci) to be one of his chief enforcers and the personal bodyguard to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Paciino).In the lead, DeNiro commands the screen like the DeNiro of old. His Frank Sheeran is menacing, razor-focused on his objectives. You never question Frank's loyalties and his ability to keep silent. DeNiro shows this by be being silent for a good part of this film, even though he is on screen for most of it. He is a commanding force that requires that we pay attention to him.It was good to see Pesci back onscreen as Russell Buffalino. His mob boss is pragmatic, making decisions sternly and expecting his people to follow them, no questions asked. His presence on the screen is almost as commanding as DeNiro's and I wouldn't be surprised to see DeNiro (Best Actor) and Pesci (Best Supporting Actor) be in the mix come Oscar time.In lesser, (almost cameo), roles - but faring very well - is a ""who's who"" of character actors, Harvey Keitel (who I would have LOVED to have seen much, much more in this film), Ray Romano, Bobby Canavale, Jesse Pleimens and Anna Paquin, I'm sure all jumped at the chance to appear - however briefly - in a Scorsese mob epic.Faring less well in this film is Al Pacio as Jimmy Hoffa. He is back to his ""yelling Al Pacino"" ways of films like SCENT OF A WOMAN. His Hoffa is pretty one note and, consequently, his scenes with DeNiro are ineffective mostly because Pacino is chewing up the scenery (and yelling) while DeNiro is sitting silent and staring and listening to Pacino. This was a major disappointment for me, but (fortunately), Hoffa is in only about 1/3 of this long film, so while it hampered my enjoyment of the film, it didn't ruin it.Credit (and blame) for all of this goes to master Director Martin Scorsese who has mined these waters more successfully in CASINO, THE DEPARTED and GOODFELLAS (his best film, IMO). This film is a loving pastiche to these types of films and a bygone era - and he chose to make it for NETFLIX for he wanted to make a sprawling epic and take his time in telling the story he wanted to tell. This is evidenced in the 3 1/2 hour length of this film, which if filled with long tracking shots set to a backdrop of Italian crooners singing old standards. It's a throwback to a different time and place, one that these players know well.Scorsese has stated the he only decided to make this film because the ""de-aging"" software the he used to make DeNiro and Pesci look 30 years younger was ""good enough"" to use. And I would agree with that statement. The de-aging of these 2 (and others) is ""good enough"", in some scenes I forgot I was watching a de-aged DeNiro and Pesci, while in some other scenes, I could spot the trick. Again, it was ""good enough"" and not distracting (unless you were looking to make it distracting, then you probably found what you were looking for).But for me - a fan of these types of films, I was not disappointed. It was about what I expected it to be. If you were looking for something different and new, look elsewhere, you will be disappointed.Letter Grade: B+8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"Great technical aspects, no plot","Great visuals, cinematography, editing, strong dialogue, and mostly great performances...but there's no plot. And by plot, I dont mean things that physically happen in the film, I mean something our characters are specifically trying to do from beginning to end. They aren't trying to get to Mount Doom, save Zion, save Private Ryan, find the infinity stones, solve that murder mystery, etc. There is no end goal. There is no objective. There is no Point B to their Point A. This film is littered with things that simply happen. But movies have story goals because that clues the audience in on what's to come. It gives the narrative obstacles. It gives characters individual importance. Without that story goal....you have an incomplete story. I feel like the biggest draw for this film is the cast, and sure...big names and strong performances...but do they all feel born to play the roles...? I'm not sure.

Borderline Masterpiece; Best Picture Oscar On Its Way- You Can Skip Half an Hour in the Middle Though if the Length Bothers You; Everything Else is Perfect,"Skip 1:50-2:16 if you want to shorten the length, which is about 3 hours and 20 minutes. That section was tedious and could have been edited out with nothing lost.The first 2 hours, as well as the final 30 minutes are all masterpiece material.Joe Pesci will win Best Supporting Actor, De Niro will be nominated for Best Actor, especially for his acting in the final 30-45 minutes of the movie which sees him encounter and battle old age after all he's done.For Scorcese's gangster/crime type of movies, I would place this above the Departed, about on par with Goodfellas (though it's its own separate thing). It is actually slightly better than Goodfellas in ""some"" ways, but I think Goodfellas is such a classic and broke new ground in such an original way that it is hard to declare it totally better than that. I will say this- I liked the ending of The Irishman more than I liked the final act and ending of Goodfellas. It's more powerful than you'll expect and hits pretty hard unexpectedly for such a dark comedy.If it was between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this is hands down your Best Picture winner for 2019. You may just want to skip that roughly half an hour around the 1:50-2:16 mark to save some time.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

But after the first couple of passes you get used to this. Great to see Pesci back at it again. Pacino is excellent. Deniro is excellent.

All three of em' gave on of the best performances of their career. De Niro was the engine that kept the movie running. Joe Pesci as Russel said so much without saying much. The 'less is more' blended perfectly.
But its Al Pacino that brought the shine to the movie in his own way. A stand-up 'say it to your face' kinda guy trying to do what he can in the era of gangsters all around as Jimmy Hoffa.

A Masterpiece.,"A fine curated piece of art, that's what Scorsese put before our eyes, he brought out everything in his arsenal of skills, every move is calculated to the teeth, every work is accounted for, it never skips a beat, it comes packaged in a smart setup which is not surprising with a director like Scorsese, in its over three hour runtime, not a single second is wasted, every little thing meant something, every frame worked towards the story, whether it's a one-second still or a ten minutes sequence, everything clicks here.The performances, my god, where should I start? everyone brought their A-game and some more, the whole cast was infinitely charismatic, but the lead trio, De Niro, Pesci, Pacino were just phenomenal, true masters of their trade, absolute strong presence, when they're on-screen, you're tuned in, not by choice, they just demand that of you, it's just fascinating for me to see a long sequence rich in dialogue between arguably the best two actors alive, the back and forth here is everything but acting, it is too real, that's how astounding they are, Pesci again, in my opinion, delivers so relentlessly as he always does, and when on-screen he takes control, he commands, not even De Niro can match his level, he just has this thing, it's unbelievable.Scorsese always referred to Cadillacs as the top of the industry, well this film is a Cadillac, it has endless class, I feel privileged and honored to have watched this, something that history will hail its cult status in years to come, A Marvelous MASTERPIECE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Like a boring version of Forrest Gump and JFK with four of the greatest actors,"Scorsese spent too much time on the CGI effects and not enough time crafting the scenes and paying attention to detail. There are very few memorable scenes after three and a half hours which is a shame.The only reason I give it a 6 and not a 4 is because De Niro, Keitel, Pacino and Pesci are all on the screen together and that will never happen again. All four are great in their roles.To my surprise, Ray Romano was a standout.The best scene involves De Niro, Keitel and Pesci sitting together which is a first in movie history. It is also the first time De Niro and Keitel have acted in a scene together since Taxi Driver.The screenplay and dialogue are not up to par.This project was doomed from the start because the story is ridiculous and was finished by the writer after Sheehan died.The Hoffa case remains a total mystery and many of the ideas floated here are non-plausible. Some of the major known facts about this case are left out.There are a lot of historical inaccuracies presented and a lot of sloppiness. The dialogue is extremely weak. Many of the scenes are pointless.Scorsese shamelessly rips off the Anastasia/Godfather scene which has no place in this story except that he attempts to transform one character into being a major person involved in that storyline which wasn't the case.For a 3 and a half hour film, this film left a lot to be desired and could have easily lost an hour.There are some interesting thoughts on aging which are pounded in during the last 30 minutes which is what I think most of this is really about which makes for two separate movies. There are some reminders at the end of De Niro in Awakenings. It is no coincidence this movie shares the same writer as Awakenings.In the final analysis, the Hoffa mystery is interesting and it is not a bad subject to tackle but it was tried back in 1992 with Nicholson and DeVito and was a total boring flop. This movie was paced even slower than that one.It felt like a mix of Forrest Gump and JFK with two of the characters seemingly everywhere at all times and involved in all things. There are also all of these conspiracy theories that start turning it into an Oliver Stone film. Scorsese made the mistake of buying all the way into this book and turning two of these people into more than what they were.I wish De Niro, Keitel, Pacino and Pesci had done something a little better together.

He's available.,"'The Irishman' is good, even reaching greatness at several points, however it has a few problems which bring it down. Firstly, it's long (running for a whopping 3hrs 29mins) and it feels it, mainly due to its pacing. The first two-thirds have a very episodic feel and aren't very focussed. The intent of the piece isn't really clear here. What we see just seems like a selection of random events in the protagonists' life, rather than a carefully constructed, character-building narrative. It actually takes around 3 hours, which is far longer than most complete films, for its main purpose to become clear. That's not to say what precedes it is bad, though. It's actually far from it, as its individual scenes are undeniably entertaining thanks to good writing, direction and performances. It's just never that engaging because of its lack of satisfying coherence. It also follows the traditional structure of the genre, coupled with generic narration, which gives it an overwhelming sense of predictably. The final portion of the film, however, really brings everything together and makes it stand out from other gangster flicks. Here, it offers a reflection and meditation on the genre as a whole, exploring themes of guilt and death in an effective and engaging way. It's an incredibly bold, ultimately genius, way to end things and leaves a great lasting impression. It makes the whole experience more likeable and far less generic upon reflection. Saying that though, one mustn't forget that it takes a long time for it to really be effective. A lot of the first 3 hours or so could easily have been trimmed for a leaner experience, without losing anything essential. It does allow for more time with the performances, though, which are nothing short of outstanding. Joe Pesci is the highlight, appearing in a far calmer role than you might expect. Another notable aspect of the film are the de-aging CGI effects used throughout, which aren't phenomenal and are really noticeable in the first few scenes. Thankfully though, the power of the performances and writing easily allows you to forget about this very quickly. It's surprising how little you even think about it as the film progresses. Overall, 'The Irishman' is definitely worth seeing (ideally on the big screen like I did, although it may be a little late for that now). Even if it's not Scorsese's best and can seem like an endurance test at times, it's still an ultimately effective piece that's undeniably entertaining in the end. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Stunning Masterpiece the likes of which may never be seen again,"I can't explain how good it feels to see an old-fashioned, good, honest 'film' again.
The true art-form of the category realized. A real story told with heart, soul, and without shoving PC jargon down my throat. No agenda's here. Just showing human beings for what they are - real people with shortcomings and downfalls. More interestingly yet again - exposing what the real world and what real world power is - based on corruption and scandal. Everyone remembers JFK for his greatest speeches. Few care to realise that he, like every politician, was shrouded by corruption and nepotism. And people now are angry at Trump because he won't show you his tax returns! As if the rest of politicians are saints. If that's all you've got to worry about, I'd say you're doing alright.It's clever, and it's funny, and engaging, genuine, and sparks emotion. There are cameos and nods to the classics. The performances are only outclassed by the absolutely flawless direction. Flawless. This is direction perfection. This is what Todd Philips and all the other 'wannabe artsy' hacks need to look up and take notice - and learn something - from. What a shame to think how incredible Joker would have been if Marty had taken the reigns, rather than the totally unbelievable, mis-characterisation garbage of a borefest we got from Joker.It is long - a good 40 minutes or so - but knowing it's made for Netflix, it's entirely understandable why Marty decided to tow the line there.Forget Goodfellas. This is truly Godfather-esque in its storytelling ability and scope. Like Once Upon A Time, this is truly a nod to real films and storytelling of the past, and it's a crying shame that this will potentially be one of the last true films of its kind, ever to be made - just like Once Upon A Time.I was lucky enough to see this in an actual movie theatre - with curtain, dress circle and all - and will remember this for the rest of my life. Incredible job by all involved.DeNiro - Best Performance in decades.Pacino - Surprisingly funny and subtle in his versatility.Pesci - My goodness, Pesci. Never should have given acting up. Still has it in spades. Could steal a scene in no less than 15 seconds from almost any current leading actor you could imagine. They don't make em (films or stars) like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another masterpiece from Martin Scorsese.,"When it comes to crime epics, there isn't a more go-to director around than Martin Scorsese, his filmography speaking for itself, with the likes of Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed only a few of the classics of the genre he has made spanning a career of over fifty-years. The Irishman doesn't just boast a masterful filmmaker at its helm but a deliriously impressive cast full of frequent Scorsese collaborators such as, Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Joe Pesci and, surprisingly working with Scorsese for the first time, Al Pacino, in its arsenal.The Irishman chronicles the life of Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran (Robert De Niro), a truck driver turned hitman who had ties with the Bufalino family and the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).Make no mistake, the scale of The Irishman is just about as epic as you can get, Scorsese's film spanning a number of decades and the filmmaker masterfully delivering a surprisingly meditative reflection of both a hitman's life of crime and his own career. Moments feel like they could come straight out of Goodfellas or Casino yet The Irishman is an entirely different beast altogether, slow and calculated in its execution but so engrossing and hard-hitting when it needs to be.Steven Zallian's screenplay combined with Scorsese's masterful direction ensures The Irishman doesn't overstay its welcome at 209 minutes. Sure, you could say there are scenes that could be cut entirely or shortened however, it's an absolute pleasure to watch this film play out from start to finish, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography and the legendary Thelma Schoonmaker's editing only adding further quality to proceedings.The method of de-aging has been used a number of times before, most notably within the MCU however, it has never been used to this extent, the majority of this film spent with these actors in their younger years. It honestly did take a while for me to get used to it but it soon becomes seamless and makes the possibility of these actors working together throughout the ages a truly captivating cinematic reality.Coming to the performances, The Irishman features a mightily impressive cast littered with strong performers but it's the main trio of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci that really are a force to be reckoned with. De Niro is the best he's been in years as Frank Sheeran, his charismatic yet nuanced performance giving the film such a powerful driving force in the lead role. Pacino steals the show as Jimmy Hoffa in what is also his best performance in years, making his first time working with Scorsese an even more special occasion. It's Pesci, brought out of retirement especially for The Irishman, who really caught my eye with a incredibly cold and quietly unsettling performance as Russell Bufalino, a polar opposite to his performance in Goodfellas. Harvey Keitel and Stephen Graham throw their acting weight about accordingly while Anna Paquin does a lot with very few words, a true testament to a performance.The Irishman hits Netflix soon but I'm so glad I got the chance to watch this masterpiece on the big screen. For that, I'd like to say thanks to the Prince Charles Cinema and, more importantly, Martin Scorsese.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Interminable,"There's a great movie in here somewhere - the movie as is, with a runtime of three and a half hours - is about an hour too long and needs serious trimming. There are many scenes that feel unnecessary, providing nothing more than slight character depth and another death in the film.The de-aging effects are jarring - and they don't solve the issue of how these elderly men now talk and move in their ""younger body"" scenes. The movie would've been better served casting younger look-alike actors for those scenes and trusted the audience.As it is, it's difficult to follow and uninteresting. I'm a big fan of Scorcese and his work - the structure of this film shows his expert touch, but it's far too indulgent a film. It milks the most it can out of the setting, the leading actors, and the genre - without adding anything unique or interesting of its own.The film and the people within it seem like what you'll be at the conclusion of this film - tired.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Vintage Scorsese: Another classic,"Ever since I heard of this film and cast I awaited with eager anticipation.

You are taken on a big journey and experience a great deal of infamous mob history. This is a fantastic film from start to finish and this stellar cast hits it out of the park.Al Pacino steals the show and every scene he is in. We get an intimate look at the lives of Hoffa, Frank and a number of key figures over time. The beauty of this film is the depth and connections of all these figures. The Irishman brings history and organised crime to life.

The On Golden Pond of Mob Movies,"Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci together again for the first and most likely final time, it is more than likely their swan song as far as mob movies go anyway and what better way to bow out than the 3 and a half hour epic The Irishman? - which tells the story of Jimmy Hoffa and ostensibly answers one of the greatest mysterious of the 20th century - what happened to him - it is familiar ground for Scorsese with mobsters portrayed as devoted family men who are religious and fiercely protective of their families but who also spend their days ruthlessly killing people, but the story is is told well, is riveting to watch and of course the acting is phenomenal, aided by marvelous movie magic that deages the actors, some may think a 3 1/2 hour film is to long but it flew by for me, and being able to watch De Niro, Pacino and Pesci together was a gift, and if it is to be the final bow for them it was a in a movie worthy of their gifts, because the Irishman should be the odds on favorite to sweep the Oscars, but does it finally solve the mystery of what happened to Jimmy Hoffa? - well it is as good of an explanation as any and as Occam's razor holds, when there are multiple theories to explain a mystery, the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Looong and slooow-mo,"Scorsese sure knows how to create a story. He makes use of a great cast, and the idea of using old stars in the roles as much younger characters is tempting and fine, but watching a 75yo De Niro act as a 40yo becomes unvoluntarily ridiculous. Camera effects cannot create that illusion when the man walks and moves as a 75yo.
The plot is not bad with the near 80yo hitman telling the story of his life. However, the speed of narration is like watching the weather change, and after 1 hour you start looking at the progression bar to see how long is left. The movie is more than 3 hours but could easily have been cut to no more than 1 hour an a half. The last experience with a long-playing film was ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"" and here t
time just flew away. What a contrast this is. Pacino, Pesci and DeNiro do their best, which is uplifting, and generally speaking, acting, film shooting and plot are fine executions, but gosh it's old school in a not so desirable way.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Watch with an intermission,"3.5 hour runtime. Holy crap. I love that this film had enough to say that it needed that long, but by the end it felt like I was marathoning a TV show. This was compounded by the fact that it lacked any noticeable 3 act structure. Major downsides of The Irishman were its failure to fork some extra money over to CGI when it counted. I can remember a scene where a glass window breaks and it looked awful. Positives included a palpable sense of inclusion and family that comes with an Irishman being accepted into the ranks of the Italian mafia. We all long to see and feel this inclusion so it always seems to be an intrinsically good thing.

Nominated for 10 Oscars??? Psssht,"Just like many Scorsese fans, I was waiting for this movie to come out since the day I heard of it. I didn't know exactly what it would be, even though I knew who was going to star in it. But once I spent a grueling 3 and a half hours (divided into 2 days) I just found myself sleepy, bored, let down.Plot- The story follows the memory of an assassin that had something to do with the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. I think it's extremely drawn out, like, I was yawning an hour in. Doesn't matter how flashy SOME scenes can be, doesn't matter that we have the gangster actor aficionados of our lifetime on screen, and most importantly- it doesn't matter that it is directed by one of the finest filmmakers ever. It was just underwhelming. Scarface is 3 hours and feels like 2, just like Casino. I was bored.Characters/Acting- You know, I love DeNiro, but the guy never plays anyone but DeNiro. He's like a glamorized Seth Rogen at this point. I know the main cast is elderly, but dude, we get it. Pesci plays a quiet guy, barely hear him half the time. Pacino, on the other hand, kills it. He's the only guy I observed in admiration. Otherwise all the other characters could have been yanked right from a bad episode of the also highly overrated 'The Supranos.'Writing- It was good, nothing I remember though. Yada yada, bunch of tough guys talking. Some parts are tense near the end. Otherwise it's just kinda bland.Quality- Great cinematography, great editing, but I mean some parts weren't believable. There's a scene where DeNiro is kicking someone and it just made me laugh. Lazy stuff.Overall, I turned on this film being a solid Scorsese fan- I loved The Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Wolf Of Wallstreet, Taxi Driver, the George Harrison documentary. But this is seriously, immensely overrated. It's like an effect that diehard Kanye West fans experience- no matter what your favorite artist does, you love it, you praise it. I can finally say that Scorsese is capable of making not so impressive films. He should shut up about Marvel and make something super himself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Outstanding narrative feat.,"One of the longest awaited releases in recent memory, The Irishman is Marty Scorsese's mob magnus opus of this decade, something that was long overdue, not to mention him joining forces once again with former associates such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and first-time
collaborator, the magnificent Al Pacino. Scorsese returns to the genre in top form, handling narrative tasks in an extremely substantial manner, with minutious precise storytelling that seems so well-connected from beginning to end. Each scene is composed through a firm thread which stays strong throughout the film, never letting any scene go unnoticed or feel somewhat unremarkable. Each scene has its purpose, whether it is small or big, it ties the story together. The editing is also a marvel to behold, since it brings the narrative element to the highest of standards, prompting to make the viewer feel that the duration of the film isn't something to be preoccupied with as long as there is an excellent film in front of them. The film slowly cooks on low heat like a stew, slowly building up to the point of being done, and the final result is an absolute delight, a feast to the senses involved.The acting is first-class, supreme and superlative, as if there weren't enough adjectives to describe the immaculate performances of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino. Even the rest of the cast does a magnific job to keep the boat not only afloat but almost floating up in the air. The only thing that results a bit distracting is the de-aging effect, specially on De Niro, just like Will Smith on Gemini Man, specifically the area around the mouth, which is something special effects companies will have to improve to make it as close to reality as possible.Marty Scorsese and his friends came back for a monumental mob/political piece regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, proving that the Scorsese way is still efficient and highly regarded in 2019, where people can still appreciate movies of long duration, with nothing but a story to tell, supported by fine acting, and almost zero effects. The Irishman will only get bigger with time, as it will be regarded as one of Scorsese's finest works of his career, accumulated with efforts of such exceptional quality.

Could have been cut in half,"Don't expect the movie to be over the top. A lot of familiar faces, younger actors today can not hold up to the oldtimers of this movie. I'm watching it thinking the acting is great. It did drag out some and could have been cut down by just showing the key parts. I remember the Hoffa story well. Today the younger generation may not know who Hoffa was but, back in the day he was a well known, respected man. I'm not sure he deserved the respect I just know my Dad was a teamster and they stood tight together. I learned a lot from the movie and have to say, I do believe the story they filled in; It all makes sense.I live in Michigan and the Hoffa story comes up too much. Someone will make a false claim and the government goes and digs up someone's property to find nothing. What would make them think there is a body to find? Whomever did it is far too smart not to make sure it was never found. People tend to think that Union workers retire with a big fat pension and it's not true. They back out the social security they receive so they don't get all the pension they should have. That's because of misuse of the Pension funds as you will see in the movie.

"A very watchable, just another tough guy movie.","An entertaining film to watch if a ""bit"" on the uneconomical side.Maybe the last time we will get to see these actors together in a film and so that alone had some value for me.Pesci's performance was my favorite (though good supporting character acting all the way around) as he was appropriately understated, especially for him.Bob did his standard slightly reserved/diplomatic tough guy acting, which was probably appropriate for this character, in the situations he was in and based on Sheeran's character in the book.Al's portrayal of Hoffa didn't work for me, as the over-the-top bit (which I know Hoffa did quite a bit of) reminded me too much of Al's other roles. The Hoffa haircut seemed a bit weird on him, on the nitpick side. It's hard to believe that Hoffa was that cocky with the mob but supposedly, he at least came close to what we see here.The visual style disappointed me as I've come to expect to be able to feast on that in just about any Scorsese film. The scenes were well composed but nothing outstanding and I expect he toned down his usual flair so as to not interfere with the acting/stars or the story.Overall, the film did a very good job of telling the tale of the book and was also effective in showing how mundane all of the mob activities and ""shtick"" could be.In the end though, it's just another tough guy movie with lots of stars.

Scorsese's still got it,"This is as close as Scorsese will get to his old style, and yet keep a significant distance between what made films like goodfellas and casino fantastic.To call this a return to form is an insult to the master, who's last films have been nothing short of great and entertaining but only just scratching above the line of being true classics. The Irishman is well above that line, and it truly solidified itself amongst the ranks of Goodfellas in the last 30 minutes where Scorsese's plan goes from being a entertaining and engaging mess to a piece of art. To put it simply, it tells the story or betrayal and regret for 3 hours but only reveals what it means to Frank in the last 30. Pacino is a true actor in this film, embodying Hoffa and making people like De Niro and Pesci seem like backgrounds to which he can stand and perform. I want to commend Scorsese for giving us this film because no one asked him for masterpiece about ageing and becoming old. No one expected it from him to deliver a tale of this potency. But it becomes so clear that only an aged Scorsese could make a film like this. This is why we waited for The Irishman. This is why we needed another gangster film from him.

It's not an instant classic, like Goodfellas was for example, but it's still a powerful film full of great scenes.Some really good performances pepper the film, Pesci in particular, Pacino too but I was a little less blown away by De Niro...the cgi too threw me a bit because the actors all had old man bodies but not their faces. Still, you get used to it. Supporting roles are less impressive, Ray Romano is just himself and the guy playing Tony Pro is now forever going to be typecast as a bad Italian American impersonator.What made this less of a clear classic was that it was slightly bitty. It's as if at times they were forcing a scene into the film for context so it didn't flow...the guys seemed a little rusty too at times maybe because it's been so long since they made a film of this type which in all honesty should've been made a decade ago when they were all that little bit younger.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

De Niro - Pesci - Scorcese reunite after 24 years since Casino to recreate the same magic chemistry in a 180+ minute plus gangster epic.It's extremely surprising when you think the man who played the iconic Michael Corlene is only working with the master himself only in their late 70s. Al Pacino is the heart and soul of this movie, his performance is his best since Angels of America and he does it so effortlessly. All the actors whom we all loved in their prime return together once again to give us a one final goodbye.Unlike his previous mob movies, Scorsese doesn't direct a tough guy macho type mob film but shows us a carousel about the 30 year journey of one Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). The music is very subtle and the violence is very very minimal. Irishman is about loyalty, betrayal, parenting, politics, law enforcement, corruption and many more things. I wouldn't have minded a 5 hour running time honestly, this movie is flawless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Unbiased Review for Those Interested in Maybe Seeing It: It's Worth a Watch,"Any movie that gets hype and Oscar buzz on here is going to draw lots of biased people reviewing it. Before I watched The Irishman, it was hard to gage which reviews were legit and real and which were just biased, whether it was in a positive way or a negative way. First off, De Niro has made lots of controversial political speeches in recent years, which can affect how people view this, and then there's the sort of de-aging CGI that some people took issue with (Is that really enough to warrant a 1-2 star rating though? Is it that bad?); on the positive side, Scorcese lovers may give it an automatic 10 since he is one of their favorites, which goes on a lot in reviews (let's face it; Tarantino often gets a free pass and 10 ratings even in his erroneous films).So with all that out of the way, here would be my honest review for people who may be interested but on the fence about seeing The Irishman.The first 1 hour and a half is absolutely dazzlingly amazing. I want to go as far as to say that I actually liked it more than Goodfellas, but I would have to see them both again to confirm that. It is an absolute masterpiece for the first hour and a half, no doubt.And Joe Pesci- just hand him the Oscar right now. He gives what is in my opinion the absolute best performance in the movie. I liked him better in this role than his iconic role in Goodfellas, and he is truly outstanding. I was so glad that his character got so much screen time in this because he was by far my favorite, heavily outshining even both De Niro and Pacino. Those two are good, don't get me wrong, but Pesci is just stunning and deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, without question. It's one of the best performances in a mob movie I've ever seen. He has so much screen time, and in every single clip or image, he is ""perfect"". every look he gives, every line he delivers is nothing short of perfection.Even though De Niro and Pacino are very good in most of the scenes, I thought Pacino could have toned it down a little bit in some of his scenes. He does in fact give the old, vintage Pacino acting you have come to expect. It's not totally bad, but I would say he was the weakest link of the main actors, and I still love his movies and he is one of my favorite actors.DeNiro excels in the final half an hour of the movie, which sees him encounter old age and come to terms and closure with what he has done. This will probably at least get him a nomination for Best Actor.The final act (half hour or so) is worth sticking around for so if you get bored in the long run time, I recommend you stick around for it. It was a little sad and heartbreaking, but it was so well done, I really appreciated how Scorcese took the story to that ""place"", rather than only keep it more superficial.Now, as for the drawbacks or negatives of the movie: once the first two hours pass, the pacing really slows down (and the film somewhat gets watered down into some mafia movie clichés) and begins to feel a little bit generic. It is in fact true that many scenes could have been cut beyond that point, particularly redundant one-on-one conversation scenes between Hoffa, Ed Sheeran (The Irishman) and whoever they were meeting. Regardless, it's never ""bad"" per say, but it does become less entertaining beyond the two hour mark and is prolonged in a way that was probably unnecessary.Ultimately, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch one way or another. The CGI de-aging wasn't as much of a problem as some of the people who criticized it said. You do notice it at times, but you quickly get used to it and the story is strong enough that you lose focus of it.It's not perfect, as a whole (due to the length), but it is a ""good"" movie, nonetheless...and it takes you out of fantasy comic book land for those sick of those types of movies. You get some interesting historical events in this as well that matures the story for mature audiences.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
This should be a great movie,I love gangster movies and I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief when it comes to moves but these actors are just sooo old there's no way I can believe the story I'm being told. The forth wall is broken. This would have been a great movie with the same actors 20yrs ago or different actors. I was surprised to learn they'd used CGI to make the actors faces look younger but it didn't look right and watching De Nero walk you can tell he's an very old man. It's just not realistic. That's not to say these aren't great actors but they need to take senior roles now.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Goodfellas Turning Over in its Grave,"At an epic run-time of over three hours, you'd think director Martin Scorsese would make something more liken to an addictive limited cable series than an epic about absolutely nothing. It is, however, about someone, and that's Jimmy Hoffa played by a CGI-youthful Al Pacino, who, with Robert De Niro as sidekick ""house painter"" i.e. assassin Frank Sheeran, are involved in endless dialogue leading absolutely nowhere...Unlike Scorsese's mob classic GOODFELLAS, ironically playing-out like binge crime serials do now... with something to anticipate around every suspenseful corner... there's nothing to look forward to here except more and more conversations with De Niro on cruise control, and Pacino using a fake accent that's not only distracting but completely unnecessary.Narrated by a slightly more aged than he's already aged De Niro, rock-skipping through short, uneven portions of the past, the tech-rendered faces look somewhat young but the bodies are as stiff as genuine old fogies: like watching Redd Foxx as Fred Sanford wearing a 1930's-era James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson mask...Meanwhile, the continuous wrap-around section involves an afternoon drive with De Niro and Joe Pesci's powerful but overall pointless mobster Russell Bufalino, and there are a few new expository devices, perhaps to deviate from GOODFELLAS and CASINO: Like every mobster introduced with words flashing on the screen telling when and how they're eventually killed. It's not entirely clear why this happens other than to remind us who the movie's about, or that no one else actually matters...And yet, backed by the usual Scorsese jukebox of vintage rock/soul tunes while peppered with rushed bouts of ultra-violence, we learn even less about the doomed union leader than in Danny DeVito's limp Jack Nicholson as HOFFA biopic: proof that the man's legacy has nothing to do with his story, because he obviously doesn't have one worth telling, or watching.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Thank you Scorsese!,"I want to take the chance to thank Martin Scorsese for making The Irishman. Not only did he revive the Mafia Film which was dead for such a long time. He also made it possible for us to see our heroes together on the big screen again. Just by considering the cast, the movie deserves big respect.But fortunately the plot did not disappoint either. It was no Expendables movie for instance where the cast was great but the content missed somehow. Scorsese did it just right and proved that he earnes his title as master. These goodfellas such as Deniro, Pacino and Pesci did a great job. In a time where the Film industry is dominated by super hero movies or senseless sequels it is an honour to watch The Irishman.I could have sit there for another 3 hours. For a long time I was not so focused, so thrilled by a movie. For now I want to rate the irishman 9 out of 10 possible stars. After watching a documentary about the whole incident and rewatching The Irishman, rating it with 10/10 is quite possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Another Great Movie from Scorsese and Friends,"The Irishman belongs firmly in the Martin Scorsese canon. Like Casino, Goodfellas and The Departed Scorsese's The Irishman is a film telling the story of Mob related history, this time, the life and times of Jimmy Hoffa. It's a lengthy film, 3 1/2 hours but worth every minute. Dinero is perfectly cast, along with Pacino and Harvey Keitel. Joe Pesci delivers an Oscar worthy performance, in fact I expect this film to receive multiple Oscar nods. It's a great movie, great cast and great production. It's well worth the running time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Twenty years earlier,"Another great movie by Martin Scorsese. This is the ideal director to portray in the cinema, the dynamic period of the Mafia in America. But Scorsese should have made this film twenty years earlier, with the same actors. We can only imagine how dynamic this film would be if De Niro, Pacino and Pesci were twenty years younger. Even so, the film is very good and sheds some light on a very dark period for America.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A heartwrenching masterpiece,"Just seeing DeNiro and Pacino joining forces on the silver screen again is enough to bring on the chills. And then there's Scorsese. And Pesci. Almost as if the stars have aligned to create the perfect trip down memory lane. A, possibly last, chance to see the giants of old act their hearts out against one another.And truth be told, I didn't expect much more of this film. Some great nostalgia. Possibly a punch to the gut as I realize how time flies. And that would have been fine with me. I would still have paid to see it.But it's clear as day that's not enough for them. Because this isn't just nostalgic nod to the past, but a masterpiece in its own right.The film centers around DeNiro's character Frank, an old mob hitman telling us about his past. Of how he got to work for the Russell Bufaino (Pesci). Of his friendship and ultimate betrayal of Jimmy Hoffa (superbly portraited by Pacino). And of his regrets in regards of to how his children came to view him and his crimes.The three-and-a-half hour of runtime may scare some, but to me it was worth every second of it. The main trio of actors are excellent. As is the rest of the cast. And the camerawork. And most everything else; the suspense is high, dialogue is sharp and progress steady. But most of all I'm awed by the underlining sense of dread. The almost tangible fear of ending up old and alone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Not quite perfect,"I enjoyed this movie. The story, writing, and filming was excellent. The primary negative with the film is I found myself constantly confused on the age of the main characters. Scorsese, presumably through his loyalty to Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino, chose to use makeup and wardrobe to present the age of the three main characters. While I am no film expert and do not even feel comfortable second guessing Scorsese, my experience would have been better served if they had used different actors for the younger stages of the main characters. Is the main bad? No. But it was not near as it could have been for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

The last of an era,"The Irishman is, quite frankly, a masterpiece. Plain and simple. What do you expect when you have Joe Pesci, Robert de Niro, and Al Pacino all under the guidance of Scorsese.
The anti-aging of de Niro in early sections of the film have caused some issues among reviewers, but in my opinion it shouldn't sway you from loving this movie. Every actor and actress looks at home in their role. The little music approach allows for the story to be told in a more real atmosphere, it relies on dialogue and camera angles to build tension and expel it. This film, all round, is a masterpiece. The 209 minutes runtime should not faze you, as this movie is not sluggish or boring. This movie is a 10/10 for me, and a must watch to all movie fans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

It'd be interested to see if all the people saying that would say the same if they went in blind without knowing it was a Scorcese flick, though you'd clearly know it was a Scorcese film pretty quickly, the hallmarks are all there. For me though he has made several better movies than this in the past.The length didn't particularly bother me but I also don't feel like it was necessary to tell the story. It was a bit indulgent.I like all the performances but the age thing was a real problem for me. De Niro's character being referred to as kid when he already looked about 65 was testing and there was a scene where he beats a shopkeeper up where he moved like an 80 year old which was just plain silly.Good but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A great classic - Especially within its genre,"What makes the Irishman such a good movie is the slow unfolding of the very simple tale it tells. Scorsese leisurely takes us through three hours of character and world building, aided with the leisurely attitudes of Robert DeNiro's Frank and Joe Pesci's Russel. Both are measured in how they act, charming, quietly confidence and are almost reserved compared to many of the other explosive and bombastic personalities of the mobsters around them.They become familiar friends to the audience, and their calmer attitudes humanise the violent actions that come with the life of a mobster and make the film engaging. It is easy for the audience to put themselves in these characters shoes, and all the more crushing third act as a result. Al Pacino's performance is also excellent. The final scenes of the film gets its power from the death of the mob and gangster films in general, as well as it being a swan song for the main trio.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Are you kidding?,"Good story. A nice snapshot of history.
But they made a big deal about how fantastic DiNero transitioned from 30 to 40 to 60 to 70 years old. All l saw was a 76 year old, overweight DeNero with terrible makeup throughout the entire film. It wasn't only laughable it was ridiculous. The ONLY time he looked normal or believable was when he was playing a 76 year old. It really ruined it for me and some friends. Why didn't they just go with younger look-a-likes as in The Godfather.

Nicholson Was So Much Better,"All right look. I enjoy watching the occasional films and shows about mob/gangster activity once in a while.

Sigh... then there is this.. this three and a half hour THING..Putting aside the ridiculous CGI that looked like nothing but a bunch of gratuitous botox injections, this film sucked in virtually every aspect besides production. 165 million for THIS??? De Niro and Pacino played themselves yet again (is there a record for doing this sort of thing?) The script was soooooo poor. My God! How many times can these characters go back and forth while saying THE SAME THING AND NOT PROGRESSING THE PLOT! Was there a plot?? De Niro must be the most overrated actor in recent memory. The scene where he stomps on a grocer's hand had me in tears. He looked like a geriatric who was desperately trying not to lose his balance. Scorsese is definitely partially to blame for this. How that entire scene did not fall to the cutting room floor is beyond me. De Niro has the same acting style since the 80s. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth up. Eyebrows up, corners of the mouth down. Then he lowers his eyebrows and does the same thing. He laughs the same way as well. This is acting? I already mentioned that Pacino was Pacino in this. Good God was he ever. He was 100% Pacino and 0% Hoffa which equates to PaSTINKO! Aren't these actors supposed to actually TRY to be like the characters they are portraying? Hoffa was a real person. There is plenty of footage of the man talking, interviews, etc. What were Pacino and Scorsese thinking? Scorsese just lets Pacino HAM it up scene after scene after scene. Pacino is another actor who I find overrated as hell. He did some decent work in the 70s but he has also coasted since And Justice For All. The man just yells and looks bizarrely awkward while doing it. Staring off into space while bug eyed. Three and a half hours of this. Boring scenes, boring dialogue ""Did you talk to him? He did that? Talk to him again. Set up a meeting. You think so? Yeah. I dunno. You really think so? I dunno. Lets think about it. I thought about it. Really? Yeah. I think so."" And on.. and on.. and on.... Was Scorsese on a mission to murder the Mob genre with this? These cats need to retire. Just call it a career.. Quite honestly this was extremely painful to sit through. I had to break this thing up into three parts. This film offers nothing but a bunch of boring scenes and an awkward geriatric clown trying to pass himself off as Jimmy Hoffa. Shame on you Marty. You let this happen.Hoffa was done already. Danny De Vito directed Jack Nicholson in 1992. You want a real glimpse of how Hoffa actually talked and acted like? Watch that instead.

"Watch the Movie, The story, Directing, and the emotion in the characters","Robert De Niro excels at playing closed-off, unreachable characters-hard men who might seem a bit dull if you met them for the first time, but have inner lives that they rarely let anyone see, and are mysteries to themselves. De Niro was 75 when he played yet another of those characters in Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman,"" which feels like a summation of a rich subset of De Niro's long career. You feel every one of De Niro's years in his haunting performance, as well as those of Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel, who are ""de-aged"" for flashbacks via computer-generated imagery as well as analog makeup and hairpieces. You also feel the years in the mostly younger supporting cast (including Bobby Cannavale, Kathrine Narducci, Stephanie Kurtzuba, Gary Basaraba and Stephen Graham as gang bosses, spouses, and union leaders), who age forward. Adapted by screenwriter Steve Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") from Charles Brandt's book I Heard You Paint Houses, and clocking in at three-and-a-half hours, the movie is an alternately sad, violent, and dryly funny biography of Frank Sheeran, a World War II combat veteran who became a Mafia hitman and then a union leader, and who had a long, at times politically fraught friendship with Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). And you feel them in Scorsese's direction, which is more contemplative than his gangster movie norm (at times as meditative as his religious pictures), and which deftly shifts between eras, using dialogue and voice-over to make the time-jumps seamless. The frame-within-a-frame-within-a-frame structure is one of the most complex of Scorsese's career. But it's realized with such grace by Scorsese, Zaillian and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker that it never feels fussy or overdetermined, gliding from one thought-path to another as a recollecting mind juxtaposes the distant past, the recent past, and the present. . ""The Irishman"" keeps with that tradition. The opportunity to sit with the movie later is the main reason to see it. For all its borderline-vaudevillian verbal humor and occasional eruptions of ultraviolence (often done in a single take, and shot from far away) it feels like as much of a collection of thought prompts and images of contemplation as Scorsese's somber religious epics ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" ""Kundun,"" and ""Silence.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

A Moden Masterpiece,"Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a masterpiece that best epitomizes the monster film genre that was revitalized by Hollywood New Wave filmmakers throughout the 1970s-90s. Films such as The Godfather, A Bronx Tale, Scarface, Goodfellas, Bonnie and Clyde, Mean Streets, etc. At its heart, The Irishman is a story about the long term effects of being involved in the world those films listed above portray. Instead of cutting on a Henry Hill character smiling at the camera and proceeding to title cards revealing the fate of our characters. The Irishman is structured around those end title cards. Even at times having text appear next to random mobsters stating their eventual demise, which is genius by the way. By doing this, The Irishman is saying there's an alternative route to life, where gratitude and a sense of completion awaits, that can be taken in contrast to short term pleasure. It's this thematic nuance that makes films such as Citizen Kane and Once Upon A Time In America so revered. In essence, The Irishman is the film The Godfather Part III wanted to be. The Irishman is the perfect curtain call for a type of mobster film that helped reshape cinema in the late 20th century. While they'll be similar films made genre wise. I think the next generation of filmmakers, including myself, should encourage the making of films that deconstructing current activities which resemble or are a direct result of mob idealism. Corporate, Political, and Infrastructure. All while paying homage to the mobster pictures that came before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

"Great, but far from perfect.","Let me be clear, it's very difficult reviewing this movie without taking into consideration the names in it. There's obviously bias, there has to be. This movie is like an end of an era, and it features all the actors that made that era as amazing as it was. However, it's clear they're all past their prime, and it's clear they're all just a small fraction of what they used to be. Pesci is great, it might actually be his best role ever, unfortunately, he gets relatively little screen time and plays a side-role. Pacino is good, but overacts a lot. De Niro? Oh boy... what did they do to him. I really, really don't like how CGI-heavy this movie looks, and it's pretty obvious when you know how these actors look in person and how old they are, and then compare that to how they look in the movie... BUT DE NIRO, I've seen animated movies in the last few years that seem less CGI than his face. First of all, his eyes are stupidly blue, like...impossibly blue, you've never seen anyone in your life with eyes as blue as his in the movie. Combine that with the fact that almost every scene involving him is a close up (for a reason I'm getting to now), and it's very hard to ignore.Now... De Niro is 76 years old, but in the movie they attempt to make him look young... and it REALLY, REALLY doesn't work. Any scene with him walking or doing anything but sitting is really awkward. He looks and moves like an old man. His hands and fingers are all deformed like an old mans hands, but he has a CGI face of a 40 year old. His assassinations look awkward, the way he holds the guns, the way he shoots, the way he fights..looks exactly like a 76 year old doing it.So CGI is pretty badly masking what it's trying to mask... another bad part is the gore. We all know mobster movies are full of blood, and this was no exception. There are plenty of people shot on camera, with blood splattering around, with bullet holes shown from close by, etc. The issue is, THEY ALL LOOK FAKE. BADLY FAKED, bad CGI, like in a low budget film, not a 160 million one.As far as the story goes, it's good, it's what you expect from a mobster/political movie, it's slow, long, but doesn't feel like it's dragging. The issue is you know how it's gonna end, and that's always a problem with movies based on a true story.To conclude, as an homage to these great names, it's a decent send-off. Don't expect a movie like Goodfellas, this ain't it. This is a much darker movie, focused much more on death, on people aging. There's not as much ""mobster romance"" as in other similar movies, it's more a miserable story showing a movie realistic picture of what it's like to be a mobster, rather than focusing on expensive cars, suits, hotels, food, jewellery, etc. It's the most HUMAN of all mobster movies I can think of. Still, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit disappointed, because it's NOT as good as it would have been and could have been had it been filmed 20 years ago. And that's sad. Not only because of the movie, but because of the actors. Watching this makes it hard not to feel like it's a good bye.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

I know Scorcese admires DeNiro a lot and has a lot of experience of working with him, but that doesn't make him the right cast.

The perfect closure.,"Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. Goodfellas, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street happen to be movies I love rewatching. So when plans of him making another mob movie with Pesci, De Niro, and, finally, Pacino came up, I was excited.I think I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It is by no means a by-the-numbers gangster movie. It's a massively reflective and introspective piece that also doesn't happen to be a nuanced satire. It's, well, sad. And that's the quality that makes this movie a winner for me. The idea that Frank Sheeran was most likely in a limbo of thoughts as he inched closer to his end was so beautifully expressed that it might just make you a little emotional.Despite being 3.5 hours, I don't think that even a single minute was unwarranted. I wasn't bored. The first hour was good, felt a lot like Goodfellas and just showing the trappings of being in a crime family. The second hour was even better, focusing on the dynamic between Hoffa and Sheeran, and De Niro, Pacino and Pesci reached a new peak this time. Of course, it was made all the more exciting by the plot.The final stretch, however, is everything. It should just be the basis for an Oscar for De Niro. I mean, sure, Joaquin Phoenix was great, but De Niro in the last hour of the movie was absolutely phenomenal.I think Scorsese is at that point of his life where he's looking at the various ways he can contribute to cinema. He's made excessive stuff, fun stuff, thrilling stuff. This is unique. It manages to be both fun and introspective without being too broody at the expense of boring people with long shots (I'm looking at you, Tarantino). It reminded me a lot of El Camino, which was similar in terms of what it wanted to be, but nowhere as good as The Irishman. This isn't saying that the movie is good because it's Scorsese at all, I've been bored by some really famous movies before. This movie is objectively good. And I can see why it's not a miniseries.Thank you, Martin Scorsese and Netflix. 2nd favorite movie this year so far, behind Parasite.(Just one problem: this deserved the theater treatment. Totally. Gorgeously shot.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
The film will test your patience and rewards you in the end. Al Pacino is fabulous.,"When I watched The Godfather pt II, I thought to myself Vito was better than Michael and De Niro was better than Pacino. This time however it was Al Pacino who turned out better, more entertaining and simply Al. Nothing to take away from Joe Pesci tough, who gives a performance that would go down in history as one of his best.
Taking about De Niro, he is great as usual, great enough to earn him an Oscar nomination in the lead actor category. The De-Aging did do some damage but Bob seems to have fought through it.Talking about the film, it tests your patience and rewards you in the end. The entire character arc of our protagonist come to unfold in the last half hour of the movie and it feels satisfactory, it feels right.One may complain that the screenplay is slow but I felt it suits the theme of the movie. Scorsese refuses to miss out on even a single detail. The cinematography seems flawless.It's the story, the like of one you expect from a Scorsese - De Niro film, that would keep you focused all throughout the 3 and a half hours of runtime.Now, don't waste your time reading this, go and watch the damn Movie.

Truly Unforgettable,"I was fortunate enough to see this film in a cinema several weeks ago and I revisited it again on Netflix. For 3 1/2 hours I was taken on an unforgettable journey with these amazing actors bringing these characters to life.
The film really takes it time to delve deep into these characters lives and relationships and that was appreciated and made for such a powerful and moving experience. It's a sprawling tale spanning many decades and events in history.
No surprise that the film is so well made. Everything is pitch perfect from the camera work, music, costumes and production design.
Needless to say the acting is phenomenal. Al Pacino easily does his best work for at least 20 years as Jimmy Hoffa and reminds us how great he is. Joe Pesci is truly outstanding, such a different character to what he is typically know for but he is unforgettable in this role. But towards the end of the film it hit me how great Robert DeNiro can be. The film centers on his character and he carries it with such a masterful performance. Also one of his best roles for at least 20 years. I hope they all receive the recognition they deserve. It's such a special treat to see them share so much quality screen time together in a film deserving of their talents. It's cinematic history.
The film is so dense and has so much to say. For days after seeing this film I couldn't stop thinking about it and the more I thought about it the more I liked it. I think it's typical of Martin Scorsese's movies that you need to give them time to digest to truly appreciate what he's created. I found the extended epilogue to be really haunting and heartbreaking. For me that's what really brought this whole saga together and realised what the filmmakers were trying to say. I found myself reflecting on my own life and legacy and it's definitely changed my view on life. Very few films I've ever seen had such a profound effect.
I loved this movie. To me it stands shoulder to shoulder with the best crime films ever made and really is one of Martin Scorsese's best films. He's created something really incredible here and it's already one of my all time favorite movies. A masterpiece and an instant classic that will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
A bloated gangster movie,"Its such a shame that this highly anticipated gangster epic from King of the Genre, Martin Scorcese, was so dragged out beyond necessity. If this had been compressed into 120 minutes, it would be more highly regarded by the reviewer.Also, it felt like some if De Niro's scenes were given the odd on acceotable takes that 30 years ago, would have been canned. Pacino is excellent however, giving a powerhouse perfornance as the stubborn, yet ill fated Jimmy Hoffa, whom De Niro's character befriends.Pesci feels quite limited here (by self choice) but still worthy of anyone's time.Alot of the characters here seem wasted also, specifically with the calibre of Keitel on show. Paquin is another who is almost muted in terms of script dialogue.The story wears itself out by the finale, with what I felt to be an anti climax and very disappointing overall.I can always tell if I like a movie or not by whether or not I would watch again.On this occasion, sadly not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Gets better every single time,"The first time I saw this movie, the runtime was intimating and I watched the first half being bored out of my mind. I finally finished it months later on Netflix, and I thought it was really good.But the film continued to stick in my mind, and I decided to give it another watch and it went from ""really good"" to ""pretty great"". And just a couple of days ago I watched it for the 3rd time in the past 3 years, and now I officially see this movie as a near-masterpiece.Almost every single thing about this movie is perfect, the acting is amazing, the script is well-structured, the editing is superb (which is usual for a Scorsese movie), and the score is incredibly underappreciated as one of its best elements. The blues music that is used for the theme adds a wonderful sense of dread that continues to play throughout the movie.The usual complaints about this movie are ""boring"", ""too long"", ""special effects bad"", and ""body language is distracting"". I can only really agree with one of those, and that being the body language is very distracting at certain points throughout the movie. Scorsese has cast his favorite actors in parts they were too old to play before, but it stands out in a film where sometimes the characters are moving quite a bit. But, I can't agree with the rest, ""boring"" is such a dumb claim to me that really stands out just how short people's attention spans are (not just young people too). Also, ""too long"", is an even worse claim because every single element and scene in this movie is purposefully in the film to be built upon later. But, again people don't realize that, and just want simple and obvious payoffs they get from every blockbuster nowadays.But despite the complaints about the movie, the movie on its own is terrific. There are scenes in this movie that will stick with me forever, this is a genuinely more mature work than any of the other Scorsese mafia/gangster films (although I like/love them all). The ideas of past mistakes, forgiveness, and living a financially fulfilling, yet empty life is beautifully woven into this film. It is very clear that this is a love letter from Scorsese to not only these types of movies but movies in general. Although Scorsese has another movie coming out and will most likely continue to make movies in the future this movie feels like a finality to his career, he put his absolute all into this movie, and Pacino, Pesci, and De Niro were right there along with him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

What could have made this movie better than a 3/10 hack job.,"Martin Scorse's new NetFlix movie, ""The Irishman"" was, to a certain
extent, a national event. After all Martin Scorsese, like Woody Allen,
and some others are national treasures and it is not everyday that
one of our national treasures puts out a virtually free movie that all
Americans can see and dicussion - a national cinematic forum to make
some kind of moralistic, artistic or at least patriotic statement. Instead,
blah, nothing, boring, and on top of all the negatives, there is nothing
to really verify that much of it or any of it was true.This could have been a really good movie if they had just shifted the
plot and conflict to be more about Hoffa, who no Americans know about,
and whose history affected so many Americans. Americans should know
a lot more about history but especially a lot more about this history because
it has affected them so negatively. Few know who Jimmy Hodda was, and
or course nothing about the lying selfish criminal scumbag liar no one can
trust, Frank Sheeran.Since the framework of the story was mostly based on a kind of nonsensical
story from Frank, who is the book written about him seems to be all about
Frank trying to take credit for every big Mafia crime or hit.It seems like it would have been better to contrast the soul and crimes
of Frank Sheeran with the soul and crimes of Jimmy Hoffa. Hoffa was
no saint, ( or was he ) and consorted with and ultimately got run over,
chewed up and spit out by the mob by using them to stand up to the 0.01%
who were beating up. ripping off, stealing from the middle class of
America. What else could he do? ... or we never would have
heard of him or the Teamsters.I don't think the writers of this movie were skilled enough to
tell that story, so they just re-did Casino and Goodfellas.America was traumatized by the assassinations of the 60's
and 70's and as we can all see from the path of the country,
the bad guys won. They took over the unions, screwed over
the middle class, took their money, made them pay the taxes
for the rich, made then fight their evil wars, and bought up
the media and the news, bought up the military contractors,
bought up the drug and pharma, and now we are all paying
for it ... and dying for it, thanks to stupid sell-out, scumbags,
creeps like Frank Sheeran, the Mafia, etc.In fact you can really say pretty catagorically that this was
a crappy film because it was situated so close to the rudders
and currents and captains of American history - and yet missed
the whole point to pander to a stupid unverified story about what
happened to Jimmy Hoffa and the minutia of Frank Sheeran's
evil life.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Marvel of cinema for you guys!,"I know what people want to see in a review of a movie like this. They want to hear these word: poetry, impactful, epic saga etc.This movie is way ahead than all of these. It tells a story, sketches a part of lives of the characters.If you haven't watched legendary movies of Martin Scorsese or Robert De Niro or Al Pacino, this is your time to sit back and watch this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
it's what it is... nothing more,"I watched this movie in one sitting. The pacing is good, the story is decent and the starring actors are literally legends of our time. Still, I don't think it's a masterpiece.I still vividly remember some scenes, storylines and characters from the Goodfellas and the Godfather. In my opinion, this is what seperates masterpieces and cult movies from decent movies. This movie is like a Michael Phelps or an Usain Bolt race in which the hero wins the event effortlessly. It is still worth to watch, it is still enjoyable yet you can't remember anything from that race to make it a memorable experience throughout your life. The plot of the movie is enough to make it a decent movie yet it doesn't give much to top-notch stars to create a masterpiece. Scenario, acting and production values are just interesting enough to prevent the film of being bland.It's what it is... Worth to watch but not a must-watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
It felt like homework,"Sometimes you can't go home again. With ""The Irishman"" director Martin Scorsese takes one too many trips to the mafia well. Watching this movie often feels like you're watching a summer reunion tour of a bunch of old rockers but not nearly as fun. ""The Irishman"" does have some nice moments but it goes on forever. It needed some serious script editing. It often feels like Scorsese and company were picking up scraps from other (better) gangster movies. As far as the performances go, they weren't so hot. Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci all have a couple of good moments but they also seem to be on auto-pilot much of the time. As far the CGI goes, De Niro looked more ill than young in those scenes. Netflix claims that they spent zillions on this production but it doesn't look like it. It has the cheap look of a made-for-tv movie (which is what it is). At the end of the day, ""The Irishman"" isn't that good. It ends up dragging down the batting average of all the talent involved.

Distinguishing between art and personal taste: The Irishman as case study,"When it comes to art, a fundamental distinction must be made. On the one hand, there is the quality of a work of art and on the other hand, personal taste. We tend to confuse both concepts, but they must be understood differently. The quality of a book, a painting or a film is independent of the tastes of the spectator. People are usually willing to admit that they like a bad movie. Interestingly, we have a harder time accepting that we don't like a great movie.'The Irishman' is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. It is obviously inspired by other major works of cinema such as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and 'The Godfather', but, especially towards its end, it achieves something new, original and different. When I had just finished watching it my reaction was. ""It's good but it's not that great."" And as the days passed I realized that the dialogues, the characters, the shots... Everything had been irretrievably etched in my memory. This modern classic had marked me forever. It was then that I realized that it was one of the best films I have seen recently, an elegy to an entire film culture, an in-depth study of friendship, family, old age, mortality, human psychology, the tragic dissolution of basic human bonds, guilt, betrayal and fragmentation of personal relationships. In short, about everything that constitutes the human being. A Godfather for the 21st century. With a formidable script, the film brings together some of the greatest actors of their generation under impeccable direction and fantastic staging. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino disappear into and become their characters in a masterclass of acting, showing the nuances and complexities of Frank Sheeran, Russell Bufalino and Jimmy Hoffa respectively. More than a year later, my thoughts on this film remain unchanged. The film is rich in themes, visual techniques and symbols. One of them is silence. Sometimes 'The Irishman' expresses itself through silences. This characterizes Frank's daughter, as she conveys the truth with a single glance. She sometimes does not speak because it is not necessary. Her powerful silence already evokes endless sensations and is more lethal than a bullet to the head.Contrary to what its detractors may want to believe, the movie doesn't get long either. Thanks to the agile dialogues, the 3 and a half hours fly by in a sea of perfectly crafted images and immerse us in a drama of epic proportions. Its length is itself a reflection of the theme of the passage of time that this film so skillfully deals with. The film loses its character as a work of fiction to some extent and becomes a reality. It wants the viewer to feel the passage of time. It wants us to see how one hour is succeeded by another equally fleeting one. It wants to make us feel how life goes by, wants to directly involve us in the world of Bufalino, Sheeran and Hoffa. All of this culminates in a superb ending that tells us about the decadence and consequences of a life of crime and that ends up perfectly intertwining the three chronological planes, and closing the arches of the main characters in a profoundly satisfying conclusion, ""a noble wreck in ruinous perfection"", in the words of Lord Byron.Scorsese won the Oscar for The Departed, a great piece work, but he did not receive it for either Taxi Driver or Goodfellas. With The Irishman, he has made a film that is at that height. Regardless of the awards, I am happy to say that The Irishman stands as one of the very best films of 2019, and that has been an extraordinary year for cinema (Endgame, Once upon a time in Hollywood, Parasite, Joker...). I honestly do not understand what minimally convincing arguments can be made against this film. Although a 7.8 on Imdb is a good grade, it does not do justice to this exceptionally polished artistic artefact.For my part, I try as hard as I can to differentiate personal tastes and quality and I affirm that The Irishman is cinema with capital letters... Whether we like it or not.PS.: A similar logic applies to Imdb reviews themselves. The webpage is asking readers to evaluate if they found the review 'helpful', not whether the individual reader agrees with the reviewer's content or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"

Overall a good feel but lacks the icing like Casino or Good fellas,The flavour of the movie is like a cake you expect to be great and has a good enough taste to make you feel ok but lacks the icing on top of it like the older classical (cakes) movies. The Irishman I thought would have an Irish accent but nope it was a full tried and tested rehash of older gangsta movies that have worked in the past. I think that's what disappointed me is the fact the plot and storyline have been used too many times and it's getting worn out. The acting was great but the split and storyline have been reused with a few tweaks here and there.

A true classic for fans of Scorsese,"This movie is not for everyone, it's slow and meticulous and it makes you feel like you're right there.

Strong writting, masterful directing, beautiful cinematography and topnotch performances are some of the things that make this movie live up to the high expectations. Despite the old-time-favorite gangster style of Scorsese, which is so entertaining to watch, it has a darker vibe because all the characters really suffer the consequences of their actions. It also has it's moments of comedy which are really funny. The only problem i had is that it became more depressing than i needed at some points.

It would've been a good movie with a younger cast,The cast is too old and it spoils the whole thing. It's not just De Niro and Pacino everyone in this film is old. Even the milkman. I guys they did it to make the protagonists fit in but it makes the whole thing look eerie. It's like your watching a parody or something. You're seeing De Niro play with his daughter and you can't but thing that he's too old to be starting a family. You see some people song doing some job and you think how old are they?I don't have anything against old people they have a place in movies playing old people but you can't have an 80 year old playing Jimi Hofa's bodyguard or some kid who just got into the mafia.

Al Pacino the Great,"What's special about 'The Irishman'? With its three and a half long playtime, this is certainly not just another Netflix flick. No, instead 'The Irishman' demands your attention from the second it starts till the second it ends. You'll find no hand holding or plot exposition here (other than the trademarked Scorsese VO of course), this is pure, unadulterated storytelling from the best in the business.Thanks to the latest and greatest de-aging tech, we follow Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran as he begins his career for the Bufalino family. There he meets Russel Bufalino, played by Joe Pesci and things start to unravel.While De Niro and Pesci never miss a beat, Al Pacino somehow manages to steal every scene he is in.

Add it to the pantheon of great crime dramas,"On the Waterfront. The Godfather. Once Upon a Time in America. Heat. The Departed. Some of the best movies ever made are set in the seedy criminal underworld. It's a great vehicle for drama and Martin Scorsese is the undisputed master of the genre. Having said all that, I was a little skeptical of The Irishman before I watched it. Its run time of 3 1/2 hours is intimidating and there was a lot of publicity about the de-aging CGI used for De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino, all of whom were more than 74 years old at the time of filming.The run time turned out not to be an issue for me and that is saying a lot. I have to exercise discipline to sit through most 90 minute movies now that I have become so jaded from endless repetition of tropes like jump scares, time travel, toothy monsters, choreographed fights and gratuitous sex scenes. The Irishman is long, but it doesn't wear on your patience, and we should be glad such movies are still being made.The results of the de-aging CGI were mixed. On the positive side, it looked realistic enough and there were no uncanny valley moments. The downside is that it only goes so far. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino always looked considerably older than the ages of the men they were portraying, and the look didn't change much over the course of the main part of the story arc, which spanned 15 - 20 years.One could also quibble about casting choices. The very Italian Pacino looks nothing like the German/Irish Hoffa who was actually born in rural Indiana. It is also hard to see how young Peggy (Lucy Gallina) became older Peggy (Anna Paquin) and the mid-30's Anna Paquin looked too old to be playing the early 1970's Peggy, who would have only been in her 20's. It would be a fair criticism to say that the casting was all over the place and was at its roots a love letter from Scorsese to his old friends and not dictated by what the real-life characters would suggest. Nevertheless, the old pros gave their usual great performances and you will just have to suspend your disbelief a little bit more than usual when it comes to casting.There isn't a lot for women to do in The Irishman, and while it is true that career criminal is mostly a male gig, it is easy to see how women might be annoyed at the overwhelmingly male presence in the movie. One can't help but think that more could have been done, and that is coming from a guy who won't be bingeing the Watchmen series anytime soon.Now that the criticisms are done, it is worth repeating that The Irishman is just a great movie. The performances are great. The writing and directing are great. The criminal underworld setting is a field day for high drama and themes of family, loyalty and morality. The 3 1/2 hour run time makes it a slow burn for sure, but that just means there is more to love. Yet it isn't simply another mafia movie. All of the characters and events that I bothered to research seemed to be accurately portrayed in the movie. I don't know how much artistic license was taken, but I didn't find any obvious discrepancies. And while the words of a psychopath like Frank Sheeran certainly need to be taken with a boulder of rock salt, his confessions haven't been disproved from what I read on the subject.In summary, if you like the genera, then The Irishman really is a must-see. It really is that good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
Geriatric Goodfellas,"The Irishman IS entertaining. On the other hand, it comes off as a Goodfella's retread. If you go back and watch the 'Mafia' movies of the last 20 years or so, same actors same story line, but different character dynamics. Difference between those movies and 'The Irishman'?, Pacino, Pesci, De Niro, Keitel, they play strong characters In those movies. In 'The Irishman', they were all weak Caricatures of those roles. To me they were, Too old, & too unbelievable to be in those ('The Irishman' ) younger roles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Crime"
"""Three And A Half Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back!""","I can probably sum this film up in about three words: overlong, grim and boring.My family will tell you I'm a big Scorsese fan (Goodfellas is one of my absolute favourites!) but I was really disappointed by his latest directive outing. The genius behind Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The King Of Comedy (to name a few) has presented us with a monotonous slug of a film: The Irishman.I got a big kick out of seeing my acting heroes (DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel...) doing what they're best at doing and the attention to set detail was spot on (as always with Scorsese) but apart from that, I found little to like about The Irishman.The CGI was passable; I didn't think it was great but I didn't think it was terrible. The main problem (for me) was that DeNiro is trying to sound like 30-year old with the voice of a nearly 80-year old.As someone who's read Charles Brandt's I Heard You Paint Houses (the book that the film is based on), I was really struck by how much story Scorsese and Zaillian left out of the script and film. Almost all of Frank Sheeran's young life is glossed-over and people who don't know who Jimmy Hoffa was will be left almost none the wiser. If you really want to know who Jimmy Hoffa was and want to see a film about him that is both gripping and moving, I'd recommend Dany DeVito's Hoffa (1992). The film is not only shorter (by a whole hour and a half) but holds a cast that actually resembles the real people they're based on. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with The Irishman's cast but Al Pacino resembles none of Hoffa's characteristics or mannerisms. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is a virtual carbon copy of Hoffa's restless, volatile nature and squat, bulldog features.If this film were a piece of music, it would be a funeral dirge. The usual excitement of a Scorsese narrative is replaced with a prosaic confession spread-out over three and a half hours. It's not soulful or meaningful but dry and barren of any emotion. Maybe that's what Scorsese intended but when I sit down for a three hour film, I intend to be moved and gripped. The Irishman did neither. My advice? Watch Hoffa instead!But what do I know?

Near perfect,"Scorsese has done it again. He has delivered another brilliant film, not without its flaws though cause it does feel like a slight let down at times.The film is extremely ambitious and clocking in at a whopping 3 hours 29 minutes, it doesn't always prove it's necessity to be that long although I loved every minute. The only real flaw I have is that it doesn't have that style and excitement previous Scorsese films have.The Irishman is arguably the most mature Scorsese film to date. And it's a refreshing take on the genre. It's much of a reflective, more bleaker tone to it than the glamorous mob films. Scorsese paired with Shoomaker is a match made in heaven. They are both incredible here.The performances are brilliant. Robert De Niro gives his finest performance since Casino. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are awesome as well, both who are outstanding. Supporting cast are brilliant as well. The CGI is noticable at times but you quickly don't notice after a while.I think it's definitely a film which needs to be rewatched cause I'm sure my thoughts on the film will be better but what we got is 209 minute epic. It's a really fascinating film. There are some incredible moments throughout and it's really character driven which I really liked. It's a slow burner but never boring at all.Overall it's an impressive film even with a few flaws.

I hear you paint houses and think I'm funny.,"This was worth the wait. With actors who can be described as icons of cinema, plus a director who is getting even better, if that is possible. This film impresses so much.
This is a long film but it does not seem long, it holds your attention from the very start. It even commands it, such is its power.
This film will be for Martin Scorsese, what "" Once Upon A Time in America was for Sergio Leone. And will become even more appreciated with repeated viewings.So much praise has been given to Robert de Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, it is fully justified. Seeing these three actors at the height of their artistic powers, is truly a privilege to value and appreciate. It would come as no surprise if they were all nominated for academy awards. Along with Ray Romano, what a performance by him.
Could Robert de Niro win best actor beating Joaquin Phoenix, the hot favourite for the excellent Joker ?. In one word, yes.
It would be fitting that this film win , Best Picture, Director, Actor in a leading role, supporting actor, editing, cinematography and numerous technical awards. In fact it should sweep the board, with academy nominations and awards.
Finally in my view it was Joe Pesci who stole the show, he has a habit of doing that. Goodfellas is a perfect example. The way he projected power and authority, in a quite, understated way, was simply breathtaking.The Irishman is not just a film to go see. It is a film to learn from, it is a film to study. It is a look at American history, the past ,even if that past is dark and troubled.

Marty does it again,"Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro worked on several movies together over the years, and it was inevitable that they would have to work together again. And the result is a masterpiece. ""The Irishman"" looks at the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who became a hitman. The movie portrays just about every type of mafioso that existed from the '50s to the '80s.The movie has made news for the de-aging of its stars (and Bobby D's eyes look bizarre here). But I'd say that the cast itself is equally important. In addition to DeNiro, we have Joe Pesci making a triumphant return to the screen as Russell Bufalino, head of a crime family. And then there's Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. With these three - how had they never all appeared in a movie together? - you know that you're in for some intense stuff.Although I'd heard of Hoffa before, I'd never known about the rest of the people depicted here, let alone all this history. Who else but Scorsese could've directed something so forceful and gritty? All that I can say is that you can't claim to have seen a complete set of this year's movies unless you've seen ""The Irishman"".
