A great movie very informative. Ignore the ones that are trash everyone is spamming.,"Me myself I don't really like rap or hip-hop. But it's nice to know what these men went through on the road to fame and success. Yeah it was a rocky road and they're not the best or Perfect People but they still are people who had real life stories to tell. No they're not my heroes, they are still people which perspective. I recommend this movie to anybody with an open mind who wants to see a portrayal of what it was like to grow up in this situation.Don't mind the one star ratings they're just spam",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
You have got to be kidding.,"For all the people who wrote 1/10 reviews.
You have got to be kidding me.
There are so many people, who write uselessly negative reviews, and for what? Aggressive, throwing stuff like, I'd rate it negatively if I could, and such. Talking about the NWA like they are 5 happy misogynists, having sex all the time, depraved bums and are proud of it. Talking about them sinning and having sex all the time.
Listen to yourself.
This film shows the dark side of the 1990's. Look how people were treated back then. This film shows what shit people went through back then. This shows who they were. So what is they had sex. Look where they came from. This is trying to show how much of a shit-show America was back then. 
This film is trying to tell you about that.
The 80's and 90's weren't having a new brand systematically destroy America. America was destroying itself. These men were rappers. These men came from the streets. They grew up in a shit-show, and so they rap about it. They don't rap to prostitute their way to become millionaires. 
Look a little closer and stop focusing on all of the sex scenes for fucks sake. It's X-Rated, what do you expect?
It's the history of the NWA. Nothing is ever completely white and pure. 
For all of you that say that this film shows 5 misogynistic men, fucking their way through life and destroying America. These people were rascals, sure. These people were thugs sure. These people rapped about their troubles. 
For the people that rated 1/10.
You are very close minded, and are not aware of identities. Draw conclusions, not from the sex scenes and the swearing, but the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great movie,"When reading other reviews about this movie, I really get frustrated due to the lack of understanding about what this movie is really about. A lot of empty reviews only giving 1 star due to ""explicit sexual content, and black men who does not respect the law"".What people does not seem to understand is that this is a movie about the rise, and fall of the biggest rap group ever, how they evolved and what power, money, and fame can to a man (and in this case, his relationship to his friends). As much as anything, this movie really is a lot about the abuse that a lot of black males experienced from the police in the 80's (which is still a very relevant topic).Personally I am a big fan of N.W.A, without that being the reason I am rating this movie 9/10. It is a really interesting true story about some of THE great rap artists of our generation. Great performances by actors who looks a lot like the original group, as well as Paul Giamatti. Great directing, the movie has a really nice action curve, keeping things interesting throughout the movie, and really gives the public a good insight of the life of some of the biggest stars in the world during the 80's/90's.This is the first time i have ever written an review on IMDb, even though I have a lot of strong opinions about movies, but I really had to come to this movies defence. This is one of those movies I am really expecting to see a 8,3 star rating or something similar, and it really frustrates me to see a lot of people giving this movie unnecessary hate. GREAT MOVIE, if you like N.W.A, it is really worth your while, and if you are not, it is still worth a watch just because of the really intriguing true story that ""Straight Out Of Compton"" is.9/10 movie11/10 will watch again",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
excellent movie,"First of all, I am a white man, 58 years old. opinions will always vary on quality of movies, but I am shocked at many of the comments/reviews I've seen for soc (straight outta Compton). To say one needs to know ebonics and ridiculous things such as that........is racist. I was shocked at how good the acting was. Oshea Jackson was the weak link in my opinion; but paul giamatti, and the guy who portrayed easy-e were amazing. I was prepared for a typical bio (especially music bios) where the story is way ahead of the acting. Guy playing dre was excellent as well. So I was pleasantly surprised. This is an outstanding movie. One need not have knowledge of the hip hop culture/industry, any more than one needs to know about southern America to watch and appreciate steel magnolias or fried green tomatoes (ok,, I'm dating myself here). I don't like the sound of u.s. southern accents, but that doesn't mean those flicks are not great. So please. To the point that many like to mention about the vulgarity: it was real life depiction! movies about 1600 England have a certain dialect. Same with this. people in different parts of the u.s. speak very differently. This should not be a drawback, but rather a very realistic telling of what happened. Open your minds, not everything is Ellen and Seinfeld. I have lived in l.a. since 1982 and I found it to be very interesting on many levels. Great writing, directing and acting. If it is very very odd for you, then perhaps you'll learn something watching it. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Don't Listen to the 1 Star Reviews,"Everyone one here who complains about the movie don't know what they're talking about. This movie is reality! Police brutality, growing up in the hood, the extravagant lifestyle of singers/rappers is all there. Someone complained about this being vulgar and not appropriate for kids? No duh, it's rated R. Even though it was a long movie, I didn't want it to end. You really felt what was going on in the movie. When they were angry, you were angry. When they were sad, you couldn't help but to feel that as well. Don't listen to the people complaining, and calling them ""selfish"". They're probably just upset at how the police were portrayed, which was the reality for N.W.A. The movie is amazing. Watch it. This movie was extremely enjoyable, and despite the length, it felt like it went by in the blink of an eye.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Go in walkin', but leave stompin'","Even as a white kid from suburbia, I remember being exposed to the exhilarating and raucous sound of N.W.A. when I was four or five. My mother would play one of her brother's personally mixed CDs, filled with novelty songs, parodies, and vulgar rap songs I probably shouldn't have been heard at such a tender age, in car rides with me. Songs like ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""F*** the Police"" were ingrained in my head, and I remember especially finding telling social relevance in the line, ""searchin' my car, lookin' for the product - thinking' every n**** is sellin' narcotics"" from the latter song despite being so young.I may not have ever experienced racial injustice in my life, but I was at least aware of racial double standards at a young age. With that, one of the purposes of F. Gary Gray's biopic on the acclaimed, pioneering rap group N.W.A. is to get us angry at the injustice that occurred in the 1980's and 1990's and remind us that this kind of hate still frighteningly occurs today. It hits us in the face and stomps on the audience hard, as if its strapped with brass knuckles and decked out in the latest Nikes, portraying the race relations in Los Angeles as they were - ugly and disgraceful.This portrayal only fits that of N.W.A.'s music and character. Comprised of five talented, street-smart young men, N.W.A. was a rap group predicated on detailing their harsh reality and controversial opinions in a brutally honest manner. Featuring the lyrical talents of Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr., son of Ice Cube and a spitting image of his father), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), in addition to the lyrical and producing talents of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.), N.W.A. went from a Compton area bunch to a nationwide supergroup in what seemed to be overnight. Armed with the guidance of acclaimed music producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and their desire to rap the truth and the strength of street knowledge, ""Straight Outta Compton"" details the rise of the group in addition to subsequent beefs, contract battles, and multiple tragedies that faced the talented young men in their prime.F. Gary Gray directs this film with complete conviction. He and writers Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff work to capture the major events in N.W.A. in a manner that, while all-encompassing, gets to the heart of each emotion and the significance of every conversation. Gray and company don't mess around in detailing the sure power and magnitude of this group through concerts, riots, and nationwide recognition, and they do so in a manner that's investing from the very first time the group is questioned by police for doing nothing wrong.""Straight Outta Compton,"" again, much like the music of N.W.A., hooks you with its bravado and swagger. We see the incredible charisma and charm of these five men, we hear their hard-hitting lyricism and their strong production, and we feel their simultaneous pride for their city and condemnation of its flaws, such as systemic racism and discrimination. From Gray's assured direction, it continues with the performances, all of which unanimously strong. Eazy-E was a character I wasn't really expecting to see developed as much as he was, but with the writing at hand and Jason Mitchell's emotionally potent and tender performance, he becomes the standout in a sea of great acting.Each actor brings something to the table here; Jackson, Jr.'s aggression is unmatched, particularly in a telling scene involving Priority Records, Hawkins is the conviction and the even-tempered soul through all this madness, Hodge is the wit and the sporadic humor of the group, and Brown, Jr. is the backup to all the characters in the film whenever they need it. Mitchell is the tender and enigmatic one, someone who isn't easily defined, has trouble rapping and performing occasionally, but someone who also comes with big ideas for the group he knows, loves, and wants to make huge. Finally, let's not forget Giamatti, in his second Oscar-worthy performance (first being in ""Love & Mercy"") of the year, who gives a performance just as emotionally investing and captivating as that of Mitchell's, particularly when the two are having a heart-to-heart.As entertainment, ""Straight Outta Compton,"" for this past summer, is unmatchable in its level of fun and human interest. As social commentary, despite being set a few decades back, the film is frighteningly current in its issues and its ideas. While it may follow some typical tropes of a biopic (the ""rise and fall"" structure), nonetheless, the sleekness and universal strength of everyone and everything in this project make it rise above those shortcomings into something truly worthwhile. Finally, as a piece of hip-hop history, and film in general, it's an indisputable must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not completely honest but worth a watch,"I didn't personally grow up with NWA's music but I'm aware of how impactful this group was to the music industry and I think this film will please fans of the NWA.Straight Outta Compton is about the formation of the well known rap group NWA, their impact on the music industry and the difficulties they faced as a group.Whilst the film is about the NWA, it mainly focuses on three of its members: Ice Cube, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. I really enjoyed Straight Outta Compton. I loved how it showed scenes of them writing and performing their music. It conveyed the passion they had for music whilst living in a dangerous area. I thought F. Gary Gray managed to show the dangerous aspects of Compton in a great way. The editing of the film was done really well. The first half didn't feel like it was slowing down which left me fairly engaged with the story. The second half is where the film did get more dramatic and that's where I thought it started to slow down a bit but despite that I never felt bored. I think the issue with the film is its accuracy. Since Dr. Dre and Ice Cube produced this film, I think a fair amount of events weren't depicted as it would them look bad which does make sense. However, I do wish the film had been more honest with its story.The performances in this movie make the film really good. I enjoyed seeing some of the cameos of musical artists at that time. The casting for that was really done since so many of them resembled the look of the real life people and managed to act like them. O'Shea Jackson Jr., who is Ice Cube's son, plays the role of his father really well. Corey Hawkins does an excellent job as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell really surprised me with his performance as Eazy-E. Another surprise was Paul Giamatti who played the group's manager. He also did a very good job portraying Jerry Heller.Straight Outta Compton really worked for me. I loved F. Gary Gray's approach to this story and it addressed a few issues that still place in the world today. I still wish it had more honesty but I was thoroughly entertained by the story and the performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
This Movie Is Sooooooooooo Good,"Their stories are told well, vivid and emotional. It helps fill in the blanks if you remember this time period on what really happened.I laughed I cried and sang along. It was a beautiful piece of art. Loved the quality of acting definitely Oscar worthy!The movie did a great job putting their songs and feelings into context with the political climate as well as the internal struggles that they had as a group.I have much more respect for these guys because they have definitely come a long way merely by believing in themselves and standing up for their dreams and the social causes that they believed in.Although I am not from Compton (Oakland), I love how they portrayed both the good and the bad within the city and showed how Compton and cities like it tend to not be like other places and therefore cannot be judged as such.I am definitely going to see this movie again this weekend (opening weekend) so that my dollars count even more.I left the theater feeling misty thinking about Eazy and his family and what this movie really means to his memory. My heart was overjoyed because the truth is out about them and I think audiences today will be able to reflect on the criticism of that time with new and different eyes knowing all that is taking place in our world today.This movie is coming out at the best time and I think that so many people will be able to relate to fighting for the underdog, voicing the untold story, and achieving more than you could ever dream possible.

Rhymes of The Ghetto,"""Straight Outta Compton"" has the similar taste of the other Music business,Wall Street business and the merchandise business movies which could easily satisfy and inspire the young audience to live their Katharsis of being a successful man or woman in the future, like the depicted successful people in these biographical genre movies. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street ). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell. Especially to young needy teenagers and young people eager to try everything to break the societies pressures and taboos.The expectation on the box office is important of course. ""Straight Outta Compton"" will possibly gain the success on box office.But some effectiveness' can make the audience feel uncomfortable about watching it again or remember it as their one of all time favorite classic. At least I will criticize the defectiveness that I have determined after I watched the movie until the end.The Subject of the biographic approach of Rap All-Stars is a perfect and unique idea. The originality can't be questioned. However the catharsis that I have mentioned before could not work for all cinema audience, I found the directing, acting and narration superficial.This was not the first biographical movie that has disappointed me with its narration and process of progression. And I think that won't be the last for sure.That's another argument.The main point is some biographies made by commercial concerns and cosmetic structure, harms them sometimes.This is the Rap Music's fathers' story,the action scenes could be more efficient on the contrary of matching some action b-movies, the classical and vigilant music agent profile played by Paul Giamatti, gave me the feeling of the same type which I ran across in other Music based movies.The actors who play the role of The Rap creators are good. The lack of the Katharsis begins with their shallow depiction, so that I definitely think that Dre or Ice Cube or Eazy E's lives depiction with other characters and crowded casting had created that mess and caused the defectiveness. Because almost 2 and a half hour movie isn't enough to depict the whole family of rap's beginning and the depiction of separate lives of them could make a better order in the narration. Linked to that criticism of the shallow narration, the documentary trace additions which would be a good idea on a biographical Movie, was used ineffectively in my opinion. For Example The Rap's born documentary series on VH1 would be watchable for all kinds of documentary lovers, so I believe that in the movie this magazine coverage documentary style is used by showing the social struggles of the Rapper's since their youth, the police's tough attitudes to the Black Citizens in their Neighbourhoods and putting the actual footage of the fights and plundering in the ghettos. However the idea of Half magazine and half crime narrated documentary style using in a movie, is very hard job and I realized that some parts were good adopted from this kind of E! or VH1 documentaries but some parts seemed weak because of several things that make the distinction between Documentary Movie and Cinema Movie, which would cause dead ends on the narration of Cinema Movie.For instance the lack of voice narration as a result of the director's obligation of staying out of magazine words, the time-lapse difference between a documentary and a movie,the slow timing usage to tell the story in the movie on the contrary of a rushing biographical documentary and doing it with telling the audience the story of at least 5-6 rap stars in such a slow occasion, had killed the spirit of the ""Magazine-Documentary- Biography"" triplet style depiction. But I still believe that ""Straight Outta Compton"" could easily be the first and unique example of the future styles of direction and maybe could create a new unique genre as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
not real,"How real is ""Straight Outta Compton"" when the movie totally omits the fact that Dr. Dre beat the hell out of his full-time/part-time girlfriend/singerMichel'le?According to Michel'le in interviews and in her Lifetime movie, Dr Dre repeatedly physically abused her on an ongoing basis.She was a significant presence in Dr. Dre's early years and yet no mention of her at all in the movie?

Very weird reviews here.,"I am definitely no film critic but one thing I can tell: This is NOT a bad movie. It caught my attention the fact that this movie has so many bad, unfair reviews. Many claim this movie is vulgar, obscene, as if it was a kids movie. It's not! They also claim it's violent, which they wouldn't say about American Sniper, which is a lot more violent, but with white heroes. Or they claim there is nudity, as if they never saw The Heartbreak Kid with Ben Stiller. It doesn't promote drugs as much as Pineapple Express and it doesn't promote violence even a fraction of how The Godfather does. So this reviews are absurd, apparently made by white police officers who feel offended by ""F The Police"".I was checking some of the reviewers who gave it one star and found some weird thins. For instance, many of them have either no other movie reviewed or have one other review made the same day they made the review for this movie, which is a little suspicious. There is one of them who gave Amelie one star also. If that is not proof of a mental issue I don't know what is.Now my review: This movie has a good rhythm in most but not all the time. It might not be the most truthful account of what happened but, hey! It's NOT a documentary. The subjects of this movie are also the producers and they chose what they wanted to portray, which they have the right to do. Besides you should never judge a movie by how truthful it is to the real story but how consistent in it self it is and how the story is told. It's an interesting movie and it makes you interested in the real-life characters. Now I want to see a documentary about these guys, cause I understand this is a movie and I'm curios about what was really going on with them. It's NOT boring but it's not a Michael Bay film. The acting was not impressive, but it wasn't distracting.I was skeptical but when I saw the first 10 minutes I was hooked.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Soooooooooo fake. Paints them as superheroes. Just, no.","I think that if you're going to make a movie like this then you need to show all sides, the good and the bad.-Like Eazy and Dre's disrespectful, repugnant ""black b*tches"" comments (No wonder Dre seemingly never had a problem with Eminem's infamous ""black b*tch"" lyrics).-Like Dre's refusal to have anything to do with his black kids. You put your white kids into private school while the black ones are stuck in the ghetto. Doesn't the fakery just gnaw at you, Dre? As a black woman, I have zero respect for you.-Like the abuses that women faced at the hands of Dre, that he only apologized for when this hokey movie was about to come out.Aside from Ice Cube, a family man who doesn't deny his kids or disrespect black women (at least not anymore), these are not the people you want your kids to emulate. Watching this movie was painful because even though I grew up to this music and used to have at least a modicum of appreciation for it all, as an adult I see the damage that it's done to an entire generation, and to watch these men painted as martyrs and heroes and such literally turned my stomach. It's SO FAKE. You can see through it even if you don't know anything about the real rappers. I'd advise you all to do your research on these people. Dre especially does not deserve respect or even a portion of your paycheck.So glad I waited until it played on HBO. I would never buy this junk.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A very well paced film with great characters and human emotion.,"I'm a hip-hop head and grew up in the NWA era, even if I wasn't a hip-hop junkie I don't think I would love this movie any less. When I first saw the trailer I wasn't quite sold. The movie was wonderful. I cannot find too many things I didn't like about it. If I were too nitpick, then I would say they painted Dre & Ice Cube too positively. I'm pretty sure there were less flattering things about them. But judging this from just how well it was written, acted and directed, I would have to say this was flawless.Obviously there are five members of the group, and the film chose to focus more on the three most popular members, which I did not have a problem with. Because the movie was carried out so well, it did not affect the overall story of the group as a whole. What made this so wonderful for me is that almost every pivotal scene in the movie, I remember being a part of it, because I remember where I was when each moment was happening. When certain songs were shown being made or when the tragic news of Eazy-E was reported. It took me down memory lane of my own life, not too many films can do this.And the music of course is a major part of the story and it was well executed. Now let's talk about the cast. What a well-put together cast! This movie had humor, tragedy and everything in between. It was sold by this wonderful cast. Basically Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson was born to play this role, literally and he knocked it out the park. But the two that held this glue together was Paul Giamatti playing Jerry Heller and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. The chemistry between those two was amazing. I would love to see someone from this cast get an Academy Award nomination. In my opinion, this is a great contender for Best Film for the Oscars.As a hip-hop junkie and a lover of great films, I would like to say thank you to the creators of this movie for reminding me why I love Hip-Hop so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton is entertaining to say the least.","Straight Outta Compton tells the the story of the most influential group in hip-hop and rap, that group being N.W.A or as Eazy-E so gracefully puts it N****s With Attitudes. Directed by F. Gary Gray, Straight Outta Compton is, without a doubt, his best work behind the camera. However, by traditional standards, that isn't saying much. Gray is no stranger to N.W.A, Ice Cube or Dr. Dre having directed numerous music videos featuring their music. While the film is a very nice ""fairy tale"" telling of a story filled with tension, violence and rage, it lacks the balls to tell the actual story. Instead, the film picks and chooses what to tell and what to leave out, very strategically as well considering the film is two and a half hours plus. Starting with the streets of Compton, we are introduced to each character with a bang. Each of them getting their own introduction as if they were folk heroes or something, whether it is petty crime or writing rap lyrics, the film shows these characters with a sense of heroism to them no matter what they're doing. The best performance out of the group would have to be Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre. Hawkins delivers in every scene he's in, making it a true standout performance among actors that sometimes feel like they're in over their heads, more specifically Jason Mitchell, who plays Eazy-E. Mitchell feels more like a caricature of the late rapper rather than an actual actor portraying a real life counterpart. The film moves quickly enough and focuses long and hard on all of the partying, the women, the guns and the drugs, so much so that you start to wonder whether the film is a N.W.A music video tribute. Despite the falsehoods, the glorification and the shaky performances, Straight Outta Compton works well as an entertaining film. The only downside of this film is its haphazard statement on Police Brutality. While that is as prevalent as a topic can get for a film from 2015 about N.W.A, that was not the highlight of the group. The highlight of the group was the fight against the censors. A fight that they won, obviously. Despite that truth, the film wallows in trying to be a message about police brutality rather than a film about these men, their flaws and their triumphs, their ups and their downs. Unfortunately, it leaves us knowing nothing new about these people and at two and a half hours, we should leave this film knowing every little detail about them. Instead, we're left wanting more out of them. Overall, Straight Outta Compton ends up being an entertaining film about some of America's favorite rap artists instead of an important one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Homage to the pioneers of gangsta rap,"This is not an Oscar winning feature. It is definitely well made and brings back fond memories to the day and age when rap-music took a rebellious turn, But in the end it is just another biopic.I was impressed though by the acting of O'Shea Jackson Junior playing his Ice Cube, the eerie likeliness to his father in posture and demeanor gives the movie a deeper sense of realism. Also worth mentioning is a fantastic Giamatti as agent Jerry Heller. I think he will get a leading male Oscar within the next three years if he keeps his game up so to speak.I do believe Dre and Cube were the heart and soul of NWA and are musical en lyrical masters of their trade, in this movie however they are portrayed as saints.

Excellent Movie about Influential Pop Culture Giants,"I was reading some of the reviews about this amazing movie and wanted to laugh. ""Oh my gosh, it has sex, drugs and violence. Boo hoo!"" I mean, do people do any kind of research before shelling out their $10? This movie takes place in Compton in the mid 80s. This wasn't Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, this was a rough, hardcore area where blacks didn't know if they would be arrested and assaulted by cops or shot at by gangsters anytime they stepped out the door. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is one of the most remarkable rags to riches stories about a group that changes the face to music, movies and pop culture on a grander scale.The movies introduces us to the five members of N.W.A.: Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and MC Ren. We see how the group formed, how they met manager Jerry Heller, the recording of their first album, the flack they received on tours, their constant battle over censorship and freedom of speech, their lives of excess and partying, the trouble they experienced by law enforcement for just standing there, the battle of egos, inner band turmoil, and eventually the splitting up of the group. If you are a fan of hip hop, you know how much of an influence N.W.A. had to the rise of West Coast Hip Hop and Gangsta Rap. At this time, the only real way to hear new music was the radio, and due to their controversial lyrics, they never got any airplay, but the media helped create buzz and popularity almost indadvertedly by talking about how controversial the group was and how people didn't like their music. That resulted in the band becoming multi-platinum superstars. In fact, the band didn't just grab the black audience, but was highly popular with white men, who started turning away from rock music, which was facing a decline due to cheesy hair metal production, to this new, powerful, anti-establishment credo that rock once represented. Yes, there is drug use, sex and violence, but this was the life these guys knew, and no matter how far you go, you never forget your roots or completely leave them.The actors all do an excellent job in their roles. The only real veteran in this film is Paul Giamatti, who does his usual solid performance, this time as the sleazy, manipulative manager Jerry Heller. Interestingly enough, Giamatti was in another music biopic this year, Love and Mercy, about another influential Southern California band (The Beach Boys). Both bands, very much from the same area, had such a influence to their periods of time and represented completely different worlds of Southern California youth life.Even if you're not a fan of hip-hop, I still think you need to this as their effect on pop culture in general is still prevalent today. Also, on a sadder note, the issues of police brutality on minorities still is a glaring problem that makes F the Police sound just as fresh as it did in 1988.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not Deep enough, but still very Intriguing (Actual Vote Should Be 8-)","In my opinion, the film suffers from a somewhat fluctuating pace, which does not explode as it could have, avoiding to go too deeply into the biggest issues, although gradually managing to illustrate very well the general atmosphere of the period and above all the combative soul of the band, embodied very well by the young performers, especially Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell.Gray's direction is very good, but a bit wobbly, failing to balance perfectly, even without burying anything, a more standard style with more articulated and dynamic shots, especially during musical numbers that make the most of the power of this great music that made history, both inside and outside the musical environment, and showing the consequences of the excesses experienced by the group quite well.Despite this, therefore, a very nice way to learn about this particular story, thanks to solid performances and intriguing musical numbers, maybe a bit too much simplified, but still able to perfectly break through the boundaries of any social oppression and barrier, halfway between the darkness and the light of fame.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It keeps you on the age of your seat for the first 1hr 45 mins and then winds down from there. It has some humour in it and shows the human side of them all. They all have their flaws, but they have qualities that outweigh them.I loved this as a movie. 7 is a high score for me and I would have given this movie an 8 if not for the last hour of the movie. The portrayal of Eazy-E struggling seems very disrespectful to me. If Eric were alive, would he have wanted himself being portrayed that way? He had a good solo career, he was working closely with Bone Thugs n Harmony who were nowhere to be seen.It skipped his rap beef with Dre and his diss records to Death Row and Suge Knight. He even ends up bagging up cannabis to sell and make ends meet. It's very disrespectful to a man who isn't here to see that his legacy get's shown tastefully. He was a very proud man and would want to come across as stronger.When Future generations watch this movie they will think Eric was a struggling solo rapper who couldn't function without NWA. The truth is he wasn't doing too bad financially, he had a successful solo career that was only slowed down due to his deteriorating health, and was helping many up and coming artists. He was still being paid for every record Dre sent out for the time he was under contract with Ruthless.Despite it being a very good movie, it isn't the best biopic due to their portrayal of Eazy-E.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Apparently.. ""this movie depicts drugs, gangs, violence and sex"" haha","Having read some of the other reviews I'm glad to see there are some people that realize this is a film based on multiple characters and their group nwa rise and fall and that's it.""this movie depicts drugs, gangs, violence and sexual abuse"" etc.. The film even gets the same reactions their first album did 27 years after the fact and that is really funny.It's about a historical rap group from a historical time. People need to remember that people from different places have different stories. It's no wonder you can't identify with this film.The film it's self is well paced I thought there some really good references the actors got to work with to build these characters.The dark side of the ghetto, the importance of family and friends. In a world where you are being pushed to the limit during the Rodney king Compton era.There's also the people who only see the bad stuff in this film due to derogatory uses of cliche profanity towards woman, Jews, white people and African American people. I understand this right but also its a historical time. This is how it was and not necessarily how it is now. It's a film about a group in history nothing else.The acting is good but I would have liked to get to know more about doc, ren, yella and some of the parts in their lives but the movie would be too long.Like most fans we all know the gist of what happened in terms of fueds and diss tracks but it's good to see it fleshed out when cube leaves nwa.A story about a bunch of friends who were tired of what they were seeing day to day and found a voice through music to tell a story.If you don't like the story, music or the film it's based on real events (somewhat) which all happened whether you like it or not.The tone is decent.. Imagine a mad ice cube smashing up your office wanting to be paid for work you have done.Imagine suge knight sending around some ripped gangster to your house casually smoking and glaring at you. You can feel the tone and fear of the moment.The soundtrack is great, it's good to see Dr dre's evolution in through his career and the music he grew up with becoming g-funk and a lot of big names that he gets to work with.Eazy E was played so well and when he catches up with cube after a few years go by. The friendship is still there and it shows how he develops from dope houses to a man that can apologise to a friend.Jerry was good. The actor who plays him is very seasoned but he fits this drama roll quite well.My only criticism is not knowing snoop, pac and a whole bunch of other people who were there. The characters arnt overly developed as well as they could be but it depends what kind of story you're telling and this is a groups biography.A bit like bohemian rhapsody.. It's mostly about Freddie mercury but you don't get much about the other members.Overall I've watched it a few times and including today and I'll watch it again for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Not only tells the story of NWA, but the movie itself is a milestone in hip hop.","When I saw the film was going to be well over two hours, I will admit I thought they were too overzealous, but every minute of this movie was entertaining.The fact that a movie that tells the history of hip hop's most infamous group, and is on the level of such biopics as Oliver Stone's The Doors just shows you were hip hop has gone since the beginning of NWA.Usually biopics like this get boring when the third act hits, but not Straight out of Compton. It keeps your heart pumping to the very last minute.He's not gonna go down in history as the world's greatest thespian but you could do no wrong with Ice Cube Jr. Mimicking daddy-o (Ice Cube's son plays his dad and looks just like him). He had it down, but so did the kid playing Easy E, but the real credit goes to F. Gary Gray who made music videos for members of NWA. The writers and producers which included Ice cube also contributed to how entertaining this movie was. It feels like everyone cared about the project.Straight out of Compton is a positive spin on the NWA story, showing how five guys from the neighborhood who only wanted to make music for the kids on their block ended up taking over the world. It's has this ""this could be you"" vibe and overall is an uplifting story about living your dreams on your terms. It's no different than any other rock star's story and that's one of the reasons it's amazing.Also like how the story gave equal time to members DJ Yella and MC Ren. I was expecting the Big three players in the band to overshadow them, but the film treated these two with respect.What a great story. It was totally worthy of the 2 hours and 42 mins spent in the theater. Every minute counted.I'm thinking good enough to get nominated for something in awards season.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Word!,"I have a problem with the clothing and the script.I am always very sensitive to when the slang or clothing are misplaced in an era.Young black men didn't say ah-IE back then. Lots of baseball caps and over-sized t-shirts as well.The word alright sounded more like alright back in those days. Black urban youths started saying ah-IE pretty recently.Perhaps no longer than 10 years ago.In fact they didn't ask ""what-up""? either.They didn't use the N word as much however did in fact refer to each other as blood or sometimes even dog. It would have been a pretty good production they just gotten their 80's script down (by law).I am.When it comes to black cinema I am fairly sure I know what's good and genuine.The police use of unnecessary force and the N word are induced to prove the peril of Compton at the time. Colors portrayed it with more realism and I have to give this an overall low rating for being too contrived an poorly researched.I know i'll get my honky s whooped now and have to lick it up but word.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Just Amazing. Doesn't matter if you are hiphop fan or not,"I try to make it quick this time. Watch this movie. It is easily one of the best I have seen in a long time and I was skeptical with all the praise it got beforehand. But it is well deserved. The three lead actors are amazing as well as the direction. Yes you see them ""fight"" the police but this is not a political film. This is a drama.It is about friendship, about self-fulfillment, about creating something and about how greed destroys everything. It has been a long time that I sat in a movie theater and you could feel how much respect and love everybody in the audience has for this film. You don't need to love HipHop to enjoy this incredible movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
About the music...,"and this will decide whether you like the movie or not. Note: like - not love or hate. This movie is neither as good as the hype, nor as bad as the blow hards. Its rests somewhere in-between.I was very surprised by the time-line. In '89 I was listening to this music - a lot. Anyone young and into rap music at the time had this in their play list with 2 Live Crew, Public Enemy, Sir Mix A Lot, Stesasonic, 3rd Bass amongst others. But you have to understand I was also listening to De La Soul, Faith No More, and the Beastie Boys. I'd like to think now, looking back, I have a bit of perspective at NWA's relevance at that time. If we were left believing this movie - NWA had no peers, and no matter what people think, they did. Back to the point, it is astonishing how fast NWA made their bones, got distribution, and made it to every corner of the US of A. I should know, I was in a backwater corner - might as well of been living in a tree house by comparison to the urban vistas of this film.What's good? The music is good. Dialog, and performances often have snap, humor, and a legit feel. There is some good acting, and you can tell a lot of work went into these performances. SouttaC is well produced - it has all the trappings: sound, shots, lighting, glitz, glamor - absurd % of hot chicks with flesh flying high in many an over the top scene. This shouldn't be overlooked, or under appreciated. People completely out of the NWA loop will also learn a thing or two about the members and events. But this movie is not made for educational purposes, and a lot of the material is not presented in a way that improves the film.This movie has omissions - smoking, and smoking and, smoking and drinking. Yea, it is implied - but the reality of this behavior is flat not the film. There are also way too many throw away lines that are supposed to indicate other huge absences: like Cube's film career.Who edited this? Was the director by the editors side? Maybe that was the problem - this movie has more chop than a fickle lake shore. Many (all?) of the heavy dramatic scenes fall flat, because suddenly everyone is crying, angry, yelling, fighting, bouncing - with no set up! How the hell is a viewer supposed to buy into these lives, when the films tempo and presentation of material is all over the place? Good guys, bad guys, grey guys - whatever! As in all movies, it comes down to the script. Very unlikely that the script was written how this film is edited, which leads me to believe this movie was attempted to be saved in post instead of extensive preproduction. It felt as though preproduction focused on character building, not character development, and integrating them into a cohesive work of art. Predictably, the last 20 minutes of the film is painful to watch, in large part due to the strict chronological unfolding of events. Many viewers will give this a pass due to content - I won't; it is bad film making.Perhaps most disappointing is the formulaic approach: From out of nowhere, rise to fame, we are a brotherhood, money causes issues, band members fall out, everything goes wrong for the bad guys, but the good guys come out on top. What is this? A well produced episode of inside the music, or history of rock and roll? Reduced to it's essence, this is a pretty damn bland film - that never chooses exactly what it wants to be.Love NWA? - you gonna like this movie. Hate NWA, rap culture? Then F off! Crazy how people go Way out of their way to hate and attempt to $#|+ on things they have opinions about. My attempt? Objective analysis. Did I mention the editing in this movie is terrible?My rating - 6.5/10, rounded down",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Fantastic movie, whether you're a fan of the music or not","This is a movie which will grip you even if you're not a big fan of rap pioneers NWA, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. If you are a fan, you'll probably be in heaven. Either way, I highly recommend this movie, which has it all: great acting, a compelling story, riveting direction, and most importantly, honesty.It doesn't make excuses, but at the same time, you see the genesis for NWA's incendiary lyrics: blatant racism and brutality by the LAPD at the direction of Daryl Gates, vast economic disparity relative to other citizens of LA, and an environment of gang violence. Can you imagine being held at gunpoint by thugs entering your school bus because you had made a few gestures at them out your window? Being forced to the ground with hands behind your back by the police for no other reason than the color of your skin?You also see NWA's defense so eloquently put by Ice Cube (well, his son, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., who plays him brilliantly): they were simply reflecting their world, honestly, and were also protected by the First Amendment. There isn't a lot of visibility put into the misogynistic lyrics of the genre and these artists, but it is clear that they were young men acting out, and when we see the older Cube a family man, sagely reflecting back on a video he made was younger, we appreciate that. We tend to have barriers and stereotypes built up, demonizing others we don't understand particularly when they confront and challenge the status quo, and this movie really helps break those down. At the same time, the attitude and actions against women were the areas that I felt the artists got too much of a pass, and a perfectly honest movie would have included those elements.I liked seeing all of the personalities in what was a very special time in music history, similar to when McCartney met Lennon or Jagger met Richards. Fans of those bands, calm down, I'm not suggesting NWA reached the heights of the Beatles or Stones, but what an incredible influence they had on an entire genre from the crucible that was Compton in the 80's. You see the fiery lyrics of Ice Cube, the visionary genius of Dr. Dre, and the tragic story of Eazy-E. Corey Hawkins plays Dre and Jason Mitchell plays Eazy-E, and both are fantastic. You see great nuance in the character of the band's manager Paul Heller, played by Paul Giamatti, who advocates for them and advances them, but also ultimately screws them. You see the jealousies between the band members lead to a schism. You see Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) arrive on the scene, and you see a real villain in Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor), who at first seems to be helping them get out of a situation in which they're being taken advantage of, but quickly does that himself, and in addition, exercise extreme violence in asserting his power. The quality of the acting is consistently high. The story itself is fascinating, and Director F. Gary Gray did a great job of figuring out what to leave in and what to leave out. Even though it's 147 minutes, which is long, you'll find it flies by and doesn't seem long, which is the sign of a great story-teller. It's quite surprising that none of these fine actors, the director, or the movie itself were even nominated for an Oscar, and quite right that that fact was widely protested. Definitely go see this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good enough but a tad overrated,"It was decent enough but I expected it to be better than ""decent enough"" considering the sky high ratings...The acting was okay but I didn't feel like any of the actors truly became the real people they were portraying in the same way that for instance Jamie Foxx did when he did Ray, or Jamal Woodard for that matter when he did Notorious...But they did okay, Eazy E was the only interesting character though for me... And maybe Ice Cube (who actually is my favorite in the real group but in the movie it's definitely Eazy), they clearly took out any negative things about Dr Dre to make him the ""nice guy"" of the movie or whatever but it just made him a bit boring...It didn't feel like they went into the depth of the characters either too much; you didn't get to know who MC Ren was at all...They pressed the issue about police always harassing them a lot which to me felt like a trick to trick the viewers into liking the characters when to me at least it takes more than that.But there was always something happening, for better and worse, better because it doesn't get boring worse because it all becomes a bit superficial and lacking true introspection.It's a lot though to take almost 10 years of time from 5 different people (although mainly focusing on Cube, Dre and E) and squeeze it into a movie so it's somewhat understandable.No real surprises though, at least if you like me know your N.W.A. history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Really Enjoyed this Film,"Despite my own personal interest in the music, I was not going to let that influence how I felt about the this film. Fortunately it did not have too. I enjoyed the hell out of it.The casting was excellent, not just based on their looks but the talent level was apparent by all members. The characters were well developed and each had their own unique personality, and the characters especially Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's characters. This is one of the most crucial parts of this film is that I needed to be able to feel the chemistry between these characters in order to pull myself into this film and begin to care about these people despite them being based on real people. One complaint I have heard about this film is that the second half of the film is not as compelling as the first half of the film due to the fact that it gets more dramatic and in depth on the personal lives of Ice Cube, Eazy E, and Dr. Dre as they began to go their own directions in their music careers. Personally I enjoyed the second half of the film, because I was able to see how well the cast act in dramatic situations and I was impressedAs far as complete accuracy goes, obviously there are certain things that were left out of the movie based on the negative history that took place during the 1990s but that is to be expected since Ice Cube is one producer of this film. However does not take away from the experience in anyway, shape or form. In short I loved this movie in its entirety. I talk about this movie forever but the point is a highly recommend you see this film especially fans of rap music because it will give you a true appreciation for the music created by N.W.A. This is my first review I have posted so hopefully this was helpful and if not I will try to improve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too much is unexplained,"For a movie that lasts so long, it was somewhat of an achievement to leave so much unexplained. I had to keep asking myself why various events were happening, especially the forgiveness towards the band- member who seems to arrange a greedy structuring of the profits. I was also left wondering what DJ Yella and MC Ren contributed to the band.I really only felt any sympathy or connection towards Ice Cube and Dr Dre − perhaps this was because Ice Cube apparently had a big part in the making of the movie and perhaps Dr Dre put up a lot of the cash for the project.The end of the movie felt incomplete, as so much was left unanswered. I know that Dr Dre is successful now and I know that Ice Cube did some acting later in life, but I don't know what ended up happening to pretty much everyone else in the film. I believe a film should be complete, I don't feel that I should need to take a pop culture history lesson to enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton,"This movie is riveting, poignant and will have you on the edge of your seat! It's about a dream realized through adversity, friendships tested and bad business deals. The director Mr. F. Gary Gary had the monumental task of telling a story of true pioneers, that changed history, the music industry and the world with their reality. He opened our hearts and minds to the true struggle of ""NWA"" and how they faced first hand police brutality, inner city crime, poverty and blight, all while trying to become men and change the environment. The ""Cast"" told the story as if they lived through it. They (""Cast"") embodied the full and true characteristics of Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr), Eazy E (Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) & DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr). They took us inside of their (""NWA"") world and made us experience joy, pain, heartaches and true success.

Intense and compelling,"This is a great film. The detail and the effort that been put in here is superb and it's wonderful to see.Each of the actors is well chosen, credible and presents their chosen character in convincing manner.The actors that play Dre and Ice-Cube are particularly compelling, but it seems wrong to overlook the portrayal of Easy-E.This is explosive stuff straight out of the blocks and it never feels slow. It's a long film too, but it keeps you right there. I went to see it in the cinema with my wife and she'd just worked a night shift - she didn't fall asleep and she thought she probably would. That is a pretty good test for a movie.The menacing figure of Shug Knight comes right off the screen too. The drama is both incredible but so real.Laced within this film are real messages too - freedom of speech messages, racial discrimination messages, police brutality messages - which are really important because they were and are part of our times.The big message is though - these five guys came from nowhere, a place where there is less than nothing to share - but with their own gifts, their creativity, their musicality - they left their mark on the world. It just shows that, it's always there waiting to happen, something new and unexpected, out of nowhere. The political elite can't ever stop that, it can't be smothered.This is a great film that holds the torch for the power of creativity and self belief - the ability to over come it all.Final mention - easy to overlook - this film is bringing NWA to a whole new generation who don't know about them. After the film was over I was waiting for my wife (bathroom) and I asked this young guy if he remembered any of the events he'd seen on the screen. He shook his head and said 'No, I'm only 16'.Great film. RIP EASY-E.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Kinda Soft,"If you're interested, then this movie will be interesting; at least for a while (more or less the first 90 minutes of this 2 ½ hour bio-""epic"". ""Straight Outta Compton"" tells the story of revolutionary rap group, N.W.A. (Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dj Yella). Kicking off on the streets of Compton, California 1986 and documenting the groups rise as the pioneers of ""gangsta rap"", their tumultuous break up, allegedly due to underhanded management from Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and introducing branches of rap legends which expanded from the N.W.A. tree, e.g. Snoop Dogg, Tu-Pac, etc. Problem is (much like that last sentence) the movie is just too damn long! And once Eazy-E starts coughing, the whole thing turns into an after school special, primarily due to an overarching repetitive atmosphere which director F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off) seems to choose over subtlety more often than not.There were a few sequences that made me lean forward in my seat (The live performance of ""F--- the Police"", for one) and the script itself from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center) does its job; even going above and beyond at times, inserting a few ""audience winks"" throughout (I mean, there's even a ""bye Felicia"" joke thrown into the mix). But it was the acting which was undoubtedly the stand-out aspect of this movie, highlighted by a performance from Ice Cube's own son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., who, in his first ever acting gig, hits it out of the park playing his father.Here's the problem: The difference between ""Straight Outta Compton"" and an actual N.W.A. album is one carries a gritty, raw authenticity, and the other stars Paul Giamatti.Not to say that there aren't guns in this movie (or drugs or police brutality for that matter) but the fact that ""Straight Outta Compton"" looks so cinematic is an issue.When comparing this to a movie like ""Boyz n the Hood"", which while ""fiction"", portrays an honest and personal look into the streets of Los Angeles during a similar time frame, I can safely say that I remember finding myself absolutely immersed in John Singleton's depiction of said setting; to the point where by the end I felt as if I knew the neighborhood without even setting foot in the neighborhood. In retrospect this form of direction aided in my bond with other aspects of the film, acting as the connective tissue between me and the characters on screen.""Straight Outta Compton"" portrays true to life characters, all who actually grew up in Compton, but Gray's glossy (and viciously repetitive) direction really gives viewers more of a distracting XD version of a story that deserved a grittier presentation. Final Thought: It is obvious that Gray has a talent for music video direction and the cinematography here is technically perfect; just not for this movie, and thus curbing my viewing experience and creating a disconnect which resulted in me getting bored after the 90 minute mark.By the way: Everyone who isn't dead, in prison or white gets out of this film scot-free. And while I am not an expert on the breakup of N.W.A. (I was around 5 when it actually happened) the fact that this film took 10 years (as stated by Ice Cube himself) to make, leads me to believe a multitude of financial parties had to come to an agreement as to what could be shown and what past actions could do damage in the court of public opinion, and thus would need to be left on the cutting room floor. So, just a heads up: this is not a scathing expose detailing Dr. Dre's abuse towards women, or anything like that. That said, this fact should not be held against the film itself, as it really has no bearing on ones viewing experience. Still, I believe that audiences have the right to know before entering the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Speak a little truth and people lose their minds.,"I just created an IMDb account specifically to point out the following issue I see here on the User Reviews section for this film.Me and my roommate just watched Straight Outta Compton and it was a fantastic picture. I would've sat for 2 more hours watching the extended version, which I hope is someday released. Now, after every incredible film I watch, I'll check IMDb to see what others are saying and I noticed that even with all of the positive reviews from all over the internet, the IMDb user reviews section of this movie is thickly littered with 1 Star reviews. That seemed odd to me, until I started noticing a pattern. Each of these 1 Star reviews all carry the words ""adult"", ""shame"", ""disgusting"", etc. Furthermore, each of these reviews feature bad punctuation and almost ALWAYS have the final sentence of the review ending with ""!."" An exclamation point AND a period? That's not right. But doing the math, it seems like one person is trying to sabotage the reviews section of this film. What I'm getting at is that maybe someone is trying to smear this film. I'm getting the feeling that perhaps this film wasn't supposed to be a success because of the deep messages it speaks about in regards to police brutality, issues of freedom of speech, and minority oppression. This is a very important and powerful film and I don't think a select group of people are excited about it.Welp, those are my thoughts. Aside from that, I think the movie kicked ass.

Extremely Captivating to the Nostalgic Folks of the Gangsta Rap Era,"It's hard for me not to be biased when rating and reviewing this movie. N.W.A. was a huge part of my musical nurturing as a pre-teen and teen. I remember the first dub of Boyz in the Hood that a fellow elementary school classmate gave me. I was so blown away by the cords, the beat and the lyrics. What? Are they cussin'???? Give me more!!!!Now, to divorce that part of my upbringing from the movie... It's hard. They could have played one track after another all the way through to The Chronic 2001 and I would have been attentive and enthralled. Throughout the movie I think every track from the first album, ""Straight Outta Compton"", was at least sampled and each time lyrics just poured out of me like I was 11 again. Music I don't listen to at all anymore and seldom think about just all rushed back to me like the amnesia patient that has a break through.Besides the head bob inducing music the actors chosen were perfect. From Ice Cube, to Dre, to Eazy-E, to Suge Knight, to Snoop Dogg and Tupac; the actors chosen were stupendous. Nevermind the fact that O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube) could be his father's twin, the other actors were expertly chosen as well.I liked the story because it was very relevant to me for reasons I've already stated and it was relevant to the music industry as a whole. They pioneered Gangsta Rap and helped elevate rap and hip-hop to new heights. They also took the reigns off of all artists to come. Yes, there was profanity in music before them, but they were so gritty and raw and gangsta that it gave every ghetto boy after them something they could identify with and rap about themselves. Then the N.W.A. family grew. Then came the D.O.C., Snoop, Tupac, WC and the Mad Circle, Mack 10, Eminem, 50 Cent, Beats by Dre, Boyz in the Hood the movie, the Friday movies and so much else.The movie's relevance was further solidified with the re-airing of the Rodney King beating, the subsequent trial and the subsequent riots. It was eery how that video, 24 years old, could be played today and we wouldn't be shocked. Replace the grainy camcorder with a cell phone and how much is different? I remember shortly after the Rodney King verdict Ice Cube came out with a song and one of the lyrics was:""Go to Simi Valley and surelysomebody knows the address of the jury.Pay a little visit""Who is it?""Fool it's Ice CubeLet me talk to the Grand WizardThen ""boom!""""I remember that line so clearly because 1.) The song was that dope and 2.) it embodied what I felt.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. There is a pruder part of me now in my adult age that even shied at some of the language and nudity. Its appeal may be limited to a nostalgic few like myself that were so impressed by N.W.A. Or just maybe its appeal may be more encompassing being that it would be a history lesson to the hip-hop lovers of today that may have never known a world pre-bling hip- hop, or to the curious individuals who want to know how Gangsta Rap came to be. For me, it was not only a walk down memory lane but it was a historical lesson as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Outstanding,"Raw. Edgy. Gritty and filled with truth. Almost as poignant as it's namesake album. It took me back to the time when this was really happening. I remember the riots after the King incident, I remember them being arrested at a concert, I remember the first time I heard the song, and the sadness I felt hearing the news of Eazy's passing. It pulled me in, made me laugh, made me cry and was well worth the price of admission. I will see this again. The gentlemen playing in this film did a wonderful job portraying the group members. It was hard to not really see Eazy as Jason Mitchell presented him on film. O'Shea Jackson Jr did a phenomenal job as his father during his younger years. Corey Hawkins did a fantastic job portraying Dre. Well done Cube and Gray. Well done. The birth of a genre was well represented.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"OK movie, riding the Empire / Black Lives Matter train.","Overall it is an OK movie, especially if you lived thru this era. But most of the film is simply pulled from the headlines. And the parts that aren't are clearly over exaggerated. I was in my late teens and early 20s during the time period of this movie, so I remember a lot of these events. Especially when a lot of my friends were really into NWA. But there is a clear bias. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there was a lot of police harassment during this time period. And I wasn't there to see what happened in these situations. But you can clearly tell they over exaggerated some of the situations.As for the acting, they picked some perfect people to play each NWA part. You recognize them right away and their mannerisms were great. The only part I found to be over the top was Paul Giamatti. Which is sad, because he is one of my favorite actors. But if you imagine Paul playing an over the top corrupt producer, that's exactly what you get. It wasn't much of a stretch. But with Jerry Heller suing because the portrayal of him in the movie. Maybe they went to over the top.This movie is clearly riding the Black Lives matters and Empire Train. If this came out 3 years ago, it would of gotten a lot less attention. Like the movie Notorious. But it's another case where the critics are afraid to give an honest review, or else they'll be called racist. Same with the awards shows. But I keep my reviews honest and I think this deserves a 7 out of 10 at best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What is up with all the bad reviews? Can't handle the truth?,"growing up listening to the NWA, WTC etc. I enjoyed this biography to the fullest. The actors mimicking the artists was very believable. Loved how they truly depicted the story of the group.Don't understand why so many negative reviews. If it's vulgarity then these reviewers watch minimal amount of movies, mostly pg13 I believe.Fans will love this and if you weren't a fan before then this movie will make you one. I give it 10 because I can follow up with it and it really is nostalgic.Highly recommend it to anyone of appropriate age, if you are sensitive and can't bear 4-5 mins worth of nudity in the movie then it isn't for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Stunning Glimpse Into N.W.A.'s Tribulations and Legacy,"Ever since I can remember on Universal's 2002 semi-biopic 8 Mile, regarding how Eminem came to be (albeit name changed and loosely based on his life), I expected Straight Outta Compton was going to follow in that same fray. The moment the film began and completed it from start to finish, I was left bewildered and further curious on how much N.W.A. went through in the early 1990s, much like how Eminem wanted recognition in his skill despite his appearance and background. I may have been too young to understand what was going on in that era, but it piqued my interest even further since such harsh circumstances still reverberate in today's culture.The cast was profound. Jason Mitchell's take on the late Eazy-E was so spot-on and performed solidly as the one who basically held N.W.A. together. O'Shea Jackson Jr. does bear a striking resemblance of his own father Ice Cube and convincingly portrayed. While Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre certainly brought out the dramatic tension he faced when it came to confronting Death Row Records owner Suge Knight. And even Paul Giamatti's Jerry Heller - whom at one point had put their careers on the map until his methods were questioned altogether - felt suitable for Giamatti's skill in drama. For example, that one scene where Ice Cube leaves the group when he finds out about the contract deal the group would face individually when signed, I can already foresee what would immediately follow from there: diss tapes and retaliation (which was a big deal in the prime of the 90s).The entire film does live up to its namesake because it was all about five individuals whose lives weren't the best in the ghetto areas of Compton, yet their combined talents in writing music and shameless ways of expressing their lives in song really shook up the music industry, notably their hit song ""F*** tha Police"" which got them into serious law trouble during one stage performance. The Rodney King beating, L.A. Riots, and even the tragic loss of member Eazy-E greatly affected them, but despite the tribulations overtime, they certainly left a mark on hip-hop/rap culture that continues to influence newcomers in the business years later. Director F. Gary Gray (Friday) definitely provided a stunning glimpse into these mens' lives and I applaud him and the cast for showing how the hood is not entirely all what is believed. Surviving police brutality and racial injustice were just of the few problems they've endured. Among the many reviews I've read nitpicking how it's so ""offensive"" or ""noisy"" and this is actually ""erotic porn"" because of the gratuitous sex/nudity, pervasive language, and violence, the old-timers who despise such music seriously underestimate this movie without seeing what is trying to be accomplished here. Sure, they're nowhere perfect or classy (in the best sense), let alone heroes. But deep down it's expressed from the heart and a must-see for music enthusiasts of the old and new generation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rap as Art,"Everyone knows that this is the film that deserved better. The lack of diversity seen in the nominations of the past year makes little sense when there's a film like ""Straight Outta Compton"" out in the stratosphere. Thanks to this film an entire new generation of kids will know about the forbearers of gangsta rap. NWA revolutionized the genre, stood up to police brutality, censorship, and a predominantly classist society set to denigrate people and keep them in their place. Telling the story of the founding members of N.W.A. (Niggaz Wit Attitude), this film covers the group's rise to fame, and their eventual dissolution in the face of animosity and greed.""Straight Outta Compton"" was only nominated for Best Original Screenplay which is ridiculous. It could have taken ""Brooklyn"" or ""The Martian's"" place for Best Picture, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. or Jason Mitchell could have easily been nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the place of Sylvestor Stallone. I think it's important to note that when people choose which actors and properties get nominated, they aren't looking to what stories are most important, but who deserves what more. The Academy is made up predominantly of white men. This body decided that a film that tells a story unseen before, and hasn't been given the needed credence, deserved a nomination for telling its story, but not the actual story. Though this was an audience favorite, and is as polished and important as any bio-pic, it apparently didn't deserve the same respect as a film about an Irish immigrant who defecates in a bucket. Besides being an important story, this film covers a lot of history echoed in today's news. For one thing police brutality is a major issue in today's media, though it has been an occurrence since our country's formation. The media is only now taking note of the multiple deaths of African Americans and other minorities by police, as well as their patent racism in complying with stop and frisk and other discriminatory police procedurals. The film depicts the group as members of the Compton community, and they are often harassed and arrested by the LAPD. Their music fights the system and calls for action by society at large, but they don't want to incite violence or rioting. The Rodney King riots work as a backdrop for the group's dissension from one another, as well as a retread of current events, including the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner.The film has been accused of revisionist history which highlights the best of the group, but doesn't cover Arabian Prince's contribution to the group's start, or the domestic abuse by Dr. Dre on the women in his life, or the story of rap group J.J. Fad. Dr. Dre comes out of the film looking squeaky clean, which is unsettling, but for the most part it's a really spot on story. Most of the film deals with Ice Cube and Eazy-E's beef, their manager taking advantage of the situation to make a lot of money, and Eazy-E's illness and eventual death. This is definitely a film worth seeing, and one that deserved better than it got.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An incredible film that is about so much more than just NWA and succeeds on all levels,"Brought up in the UK in place about as far removed from Compton as The Moon NWA was a band that I could get into but not really fully appreciate the emotion and the anger behind the lyrics - that was until 'Boys in the Hood' came out. That movie brought a reality to foreign shores that gave us an insight into the birth place of this music. Now Straight Outta Compton gives you the story behind that music. I'll say out and out this is a MUST SEE SUPERB FILM which for me will rank as one of the most important films of all time. It probably wouldn't do the Police of the USA any harm if they sat and watched it then they actually might have a grasp of how they make people feel and in the light of the wave of Police brutality in America never has such a film been more relevant.The film itself charts the rise and fall of the group from their humble beginnings of sleeping out of cars and recording tracks in friends garages through to their internal beefs, eventual break up and the paths leading to the potential reunion that was cut short by the death of Eric Wright from HIV.So why is it so good? Well first off the performances of all the cast without exception incredibly well pitched. O'Shea Jackson as Ice Cube shows he can already hold his own against his father in his very first acting role while Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell play Dr.Dre and Easy E with a great deal of poise and sensitivity portraying them as flawed human beings and relating for me the films main theme - Division will always conqueror. Paul Giamatti brings a well rounded performance as the groups manager making it hard for you not to totally dislike him and so it should be.But its not just the acting - While telling the story of one of the most influential Rap groups of all time the film manages to make two very powerful statements -1) The fact that the issues the film raises about how a Police Force treats its citizens are even more relevant now than they were then. Rodney King was beaten some years after NWA was formed and what happened to him only reinforced the anger that NWA was articulating in their lyrics. A topic which middle class white America choose not to believe until they saw that video. Now this film serves the same purpose - It underscores what is happening in America now and the need more than ever for it to be addressed. The film may not have intended this but it achieves it 110%2) The internal conflicts in the black music industry are highlighted so successfully that it makes you realise how much such feuds only serve the cause of those who want to keep people in their place. The futility of being so divided all the time which ultimately comes from greed or in the cases of some an additional sadistic mentality. (Surge Knight) The divisions here broke friendships some of which could never be completely repaired. The death of Eric Wright was something that didn't get as much press in the UK as it did in the states and I was probably only more aware of it at the time because of my interest in NWA and having lost my own cousin to HIV a few years earlier. The film underlines the need within the black music community for artists to be more mutually supportive of each others work regardless of which coast their from and what neighbourhood they were born in.This film should be successful for all the right reasons and while it might not be 100% accurate for it to contain so much power in a film of two hours twenty minutes is nothing short of superb. It will of course be criminally overlooked at the Oscars I am sure. The film will serve as the perfect companion to Filmmaker Dylan Avery's documentary about Police corruption when it is released. I have no doubt what so ever that Eric Wright would be incredibly proud of all involved. This is the film that not only NWA deserve but all the people who ever grew up in Compton too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton delivers a raw and emotional movie that will stand for generations,"Straight Outta Compton delivers a raw, edgy, and powerful film that is built to last for generations to come. Starting in 1987, a group of 5 individuals start what came to be, a musical movement that came in like a tidal wave. They together formed the group N.W.A and with their powerful lyrics, strong wills, and big dreams, they got the ball rolling for the hip hop and rap music industry that we see today. This movie does an excellent job of showing the hardships that these men had to go through. The racist cops, the threats from the FBI, and the government and media want to censor their art. They were given a voice with their music and the were not going to be silenced. Police tried to silence them and were subject to racism and misconduct, This can resonate with the people and the movement that is happening right now. The casting department for this movie did an excellent job of filling the giant shoes of the musical giants Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and more. Most of these were fairly unknown actors but each one of them did an outstanding job. The music and the style they portrayed were spot on and this lead to a fantastic soundtrack throughout the movie. This movie would be almost perfect if it wasn't for the side stories that they brought in throughout the later half of the movie. Without giving too much away, I felt that bringing in these stories may have lost some of the emotion and the intensity that had been building up throughout the movie. This movie has done an excellent job of its presentation of the hip hop and rap revolution in a fun, entertaining, and historical fashion. I would highly recommend seeing this film.Average Man Score: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Flawed and generic narrative of NWA, praise for O'Shea Jackson Jr.","NWA was the pivotal rap group in the late 80's to mid 90's that created the sound of the generation. Straight Outta Compton attempts to tell their story from their roots in Compton to their eventual and inevitable break up.The members of NWA that the film follows are MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy- E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, but the story primarily focuses on the latter three and the disagreements that led to NWA's demise. Simultaneously, Straight Outta Compton examines the societal landscape and cultural turmoil happening at the time that led to the voices of NWA being heard and celebrated.The sheer volume of narrative that needs to be told in the film is gargantuan. Unfortunately for the screenwriters Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, they are not successful and the whole story feels like a Wikipedia version of NWA. A film of this size should reveal some additional unknown information or motivation, and it fails to do so. Further the constant contemplation upon the LA riots and that time period feels overly forced to reflect our current situation, a heavy handed and unnecessarily graceless approach.The other greatest criticism is its dollar store approach to the costume and hair design on the film. Perhaps it is because the 90's weren't that long ago that those alive recall the style and fashion, but it's pretty abominable in Straight Outta Compton. None of the actors look to be comfortable in their garbs and the limited diversity in outfits leads the audience to believe each character only had one costume each. The whole look of the time created in Straight Outta Compton is immediately off-putting and difficult to get past.The film isn't all bad, and the best decision the filmmakers made was to get Ice Cube's real son to portray Ice Cube in the film. Not only does O'Shea Jackson Jr. look startlingly similar to his father, but his performance is the only complex one. Rather than reverting to a constant scowl and mean mugging the camera, his performance is of a man across many years. O'Shea is the only actor able to rise above his poor costuming and inhabit the role completely, then again, he has had his whole life to observe his father.The story behind Straight Outta Compton was always going to be a difficult task, but to those aware of the NWA story, it could have been better. In the end, it feels like a highlight reel, glossing over the details to help audiences fully understand the inner- workings of its downfall and the complex happenings between Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. And for a film about a music group, more rap and hip-hop music from the time would have been greatly appreciated.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An Ambitious Movie that Nails it on almost every level possible,"This isn't just about NWA and it's Members and their lives.This is about everything America is, everything America can be and everything America was. For that I give this movie a 9/10 because if it were just a movie about NWA like a VH-1 ""Where are they Now"" well, I would've hated it.At the core of this Movie is something special. I'm sure people want to focus on the language but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I thought it would be and in fact as the Movie progresses and as we see the Members become more Mature the Language and the Violence lessens and lessens. The language wasn't half as bad as what some folks have written and I wonder if they actually watched the movie or if they watched the first 30minutes and said ""Well there's a lot of potty mouths in this movie"". I've watched movies that were popular and have had dramatically less foul language than this.I'm saying that the language as a negative is pretty much bullshit. There wasn't really that much bad language and a lot of scenes it was quite the opposite, probably 80% of the movie has nothing to do with being ""Gangster"" or really anything to do with anything illegal.What this movie shows are people with a dream trying to rise out of the social accepted ""norm"" set for them. It's not just about the movie tackling social-political issues but at the core it's about people, people just like me, just like you, just like anyone who wants to be better than just ""Surviving"", or ""Getting by"".It is at it's very core a success story about the American Dream and it doesn't matter the setting or the race of people or anything of that nature. It's about these people struggling to find what all of us are motivated by and what this Country was founded on and how they pressed the times to change and by doing that created a path for them and others who are ambitious enough to try.I can't say enough about the movie and it's positives FAR outweigh it's negatives (at least anyone willing to look at this for what it is and not what they WANT it to be).I could write more about everything it did right and it did almost everything right, it is as close to perfect as it could be.Now for the negatives, very few (hence the 9/10) the only 2 negatives I really have are: Pacing and some of the Characters got lost.Even though the movie was about 2 hours and some change it didn't really lag at any point, it was very fast and went straight to major events in each characters lives. Some Characters (Dre/E/Cube) had more events of interest and so they got more time but it makes sense because honestly if you know NWA then you know it was those 3 who were the most interesting but having said that, to be unbiased I have to say that Ren (who had some notable scenes and story) got lost as well as Yella and even though DOC wasn't in NWA he was in the Movie and was a bigger deal to the group then the 2-3 scenes we saw him in. Also those 3 had very little speaking lines and felt more like a glorified extra's.That's fine though because like I said; Cube/Dre/E were the 3 people that were the most interesting and so because of that I only took a few pts off for that but still an overwhelmingly GREAT FILM.If you have an open-mind, a decent brain and want to see a movie that can inspire as well as provide GREAT ENTERTAINMENT; then I highly recommend this because this movie IS the American DREAM come TRUE and not something from the 1920s either; literally we get to see how people turn nothing into something of legend.Anyone who doesn't ""get"" this movie is doing so because they have their own biased to deal with.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Go see if you're an NWA fan, or a movie fan in general!","I loved LOVED LOVED this movie!!!! NWA was always my favorite rap group so this movie was just a blast for me. This movie definitely exceeded my expectations. This is among one of the best biopics I've ever seen. This has drama, comedy, action, thrills, and above all, and incredible soundtrack! I was also surprised at how well directed this was. It's got to be the best thing F. Gary Gray has ever done. The cinematography for this movie was surprisingly gorgeous, especially for the earlier scenes that take place in the 80's. It just has this beautiful golden glow that was just incredible. considering the cast of school the bunch of unknowns I thought the acting wasn't going to be the best.....it turns out that it was fantastic!!!! Everybody in the film gives a great performance! Even in the emotional scenes, they deliver. There is some great talent in this film and I feel like these actors should get recognized after this film. Paul Giamatti was great as usual. Only problem for me was that MC Ren's character was underdeveloped. Maybe he wasn't as popular as Dre, E, and Cube, but he felt sort of left out of the drama. We get to know every character in the movie (even DJ Yella), but Ren was just kinda there. Either way, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie.

If you grew up with NWA then you'll LOVE this film! It's AWESOME!,"Wow... I mean.... just... wow. Bravo, bravo, bravo! ""Straight Outta Compton"" is not just good, but I'll have to put it up there with my ""must see"" movies of all time for so called ""black movies."" You know, there are certain movies that you simply HAVE to have seen in order to keep your ""ghetto pass"" or your ""black card."" Well, this is one of THOSE kind of movies.It's been awhile since I've seen a film worthy of a real, in-depth critical review. Because this movie was made with me in mind, I will give this critique its just due. Let's start off with the screenplay.There were about five white dudes who put together this story that black director, F. Gary Gray, brought to life on the silver screen. The story begins just before NWA is formed and ends as Dr. Dre exits Death Row Records to start Aftermath--his very own record label. What happened in between is one of the most compelling dramas I've seen on film. Because I lived through the entire arc of the film, I couldn't help but to be overcome by its nostalgia and it's gripping narrative. I was literally reliving my ""coming of age"" years along with the film's protagonists. The story drew me in from the opening scene and ran the gamut of emotions until the closing credits. Note: the film's epilogue is worth sticking around for because it features a litany of stars both past and present who owe their careers to N.W.A.No good story or great director can make a movie truly special without a great cast. I was very skeptical about the casting of ""Straight Outta Compton"" because only Paul Giamatti was a known quantity going into this project. However, I will give credit where it's due; O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., and Aldis Hodge did a tremendous job as Cube, Dre, Eazy, Yella, and Ren. Jason Mitchell really delivers a standout performance as Eazy-E. There are some truly unforgettable scenes that this young brother absolutely KILLED. The supporting cast was also noteworthy portraying such icons as Tupac, Warren G, Snoop Dogg, Chuck D, and Suge Knight.I had heard a lot of chatter prior to seeing ""Straight Outta Compton,"" and much of it was less than positive. My biggest fear is that it would be like that manish woman, Wendy Williams' absolute disgrace of a biopic on the late, great Aaliyah. When I heard that F. Gary Gray was directing the film, some of my trepidation waned. When I heard just a few days ago that Oprah said it was ""powerful,"" I felt really good about the prospects of this film actually doing justice to these rap music pioneers and living legends. I can say now with full confidence that ""Straight Outta Compton"" did NWA justice. This ain't no after school special, and it definitely ain't no ""made-for-tv"" bullcrap. This film is legit in every sense of the word. From it's expensive production values to it's attention to detail with respect to the period, to the amazing soundtrack, this film is straight DOPE! I can't wrap up my review without talking about the centerpiece of this whole movie--the MUSIC! Oh...my...dayum! The music in ""Straight Outta Compton"" goes HAM!!! I'm an ol' skool music connoisseur anyway, but coming into my own in the early nineties really made the music of that era resonate with me in a uniquely powerful way. I literally knew every word of every song featured in the movie! I don't think I've ever been able to say that about a film before. From N.W.A.'s classics to Ice Cube's solo classics, to Tupac's ""Hail Mary,"" to Dr. Dre's ""Chronic"" album (arguably the greatest rap album of all time), the soundtrack of this film keeps you moving from start to finish. The official soundtrack by Dr. Dre features new songs, but the music that's actually featured in the film literally transported me back to some of the greatest times in my life. There's a scene where Dr. Dre and Snoop are coming up with ""Nuthin But a G Thang"" that will make 1993 come alive right before your very eyes! It was oh so very, very DOPE! Go see ""Straight Outta Compton"" this weekend. It's the best film I've seen in a long time. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll get mad as hell. You'll learn something you didn't know before. You'll think. You'll gain a new respect and a new appreciation for the struggle of being a black man growing up in AmeriKKKa. You'll celebrate how a group of young brothers from South Central Los Angeles took nothing but their God-given talent and an ""NWA mentality"" and conquered the world. 5 Big Starz for ""Straight Outta Compton."" #filmcritic",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A film with a message that will transcend generations,"When it comes to biopics, I can proudly say that 'Straight Outta Compton' now ranks as one of my favourites. Ever since seeing the trailer, I just knew that it was going to be something that mainstream audiences had yet to experience. The film holds no punches when showing the rise and fall of N.W.A – it introduces a level of intensity rarely seen in biopics. F. Gary Gray and his crew did a wonderful job in recreating some - if not most - of the rap group's defining experiences (with all the violence, racism, and betrayal any N.W.A fan would come to expect). The film also dives deep into each of the rapper's personal lives (or at least that of Eazy-E's, Dr. Dre's, and Ice Cube's) – displaying a sense of compassion and togetherness that's just as hard to forget as the brutality and grittiness.The three lead actors - O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (Ice Cube), Corey Hawkins (Dr. Dre), and Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) - all give great performances. However, if I had to choose one actor who particularly stood out, I would have to pick Jason Mitchell. His performance as the late rapper Eazy-E is gold. Despite not having any guidance from his counterpart like his co-stars, I felt as if Mitchell essentially made the role all on his own. From his character's rough beginnings as a drug dealer all the way to his depressing battle with HIV, Mitchell owns almost every scene he's in (it also doesn't hurt that his story-arc is the most dynamic of all the other characters'). I wouldn't be surprised if the cast of 'Straight Outta Compton' was nominated for some 'Best Ensemble' or 'Best Cast' awards.The script is amazingly well-written. This is probably the only biopic that I have watched where I wasn't checking the time on my phone at certain parts; there wasn't a moment when I lose interest while watching ''Straight Outta Compton'. Simply said, there is never a dull moment. The pacing works. The structuring isn't confusing. All the emotional moments hit at the right time. And although it doesn't seem like there's a clear external goal for the characters to achieve (actually, there are several goals), this film works brilliantly as a character study.SIDENOTE: I'm well aware of the release date for this film and certain events that have preceded it. However, for all intents and purposes, I will not be commenting on the socio-political aspects of this film. Aside from the fact that I like to keep focus of my reviews on the film itself rather than divulge into reality, I also believe that this film speaks with a strong, uncompromising voice that's hard to ignore. I don't believe the producers could have picked a better time to release this film.I am adamant that 'Straight Outta Compton' will be remembered throughout generations. It is easily one of the best films I've seen in theatres this year and one that will make its way into many top ten lists by the end of this year. Everything – from the acting to the direction, to the production value – is top-notch. If you can somehow stomach the tough reality that these young men had to go through, then you'll find yourself watching a truly complex and profound masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Giving N.W.A. the Respect They Deserve,"Straight Outta Compton (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.) are the main focus of this film that takes a look at the rise and fall of N.W.A. and the various other people that their style of music influenced.STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON has been attacked by some for white-washing certain elements but I don't think that's too fair. I mean, any film that deals with a ""real"" story is going to be altered for one reason or another so I don't bash any movie that changes things around. With that said, I thought the movie did a very good job at telling the story of this group and the impact they had on the culture at the time but it also serves as an education to the people who think current music is new or original.Director F. Gary Gray does a terrific job at keeping the entertainment level extremely high throughout the picture and even with its long running time the movie never feels too long and in fact there are many elements that could have been extended on. I think the greatest thing the film accomplishes is that it gives people are clear idea of what the culture was at the time and how this group really knocked down all sorts of doors. I was a music fan when these albums were originally released and it was something fresh and original.The screenplay manages to hit not only on the music side of the group but I thought it paid great attention to the three main characters as well as the manager played by Paul Giamatti. I thought the character development was excellent and not something you usually see in these types of movies. Another major plus were the performances with the entire cast doing an excellent job in their roles. The real stand out Mitchell who is simply wonderful as Eazy-E and really brings a lot of depth to the role. Giamatti also deserves a lot of credit for a very powerful performance.As you'd expect, the music is wonderful and there's no doubt that it's a terrific looking movie. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly one of the year's better movie. What was so surprising is the fact that it really does have a heart to it and this is especially scene towards the end when Eazy-E begins to get sick.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Should have been better,"This is a movie that should have been more than the sum of its parts. It should have been about young gifted artists who transcend the horrors of their environment, their upbringing (though none of them had abusive families here), and discovered either themselves or were given insight into how the world works. Especially now that we know more about police brutality and the school to prison pipeline.But unfortunately, this doesn't happen. If we take this movie as fact, how does a young drug dealer who can't stay on beat suddenly become a rapper and perform in front of sold out crowds. And since Ice Cube (one of my favorite actors) is the one with the real talent, it doesn't show here with his penned lyrics . . . until we hear Straight Outta Compton. That was tight.But how did he get there. After a few more songs, I didn't hear genius anymore, just a lot of repetition. Yes, his lyrics captured the reality of his environment, but that's all it did, and it did glamorize violence. It did nothing to portray the sadness, the tears, the tragedy in his life. Just a lot of banging ho's and shooting up n*ggas. I'm sorry, but I believe the real life NWA did more than that.Unless I'm wrong. I hope not. They gave their community a voice but did little else but play into the game of police brutality and incarcerating their brothers and sisters. I only wish they had the insight to have done more in life and in fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Beautiful movie,"This is the most important movie of the year, in this time when race relations in this country are so strained. I am so glad that someone has finally produced a truthful movie showing the view of individuals growing up in a violent society and the challenges that each and every one of them faces. The most telling scene was that of a young Ice Cube on a bus - just a high school student writing poetry - when he is exposed to gang intimidation and violence. This was not my experience growing up in white suburbia, when I rode along in the safety of my school-bus in the mid 1980's, writing morose poetry (which I thought at the time to be rebellious, but was just an outpouring of boring adolescent melancholia as opposed to true suffering.) Rap is poetry and I truly loved the insight provided by that single scene of the sweet, observant soul of the poet becoming witness to what will inspire his verse.

Basics of a great story,"Straight Outta Compton is a failed attempt to tell the story of NWA/Eazy E's story. A rap group of the late 80's through to the mid 90's. This came across more of a highlight reel, with facts thrown together, than a flowing film. I am not sure how a screenwriter could tackle the daunting task of telling this story without it losing something. The story and people are very complex.I like NWA and I like their music. Having been there through the whole story, there isn't one thing in this movie that I didn't already know. Which was disappointing.In the beginning it felt like I was watching theater more than a movie. Soon it would pick up pace and the music kicked in and it helped keep my interest. Without the music the film would have been terribly dull to watch.O'Shea Jackson Jr. not only portrays his father, Ice Cube, superbly, but the depth of his acting was so on point he became the best part of the whole movie. He, in my opinion, is the star of this film.If you are not aware of the story, go see this movie. But don't expect more than an encyclopedia insight into what really happened.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Discovering the Legacy of N.W.A,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I only recognized a few names, like Ice Cube or Dr. Dre, but I had never really taken the time to listen to their music or learn about their story. To say that I didn't even know those two artists were connected in some way is enough. Clearly, that was a huge mistake on my part because their story is simply fascinating. It also involves many artists I wasn't expecting, like 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, and others.For this reason, I think the writers did an excellent job summarizing such a complex and vast history into something that's not only entertaining but also allows you to feel their world, even if just for a brief moment. This is clearly also thanks to F. Gary Gray, who did an outstanding job, especially with scenes and shots that felt almost tangible, in intimate spaces, and with a rhythm that perfectly reflected the emotion of the moment.Additionally, the acting was undeniably flawless, and although everyone did an excellent job, I have to highlight O'Shea Jackson Jr., not just because he's a perfect replica of his father, but also because of his effort, which was evident throughout the movie. In fact, he might have been one of my favorite characters-at least considering how much or how little was shown of him.Lastly, I must admit that the music isn't a genre I typically prefer, but I liked it so much that I'm going to spend a couple of weeks listening to all the songs they created during that era. That said, I wasn't completely ignorant either, as the popularity of ""F* Tha Police"" was massive at the time, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic film,"I enjoyed this thoroughly.

Informative and entertaining biopic about one of music's greatest moments.,"""I can make you legit."" Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti)So he does make the gangsta rappers legit and wealthy and famous. Straight Outta Compton is a chronology of the hip-hop movement from unknown songs about LAPD oppression of black youths to big-business music, whose money makes for distorted friendships and cut-throat tactics. N.A.W. (Niggaz with Attitude) grew universally popular, similar to the Beatles, so fast as to be almost unbelievable.It's all in the lyrics. For some of us not versed in the vernacular and history of rap, this biopic is helpful putting the history together. Less helpful than that is the film's depiction of how the powerful lines were formed. Only a few shots of Ice Cube's (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) notebooks give you an idea of the process. The irony of Cube's creating his famous anthem, F--k Tha Police, after several abusive run-ins with LAPD, does help me see origins.But then, I am always disappointed that these musical biopics don't give enough insight into the creative process of its artists. Maybe that's an impossible task.However, I should say the sequence involving Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) coaxing out a performance from Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) of his groundbreaking hit, ""boyz n the hood,"" is instructive and humorous. As bad a boy as Dre might have been, his stewardship of the rappers is clearly fundamental to their success. I would have liked more imagining of these crucial creative moments.Not to say, however, the film slights the influence of such moguls as Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor), who built the success of Death Row on the backs of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dog, too many times with violence a main ingredient.The film, to its detriment, downplays the importance of their crime glorification and misogynist themes (tossing a naked woman into the hallway and locking the door behind her!). The absence of the competition such as De La Soul, Public Enemy, and Eminem is lamentable. Then, what could be expected from two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre? Straight Outta Compton is an energetic, informative take on a musical movement in the USA that rocked the world.""Nothing wrong with being from the hood. But I'd rather my kids be visitors than residents."" Ice Cube",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The rise of the Rap music!,"There were lots of debate over this film's snub from the Oscars, but I'm not here to talk about that. As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.One thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.This film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Don't believe in the haters/trolls,"First of all, its pretty obvious that this is a movie about teens growing up in a really bad neighborhood who suddenly become famous (and rich) for their rapping and lyrics. Further its pretty obvious what boys will do if they suddenly have a bunch of fame and cash. What do people expect? Seems to me like all the bad reviews of this movie is written by religious freaks that somehow traveled in time from the eighteen hundreds and was shocked to see that people actually use curse- words, drink alcohol and use prostitutes if they are young, rich and famous. It actually amazes me to read all the bad reviews. People are saying that the movie is disgusting and it goes on and on about how shocked they are about it in general. Grow up and simply avoid movies that isn't all about rainbows and angels if you cant handle the truth or real life.Now for the movie... I just love movies about people who come from nothing and end up having it all. Its a nice way to daydream and think ""what would i have done"". The movie is entertaining and it was interesting to see the story behind each song and the history of rap music and this group. I was really surprised because of my low expectations (eight mile)..Give this a go and be entertained. Avoid it if you cant handle reality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
THE ACCURATE REVIEW,"Dear loyal followers,Its time for an accurate, real and correct review of this off the scale 11/10 masterpiece. Lets start by analysing the techniques used to bring us this joyous, heartbreaking, emotionally warming and politically correct societal blockbuster hit. The use of actors was rather exciting, especially O'shea Jackson Jr playing the Angel of the lord himself - Ice Cube. Now many of you out there may criticise my beliefs and ideologies of how the genius Cube himself, is portrayed on his past experiences and work but not forgetting his colleagues who have made big success. Being a black man in the 80s was known to be quite traumatic and racist, so to see a group of young black rappers succeed was simply absurd but developed to be iconically phenomenal and game changing for the music industry as a whole. The music can I say made me feel quite peaceful and the classic hit '*UCK THA POLICE' is a song I listen to every morning for my daily meditation but also what I share with my clients to show them whatever you are going through is not that bad and it will be okay in the end. To all the haters out here I have one message 'go suck a duck', I shall change that word by simply replacing with a 'd', because most of you have 7pm bed curfews, and can not restrain from powerful language. This movie was beautifully crafted to reveal the true struggles of ethnic minorities. I will tell y'all a little secret, me and Ice go back a long way we have had our arguments over creative talent - ice always wins, which I think is fairly evident in this review of our lives. Now I have his digits on my cell, I won't hesitate to give him a call and arrange a little meet up with all you dictators.

"Straight Outta Compton contains the right beats and lyrics to rise outta the ghetto, even if it trudges in schmaltzy tropes","We are what our environment makes us. I grew up in a small town that has grown, but I like to imagine how different I would have become if my parents would have stayed in the Los Angeles area. Perhaps I might have been more troubled or perhaps not. I grew up in Long Beach for a few years before we moved, but I wasn't old enough to have had any influence. The area wasn't dangerous, or at least nowhere near as dangerous as the city of Compton was.Compton, California tends to have a reputation as one of the most ghetto cities in the world. I don't think it would be put on any list, but if you were to get off the 91 freeway twenty years ago for a car trip, it would be a bit easier to make a case. The entire city of Los Angeles was in a gang problem with the Crips and Bloods in an everlasting melee, yet Compton seemed to be the center of it. The area was a probably black community and it didn't help that the law enforcement was anything but sympathetic and came around to simple harass. Coming Straight Outta Compton was a group that would use it's message from the streets to create a different side of rap.In Compton in 1986, five friends Dr. Dre (played by Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (played by O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), Eazy-E (played by Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (played by Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (played by Neil Brown, Jr.) form a new hip hop group N.W.A with the goal of putting their hard views of city living and gang warfare within their raps. Their first single, ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" catches the ear of a music business man, Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti) whose been looking to get back into management.Eazy-E works out the deal with Haller, making him the manager for N.W.A. while Eazy-E starts his own label, Ruthless Records. Haller gives them the resources to make their next album, but the guys are still harassed by law enforcement. The album, Straight Outa Compton, is a smash hit, making the group popular by mainstream crowds and giving them their first tour. When not paid for his written work, Ice Cube leaves the group to embark on a solo career while Dr. Dre signs on to Death Row Records. Each guy takes different route in the music business as L.A. continues it's crime problems leading to the 1992 L.A. Riots. Bio pics are a dime a dozen and need a hook to stand out. Straight Outta Compton has the right beat and does well as a storyfor a while.The strongest elements here are the production value and acting. Straight Outa Compton has some of the best recreated concert footage since The Doors. When the concert in Detroit was commencing, I almost forgot I was watching a movie and that I was watching a documentary. All five boys resemble their counterparts in a way that adds to the documentary argument. Even watching O'Shea Jackion (who also happens to be Ice Cube's son) sing ""F**k the Police"" was freaky with how much he resembles Ice Cube.The movie is standard as a bio pic I would have ruled it as an entertaining piece of music history had it not been for the unnecessary last forty five minutes. Without giving away who it is, one character coughs and the movie embarks on the trope of padding it until they die twenty minutes later. It's predictable and easily could have been cut and implied instead. As sad as a death in the family is, the movie needed to make it's cuts and choices a bit better for the sake of a flowing story.I'll give it seven Straight Outa Compton albums out of ten. For what it is, I'm glad I saw this. It's a needed look to understand why a song like ""F**k the Police"" would be made and how people would misunderstand it's intention.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Horrible Movie!,"I really tried to look at this movie with an open mind although this type of movie isn't really my cup of tea anyway so to speak. It was awful to say the least with no cohesive plot whatsoever! It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the ""thug"" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on ""Hip Hop"" culture. Just not a good movie in any way, shape, or form. Do not go see!

A film about hip hop for people who know nothing about hip hop.,"Straight out of the gate we are launched into the turbulent lives of the young men that would eventually become the mega stars that have become synonymous with the hip hop musical genre. The film focuses on the men that would eventually form the NWA and their rise to stardom and provides a commentary on the state of racism in America in the late 80's to early 90's and what the foundation of their musical movement was made from. The film takes us from the inception of the NWA and charts the history up until the creation of Dr Dres Aftermath record label in 1996.I will preface this with I have a very limited understanding of rap and hip hop. I enjoy it, I have listened to a multitude of albums but would not consider myself an aficionado. Regardless of your interest in the music director F. Gary Gray handles the material with skill. You are invested in the plights of these young men, who are at times fairly unlikeable and I found myself wrapped up in the narrative of the sheer craziness that happened behind the scenes when this music first came onto the scene. F. Gary Gray gets an awful lot out of his cast particularly with O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who turns in an excellent performance as his father Ice Cube.As a piece of work studying a moment in history it is eye opening and I believe captures the mood of the moment exceptionally well. However it must be said it must be taken with a slight pinch of salt regarding its overall accuracy. I don't know the history well enough but after some brief reading, one of the main points of controversy is the handling of the groups manager Jerry Heller, played here by Paul Giamatti who is clearly having a very good time and how the the events between him and the group are depicted (I believe a lawsuit was ongoing at the time of Hellers death in 2016).Accuracy concerns aside there is much to enjoy here even if you have no interest in the music. The narrative is well handled and the performances from all involved get you wrapped up in the drama. I do believe it was Aaron Sorkin that said 'don't let the truth get in the way of a good story'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Closed Minded people just won't get it.,"When you read the reviews on here, it's literally them complaining about the language, the message they were saying, it lacking and just hatred with rap music. Not stirring the political pot, right wings can have their voice but the left can't which is ridiculous. 1. The film depicts the reality of life on the streets so language is going to be strong (it is R rated), if that's a problem don't watch the movie. 2. They exercised their first amendment rights by speaking the truth about what's going on in areas that people don't frequent so it'll be a shock when viewing something that is new to you. 3. Too many people hate rap music for language, what they rap about, etc. Rap isn't for everyone but for those who can use it and channel their anger and express themselves, it gives way for some raw lyrics and great beats. But you can't go too hard or they'll get mad for speaking your mind in song. No one ever complains about all that Satanic rock music or rock music speaking about killing yourself and death but you hear the B word in a rap song and it's the end of the world. So in short, stop complaining about music you don't understand, and culture you choose not to associate with. Plenty of people of all color and background embrace rap music and this movie so what's the problem? I went and saw it amongst a mixed crowd and lot of men (white, Black, Hispanic) in their late 40's and early 50's watching it because the impact the group had on them which is powerful. Yes they left some things out, but what biopic is 100 percent accurate? The acting was on point especially O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins. So instead of bashing it because of language or what not, research the group and what the filmmakers captured instead of spewing your hate towards because you're offended. They didn't come together to make friends, they wanted to bring the reality or Hood and urban areas to the mainstream which still rings true today with police brutality and racism at an all time high.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

What I Expected - Nice Portrayal of These Rappers,"Having my experience of growing up around LA county, I would say the movie may have been a bit dramatic on some police scenes, except the scene of Rodney King, however, It truly reflects the racial tension and abuse of freedom of past, and possible present, LAPD behavior.I'm not defending gang violence, but the truth of police abuse of authority is real in many areas, especially the history of LAPD.With that said, I don't understand the sensitivity of some reviews that one-side this as racism, reality is reality.With that aside, the movie itself done very well on showing the semi-biography on how these primary rappers made it through tempting times and rose up to become very successful in their careers.The movie will speak for itself as far as how well people receive it, and I believe it's off to a great start with Box Office Numbers like It received.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Music history well told.,"Straight Outta Compton is an entertaining film based on the historical rap group NWA.Directed by F Gary Gray, (famed for the award winning ""Boyz n The Hood""), and help from mega producer Dr. Dre and Ice Cube.

Events of police brutality and harassment, could easily make todays news.Like any film, it's not for everyone. Yes, it's mature but it doesn't have unapt or gratuitous sex or violence. Authentic depictions and content steer the biopics' story line. If I made a story about sheep, expect to see a wool. A biopic, based on the first gangsta' rap group, who's most famous song is titled,""F**K Da' Police!"", probably shouldn't be seen by the easily offended.That in mind, I recommend this film for mature movie goers of all stripes.

solid biodrama,"It's 1987. Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) are trying to put out reality rap. They get reluctant Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and they form N.W.A. Faded producer Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) helps Eazy-E create Ruthless. They sign with Bryan Turner at Priority Records. Suge Knight (R. Marcus Taylor) is a hustler always around. During their initial success, Ice Cube refuses to sign with Jerry and later decides to go on as a solo act. These young men rise out of the gang-infested, LAPD-harassed Compton to give voice to a new generation.There is a great energy surrounding this biopic. The actors are solid. The fact that I don't recognize them as actors make it easier for them to fade into the roles. Of course, the story is compelling. There seems to be a little bit of papering some parts of their history. That's perfectly expected especially with the participation of these artists. Without them, the movie wouldn't be made.

Straight Outta Cinema,"Being someone that doesn't care at all about the history of this music group, let alone rap and hip-hop itself, Straight Outta Compton was a little hard for me to settle into. At first it reminded me of eighties gangster films, before leaping into some 8 Mile type of film. Purely a personal thing, Straight Outta Compton neither made me enjoy the film, nor convert me to the hip-hop dark side.Though I respect the film and the hardships the rap group went through, Straight Outta Compton was not a film I really would invest my time into. In a current society where the golden age of hip-hop is emerging, I find myself running behind the bus, or realistically taking a different path. Not a film for all, but still somewhat fun to endure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well done,"Straight Outta Compton deserves it's top spot in the box office. The negative reviews I've seen focus on the excessive obscenity in this movie, but honestly to those reviewers: what did you expect? This movie is about a rap group that popularized the use of excessive explicit obscene language and themes in rap music in order to portray the harsh realities of their daily lives. I think one drawback of this movie is that it does gloss over the not-so-pretty pasts of individual N.W.A members (ex: Dr. Dre's history of abuse towards women), but if you're going into this movie expecting it not to have graphic scenes of violence, sex, nudity and profanity, then you must have severely misinterpreted the trailer and forgotten what this film is about and who produced it.My two cents on ""Straight Outta Compton,"" for what it's worth is that it is a well done movie. As I mentioned, some ugly details are glossed over and embellished, but otherwise from my preliminary research, I think this movie doesn't do a bad job of telling N.W.A's story. The acting is superb and compelling. Ice Cube's son as Ice Cube was perfect, and I don't think anyone would have captured his essence any better than Oshea Jackson Jr did. I can say the same for pretty much all the other casting decisions. (Shout out to actor that plays Tupac - he has a 5 minute scene, and except for when he talks - he NAILS the look completely!) Great movie overall, especially if you're into this type of music.

Black Eye For Rap Culture,"I think the sins of the various police departments across the nation are getting pretty well documented. That said, I have rarely seen a more thuggish, criminal and misogynistic portrayal of rap culture. Women have NO role in NWA beyond being sex toys. Dr Dre is portrayed as the good guy in all the chaos of cheating managers and out of control band members. That white hat portrayal is spoiled, however, by his motivations for cutting ties with the criminal elements around him. His motivation was that they were stealing from him, not that they were criminals. Had they not stolen from him, he was happy as a clam to be surrounded by criminals and thugs.

"Great movie, even if you're not into hip-hop or rap","Great movie, even if you're not into hip-hop or rap (and I generally am not).The true story of the hip-hop / rap band NWA who emerged from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles to be the voice of African- Americans living on the wrong side of the tracks.Much more than just a movie about a hip-hop / rap, but a movie about social injustice and police brutality. At the very least it can be taken as an example of the rise, fall and aftermath of a band, and the pluses and minuses of the music industry, especially its seedy side.Good performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr, playing Ice Cube, his father, Corey Hawkins as Dr Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E and Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, NWA's manager. Solid supporting cast.Not perfect though: the movie does drift in the latter third or so. It's as if the writers and director didn't know when to end it, or at least know how to compress the post-breakup era into something succinct and engaging. I realise that the story of Eazy-E had to be told, but there surely must have been a quicker and/or more engaging way to tell that part of the story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

They had something to say!,"Straight Outta the theater! (But not really, I gave myself two days to process the film.)OK I'll be the first to admit-originally I wasn't 100% sold on seeing the movie. It was from hearing very high praise from friends and family that watched the trailer that made me want to see it in theaters. That being said, the highly impressive reviews that came out opening weekend would have made me go see the film regardless of what others told me.I went into the film knowing pretty much nothing about the group NWA. I knew Dr Dre. & Ice Cube were in it and I had heard a few songs. My lack of knowledge did not stop me from loving this film.From the first scene, the audience gets sucked into an intense situation, and I found myself quickly forgetting that I was at a theater. The film introduces the characters one by one and eventually we witness them connect with one another.Seeing the way their lives played out was non-stop entertainment. The actors portraying the characters all gave amazing performances. The casting really nailed choosing the correct actors because I had to keep reminding myself that these weren't the real members of NWA. Even cameos of popular artists stood out to me because the casting was perfect. Everything from their look, their lines, and most notably their voices, made the scenes memorable.The soundtrack, of course, was one huge aspect to the film. The songs were always put into scenes at the perfect moment. The beats and the lyrics always matched with the mood of the scene, and I found myself nodding along with a lot of the songs. The flow of the movie was also very well-done. The scenes were so smooth that you don't realize the films over two hours & 20 minutes long.This film is one that won't leave you. I went home after seeing it and immediately went to look up more facts about NWA. I keep finding myself replaying the scenes in my mind. It's one that I could see myself seeing again in theaters!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Almost Perfect! If all history could be that fun to learn.,"I have been waiting 2 plus years to write a review for this film. 1988 changed my life when a friend dubbed me ""Straight outta Compton"" and Eazy Duz It. My 9 year old brain blew! I was worried that this film would come off corny. Knowing the characters has such a big part in the scripting and production made me nervous. This is not just a biography of a rap group, this is the birth of West Coast Rap and Gangsta Rap period! Enough props. Let's get to it...The acting is amazing! The actors portraying the subjects are on point! Never does it seem overwritten or polished. Everyone is given their respects for their parts played and emotions aren't held back for the point of toughing these Gangsta Rappers. The human element is ever present and encouraged. Jason Mitchell deserves praise for his portrayal of Eric Eazy- E Wright! To go from crack dealing gang banger to the legendary figure dying from Aids, that tall order is filled almost effortlessly. Corey Hawkins as Dr.Dre was a great fit. O'Shea Jackson Jr deserves credit for his efforts to play his father. He deserved the role. Neil Brown Jr. (Dj Yella) and Aldis Hodge (Mc Ren)aren't as big of a role in the film which feels awkward if your a fan because they feel less important (In My Opinion). Paul Giamatti ( Jerry Heller) played the role well. Jerry was more a faceless character. Interviews with him at the release of the film didn't seem optimistic. He wasn't consulted about the part and I personally think it was a fair and just portrait. All in all, the actors did an amazing job translating the real life to the screen. So why the 9 instead of a 10??I have learned to take reviews of movies with a grain of salt. Different strokes for different folks. Everyone gets their opinions based on their views and beliefs. As a huge fan of the genera as well the group, I wished the entire 4+ hours that was filmed was included. Of close to 4.5 hours of footage, the movie was trimmed to just under 2 and a half hours in length. Certain aspects were missing to me. Members like Arabian Prince and others had no mention. The film jumps straight into Straight outta Compton without mention of the first effort ""N.W.A and the posse album, which is available to hear. During a performance, the original version of Dope-man from said L.P. was performed rather than the Remix version available on the featured title. Small things like the World Class Wrecking Crew and things that led to the point in which the film highlights are absent. F.Gar Grey defiantly had his job cut out trying to give us all of the goods within an appropriate time span. All the small things aside as a lot of people aren't hip hop heads like myself, the major opinion from other reviews is the transition of the movie's plot. Characters like Suge Knight, Snoop Dogg, and even 2Pac seemed needless. Without spoiling the plot, there are a few minutes where information seems less important or unnecessary considering the intended story. Periods were you kinda wish they'd just move on come and go. Certain story lines aren't necessary and may dull the emotions being built up. For this reason, I gave it a 9. I don't say that to make anyone question seeing the movie though! If you've wanted to see the film for a reason or another, I highly recommend you do. The overall goal was achieved. The overall presentation is on point. This will make good money and most people will be pleased with their viewing. For all the hype over Suge Knight's reckless killing on the set to overall anticipation, the wait was worth it! I expected to possibly be let down and left feeling like I got what I asked for. Hopefully all parties involved were pleased with their portrayal. The effort is there and everyone who had a part in making this movie should be proud. Everyone who has a film made in their legacy should hope to have the same results.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Excellent Film!,"Making a biopic is no easy accomplishment. There are always going to be yells that certain people, places, things were left out or shown in a bad light,etc. There's no guarantee that the filmmakers will have the blessing from the actual living persons or estate. There is the chance that the person or persons cast won't be able to convince the audience. And of course, can the filmmakers pull the whole thing off? In the particular case of Straight Outta Compton, there's no need to worry from the audience or the cast and crew. It's phenomenal. With only one known entity, albeit an amazing one, director F. Gary Gray (Law Abiding Citizen, Be Cool), screenwriters Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff and the entire filmmaking team used almost all unknown actors and zeroed in on a group, time, and place that unfortunately and uncannily is still relevant to this day.Straight Outta Compton is the story of the groundbreaking rap group known as N.W.A. The group started in the mid-80′s with the hardscrabble life of growing up with gang violence, drugs, and police brutality as their backdrop. Using their street knowledge, talent for writing, sound mixing, rapping, and some capital courtesy of one of the members, N.W.A. set themselves apart from other groups and styles of the time. Dr. Dre, MC Ren, DJ Yella, Ice Cube and Easy E combined infectious beats with incendiary rhymes to give a voice to a generation of urban youth who were waiting for someone to tell it like it is.From the opening scene, the die is cast that Straight Outta Compton is going to be an intense, detailed slice of life. A police tank equipped with a battering ram knocks down the whole front of a house and knocks a woman all the way across the room. It's not overseas, it's in the 'hood. It's a powerful scene and amazingly done. Counter that with Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) laying on his back, headphones on, amongst albums strewn across the floor. He's listening to a Roy Ayers classic, deep in thought, then his mom turns off the record player killing his vibe. The movie is rife with these kinds of details, including Jheri curls and activator.This being a film about a musical group, it would be remiss if there was no mention about the score and soundtrack. Straight Outta Compton not only has N.W.A.'s music, it also has R&B, soul, jazz, and some disco. The music is there and it sounds really good from a quality perspective. Kudos to the music and sound people.The film is rich with characters. Each member of the group gets his due and others that were on the periphery get a nod. Props to Cindy Tolan for the casting choices because to mention everyone in this review would be difficult and to single out certain performances is almost impossible. This is especially true for viewers who might not be familiar with who is who. For instance, N.W.A.'s encounter and dealings with Marion ""Suge Knight. R. Marcos Taylor not only looks like the imposing, maniacal, mountain of a man, his performance is menacingly spot on. However, because Straight Outta Compton centers for the most part on Easy E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and their manager Jerry Heller, the spotlight is on them. Making these characters come to life and leaving an indelible impression on you is the work of Jason Mitchell, the aforementioned Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., and Paul Giamatti, respectively. It was a stroke of near genius and enormous confidence to shoot a 2 1/2 hr film about rappers with unknowns and then ask Giamatti (John Adams!) to sign on. The scenes involving these actors are funny, poignant, and intense. None more so than when the group is outside the recording studio and get harassed by the police, or finally getting Easy E to step into the sound booth. All four of these actors deserve recognition but especially Mitchell and Giamatti.For those who might not like rap or to be more specific ""gangsta"" rap, the film is more than that. From start to finish Straight Outta Compton is an amazing film. Timing is everything and with what is going on right now in society, makes it that much more profound.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"A riveting ""rags-to-riches"" story that turns flat out decadent","If you don't really think about it, Straight Outta Compton, this year's anti-action blockbuster, is the sort of movie that will completely blow you away. Its crisp direction, engaging performances, and snappy tracks seamlessly work together to pull the audience in, whether fans of N.W.A. or simply the casual viewer. This film knows how to grab and hold the audience's attention, inserting humour, drama, violence, and even undiluted emotion at such a perfect pace that makes it almost impossible to think about the movie at a critical angle, at least within the film's duration. Even the opening scene, which has no purpose other than to illustrate the violent and dangerous lives of the inhabitants of Compton is wildly intense, a pulse-pounding escape scene that I didn't see coming from a mile away. So this, in a nutshell, is what Straight Outta Compton does right: It is unexpectedly riveting, creating solid entertainment out of simple things like dialogue, soundtrack, and excellent visual direction.However, when you think past the excellent filmmaking, Straight Outta Compton becomes rather childish and decadent, eventually losing its ability to showcase N.W.A.'s drama without resorting to silly, mobster-mentality fuelled scenes and opulent displays of wealth. It ceases to become a film about a group of young men overcoming cultural and racial struggles through music, morphing eventually into a tale about rich people who go around breaking things, beating each other up, engaging in gleeful misogyny, and getting richer. While it presented itself as a very promising ""rags-to-riches"" tale, the ""rags"" ended about a quarter of the way through, replaced by an irredeemable amount of ""riches"". As the film progresses, it loses its authenticity as a character drama.The acting, however, is fantastic. Every member of N.W.A. has a distinct and charged-up personality. O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father Ice Cube, and it's obvious that the man knows the type of guy his dad was. Not only is his acting done with all the expected fury, his performance is deep, making him more than just a character in a story. The film mostly revolves around Eazy-E, played by Jason Mitchell. Mitchell is relied on for the emotional pinnacle of the film, and he gives it his all in a few heartrending scenes. The actors are amazing talented, but the screenplay makes the characters, and this screenplay sees it fit to make these characters into rich thugs.The tagline for the poster reads: ""The World's Most Dangerous Group"". If this were to be so, I would assume that the group originally had some sort of ""ruthless"" political ambition. But it's hard to see that in the film. In fact, the underlying purpose of their musical ambition is kept ambiguous, never amounting to anything more than money, guns, and women. The political venom reflected in their songs never extends to their behaviour. They are unjustly treated, but by the way they carry themselves, it doesn't seem like they care. For a group called N.W.A. (and I'm assuming that the meaning of the acronym is universally known), they have surprisingly little attitude.Although the film may be strangled by its decadence in its later stage, it has its best and most memorable moments on the streets of Compton. The director is attached to the place, and depicts it not only as a cruel place, but as a reluctant sanctuary. Gray paints a vulgar, yet beautiful canvas on these dangerous streets where life is rough, tensions run high, and dreams are no more than dreams.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Instant stardom!!!,"The movie is phenomenal!!! The portrayal of the crew(NWA) is exceptional. Their story was told in a very real, compassionate, and loving way.

The era is a unique one as it was the backdrop of one of the most memorable events in modern day history---the beating of Rodney King.

The rise of Gangsta Rap in Compton L.A. circa 1988,"Five young men - Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E and DJ Yella - walking towards us, lined up in a row coming into the picture frame like modern-day gunslingers - full of swagger and the defiant air of adolescents that have grown up and experienced the brutality that comes with being black living in one of the poorest and most dangerous communities in 1980's America - the city of Compton, CA., south of downtown Los Angeles; these are the members of the pioneering ""gangsta rap"" and West Coast hip hop group N.W. A. (an abbreviation of Niggaz wit' Attitude) whose ""rags-to-riches"" story is told in the biopic STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON directed by F. Gary Gray.A group of locals, some of whom had been friends since childhood band together to express the rage they feel at society's inequities; to bring to attention the destructive nature of racism practiced by the authorities in their neighborhoods; police who were the supposed ""enforcers"" of justice interacting with urban black men treating them like enemies with no regard for their civil rights. N. W.A. fought back with raw screaming authenticity - lyrics that told their stories, attacking with the rat-a-tat of drum-machine beats and rhythms - words sprayed out with the ferociousness of thundering cannons - gesticulating and shocking their audiences with facts that were harshly bitter, crude. and all too real. N.W. A. became heroes to an expanding audience - their voices had been unleashed - fighting back not with guns and flying bullets, but with music that had the power to slice souls.I listened spellbound to N.W.A.'s sounds, inhaling their cries of intense fury, but at the same time cringing at the vitriolic lyrics aimed at women who were often referred to as ""ho's and bitches"" - buried in the same slimy abuse and disrespect, that the power structures so disdainfully thrust on them. The glamorized characterization of the relationship between the ""perks"" of fame - adulation, material acquisitiveness and indiscriminate sexual abandon - are depicted as becoming the roots of a Greek tragedy - hubris leads to nemesis.The film follows the group's path to worldwide fame including the oft seen sleazy ups and downs of the managerial side of the performing business; the collaboration of the entrepreneurial Eazy - E (a terrific performance by Jason Mitchell) with a scheming white businessman Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) to form a production company called Ruthless Records. Once recruited into N.W.A., Dr. Dre (a fine Corey Hawkins) is portrayed as the anchor of the group handling the music, and Ice Cube (played by his son O'Shea Jackson, Jr. with an uncanny resemblance to his father) is the lyricist along with MC Ren, pen and notebook in hand constantly jotting down phrases for future use. All five members were uncompromising, never giving into pressure from institutions, (including the FBI), the press and other external forces to tone down their rhetoric, many of whom were shocked by the unrelenting capacity of street vernacular to propel the public into social awareness.STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON also presents the personal battles and clashing egos among the rappers, with some quitting over ""royalty"" issues going off on their own, but over time we witness their strong ""familial"" bond which is unbreakable.The movie was not filmed in a vacuum - the turbulent history of the late '80's and early '90's is woven into the plot including the 1991 police battering of Rodney King, videotaped and seen on television by the whole country, and the subsequent acquittal of the four accused police officers in 1992 sparking riots in Los Angeles - clearly foreshadowing uprisings 22 years later, where a police culture is still too ready to shoot and destroy what they perceive as ""threatening"" men and women of color.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great acting, Almost perfectly casted","Absolutely loved the first three quarters of this movie. However, it seemed as if some parts and scenes were dragging on towards the end. It gave off an almost conscious, lengthy feeling. It was brilliantly casted, and I was especially impressed with O'Shea. His Ice Cube mannerisms and facial expressions were uncanny. Jason Mitchell also did a damn fine Easy E in my opinion, and no complaints can be offered about Corey Hawkins' Dr. Dre. I feel as if Ren got skimped; regarding his amount of lines in the film, face time, and overall portrayal of his importance and how heavily he contributed. Overall, it was definitely worth a watch and the first half was superb, just schedule a bathroom break around 3/4 of the way through watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"In depth, lengthy, but lacking a solid narrative structure to hold it together","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the late 80s, a group of young black men, including Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Junior, in his debut role), Dr Dre (Corey Hawkins), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Junior) emerge from the streets of Compton, South Central Los Angeles, to form the NWA, a hard core rap band who, in sharp contrast to the laid back, affable lyrics of time gone by, blast out sharp rhymes about police harassment/brutality, gang killings and drug slinging that get right in everyone's face, and even gain attention from the FBI. The content of their songs sees them struggle to get airplay, but Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a mainstream record producer, sees their potential and signs them up. But over the course of time, internal conflicts and different ambitions see the group dissipate and veer off in their different, destructive directions.Hip hop culture certainly dominates the charts today, with its influence even present in other genres of music that are doing the rounds. Straight Outta Compton attempts to probe the origins of a group that subverted the genre, and used it as a platform to vent their anger and frustration at the issues that blighted their lives in the black community at the time, in a manner that some artists over time took out of context and warped into the gangsta rap genre. Director F Gary Grey has certainly compiled a thorough, in depth study of the group's life, which by the end has left you more drained than informed.The film has a lot of story to tell, but somehow lacks the solid narrative structure to make everything have the maximum effect. For a film with such a length, this is a pretty big problem, and despite containing enough various, often veering, human drama to engage, at numerous points throughout, you're just left wondering when the ending will roll around, probably a natural reaction to not having the most structured story to follow. When it does roll by, you're left feeling completely depleted.The young cast certainly prove realistic incarnations of the group, whilst as the most recognizable member of the cast, Giamatti turns in a surprisingly impassioned performance as the manager who believes in them, then comes to be regarded as sneaky and manipulative. The recreation and performances are all check, but it maybe needed some miles clocked off, and a better idea of where it's going. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I liked this film a lot,"I thought Straight Outta Compton was a very entertaining movie. To see how N.W.A. came to be and their rise during a very controversial time in ""gangster rap"", was very interesting to me. Like most success stories, they had to jump a whole hell of a lot of hurdles to make it to where they did. Hurdles like the press, LAPD & even the FBI. That is some serious red tape.Love them or hate them, that is something that I have an immense amount of respect for. They were essentially pioneers in the rap industry bringing a whole new brand that received as much resistance as it did acceptance. This film kept me at attention from start to finish. Unlike most films I watch, I was honestly more interested in the story itself than the quality of acting. I really enjoyed the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A visually and musically interesting story of one of the most influential bands in hip hop history.,"""Straight Outta Compton"" has Something to SayNWA is credited with creating gangster rap, also know as reality rap for singing about the reality of the lives they lived. NWA lead to not only million selling albums for the band and their three main members, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E, but to Tupac, Snoop Dogg and more.NWA was more than recording artists, they spoke for millions all over the nation who were oppressed by the police, including the ""Black police showing out for the white cop.""The racist L.A. Police has had a history of abusing the rights of African Americans, especially in the 80s. That is one of the catalysts for gangster rap along with the war on drugs and crushing Reaganomics. Were the NWA performers the most talented in the L.A. scene? Certainly Dr. Dre and Ice Cube were. Eazy E comes off as a bit of a dupe and lessor talent. However, Jason Mitchell plays the rapper well.The son of Ice Cube, O'Shea Jackson Jr., is excellent and he looks just like dad. Paul Giamatti plays a thieving white prick with aplomb. The rest of the cast also does well.The scenes of the band performing on stage and in the studio are real standouts. The cinematography is excellent as is the sound mixing. The plot holds together, but like a turducken, they cram too much in.There is no way they could have put every event in the lives of NWA in the film. Even so, some of the scenes are too long for their minimal content. Scenes are held too long after the point is made and story elements are evident. There are a few moments of self reflection in the film that weren't needed, and frankly, some of the exposition was redundant.Otherwise, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an entertaining and educational film.Rating: Full PriceSome of the sexism of NWA, and in Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's lyrics, comes out in the film; that is unfortunate. However, that is who they seem to be, and to be otherwise, would be false.The film does cover some familiar biopic band territory of member's squabbling, producers ripping them off and so forth. It is most handled in an interesting way except from the drawn out scene with their manager, Jerry.In all, it's a well produced film with great musical performances and a good hip-hop soundtrack from the days when hip-hip was still political and relevant and more than just a commercial success.Peace, Tex Shelters",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
7/10,"I will admit fully up front my total, absolute, 100% ignorance about the events, the people, the context and the music portrayed in this film. It just isn't something that I ever heard or grew up on, living in Italy. Nevetheless I was actually looking forward to checking this out and understanding what this whole story was all about. Even though I cannot comment about the way the facts are portrayed I can call this a well crafted movie.F Gary Gray does a very good job in making you part of this world, making you understand how things work and ultimately he simply tells an interesting true story and does it justice, taking out of it themes that everyone can relate to and showing a reality with complex dynamics which offer a great cue of thought and discussion. Even though the events in the film may be unfamiliar to the viewer he presents them with confidence and knowledge and makes them familiar and easily understandable. There is lots of commentary on society and discrimination, much of it comes to fruition even though I might add that I never had a full three dimensional dynamic of it.All in all what really makes the film succeed is the fact that it has interesting characters in an interesting true story which is never shoved down your throat, you are treated respectfully, the story is told with passion. You won't get bored, you board the ride and you are taken through a satisfying, reflective and interesting journey which makes you come out with the feeling you just saw a good movie with some killer music that pumped all the more goodness in the film.I just unfortunately can't get too excited about this. Firstly because from a filmaking point of view there isn't anything outstanding or flattering, there aren't stand out performances, or intense, breathless scenes. But that is OK, the movie is still very good. The main point is the fact that a little too many of its emotional beats and story beats require you to be familiar with the events to get emotional or excited. It doesn't explore its themes as much as it explores its story and that is way I was never fully engaged by it, other than the fact that it is a tad to long.I will repeat the fact that my ignorance in the subject doesn't make me a valid judge for the film which is a good, sometimes very good biopic/muscipic, but I think that a slight edge more of attention to the themes and the issues it raises could have elevated the film a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"powerful and entertaining, if less than great","Straight Outta Compton is about Three guys growing up in the hood of the Compton section of Los Angeles - Eric Wright (Easy E), Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and O'Shea Jackson (Ice Cube) - who come together through some various reasons (trying to get out of selling drugs and getting almost run over by police-driven bulldozer; the frustration of continuing with the basic R&B dance music of the day; writing lyrics that will push the envelope) and try to make some rap music that challenges the norm. There are ups, there are major downs (including death), and in the end it's all like 'wow, we came THIS far?'This is a refreshing, hard-R rated trip into not simply a little rap group who sold a few million records and burned out after a few years (technically anyway, Dre and Ice Cube went on to monumental careers). This is a piece of modern history that has to be told: how 'gangster rap' came into its own in worldwide public consciousness. Like much of the best aggressive music for young people, though certainly not exclusive to them, it addresses what's going on in the world that group's in, but here with the added social-political edge: what are cops doing? What has happened to where people have to be ""thuggish""? Or, in a sub-textual level, do people from places like Compton act super-hard and angry and act super-tough to make up for what little power they have in their neighborhoods? But anyway, back to this movie...This is a blend of the conventional (but often quite good and challenging) musician bio-pic, with the highs and lows and egos that become too big for everyone and how money comes into trouble and so on (not to mention the manager who isn't all he says he is), and an all-too distressing look at how nothing's changed with regards to urban/COP violence and conflicts (and actually, I think as a reaction to Obama honestly, has gotten worse). Arguably, the cops are really the villains here, certainly for this group of people, though Suge Night kind of takes over that mantle in the second half with his scenes of thug-life.What makes it so compelling is that we really get invested in these three main guys, and manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) - Dre, Cube, and Easy E - and then we see how invigorating and exciting it is for them to get together, which makes them coming apart so sad (though inevitable). These aren't card-board gang-banger types; even Easy-E, who has maybe the least talent of the three main guys (Ren and Yella are kind of less than one-dimensional), they have humor and pathos to them, they care about how their messages are getting out there, not being censored, and then... sure, the parties, the women, the drugs, they're there.In the third act - 1993, as soon as it comes on the screen is actually the cue - is not as strong as the first two-thirds, when even as the group comes apart the individual sagas of how they try to keep going on as solo acts is fascinating and funny and frightening and so on. But somehow in the last half hour the film becomes rushed, and the feeling that a LOT got left on the cutting room floor becomes more apparent. And there's one cliché involving someone getting rather sick - spoiler, it's Easy, another spoiler he died in 1995, this is a matter of public record and all - that doesn't gel with the rest of the movie. But until then, Straight Outta Compton is a spectacular look at how real art and discourse can come out of a place as hellish as Compton; these guys made real protest music, and it resonates today for good reason. If nothing else, the movie does a masterful job of getting the audience to care about what the music has to say.One last thing: 98% of this cast fills these real-life roles so well it's hard to see anyone else, certainly with Ice Cube's own son. The 2% exception are two scenes with Snoop Doggy Dogg. When he comes on screen, it's a wonder why they didn't just get the real-life Snoop to come in as himself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very well acted and exciting music biopic,"Set in the racially divisive cauldron that was South Central Los Angeles of the late 80's, five young black guys from the inner city suburb of Compton formed a hip hop group which would go on to revolutionise popular music. Straight Outta Compton is the biopic about the band labelled 'The World's Most Dangerous Group', namely N.W.A. They only lasted as a functioning outfit for a very short time but their impact has been lasting and profound. In many ways, their aggressive socially aware music and image did for hip hop what the earlier punk band the Sex Pistols did for rock music. In that they created a brand of direct uncompromising music that acted as a call to arms for many, while leading the band themselves into direct trouble with the authorities of their country. What followed of course was the rise of the popularity of rap music to the point that at one stage it was the most popular form of music on the planet.N.W.A was made up of five individuals, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella, are all portrayed distinctively here with particular emphasis put on the first three, seeing as they were the most prominent members. The cast is superb, with a charismatic turn put in from Corey Hawkins as Dre, Jason Mitchell captures the quirky nature of Eazy-E and O'Shea Jackson Jr. is extremely convincing playing his real life dad, Ice Cube, who he has an uncanny resemblance to. Rounding things off is the always impressive Paul Giamatti in the role of Jerry Heller the bands manager – he is portrayed poorly yet never one dimensionally negatively, as he is shown to defend N.W.A when they are harassed and demeaned by the L.A. cops. Overall, the acting is of a very high calibre. The film essentially charts N.W.A's quick rise and fast implosion, with some focus on their highly confrontational debut LP, Straight Outta Compton, which included the song F*** Tha Police which led the group to national infamy and harassment from various law enforcements around the U.S.A. as well as a threat from the FBI. I remember at the time the controversy this song caused, yet only a couple of years later the world watched open mouthed at the footage of Rodney King being savagely beaten by the LAPD, leading to the guilty cops being shamelessly let off by the justice system which led to the L.A. Riots. It seems that N.W.A's song was talking of a truth that made a lot of people very uncomfortable but it was a truth nevertheless. This film works partly as a critique of America, in its highlighting of topics like police brutality and the unwillingness of the authorities to allow freedom of speech about such an issue.The film also looks at the gangsta rap (aka reality rap) scene more generally, with appearances from recording artists like Snoop Dogg and Tupac, while Suge Knight and his label Death Row Records comes off very badly and seems to represent some genuinely negative elements of the rap genre. As the film progresses the melodrama increases as the band splinters off and public fights ensue between ex-members. But some of the most impressive moments are the scenes involving the music itself. There is particularly powerful concert footage of a Detroit show which was ultimately stopped by the police. Whether you are a fan of rap or not, it's hard to not appreciate the sheer excitement of this type of music when it is delivered so aggressively and committedly. By the end, it takes a depressing turn with the death of Eazy-E due to AIDS and the film doesn't sugar coat this, much to its credit. Overall, this is a pretty dynamic and exciting music biopic and is delivered with some gusto, although I often felt that if anything it downplayed the incendiary nature of N.W.A a little. But, whatever the case, this remains an excellent film which tells a story that fully justifies its big screen treatment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Its a good film, ignore the PC idiots who live in a bubble","I was into hip Hop back in the day, Big Daddy Kane, GrandMaster Flash, Run DMC, it was the perfect backdrop to bust out some moves, I even performed in Snow White & the Seven Break Dancing Dwarfs. I was so street. Alas, by the time NWA arrived I had moved onto Rock N Roll.However, I remember the impact they had on the music scene, all press is good press, especially bad press. They had something to say, and they said it. Riots at gigs, groupies, misogyny, smashing up hotels, orgies, parties, you name it, they lived it.Like many ground breaking acts before them, they were clearly living the rock n roll dream. Call it calculating marketing, they knew what they were doing, both musically and socially. If you wanted to sell lots of records, pi** off the parents, the kids will love it. We can go all the way back to Little Richard and the origins of rock n roll to find this out.Its a good film, forget about how accurate or inaccurate it is. Problem I have is with all the idiots on here giving it bad reviews for the language and treatment of woman and the way the police treated them. Get real, what world are you living in? It happened, it still happens. If it was a film about about The Rolling Stones, The Who or even Elvis it would be OK, they would probably say, that was so rock n roll.Its a good film, even if you're not into rap. The performances are excellent, the soundtrack is superb. If you are easily offended, then go watch a block buster with explosions and rap yourself in cotton wool, just in case it gets a bit risqué.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best musical biopic since Selena,"Now when I first saw Notorious, I thought Diddy did a good job on the movie; but as I got older and started to gain a more critical eye for movies, I thought to myself that Notorious was a horrible movie. Notorious, in my opinion, ruined Biggies legacy. As a result, I started to hate biopics in general. When I heard ""Straight Outta Compton"" was coming out, I was a little skeptical about seeing it and I was pessimistic. I said to myself ""whoever is making this movie is going to mess it up, and ruin NWA's legacy."" But I was wrong, this movie is one of the best biopics I have ever seen. I went to see it with my girlfriend and she's not a big rap fan but she still enjoyed it. The movie is real, it's raw and it's something we need right now, all people of every color need to go and see it. ""F the Police"" I first heard when I was about 8 or 9, and I learned Ice Cube's verse word for word in a matter of months so I kind of was anticipating this movie. I'm glad I didn't treat this movie like every other biopic that ruins peoples legacy and not go see it. I had an open mind with this. Now about the actors, I think they all did an amazing job. Jason Mitchell, who played Eazy E had the #1 performance over the entire cast. I think his performance is Best Actor Oscar worthy. Don't get me wrong, everyone else did an amazing job but his performance was spectacular. If you think about, Mitchell had to have the most difficulty to play Eazy E because he was the only one who didn't have any guidance from the real person he was playing. Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella are all still alive so they could give the best guidance to the actors portraying them but Eazy E is unfortunately not with us anymore and is incapable to guide Mitchell and say something like ""Nah this is how Eazy does it."" But everybody else had that guidance. O'Shea Jackson Jr had his father to guide him, Corey Hawkins had Dr. Dre to guide him but Mitchell didn't have Eazy which is why I praise his performance the most. Eazy E has to be proud of Mitchell because I know every single person who watches this movie will be proud of him too. The producers of this movie were very careful and they really took their time. Dr. Dre is a perfectionist in the music industry and with him being a producer on this film, you know it's gonna be perfected. Most biopics usually slander a person's image and it's usually the person who isn't involved in the film that gets slandered. Many people know that Jerry Heller has his lawyers ready to sue but honestly, Heller wasn't slandered at all in this movie. I didn't walk out the theater saying to myself ""Wow that Heller guy was really a piece of work."" The movie depicts NWA accusing him of skimming off the top which Heller denies until this day but there was no actual scene of showing him do the dirty deed. This is why I say the producers were very careful, they weren't out to slander anybody. Like I said, I didn't walk out of the theater thinking to myself any less of Heller. I think the most of him now. I see how he stood up for his artists and really represented them in a positive light. I love the scene where Heller defends NWA against the cops who were harassing NWA. It made me see Heller as a semi good guy, not the evil Jew many people think of him. I don't really see a lawsuit between the producers and Heller, there was no defamation of character. I pray to GOD this movie hits big in the box office, and I certainly hope, this movie wins big at the Academy Awards, it deserves it. It should be the first movie about rap to win Best Picture. Mitchell deserves Best Actor for his portrayal of Eazy E, F. Gary Gray should be the first black director to win Best Director and they deserve many other awards. All in all, this movie was exceptional and it will go down as one of the best movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
F. Gary Gray's gift to the world and N.W.A.,"""It's the film of my generation."" I uttered that exact phrase to my wife following what was one of the most vibrant experiences in a theater in some time. An undeniable love letter to one of the most influential groups in rap music history, F. Gary Gray's ""Straight Outta Compton"" is a vivacious and powerfully timely piece that stands as the single best film of the year thus far. I can't recall a more prolific biopic that institutes its own sensibilities about its subjects with such adoration and respect. Acknowledging the absence of certain events in the lives of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Easy E, and simply approaching the film as a piece of fiction, the movie is damn near flawless.Telling the story of the group NWA, as they emerge from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.This is one of the best examples of a film where three leads are treated with equal focus and respect. Each performer, O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (portraying Ice Cube), Jason Mitchell (portraying Easy E), and Corey Hawkins (portraying Dr. Dre.) all deliver invigorating performances. Jackson, Jr., the real-life son of Ice Cube, lives inside the character, delivering lines of powerful meaning. Mitchell finds his stride early in the film, executing a charisma and charm that few actors can deliver in a film such as this. Oscar-worthy is too broad a term to describe his abilities in the film, it's downright sensational and something I'm sure to remember for some time. Hawkins grows into the role as each minute progresses, before launching himself into the psyche of Dr. Dre and dissolving into the man. Academy Award nominee Paul Giamatti follows the energy and arc of his character with determination and presents another strong performance for his résumé. Another strong standout is R. Marcos Taylor as Suge Knight, the closest thing to a conventional movie villain but an embodiment of greed and aggression.""Straight Outta Compton"" is so much more than a biopic. It's a full- on musical epic, a character study that isn't shy about what it knows and what it decides to show its audience. The music is at the core, but the lives and message are what really drive the movie. Looking back at films like ""Selma,"" a film that captured the time so perfectly and effortlessly, Gray's film manages to create its own defining staples in our nation's history. It's honest about the truth of the streets. As someone who grew up in both the Bronx and Jersey City, two urban cities with its own fair share of hardships (and in no way comparing either to Compton, CA), I appreciated everything that the film chose to show and say. The hunger for money and acceptance, or the ill-fitting look of a man from the ghetto who sits in a house that is larger than anything he could have ever dreamed. The script and story by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge, and Alan Wenkus is littered with fantastic narrative elements and raw projections of these men and who they were/are.Gray's film is not just an acting and storytelling showcase, it's also one of the technical marvels of the year. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique, Oscar-nominee for ""Black Swan,"" gives a polished and engaging feel to every scene he shoots. His decisions about framing either an emotional moment or a light chuckle for the audience to indulge, is simple mesmerizing. Editors Billy Fox and Michael Tronick take 147 minutes of epic storytelling, and never let up for a second. I was involved in every scene, every frame, and every trait that Gray's film had to offer. Composer Joseph Trapenese (another Jersey City native!) takes his opportunities well to inject a swell of sentimentality and passion when the moment calls for it. You don't expect a composer to shine in a film about a music group yet he does tremendously.This is film is not for everyone. I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this film to many people unless I was sure about what films they typically like. It's vulgar yet genuine, and graphic yet sensitive. The music takes over your soul though. I've been playing N.W.A. music the entire time I've been writing this, letting the lyrics and beats take on a brand new meaning because of Gray's masterpiece. And that's exactly what the film is...a masterpiece. A film that needs to be considered by not just awards, but by all who love daring filmmaking.""Straight Outta Compton"" is distributed by Universal Pictures and is currently in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Records Left on the Table,"Part of the reason we love and hate celebrities deals with the fact that we live extremely different lives and it's just hard to relate to people who don't go through the same life obstacles as you. This film does a phenomenal job at taking that problem and turning it into one hell of a film, because not only does it bring you directly into the lives of Compton natives turned rappers N.W.A, but it tackles their lives in a way that feels approachable. All things considered, growing up in the suburbs of Chicago doesn't give me much perspective on Gangsta Rap, but I'd like to think listening to N.W.A's music gave me insight into the atmosphere in late 80's LA. Luckily, F.Gary Gray takes their lyrics and creates a masterful world around the beloved rappers. Straight Outta Compton is one of the best films of the summer and easily the most surprising film to come out in 2015 for me.When I was in high school I listened to rap all the time, and being a white male, Eminem appealed to me the most. But I listened to my fair share of N.W.A, 2Pac, Nas, Jay-Z, and even some Wu-Tang. So I knew enough about the golden age of hip hop to be extremely excited for the film. But I was nervous, none of these actors had proved themselves before, and taking on the roles of some of the most iconic artists in rap or just music history is a difficult task to say the least. But all of them, and I mean all of them, absolutely killed it. O'Shea Jackson Jr playing his dad was also a big question mark. He obviously looks the part, but could he capture the mannerisms and personality his father had? Dang right he can. Acting comes from the eyes, and you can make or break a performance depending on how you play a scene with your eyes. Well, Jackson and Corey Hawkins, playing Dr. Dre, were terrific at selling each and every one of the emotional scenes. Jason Mitchell was also really good as Eazy-E. Talk about having to deal with emotional material, Mitchell probably had the biggest challenge considering the fate of E, but he nailed everything. And unlike another film that just came out (ahem Fantastic Four), I really bought into this group as a team and the bonds they all shared. It was clear from the beginning that these characters were from the same background and understood each and every one of each other.Obviously being a huge rap fan, hearing all of the old songs in a theater with great sound systems was really gratifying. The Detroit concert scene was definitely one of the best scenes I have seen all year and a thrilling one at that. But I was so impressed by the way the actors were selling the fact that they made the music and performed it. I know none of them are actually rapping or spinning beats, but the actors and directing sucked me into the performances and studio sessions. It was cool to see 2Pac and Snoop make cameos as they both had a good amount of collaborations with Dre and the crew. I thought those scenes may take me out of the film, but the actors once again sold the performances so well. The film does take a step back in third act because it focused on everyone's solo adventures and veered away from the group dynamic. But that's the material and it doesn't translate as well to the screen as the first half of the movie did. I still loved nearly everything else about the film, especially all of the rap easter eggs and nods to other artists they included.It's also worth mentioning the emotional layer to the film as well. Like I said, usually it's hard to relate to characters like this, but the family like dynamic between the group brought me along with the good and bad times. So I felt for the guys when stuff hit the fan. I was glued to the screen just as much for the dramatic sequences as I was for the insane concert scenes. So overall, I really loved Straight Outta Compton. It surpassed my expectations and is one of the best films based on a music group or artists that I have seen. It's also one of those stories that you wish could have turned out a different way. I wish N.W.A could have figured things out and gave us more music. Because they were pioneers for not only rap but for people to have a voice in music and not care what other people may think or react to what you say.+Surprisingly deep performances+Thrilling concert scenes+Surprise cameos+Rap Easter eggs+Great biopic-Third act stumbles just a bit9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

As a film it's fantastic,"Quality film.I thoroughly enjoyed 'Straight Outta Compton', it had me gripped all the way through. That's despite me having little to no knowledge of N.W.A, I knew of their name and of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but basically zilch about their actual story. I couldn't comment on how true it is to history, but as a film it's fantastic.You have great performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti. Mitchell impressed me most as Eazy-E, while the casting of Jackson as Ice Cube - his father, of course - was a masterstroke. All the cast do very well, in truth.I love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get. There is some neat cinematography in there, while the music is entwinned nicely. The pacing is almost perfect, aside from a few moments in the middle. I also rate how it all ends, in terms of the story but also with the end credits. There's heart in there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Rap fans will love it,"It's a commonly agreed upon theory that the worse of a person you are, the better of a musician you would make. 'Straight Outta Compton' certainly does nothing to dispel those theories. There literally isn't a good-hearted, genuine person to be found in this movie. Every single character is deplorable, it's simply a case of to what extent. Now, that's not an insult to anyone, these people would be the first to agree that they are far from reputable characters. And the thing is that that's what makes 'Straight Outta Compton' so enjoyable.With a long run time of roughly 2 and half hours there are certainly varying degrees of quality at different stages of the film. The ending is certainly the strongest stage. The emotional story line that develops is well told and certainly does tug at the heart strings. The final word spoken before the credits role will also bring chills to anyone familiar with the rap genre. There are portions earlier in the film that certainly drag, and can have you at times wondering whether certain things needed to be included in the story line, thus making the film so long. I think a very strong ending does a lot to cover up the earlier indiscretions, and fair play to them for that. If you need one segment of your film to be especially strong, you'd be crazy not to make it your ending.It's certainly a film that will resonate for people who are fans of rap, but will it do the same for those that aren't? I'm not entirely sure on the answer to that. Whether the story is interesting enough to carry the average viewer, purely from a story line perspective, I think would be split about 50/50. I thought the actors all did a fantastic job portraying their real life characters and I was especially impressed by the sound they managed to create with some of the musical reenactments. Altogether, it's not quite as strong as I had hoped for, but it still remains a very solid, and at times excellent, film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Vidiot Reviews....,"Straight Outta ComptonBeing a roadie for a rapper is easy because you only have to carry around a milk crate of old funk albums.However, as per this biography, personal baggage counts as sound equipment.In 1986 drug-dealer Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) enter the studio of producer Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) who pairs them with DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.). They subsequently release a hit single under the acronym N.W.A.But when Eazy-E hires businessman Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) to be their manger, his misappropriation of their revenue tears the group asunder.Spanning the social and racial issues of the early nineties with great aplomb, this O.G. origin tale may whitewash some harsher realities of the real-life situation but is ultimately a well-acted, keenly directed hip-hop masterpiece.However, not surprising is the fact that all East Coast film critics dissed this movie.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Definitely Something Fishy Is Going On,I am noticing a pattern with all the 1 star reviews here. They all seem to be writing a line and then missing a line and then writing on the next line. Why would every 1 star review be written like that. It makes me think that there are lots of fake reviewers trying to bring the score down.OK over to the review. This film is excellent in highlighting the behaviour of the good old American police and their treatment of young black men. It shows that people just want to get on in life and it should matter not which neighbourhood they come from. Unfortunately there are people in the US that are already at a disadvantage just because they happen to be born in a particular area.This film has a very powerful message and deserves to be seen.

An Unapologetic Biopic That's As Powerful As The Group It Follows,"In the 80s, a revolutionary new group enters the limelight, changing music and pop culture forever. Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A's first ever album, proves controversial with its brutal, yet honest, depiction of life in Southern LA . With guidance from their manager, band members Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and MC Ren trail-blaze their way through the industry, scoring fame, fortune and a place in history.Cleverly devised and rhythmically paced, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is one of the most powerful biopics in recent memory. The cast is fantastic. Watching these guys perform really makes you believe they went through all this; you lose yourself in the story, and find yourself transported back in time.O'Shea Jackson portrays his own father, Ice Cube, and while there's an uncanny resemblance in his appearance, it's ultimately more than how he looks; it's how he acts. One could say the only reason his performance is as good as it is here is because he knew his father better than most, perfectly channeling that and delivering something genuine. But I, for one, would like to see more of him in other roles.Visually, the film is beautiful to look at; which comes as no surprise once you realize who the cinematographer is. Matthew Libatique, who's worked on Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, as well as Iron Man, shoots this brilliantly; giving each scene it's own unique voice. There's a noticeable haze during the earlier moments, when they're on the streets of LA, that gives these scenes a nostalgic tinge. And then there's the electrifying use of vibrant colors during the larger- than-life concert scenes that completely immerses you, making you wish you were there to experience it all.If I had one gripe, it'd be that the film loses some steam towards the end. That's about it. I don't care if it sugarcoats things that happened with the real N.W.A; I judge movies on what they show, not on what they don't. This is an important, educational, and, at the same time, great movie that unapologetically touches a sensitive nerve that's, sadly, still relevant to this very day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Up...One of the Year's Best,"(Rating: ☆☆☆½ out of 4)This film is highly recommended.In brief: The film doesn't play straight with the facts but it is superior filmmaking.GRADE: B+Now I should say straight out that rap music is not my particular inclination when I want to hear some songs. (Honestly, I'm more a Broadway show tunes and R & B type of listener.) With that in mind, I went to see this movie with some trepidation and found it to be involving and yet riveting in a detached way.And boy, did I feel old watching Straight Out of Compton. Resembling a wannabe Barbara Billingsley jive lady, I felt out of sync with the rhythm and rhyme, a genuine generational relic ready for the scrapheap of life. Let me state upfront that the film does have its flaws: All of the characters and their attitudes in this film were an unpleasant lot, off-putting and repellent people with very little remorse for their actions or possessing any redeeming values other than their passion for their art. The film also takes its subtle glorification of these real life boyz-from-the-hood and their pro-drug life-styles to some exaggerated heights without showing the ramifications of their actions, which I found slightly disturbing. But the film's many assets outweigh some minor missteps along the way.Straight Out of Compton takes place in 1986 and shows the origins of the hip hop music industry. It's the beginnings of gangsta rap, with lyrics laced with profanity and urging violence acts against the establishment, specifically any symbol of authority be it the police or any embodiment of law enforcement. A group of street-wise musicians broke new ground with their unique brand of music that is all too commonplace today. The group was called N.W.A., formed by three friends: Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr, Ice Cube's real son), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell). and this biopic depicts their rise to fame amid adverse conditions, many caused by their own making.While the film paints an incomplete picture of true events and its facts are somewhat skewed, it remains a powerful look into a time when revolution and unrest became part of the mainstream. The film never truly delve into the darker side of these performers and their complicated lives, skimming across some of their more violent acts and anti-social behaviors. The historical accuracy is a bit lax with misogyny and homophobia present in the storytelling but downplayed in this film, especially in the case of Dr. Dre's record of abuse toward women. (Perhaps the reason may lie with two of the film's producers, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre themselves who could only go so far as to depict the real story behind the music which diminishes the film's real impact. The truth obviously could not set them free. It also plays fast and loose with the pivotal roles of MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) and their contribution's to N.W.A.'s mega-hit status. (A sixth member of the group, Arabian Prince, is not even mentioned.)That said, the movie is expertly directed by F. Gary Gray. The direction keeps the action moving at a brisk and showy pace. He encompasses his narrative with a vital raw energy and much cinematic style, successfully incorporating the music within its plot. Many of the incidents shown on the screen are fascinating to watch without emotionally connecting to this moviegoer.The screenplay by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff is literate and riveting while loosely based on the facts. They create believable characters and capture in their dialog the street jargon with much authenticity and bravado. As the group begins to splinter, so does the film in its third act. Still it is strong dramatic fodder as it takes these real life characters and makes their roles bigger-than-life, giving the performers plenty of opportunities to showcase their musical talents and acting abilities. The casting is very strong throughout the film. Particularly outstanding are the three leads who all give break-out performances, especially Jason Mitchell as the trusting member of the group. R. Marcos Taylor plays Suge Knight as pure evil and Paul Giamatti plays their ambitious and shady manager, Jerry Heller, and makes his interpretation of a predictable role even more intriguing.Did the film make me appreciate the world of gangsta rap more? No. But I was enraptured by the cast and its talented director. Straight Out of Compton is a well-crafted film and worthwhile viewing, especially for seriously-minded film-goers and fans of this musical genre. It deserves many of the accolades it is presently earning. Straight up, this film is one of the year's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

great biopic,"I agree with the poster that said that something weird was going on, I could not and still cannot understand the disparity between the IMDb rating and the reviewers. For my part I give this movie 9/10, It's very well made much better than I expected. I also must mention the superb acting talent,from Cubes son to the actor who played Snoop flawless! great chemistry between the actors as well. The music / lyrics I know have been the subject of the moral majority in years gone by, these guys were/are a product of their surroundings, IE they were moulded by their experiences where they lived. I remembered the same grumbles raised about the lyrical content when Stiff Little Fingers released ""Inflammable Material"" back in the 70's.As far as the Oscars go, I agree with Ice Cube when he was interviewed on the Graham Norton show two weeks ago when He said the he makes movies for his fans, and that winning an Oscar is the icing on the cake however it isn't that important. well said Cube!",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unconvincing version of an interesting story,"I know little about the story of N.W.A., and this movie might be on the money accurate - but it doesn't manage to present the story in an convincing way. You feel like you're watching the version of history preferred by the surviving members, and that it glosses over some of the negative sides of the relationship. Not all of them, mind you, as there's enough on screen to keep the drama going. But I don't buy it.That said, the most interesting part of the movie was how it portrayed the police. That actually felt convincing, and helped explain some of the background for albums like ""Straight outta Compton"".The acting was mostly quite good, and the rapping as well. Sadly, O'Shea Jackson Jr. isn't quite up there amongst the others, and it does distract a bit.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent Rap Biopic,"There are a number of very good period biopics out there. Here is another one. However, there are not many period biopics that reflect and define both the era in which they take place and the era in which they are released. ""Straight Outta Compton"" joins that short list. The film perfectly displays the rise of N.W.A. in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It also fits into the scope of where we are now in 2015. A year after the Ferguson shooting, and amidst the rising accusations of police violence, the film's message and content could not have come at a better time.It may seem hard to believe that N.W.A. released their debut album 27 years ago, considering how much their influence is still felt. This extremely well-made film, directed by F. Gary Gray, leaves out a few factors of the group's rise to prominence, but does not take any shortcuts. These characters are presented as misogynistic gangsters, some of which previously had lives selling drugs, and are taken as they are. It's quite remarkable how the film still manages to present these guys as heroes despite their flaws and upbringing. That's what the film is all about, but I did not expect it to be done so well or convincingly.Every performance in the picture is exceptional, but I'm choosing to focus on the main three. First off, O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father, Ice Cube, in a strong, convincing manner. He steps into his old man's shoes and develops the role. We see Cube's shift from a kid trying to survive in Compton to a furious, influential man who advocates against police brutality following the Rodney King shooting (in an excellent scene in which he argues with a reporter) and pumps up the crowd with a ferocious tone and booming voice. Next is Corey Hawkins, who feels the role of Dr. Dre. This character is special because he is the most relatable. He's the one who gets caught in the middle with the feud between Cube and Eazy-E. He's the one we're still thinking about the most when the picture ends and the one we want to succeed most. Hawkins delivers a commanding, yet perfectly subtle performance that sticks with us long after the credits roll. Last but not least, there's the excellent Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. In a film full of stand-out performances, he delivers most. As the leader of the group (mostly) a strong performance is needed from Mitchell, who gives more than is necessary, in a good way of course. He delivers the biggest laughs and the deepest sobs. He is exceptional and deserves to be noticed for future big roles.Not only are the actors spitting images of the real-life artists they portray, the embody them completely with the help of a terrific script filled with surprising laughs and deeply moving moments. The new ""Fantastic Four"" film happened to be released a week before this film. After seeing the two films on consecutive nights, I must say that I would take this rag-tag group of gangsta superheroes over that un-unified group with amazing powers. That's what these guys feel like in this film: flawed, raunchy superheroes that take on the world.A film not only of its time, but also of the moment, ""Straight Outta Compton is one of the year's best thus far, and one of the top three films of this summer. Like Eminem's excellent 2002 film ""8 Mile,"" you do not have to be a fan of rap or N.W.A. to enjoy this movie. Whether or not you agree with what these guys stood for, give their film a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Enjoyable Biopic! 7/10,"Review: As I was into Hip Hop when N.W.A. first came out, I was really looking forward to watching this movie and the fact that Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and Yella, all contributed there services to this movie, it really did make this a no nonsense, straight from there mouth, enjoyable movie. It certainly brought back some memories! I wasn't really into the whole LA scene until I saw Colors, which really opened my eyes to the gang problems over there. When I first heard ""Straight Outta Compton"", mixed with Dre's beats, I was completely sold and I bought my LA Raiders hat, along with there singles and albums. This lengthy movie gives a step by step rise to fame of N.W.A. and how there popularity affected each member. MC Ren decided to stick by Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright's side, during his time with music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) but after releasing a couple of albums, Dr. Dre went with Suge Knight to create Death Row and Ice Cube started his single rapping career with Bryan Turner at Priority records, due to money and contract problems. Death Row records became an instant success with rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Doggy Dogg on board and Ice Cube's debut album, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted is a huge success. To cut a long story short, they both have problems whilst pursuing there career in music and the roads that they all had chosen, took away the enjoyment that they first felt when they started out in the music business. When Eazy E finds out that Jerry Heller has been embezzling money through the group, he decides to cut all ties with the him and he approaches Ice Cube and Dr. Dre to work on new material but Eazy collapses during a recording session and is taken straight to the hospital, were he is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. He finally dies on the 26th of March, 1995 and a year later, Dre cuts all ties with Death Row records because he doesn't like the way that Suge Knight runs the company. To make sure that Suge Knights evil ways doesn't put Dre's life in danger, he gives him full control of all there previous material, which basically leaves Dre with no power of his hit records. Meanwhile, Ice Cube's career is a huge success and he has also entered the movie world with hit films like Boyz 'N Tha Hood and Friday. Dre's new label, Aftermath, sees new artist Eminem and 50 Cent, become a international success along with his Beats franchise, which is eventually sold to Apple for a huge $3 Billion. To see them come together for this project, proves that they have put there previous ""Beef"" behind them and it's great to see that they have dedicated this movie to Eazy E, who really was the root to there success. Anyway, the performances were top class from the young N.W.A. cast and the director touched on some delicate matters involving the police, the L.A. Riots and the violence involving Suge Knight. For the people who didn't follow the group back in the early 90's, this movie must be an eye opener but I personally knew about a lot of the material in this movie after following them for so many years. That's not to say that this detailed film wasn't put together well and I appreciate the fact that the director is celebrating such a talented group that brought L.A. Hip Hop to the forefront, so I hope that it gets all of the recognition that it deserves when it comes to Oscar time. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, 46, whose first movie was Murder Was The Case, back in 1995, starring Snoop Dog, so it's ironic this his last movie would be about N.W.A. He also directed Friday in 1995 and Set It Off, the Negotiator, a Man Apart, the Italian Job remake, Be Cool and Law Abiding Citizen. He doesn't seem to shy away from the big projects and he's tipped to be directing the next Fast & Furious, which they haven't started to work on yet. I would like to see him celebrate other Hip Hop artists, who made the movement special during the 80's and 90's, because he done a great job with this film. It didn't seem like it was over 2 hours long because he covered so many different elements of the group, which made it interesting and a joy throughout.Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $200millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Biography, Drama, Music movies starring O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., Aldis Hodge, Paul Giamatti, Marlon Yates Jr., and R. Marcos Taylor. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A biopic that educates and resonates with some small errors,"Biography adapted films are sometimes risky depending on the topic. The biggest risk is making sure that all events related to whomever the biography is about are true. For this to work there are a couple of factors that need to be considered. First is the time period. Depending on the time period, certain events and facts may be difficult to research. Second are the people being portrayed. For individuals that have never been heard of before, the only way for someone to know how to portray them is by studying records of their behavior and then interpret it themselves. However, for more recent times it has been a lot easier for such access to various information. Then again, there is no greater person to help with this kind of project than the person themselves. Take it from Ice Cube and Dr. Dre who produce this movie about themselves, when they went from the bottom straight to the top in the rap group Ruthless & N.W.A.There really is no better way to make a film about yourself other than directly being involved with it. Then add F. Gary Gray as director with writers Jonathan Herman (his first writing credit) and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center (2006)) and you have a recipe for successful storytelling. It's quite a feat considering only one writer had a credential that showed promise. F. Gary Gray was a nice choice due to his work in other films and his best known film to date being Friday (1995), which also starred Ice Cube. For a biopic on a group of artists, it has a natural tendency to educate audiences (especially the ignorant ones) about why Ruthless & N.W.A. acted the way they did and why they did it. The main plot is about how Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, MC Ren and Eazy-E rise, fall and recover from their fame after making a name for themselves. Specifically, the music they would create related to the people being oppressed by the police officials in Compton California.This section of writing is what really the educational part of the story is. As displayed throughout the film, for those who were not aware of the situation going on in California, many considered Ruthless & N.W.A. pimps that glamorized and emphasized the negatives in life. But as clearly stated by one character, ""Our art is a reflection of our reality"". It does not get any more real than that. Along this being its strongest element, it is also its weakest because that particular social undercurrent is not focused on enough. The rest of writing analyzes the rest of the characters from startup and separation of paths. This is fine and develops its characters, but in some ways it feels like it slights the main point. That's not to say the actors that play the characters aren't noteworthy though. Playing Ice Cube is his son O'Shea Jackson Jr. who can not only act but (thankfully) shares his father's looks as well. Along side Jackson Jr. is Corey Hawkins (as Dr. Dre), Jason Mitchell (as Eazy-E), Neil Brown Jr. (DJ Yella), and Aldis Hodge (MC Ren). All of which have great chemistry with each other and all act with true emotion.The only other actor who has almost the same amount of screen time with them is Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, Ruthless & N.W.A.'s first producer. Giamatti as Heller is convincing in his role and does play a significant part in the groups history. The only thing that doesn't look right is Giamatti's horrendous looking wig. It just looks too fake to be his. Couldn't there have been another wig that looked more realistic? And just for fun there are a bunch of other references either to past events or nods to other celebrities. There's (not real) appearances of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) head of Death Row Records, Tupac (Marcc Rose), Snoop Dog (Keith Stanfield), mentions of Boyz n the Hood (1991) etc. For those who remember those moments and enjoy revisiting the past, the nostalgia will be memorable.Matthew Libatique is credited as the director of photography for this production. For all of Libatique's camera-work, there's great lighting, and an exceptional demonstration of showing the transitions that went through the artists lives from beginning to the end of the movie. For the scope that the camera captures, ranges. There's a mix of wide panning shots but only to show the scale at which events were occurring. There's also shaky-cam effects, which although aren't welcome most of the time, end up doing okay for the moments that call for them. This usually involves frantic scenes but that's it. The music, of which this biopic is based on definitely has the beats. Although the soundtrack music is mostly lip-synched to the actors, it feels authentic. Joseph Tranpanese composed the film score although there were not a lot of scenes that needed instrumental music. Trapanese just fills in for the sentimental and tense moments. It's the usual cues but all anonymous and that's good since it's a biopic on rap music.Aside from the writing's initial social undercurrent that is unfortunately let go of over time and Paul Giamatti's awful looking wig, it is a well made film. The actors have authentic chemistry with each other, the music has catchy beats, the camera-work is well lit and a lot of its writing paints an educational picture about the ups and downs of the fame life.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I would have give this a higher rating but ...,"...I think it's a fair rating nonetheless. Nostalgia and emotion might have contributed to this rating, but then again, I have not over-analyzed my other ratings to determine if any emotion was at play there so... yeah ... my rating remains as is.There were parts of the movie (it's loooong) where I noticed the acting and was dragged out of their world into the real world for a minute or so. To be fair, this only happened some time over the hour mark when my brain's ADHD kicked in while sitting on the same spot in an environment where I have to be on my best behavior (the theater).The cast were on point, for the most part, I did however judge the one actor to a stricter set of criteria than the others as I was a bit nit picky over the portrayal of the one artist who filled the void of older brother as I was growing up in a heavily censored environment without any father figure or older brother to mentor me and/or help me deal with my early childhood anger issues.I was a bit disappointed in that the character development of that said artist was very limited and felt rushed over in order to focus on the other two characters instead. Without the context or familiarity or celebrity of that artist, the lack of character development would have left huge gaping holes in the plot. On the other side, I do however think that Jason Mitchell did an exceptional job. I was completely immersed in his world whenever he appeared on screen. The same goes for Corey Hawkins.In hindsight, parts of the drama seemed a bit after school special-ish, but I decided to attribute that to difficulty of nailing drama without it coming across as even the tiniest bit cheesy in this judgmental age of instant gratification.Overall, it was extremely enjoyable and nostalgic and quite an achievement given that at least 3 of the main characters have led such interesting lives to cover even a fraction of it in just over 2 hours and retain context is a bit ambitious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fabrigated and tampered Story,"Dre just showed the positive side of himself and tried to portray himself as courageous while he wasn't, The part where he assaults people is removed and also the ones where he genuinely deserved to be jailed. Watch Eazy-E's diss on Dre and you'll know.Also, Eazy died pretty rich and wasn't afraid of anybody and definitely was not a pussy as mentioned in the movie.Acting wise, It was a great watch but yeah, story has been tampered for personal gains.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Beautiful & Moving Story,"I saw this yesterday and I am so glad I did. The one star reviews of this movie are honestly making me very angry. It seems that people have very narrow views of the world and are upset they were exposed to a slice of peoples' lives that don't align with what they think is right. People comparing it to a porn have obviously never seen any actual pornography. This movie is poignant and moving. Yes, there are scenes with women wearing little or no clothing. People have sex. NWA blew up and surrounded themselves with beautiful women, as many celebrities do, but these are the same people who don't say a word when reviewing Wolf of Wall Street, James Bond movies, etc.The top review right now that is showing on the MAIN PAGE for this film on IMDb says ""Were black men so aggressive and shameless during the 1980's?"" Are you kidding me?! If you go to see this movie and that is what you come out with, then you have some prejudices that are deeply embedded in your personality and a movie, unfortunately, can't change that.First things first - the casting was spectacular. O'Shea Jackson Jr. and his dad could be twins, I swear. The entire cast actually look very similar to their real life counterparts. The actors and actresses in this movie were incredible and obviously felt a deep connection to the roles they played. The talent in these men, especially those playing Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy E, is off the charts. I hope to see much more of all these actors. These men lived hard lives and were born in a rough part of the world. They struggled and suffered a lot of hardship. They worked hard to get to where they did. This film doesn't gloss over any of the less pretty aspects of their lives in Compton, nor the fact that people continued to try to silence them and refused to see past their skin color even when they started to become well known. I love seeing the camaraderie between these young men - they look out for each other when no one else will. I cried twice during this movie - if there were people who weren't touched by this movie, they must have hearts of steel.Are they angry? Of course they're angry. Look how they got treated by police, by people in general! Look how black people today STILL get treated like that! This movie is incredibly relevant to a lot of the issues going on in our society now. Anyone that thinks this movie is glorifying the thug life obviously missed the entire point of the movie and apparently turned their ears off during the scene where they LITERALLY discuss this exact sentiment. This movie seems to have offended those who live in a bubble separate from the real world where bad things happen to people and where people sometimes don't behave in ways that you think are ""upstanding."" News flash, it's a movie about NWA. If you didn't think there would be swearing, sex, and alcohol and drug use, you didn't know anything about the group or the time period or the places it was set in and you seemingly know nothing of the world in general. Sometimes people don't talk and act and experience things in the same way as you, and that doesn't make them inferior, it doesn't make them thugs, and it doesn't make their voices any less valid.In summation, this movie is beautiful. It's real. It's raw. It's not whitewashed and toned down so as not to offend racist people's views of what black people should act like and what roles they should be relegated to. That's what NWA was all about anyway, not putting up with other people's crap and not allowing people to put them in a box and tell them what they can and can't say/do. I love NWA's music. My sixty year old white parents loved this movie. It's actually long enough to flesh out a complete story from beginning to end without racing through things like a lot of movies seem to do nowadays. The acting is brilliant and the camera doesn't pan away when things get real. I think everyone should give this movie a chance. I'm so glad I caught it while it was still on the big screen. It's a brilliant story about the hardships and the triumphs of a group of men who overcame a lot and fought hard to be successful. I will absolutely be buying this movie on DVD when it comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
What's more beautiful than watching talented rebel artists change the world?!,"'STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Music biopic about the popular 80s/90s hip hop band N.W.A. (an abbreviation for Niggaz wit' Attitude), from Compton, California. The film focuses on rappers Ice Cube, Easy-E, Dr. Dre, MC Ren and DJ Yella. It was directed by F. Gary Gray; who also directed the 90s' comedy classic 'FRIDAY' (which was co-written by and starring Ice Cube). The movie stars O'Shea Jackson, Jr. (Ice Cube's son), Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins, Aldis Hodge, Neil Brown Jr. and Paul Giamatti. It was written by Jonathan Herman, Andrea Berloff, S. Leigh Savidge and Alan Wenkus; Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Gray were all producers on the film as well. I really enjoyed the movie and found it educational (and inspiring) too.The movie begins in 1986; when friends Easy-E (Mitchell), Ice Cube (Jackson, Jr.) and Dr. Dre (Hawkins) formed the rap band N.W.A.. MC Ren (Hodge) and DJ Yella (Brown Jr.) later joined the group; although this is not covered in the film (as their parts are not fully developed). Easy-E first bankrolled their project; and formed his own record label, with producer Jerry Heller (Giamatti), called Ruthless Records. After releasing a hit single, 'Boyz-n-the-Hood', and doing a successful show; the band was later picked up by Priority Records. The movie covers their entire rise and fall from fame, as they caused a music (and social) revolution.I've never been a huge rap or hip hop music fan, and I never followed (or listened) to the group N.W.A., but I did enjoy learning all about them in this film (and I do now like their music). For me the movie was very informative, and I also really liked the style (and look) of the film (thanks to Gray's excellent direction). The performances are decent enough, and the social commentary couldn't be more fitting to the times today; the film largely deals with race relations and police brutality (and it doesn't seem like much has changed, between then and now). The movie's a little long, and slow paced in places, but for the most part it's very entertaining and inspiring; what's more beautiful than watching talented rebel artists change the world?!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/iHtyjLDJ1Ko",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton in a 6-4 Impala,"This is a landmark film that will have staying power beyond the history of rap music. In order to understand the power of this film it is essential to understand the history of the environment from which this music genre emerged. South of the City of Los Angeles is a small city of about 100,000 called Compton. A quarter of the residents live below the federal poverty line. About a third of the population is less than 18. Although demographics have changed to a latino majority recently, the African American community found available housing here after WWII. Situated near Watts and South-Central, the area has suffered the ravages of gang warfare, drugs, with internal corruption and mismanagement of the City. As the Civil Rights Movement slowly got started during the last century, voices began to speak out: James Baldwin, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Black Panthers, Angela Davis and Maya Angelou. In the sixties, the Black Panthers shouted out black pride. The popular music from the sixties (R&B, Motown) was never an overt statement of protest, but the message was there although veiled (""Dancing in the Streets""). Around the time of the Nixon administration, it became the mantra of politicians to ""get tough on crime."" The end result of this misguided and ignorant approach is today's mass incarceration of Black men and the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement.With this history as a backdrop, the film begins in 1987 and explores the driving forces that pushed this artistic movement, a movement driven from the street by young men, straight out of Compton and into mainstream America.From Compton, many rap artists emerged but among the first are N.W.A., Dr. Dre and Ice Cube. The cast give performances that stress the reality of the daily life in any community ravaged by illicit drugs, society's benign indifference regarding basic social support services and always the presence of the police. Rap and hip hop have now continued for thirty years. It is time to acknowledge this history and listen to the message very carefully. This film may be the finest production to date on this theme. The young men who created this sound in Compton and other cities speak in a coarse street language about anger, fear, humor, love, sarcasm and frustration. But there is a warning: things must change. The film is divided into short stories of the forces that caused the artists to write verses in a percussive rhythm where melodies have largely been discarded. They immediately found a following in Compton. The actors portraying the rappers made their characters very real. Paul Giamatti portrayed their first agent ""Jerry"" and nailed his part. Mr. Giamatti is probably the finest character actor on the screen today. Sadly, the women in the film were dehumanized and made ornamental and insignificant. The middle of the movie slowed a bit until Eazy E's story. If this had been fiction, it probably would have seemed contrived. But the fact that his death at just 31 from HIV was true, skillfully drove home the fact that life is short and temporary. The photography could have been a distraction with the hand held jiggling camera, but it worked and complemented the coarse reality of the story.This film's release turned out to be perfectly timed. It is much more than a Saturday night date movie. It is a historical reality check. It is a cinematic chapter in the special history of the Black equality movement that is far from over. But for now, these artists spoke to America and the world, straight outta Compton in a 6-4 Impala.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Solid (but Over-Long) Music Biopic on the Origins of N.W.A.,"N.W.A. hit it big with ""Straight Outta Compton"" in 1988. I was only about four-years- old at the time and, by the time rap music fell on my radar, I was in high school and, with a few exceptions in that era, I wrote the genre off as something I wasn't interested in. I was a classic rock kid. Sue me. Anyway, modern rap hasn't done anything to change that but I have gone back to check out some of the earlier stuff I'd missed thanks to STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON and realized I might've been a little hasty in dismissing an entire genre of music. That's how I know this movie is good; it was able to ignite a respect for something I previously couldn't be bothered to care about. It was the same with Ron Howard's RUSH in 2013. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, from director F. Gary Gray, details the meteoric rise and eventual divide of West Coast rap phenomenon N.W.A. Aspiring artists Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) band together with their friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), who's developed business acumen from his time as a dope dealer in Compton, to bring a message to the people that they're tired of the oppression and abuse of power from local law enforcement on the black communities. We see the power behind their music inspire a generation of people to rise against their oppressors, while at the same time shady dealings between Eazy-E and their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamiatti) lead to fractures between them.N.W.A. was a five man team but STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON seems to focus on the three key players: Dre, Cube, and Eazy-E. If you're a fan of MC Ren or DJ Yella, I'm sorry to tell you but they're essentially background players in the scheme of the movie. At least Ren steps up as N.W.A.'s main writer once Cube goes solo, but Yella doesn't get a whole lot to do. As long as that doesn't cause you too much grief, you're in for some amazing performances from Hawkins, Jackson, and Mitchell. Hawkins gets some meaty material for Dre as a man dedicated to his craft and determined to be successful, and Jackson (real life son to Ice Cube) is spot on as an angry artist and the only member of N.W.A. with the gumption to call out Eazy-E and Heller for ripping them off. But, in the end, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is Mitchell's movie. Eazy-E is the most compelling character in the roster and Mitchell is given the most engaging character arc in the film. Eazy-E goes from street-smart dope dealer to millionaire, stepping on the backs of friends to get there, and comes to realize what he's sacrificed for success. Mitchell is a scene-stealer and, despite the way he cheats his friends, he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie. The character is complex and, as someone I'd never seen act before, Mitchell nails it. Even Giamatti pales in comparison as the group's self-serving manager, a man I can't pin down as genuinely evil or just playing the crooked music industry games.The story behind the rise of N.W.A. is a pretty awesome one. Seeing as how most of the members are still alive and probably had a certain light they insisted on being painted in, you'll know you aren't getting the full story but, at two and a half hours long, you're still getting plenty. The movie covers what are, I figure, the more important points. We get key moments in the studio, including a reluctant Eazy-E's recording of ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" line by line and the birth of ""F**k the Police"" after the guys are harassed by some cops outside the recording studio. We see the rise of hard core rap and the effect it had on the populace, surely contributing to the outrage of police harassment and abuse. The movie focuses primarily on the Rodney King event and the following riots in Los Angeles where the guys saw their dire warnings come true as the oppressed fought back. The movie also manages to stuff in scenes with appearances from Snoop Dogg and Tupac so fans will have something to nudge their friends and point at the screen about. One of the better story elements in the movie comes in the form of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) when he poaches Dre over to Death Row Records; Taylor has an intimidating presence and can pull off crazy eyes that'll stop anyone in their tracks. The last half hour or so starts to drag when the movie starts going down Eazy-E's redemption path and introduces his AIDS but that first two hours is pretty solid. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a movie I never thought I'd love but there you have it. It's even got me listening to some of the early west coast rap to have come out of the era. And if that's probably the best compliment I could give the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Effective and sprawling, if overlong.","Very ambitious project. Perhaps a little too ambitious. I appreciate all of the themes it tried to incorporate, but 150 minutes was just too long. By about an hour I already felt overwhelmed because the film had traced so much story. This is one film that really felt its length. I also think throughout many instances, the film just overplays its melodrama completely. Some dialogue is shoddy, and some of the narrative structure gets messy in its second half (which is definitely overall more problematic). I think the cast is really great though, and the film does get across its overarching, most powerful message about brotherhood and friendship. Jason Mitchell stands out as the MVP here, although everyone does fine work. I was really loving the film in its first half but yeah, it just seems too all over-the-place in its second, but I still liked it a lot",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Overrated TV movie,"I've just watched this last night.

Inaccurate,"I was disappointed at the movie because the dress and speech of the place and time was not accurately portrayed. The people in Compton and South Central have a have melodious, funky way speaking (which maybe be the reason they make good rappers) which is not captured by the actors. Also Easy-E had a funny,unique way was speaking which was not depicted in the film. The style of dress in the late 80's was not baggy. Wearing a raiders jacket is not enough. Look at pictures or films from the 1980s gangs and people in general you'll see that the fashion is different. Much of the film took place inside closed rooms with the actors cursing at each other. It would have been better if they had the actors were doing stuff out in the street and showing the audience the streets of Compton. Also, a large percentage of people in compton are Latinos. Yeah, Dre does wear Cholo Nikes. But they could have included some cholo characters or hot latinas. Also, the movie does not explore the contrast between the on stage and off stage personas of NWA. Were they really Hudlums? or were NWA just rapping about the things they saw around them? The movie also dragged on too long. Oh, That being said, the film has some good party scenes and the cinematography, sound, special effects are pretty good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the film was dope,"Straight Outta Compton is a wild ride, that shows the rise and fame of Ice Cube, Eazy-E and Dr. Dre. What I loved about this movie was the characters, if you walk into this movie, being slightly familiar with the artists, you will walk out, bobbing your head along to the amazing soundtrack, which consists of the artists' original songs, as well as some solo projects that they embarked on. I loved everything about it; the performances, the musical cues, the writing sessions, Ice Cube's film career, where he is seen writing the script for Friday, everything was very well done. The only true gripe I can find is that; I was disappointed that they didn't show Ice Cube writing one of his most popular and most critically successful songs; ""It was a good day"", but other than that, Straight Outta Compton is an emotional, funny and touching thrill ride, that is well worth the price of admission, I give it a 9.5 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Their responses though were not so kind. They mentioned quite a bit of this movie is made up/Hollywood fluff just to sell it. So don't take this as an actually history piece, because it is NOT.

Easily one of best movies of 2015 so far,"Straight Outta Compton is directed by F.

First off,before seeing this movie I knew very little about N.W.A and their story and I have only listened to some of their songs and I have to say I loved this movie. Everything was just so great from the casting to the story telling. The acting was fantastic by everyone. The two people who stood out was O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who played Ice Cube and Jason Mitchell who played Eazy-E, both performances were amazing. Now this movie had lots of funny moments but it also had lots of serious moments. They weren't afraid to cover some of the more serious topics, like what was going on during this time. F. Gary Gray handled those moments very well. F. Gary Gray did an amazing job with this movie. The only negative thing I had was that at some parts, some scenes dragged too long and you feel the runtime (2 hours and 27 minutes) but besides that I loved it.

The music took me back but I awkwardly was stiff with the rest of the crowd.Story was great the movie flowed and you couldn't help a root for these guys. I give the movie a 10 out of 10 however that is ridiculous.I will have ever say that I'm going to see this movie again and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Eazy-E was bang on Suge Knight was bang on Dr. Dre was not bad and Ice Cube bang on!!!!!I highly recommend..... and the people give that give this a bad reviews, after seeing the movie I don't get them.The pornographic comments are ridiculous. I'm sure they toned down what was really going on. Good movie 'cause Stone G said so!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Pretty good but selective memory takes over,"Yes, the film is overlong but generally entertaining. Would have given it 7* but knocked off a star for the flagrant rewriting of history to favour the producers (Dr.Dre, Ice Cube and Tomica) Performances are generally good (esp. Ice Cube's son) Better editing and more honest portrayal of facts would have improved the film. Btw ignore the 1* reviews - don't watch a film about gangsta rap if it offends you so much!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton,"Just like I commented on last year's film Selma, I feel that the new film Straight Outta Compton about the rise of the rap group N.W.A. and it's group members including Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, could not have come out at a more crucial time. The film does indeed work very well as a musical biopic of the group's rise to fame, but as well as being a powerful film about the lives of the members of this rap group, the film also touches on key issues that were happening in the late 80's and early 90's and that are still affecting America today. The film depicts police brutality and the racism of the police at that time toward the African American community. People being stopped on street corners and harassed by the police for doing absolutely no crime, or misdemeanor other than the fact that they were standing at the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also incorporates the famous beating of Rodney King by police officers into it's story as well and the film works just as powerfully as Selma, as a statement against racism and against the powers that be that are suppressing and promoting racism, but I would argue that out of the two films, Straight Outta Compton is the better film and while some may argue that this film glorifies violence and gang behaviour, I would instead argue that it definitely depicts the everyday lives of these people and shows how they have made themselves in a society full of violence, narcotics and racism and how they struggled against these things and still managed to come out on top as one of the world's most influential groups and that was very impressive to me. The film still does depict the violent and sometimes offensive lyrics of N.W.A. and shows people trying to live the gangster type of lifestyle, but I think at the same time that some of these people were definitely a product of their surroundings and the home environment and world where they came from and how the system and society around them was often times failing them, yet at the same time these men grew for the most part out of the stereotypes and made names for themselves. Another interesting aspect of the film that it touches upon is the whole issue of censorship and freedom of speech. As anyone familiar with the group's lyrics and public performances can tell you, the group and it's members were often getting themselves into trouble over their lyrics and content which later resulted in arrests and threats from the Federal Bureau of Investigation against the group. One song in particular that addresses the corrupt and racist nature of the police of that area around the time was a particular instigator. Yet again, these young men were saying through their own type of poetry and street wise language and commenting yet again on the here and the now and because there was so much racism in that area and the police were at times racial profiling and just brutal towards the African Americans, it is not surprising the that particular song was so powerful and almost in a sense became an anthem for young people at that time. The film when it works as a musical biopic is also very powerful and well done. All the usual elements are here including arguments amongst the group and the shady business people they encounter and the typical lavish and yet unscrupulous way of living that resulted from the tons of cash their music was bringing in. I was surprised at how well this film turned out and how much I loved it. Everything about the film was done right. The acting which was mostly from an unknown cast (except for Paul Giamatti was the group's manager) all deliver exceptional performances here and of the films I have seen so far this year, I would have to say that this film has the strongest acting and ensemble cast of any film that I have seen so far this year. So kudos to these up and coming actors as they really got their stuff together and knocked it out of the park performance wise. F. Gary Gray's direction was also very impressive to me. I wasn't sure how the film would look and turn out with him as a director, but I would say this is his finest accomplishment and best direction to date. The film is at times gritty and very suitable for it's urban setting and at other times can be flashy and lavish as these young men are taken out of the ghettos and moving into more established areas and also doting more money to their homes and way of life. Yet those earlier parts of their life still affect and are part of their lives which is another powerful point of the story and the film does a good job of balancing both worlds. The film while it is longer it length certainly breezes right past you and is certainly the most entertaining two and a half hour film I have seen in awhile and it is so involving and captivating that it feels like there is not a single wasted moment, or frame in this whole picture and the pace and rhythm of the film is just perfect. Straight Outta Compton works as the most entertaining film of the year so far definitely, but it also works on a social scale as well and delivers a message that was important at that time and is still incredibly relevant today and just as powerful also. One of this year's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Boyz n Da Hood meets 8 Mile.. A Modern Classic.,"Straight Outta Compton is the story of N.W.A, a group of 5 men growing up in Compton and the struggle they face with the police as well as their rise to fame and how they influenced the world. As controversial as the group is, they have inspired many including myself, this film is a perfect reflection of that.From the beginning we get a glimpse into how the police treated these people because of their skin colour. This was a very real thing and the film does a perfect job at showing this, to an almost shocking degree. First off,the cast is perfect. O'Shea Jackson shines in particular. He plays Ice Cube and is actually his son in real life. It can't be easy playing your father, but he makes it seem that way. His mannerisms and look are just brilliant, it is almost as if we are seeing Ice Cube himself. Dr. Dre and Eazy-E are also played brilliantly and i could not see anyone doing a better job. This film is very much based around those three members of NWA, whilst DJ Yella and MC Ren do have parts to play it was a bit odd that they didn't get nearly enough screen time as Cube, Dre and E. Paul Giamatti also appears as manager of NWA Jerry Heller. I'm not entirely sure how accurate his role was in the movie but Paul Giamatti does great at being part caring manager, part corporate douchebag.Around the third act the film slows down in pace as it shows us the fall of NWA and the feud with Ice Cube. Where many people saw this as a flaw, i was as entertained with this portion of the film as i was with the rest of it. We start to see how the members of the group are dealing with their own personal issues, so as a result we get a good look behind the scenes of the glamour and music as well as the personal lives of people we thought we knew. For example, we get to see Ice Cube writing the script for Friday which shows how he is moving on from NWA. A character in the film talks about how NWA is glamorising drugs and violence, as producers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre do brilliantly at showing us how this wasn't the case. You can really see in the writing that they are passionate about this story.Overall, Straight Outta Compton is one of the gems of the year. The soundtrack is brilliant and had me rapping along to the lyrics on more than one occasion. It made me laugh, it made me tear up at points and in a way it really inspired me to be what i want to be. I highly recommend this film to absolutely anyone who will listen. It demands to be seen in cinemas and is one i will most definitely be buying on blu-ray. One of 2015's best movies and that is no exaggeration. Time to go home and blast out the old NWA records.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Damn, That Sh*t Was Dope!","A vicious blend of kinetic direction, smart writing, compelling performances, energetic camera-work & groovy soundtrack, Straight Outta Compton is one of the finest biopics to surface on screen this year that's captivating from its opening moments, is sprinkled with clever wit & offers an intriguing sketch of one of the most influential groups in hip-hop music history, and is amongst the most hip & entertaining movies of 2015.Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise & fall of the hip-hop group N.W.A which emerged from the violent streets of Compton, California in Los Angeles during the mid-1980s and ultimately went on to bring gangsta rap subgenre into mainstream music. The plot focuses on three of its founding members namely Eazy-E, Ice Cube & Dr. Dre, the numerous controversies the explicit lyrics of their songs invited, and its decline due to financial disputes within the gang.Directed by F. Gary Gray, this biographical drama features a deftly structured story that's smoothly narrated & swiftly paced and is totally devoid of any dull moments. Driven by its electrifying tracks, the whole ambiance of the picture is highly charged & aggressive in tone and manages to make its voice heard loud & clear without going in your face. The gang's critical stance against the police is relevant even today and the reflection of the volatile society it emerged from is evident in their songs but there's more to this flick.Straight Outta Compton does succeed in offering an in-depth glimpse into what N.W.A was trying to express with their explicit, provocative music but it also doesn't shy away from illustrating the flaws of its own members, albeit not as extensively. The background research is carried out in exhaustive detail but a few artistic license is taken here or there to enhance its drama which do work out in its favour in the end. Another positive sign about its quality is that its story is told in such an engaging manner that its 147 minutes of runtime simply flies by.Cinematography exhibits dynamic use of camera that remains in sync with what's unfolding on the screen for it is chaotic when things are on the verge of explosion & easygoing when dealing with calm moments. Every scene accompanied by N.W.A songs is better than the ones without it and the tracks are arranged in a fitting order plus greatly assist in enhancing the whole experience & keeping its potent vibe alive. Editing keeps the plot closely-knitted for the most part & paces it amazingly well but it does slow down near the end where it appears as if having spent all its energy.Coming to the performances, Straight Outta Compton features a relatively fresh ensemble in Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jason Mitchell & Paul Giammati, with all of them chipping in with very convincing work in their given roles. Whether it's the chemistry these guys have with each other or the sequences that require them to prove their mettle individually, Hawkins, Jackson & Mitchell are able to keep the audience's gaze firmly fixed on them and render their real-life figures with sublime effectiveness while Giammati provides reliable support as Jerry Heller, the manager of N.W.A.On an overall scale, Straight Outta Compton is a delightful surprise for it's far better than expected and is told with such passion, confidence & panache that it's difficult to not be swept by its strong tide. The script is an absolute gem for it brims with elements that scream N.W.A from first frame to the last, wisely handles the positive & negative escapades of the group, and puts just about enough meat on its characters' arcs. Highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly rewarding, Straight Outta Compton is an instant classic that's destined to garner a cult following and will stay around for years to come. To summarise it all in a sentence, ""Damn, that sh*t was dope.""",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Expressing Themselves,"It's 1992, and I'm just a normal teenage kid just starting to expand my musical tastes, and I come across this thing called Gangster Rap...and it hits me like motherfucking train.From Ice T, to Geto Boys, to Bone, to N.W.A. this stuff was potent and vital and raw. And it was musical genius. It was perfect.I think a lot of us grew up with that feeling. And more, it opened our eyes to some things - like how mainstream society can be so blind and deaf to loud new things. How music could intersect with politics and sociology, activism. Not to mention the plight of so many young black men in an American landscape previously dominated by whitewashed culture.And it's nice to see the story of the guys who brought it out, who broke those boundaries, stood up for their freedom of speech, and moved a whole generation with them. The guys who laid the path for so much innovation and really great tunes.

N.W.A (Not. What. Appened),"As a white Englishman, I loved N.W.A. back in the day mainly due to their controversy and anti-establishment lyrics.

There are so many facts, and people ignored in this ego trip of a movie it insults our intelligence. But with the group involved as producers, and advisers, what do you expect but a pompous and narcissistic movie.The two stars are for the music and the cool Lowriders in the movie, but also the feeling of the late 80's is very well realised and the gig performances are pretty well staged.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Film,Watched this film this afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. I'm not the biggest fan of rap music but still found myself interested in the origins of this group that spawned a popular culture. The Rodney king incident shown during the film really did reflect on how far things still haven't moved on since those days and how much police brutality goes on not just against the black community but also people of all races especially from poorer backgrounds. If only they'd done that to the Wall Street bankers before the recession Maybe we would not have have such a crash. One rule for the rich and for the poor. Luckily there are mobile phones now to try film the abuses more frequently.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"I didn't like it, I LOVED it!","First of all, if you don't like gangster rap from the eighties nor biographies you probably should not watch this movie because you probably won't like it. But if you do like that kind of music then you will love this movie. I for sure did. It brought me back to my youth and it got my attention for the whole entire movie. It could even last for two more hours to me, I would still be pleasantly entertained. Of course you get a movie with a lot of music and that's the real bonus for me. I love N.W.A. , Ice Cube, Dr.Dré etc... so it was like listening to my CD's and watching a documentary about the gangsta rap movement. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is definitely the star of the movie. Maybe because he is Cube's son and you definitely can tell he is. His physic and mimics are just the same as his father. Really well played I thought. I miss those bands when I think about it now. Those were the best days of Hip Hop. So if you're a fan of this music then you should watch Straight Outta Compton. You won't be disappointed.

Straight Outta Compton,"I was hyped about this film ever since I saw the trailer a few months back and finally got around to seeing it. Very satisfied with the end product. I'm a big fan of N.W.A., Ice Cube, and Dre so seeing young portrayals of them was riveting. O'Shea Jackson Jr. looks so much like young Ice Cube it is ridiculous. He had all the mannerisms and voice of his father down. The film offered a view at the creation of some of the wonderful tracks in the groups catalog like ""Fuck Tha Police"", ""Express Yourself"", and the title track. Its crazy to think that the group was around for a short time, yet became such an influential and iconic group in hip hop. I was very satisfied with the portrayals of the members of the groups. There is some stuff left out with events that transpired with Dre, and the more misogynistic element of N.W.A.'s music but its no biggie. Its so nice to hear some classic tracks from not only N.W.A., but the various solo efforts of the group, among other West coast acts that are featured in the film. Music biopics are usually hit or miss; I can safely say this one was a hit. Dramatic elements, the music, the rowdy atmosphere of the late 80's, and the raw energy of Compton and aggressive hip hop was all captured in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Our art is a reflection of our reality"".","What is the main purpose of art? Yeah, right, to express yourself and tell the world your story. This is what ""Straight Outta Compton"" movie is about - to show people the reality as it is and to inspire everyone to fight for their rights and better life, with no fear. And this is what guys from Compton did. They went against the system. They weren't afraid of anything, they just decided to become ""the voice of their streets"" and change their reality through music and make other people believe they were able to do the same as well, if they didn't like the situation they were in. Of course, it wasn't that easy. There was a lot of misunderstanding, refusals, protests, but at the end it all was worth of that. Guys were accepted and supported by people. But, as it usually happens, nothing good last forever. Within the group there was a lot of controversy, plus dishonest manager who just used the guys to enrich himself. All this affected the group and, as the result, the group stopped its existing. And then everyone went on its own.I should stress out a great director's work. The way the camera moves, scenes sequences - nothing special, but still it looks so real that you feel like if you were inside the action. Such effect is also due to the great actors' performance and well thought script. I think there could't be any other movie telling N.W.A. story.I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially to those who appreciate hip-hop music and its culture. The movie makes it clear how hop-hop appeared and what the main message is. And it will also be very interesting for common people, because the film is very tense, it's full of action, drama, it has a real story to tell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
for the hip hop crowd,"This is a sort of biographical tale of how rappers Ice Cube, Easy E, and Dr Dre came to fame. I'd say you need to be a fan in order to really like this movie.The movie starts with them as teens living in South Central. The part I didn't like was how they portrayed all the cops to be bullies with no cause. I seriously doubt it's like that in South Central.Anyways they get popular in clubs and a music producer, Jerry, wants to sign them (but is really only after Ease E). So of course with money involved the friends grow apart and they get mixed up with thug, Sug Knight. Eventually E dies while the other 2 have even more success.I thought the actors portraying the rappers really played the part. And I didn't know it was Ice Cube's son playing him until looking here. Now I know why he looked so much like the real Ice Cube.FINAL VERDICT: OK, better if you were one of their fans.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I always hate how biopics try to paint people as good guys that aren't.,"I know very little about rap and even less about it's history so I found the film to be fascinating. But every Biopic that gets acclaim that draws my interest, I always will be curious how much of it is true and what underlying messages got twisted to illustrate a different narrative. And the biggest one is the portrayal of Dr. Dre.My impression of him was that he was that he was the quietest and the most sensible member of the group that had the least problems with the law. But what the film neglects to show is all of the abuse that Dr. Dre did towards women. It's important to remember when watching Biopics to see who is involved in the production of the films and who comes out as the winners in the story to find out how factual that they really are.It was an interesting and well-made film with lots of truths that are mixed up due to the inputs coming from a bunch of different people with Eazy-E obviously not one of them due to his unfortunate death to AIDS in 1995. As always, movies like this tend to paint the people involved in a more positive light than they deserve to be, but I enjoyed the film nonetheless.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Movie,"This movie accurately chronicles the rise of N.W.A. and the aftermath that has come out of it. O'Shea Jackson Jr.'s portrayal of his father, Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Sr.), is uncanny. His look, ,his mannerisms, and facial expressions were all spot on. All of the actors they found to represent the members of N.W.A. and other rappers portrayed in the film are all spot on in my honest opinion. I know this movie is getting a bad rap for the way it depicts law enforcement, particularly the LAPD, but those were different times and things have come a long way in the last 30 years both in law enforcement and racism. I would recommend any fan of N.W.A. see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An energetic music biopic with great acting turns,"Straight Outta Compton is most certainly pretty dope It's long though so make sure you got ample popcorn and coke The story of these pioneering rappers is a story worth telling Even though there's far too much intent starring and yelling This is a tale filled with music, drama and boys from the hood It's important that the film then casted so good Filled with up and comers, unknowns and a scene chewing Oscar nominee Straight Outta Compton really creates a believable hip hop company Stand outs are Jason Mitchell as Eaze-E, Corey Hwakins as Dr. Dre and O'Shea Jackson Jr as his father Ice Cube And Keith Stanfield as Snoop Dogg really is quite the dude Director F. Gary Gray directs with a steady and well-tuned hand No doubt steaming from the time he had once spent with the band He makes the group feel alive and the streets of Compton as well Without this energy and attention it could've been the films death knell The problem with Grey's film is that it steadily loses steam There's also a lot of glossing over details that make the group seem a little too clean And you can't help but feel that the boys from N.W.A were slightly more mean For in many ways the film feels gritty, realistic and raw But the group itself only show glimmers of what made them enemies of the law Overall the film shines most when the music takes centre stage and the creative process takes hold And in the end you're glad that this story was for the big screen told One of the better music films of recent years Despite its melodramatic TV movie nature, Straight Outta Compton brings the tunes, the laughs and the tears.In Summary – Straight Outta Compton is a slick and well-made biopic that does a fine job of handling so many stories in one cohesive narrative. After bursting out of the blocks Compton does eventually start to run out of steam however and it would be hard to argue against the fact that the films best scenes are held within the first half.It's hard also to not feel slightly ripped off by the fact that these men are made out to be slightly to pristine from their colourful background with crime and misdemeanours but with Mr. Cube and the Dr on board behind the scenes they clearly had a say on what the final cut looked like.With a winning cast and fine direction from Gray, Compton is overall a winner and no doubt a great event for those array of fans of N.W.A that have for many years waited for this story to be told.3 ½ Nash Edgerton's out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"good movie, but maybe too long","This is definitely a movie worth watching. The cast is very well chosen with young, quite unknown actors,which not only have a look remarkably similar to the original group but act very well. Especially O'Shea Jackson Jr. plays his father well and very authentically. The movie tries to depict the situation in Compton in the 80s and early 90s with crime and racism against young African-Americans all around, especially coming from policemen. A situation which nowadays the public,thanks to N.W.A., among others, at least is aware of, though it has not changed dramatically since then. It is a good feature of this movie that it tries to explain N.W.A.'s fight for freedom of speech and against racism by using their music as a medium. The negative part about this movie is that it maybe describes the political aspects too short whereas the house-partying-part is way bigger than it should be, therefore the second part is too long with too unimportant features. Apart from that a movie definitely recommendable since it is still on point 25 years later.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Very ballsy.. But Delivered! :),"Well, they delivered! I finally seen this uplifting film based in the late-eighties, early- nineties, of the rise and fall of one of the most notorious groups LA has ever breaded. NWA.To start off, the acting is on key and is done well by all the main characters of the story. I especially think Corey Hawkins (Dre) and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Cube) in general were phenomenal; really ballsy on his (Jackson) part - following in his dad's footsteps // and for the first time, as far as I know - I don't think Ice Cube would be steered in the wrong direction, regardless.I found a lot of heart in the film. Not any romance, but the love for the game. You can really see who was the true artist and who was just lucky to be there for the ride. In a way, even though he doesn't seem like he's doing his part, Easy-E was a formable asset to the group. He was a spokesperson; a symbol, if you will; a person to look up to and have speak for a broken generation all around.I must mention that the film was roughly two hours and thirty minutes. Let me just say, that time flew by from how entertaining this film was. And it had nothing to do with the same bullshit; gang-war; violence; drugs; rioting. This film was interesting for it's dialogue. YES, MY FAVORITE. - It had heart, and that is how I know they found the right actors for the part.You see, this has been something that has been around for a long time now. Adults are not growing into their dull. boring lives // and it is good to reassure them that at one point, they were all about standing up to the system. Falk it!I gave this movie a slightly off-generous 4 out of 5 stars. There maybe have been a few things I needed closure with, such as Dre.'s story. But I hope to see better black cinema films after this. F. Gary Gray kicks ass at it again in this coming-of-age tale.Hope you enjoy!-- Michael Mendez",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The song remains the same,"Remarkably the movie version of the rise, fall and redemption (at least of Dr. Dre) of the hyper-politicized, most radical musical artists of their time still follows a natural trajectory of fame you see in many other musical acts. Or to put it another way: ""it used to be about the music, man!"" ""NWA"" rose to prominence in the racial charged atmosphere of Los Angeles and tapped into a broad discontent about continuing disparate treatment throughout the U.S. Instead of writing metaphorical songs of protect, their lyrics directly challenged authority with blunt threats of violence. The movie, focused around founding member ""Easy-E""'s brief life and experience with the group. Interestingly that group's experience follows a seemingly natural course you would find in other musical biopics such as ""The Doors"" where the band struggles together to break through and then quickly struggles against one another once successful and then finally struggles with drugs, drink and the hard partying that comes with the lifestyle. While the story feels to have fidelity to actual events in the pre-Kurt Cobain era, apparently, much of the misogyny and actual physical violence against women surrounding the band is reduced to a cheeky line ""bye Alisha"" as Ice Cube throws a woman out of a hotel room. Much has been made rightly over Ice Cube's son's performance as his father. Corey Hawkins neither physically or in mannerism quite nails Dr. Dre and R. Marcos Taylor never quite captures the natural intimidation that Suge Knight exudes. The writing and direction keep the story moving well across a long running time and juggles multiple subplots well as we see Ice Cube and Dre branch out from the group and become huge stars of their own. The music never quite comes to the forefront and plays a less prominent part of the film than similar biopics. Those looking for musical nostalgia are better off just buy the old albums. In short, while never bringing a lot of emotional resonance, the film captures a familiar pathway for a novel-for-their-times band.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I have to put this up there for movie of the year and I really wonder come Oscar time if we will be hearing about this one. Maybe not for the music category, being NWA and all lol but I can see some other categories for sure. I can't say enough about this truly captivating story and how the movie does such a great job telling it right up until the end. No spoilers in case people don't know the real life story. All I can say to sum it up is SEE IT. I bet you will watch it more than once. ""Yo Dre, I got something to say"" Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The worlds most dangerous group.,"Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise of rap group N.W.A and boy does it deliver, if you wanted guns, girls and kick ass music you've come to the right place. The story is raw and keeps your attention throughout the movie, moving between the different members of the group and the different trials they had to go through. The writing is funny, powerful and shows just what N.W.A stood for when they first emerged in the late 80's. The pacing is strange at times but ultimately it doesn't take away from your enjoyment of the movie, and a few things feel a little bit rushed but it's only a minor negative in an otherwise awesome movie. The real stand out element in this movie is the acting as every single person in the film is absolutely brilliant, particularly original N.W.A member Ice Cube's son: O'Shea Jackson Jr who plays Ice Cube in the movie. Every actor had me believing they were the character they were playing, which is not easy when you are playing such recognisable people like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. All of them really gave it their all in the movie.In summary, Straight Outta Compton is a damn fine film. It has plenty of action and comedy, with a lot of heart thrown in as well and it is interesting to learn about the groups rise to fame and how they all ended up after the group disbanded. If you like N.W.A you'll love this movie, if you like rap music you'll love this movie, and if you like great movies, you'll love this movie.In the words of Dr.Dre: ""That was dope!""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An antidote for summer blockbusters.,"Raw. Very raw.I'm not the biggest rap fan, but I do enjoy it from time to time. These guys were something else back in the day. I think people don't really realize that, but this movie will show otherwise.The story of the rise and fall of the rap group N.W.A. is wonderfully told through the solid direction from F. Gary Gary, and the excellent performances from the talented young cast. It really grabs the honest portrayal of their days as a group and as individuals. What makes Straight Outta Compton different from other biopics is that, most biopics rely on the nostalgia, but this film reels us in with the raw reflection of that particular era. Right from the beginning we're hooked in with the trio of leads, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube, and as Ice Cube nicely puts it, their art is a reflection of their reality and it's immediately shown when the movie kicks in.The three leads equally share the load of this film and to see the three of them take separate directions in life, one would think that's a lot to juggle, but here, it's paced so eloquently. I liked the natural progression and evolution of the these characters, showing that people do change. When you have three guys coming from the same neighborhood with the same career goals, give them fame, stardom, and money, they're gonna end up in different places, forging their own destiny. The film showcases that inevitable outcome and the usage of logos, ethos and pathos are also at play, as the trio represents one of the modes.Dr. Dre is the logos of the film. Portrayed by Corey Hawkens, Dre showed the most maturing and growth of his character, dissolving into his own man. Jason Mitchell who is Eazy-E oozes charisma and charm, if anyone is familiar with Eazy-E, Mitchell's performance certainly brings the pathos into the film. The one who stole the show for me was O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Ice Cube showcasing ethos. During the hype of this film I wasn't too sure about Ice Cube's own son portraying him who really had no acting experience. I had no doubt that he would be the weakest link, but I was certainly wrong. I did not see O'Shea Jackson Jr. in this film, I saw Ice Cube. I heard he took two years to prepare for this role, and it really shows. He brings the most attitude and energy to the screen, by standing up to authority, and writing powerful lyrics. Plus his uncanny resemblance to his father helps as well.Aldis Hodge as MC Ren and Neil Brown Jr. as DJ Yella are obviously aren't in the limelight as the trio, but to my surprise they weren't underdeveloped as I thought they'd be. They have some moments to shine within the group and provide decent supporting roles. Paul Giamatti as their manager Jerry Heller brings the almost fatherly, and caring figure to the group, especially to Eazy-E, but also evokes the dirtiness of a cheating business man. R. Marcus Taylor brings out a chilling, cruel performance as Suge Knight.Is this movie completely accurate, I would assume probably not. When it comes to bringing a famous person's life on screen, there is some revisionist history going on, but it does a good job showcasing the brutality of living in a neighborhood like Compton, and how music was an escape for these guys. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre are also producers on the film and I appreciate that they portrayed themselves and the group without as much filter, despite the fact that some of it was probably omitted(Dre's history of violence against women). It only makes their development much more engaging. This is a film that has a real feel for the creative process in the studio. Their tour performance scenes rock, particularly the depiction of a tense show in Detroit where the group is warned in advance not to perform ""F*ck Tha Police.""F. Gary Gary had a difficult task of making a biopic about N.W.A. He pulled it off. Biopics more often than not tend to elaborate on the rise-fall-rise-again structure, the sex and the drugs, disputes within a group about money, ego, it's all there and to be fair we've seen it many times, but with the solid, all around performances, and F. Gary Gary's execution, you probably won't mind.Straight Outta Compton is one of the better musical biopics out there, and easily in the top ten of 2015. Sure, the last hour loses just a tiny, tiny bit of steam showcasing some side melodrama, but it's packed with performances you can't take your eyes off, stellar concert scenes, nice cameos from future rappers, a strong narrative, just an electrifying film all around, Straight Outta Compton is a hell of a ride and the lyrics of Ice Cube's ""F*ck Tha Police,"" which was written almost thirty years ago, is still sadly relevant today.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Express  yourself,"The film illustrated the ongoing conflict and tensions that still exist in the USA between the urban black youth and the police.The central characters in the movie were Dr Dre, EazyE, Ice Cube and Jerry Heller. There were great performances from the actors who played Ice Cube (Jackson Jr) and EazyE (Mitchell )steeling the show.NWA didn't create 'Gangsta Rap'but they were the ones that took it to the masses and made it popular. Central to this revolution was Dr Dre played by Hawkins and the rhythms written by Ice Cube.The key to this movie was the relationship that existed between each major protagonist how that relationship developed, matured then fell apart.The break down in the relationship of each major character was very public at the time this wasn't properly captured in the film, this is what lets it down. This is probably done not to give rise to any new disputes (beefs) and to respect those that have passed.As the central focus of the story was on the relationship of the group and not those that existed in conjunction with the group so relationships that the rappers developed with their spouses were not fully explained, spouses appearing out of the blue making you wonder were did he or she come fromThe film isn't overly violent or nudity jumping out at you each minute. Overall it was a good movie and I was surprised how quickly 150 minutes flew by.

"""Straight Out Of Compton"" The Diary of NWA's Lyrical Journey","Chasing the American Dream; 'Starting from Nothing and Making it Happen', is an obvious theme in STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON. And while the movie displayed New York's B-Boy representation of Hip Hop Culture from the East, something else was brewing out West. ""Reality Rap"" or Art, as Ice Cube described it, exposed an underground culture in South Central Los Angeles, that up until that time, no one knew existed. Although set in California, this was no Hollywood film, as vivid images of real obstacles hovered over five young dreamers, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and Eazy E, who, despite these obstacles, managed to change Hip Hop's course. No Graffiti Artist, no Break dancers, no MC. Just a 'Dope Beat' and a Rapper with lyrics to match, which ironically held the story line that explained NWA""s journey. The casting was on point as well as the writing and direction. Everything you thought about NWA's persona is erased as we learn that these young minds were well equipped to deal with and combat any and everything that came their way.

Don't bother.,"I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their ""music"" became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this.The actual story is so stereotypical and formulaic that it became tedious to watch very early on and made it difficult to stay interested. After watching I cannot believe the high rating the film has here and I can only put it down to some earnest fans and their friends voting for the music rather than the story.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Movie! Best in its kind!,"First of all, i must say, i really enjoyed this movie! I've been a fan of NWA since the early 2000's, i listened to all of their songs, watched all the interviews and documentaries. So, i wasn't a stranger to the plot, and most of the time the production stayed true to the real events i thought, except some part of the feud between the rappers. But i don't think anyone will watch the movie with a critic eye, everything was great.The actors did a really good job, huge thanks to the real characters who mentored them, and had a big part in the aspect of credibility. The Compton atmosphere was really old school too, and well synchronized with the music that was used. Really loved it, great acting, great directing, great production.

A great movie,"Some of you people giving bad ratings know nothing about rap music or what the streets are about. Why watch a movie about something you know nothing about. Then call them thugs and whatever else you can think of. This movie is about real life and what they went through to get where they wanted to be and should have been. You tell me if you lived like they did and had your money played with you wouldn't be angry also? They rapped and spoke about what was going on in their lives everyday and what all minorities went through and till this day still go through. Something i can say that most of you have not been through and probably never will. Rap was their outlet and they did it well. Yea i know what type of people rated this horribly. I love this movie although a lot was untold about how E really got aids. Just ask Suge he knows the truth.

This movie could possible be my favorite movie of all time!!!,"I love this movie!!! Simply put, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is my generation's version of THE FIVE HEARTBEATS. I've seen it every week since it was released. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON elicits a multitude of emotion such as happiness, anger, joy, and sadness. It touches on some sensitive topics that are still very relevant today in the USA. Even still, there are several humorous moments throughout the movie. Although the movie is 2 1/2 hours long, I still want more. The song selection was poignant and focused mainly on the music from the NWA. This movie is NOT for kids so please leave them at home. There is quite a bit of nudity and explicit language. I hope the DVD will come with special features such as deleted scenes and an extended version.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good fun bio that takes it a little easy on Dre,"Dre and Ice cube are producers and so one can see the the way they whitewash certain aspects of their early lives.

JAson Mitchell deserved an acting nomination as he is one of our emerging great actors and has a very engaging screen presence as one can see in this movie and the TV series Chi.Paul Giamatti is good, but i wish they showed just a little more nuance in his shady character in the second half of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great film, worth more than 1* reviews the muppets on here keep grading it as...","I'm only writing this as a kind of response to the outrageously low marks, and occasionally racist reviews. I know a little bit about the story, I followed this stuff when I was growing up. I was about 10 or 11 when I started to listen to rap music (I listen to ALL types of music not just rap! I have a very wide taste in music and a huge record/CD collection to back that up!)... OK, basically, I LOVED this film. I enjoyed how the story was told, all these crappy reviews on here are very suspicious indeed as some of them are virtually identical to each other! People moaning about the swearing? You've got to be f**king kidding me! People moaning about young angry black men being glamorised for their choices in life and how they act? F**k. Off. I don't see people slagging off mafia films like Goodfellas or Casino in the same way! And some people on here complaining about it being an 'Adult' movie!?! Swearing, sex, nudity, gang activities etc. Of COURSE it's and ADULT MOVIE! SO F**KING WHAT!? There's even some reviews bringing the good lard G- zuz into it! How? What the f**k does Jesus have to do with it?! Less Jesus, More G's, please!It's a film, it's Hollywood, even I expect errors in these biopics because of that! The acting was very good indeed I thought. Certainly no problem there. Some things were left out, but as I said, I kind of expect that from Hollywood.These 1 star reviews are suspicious cos they certainly don't reflect accurate feedback. If my mate, who didn't know who NWA were and has never ever listened to rap music, can become engrossed in this biopic, and actually say to me at the end ""Man, that was actually really good! I found that thoroughly enjoyable!"" We watched it late at night when he was dropping off to sleep. Instead, he got into it and woke up cos he was enjoying it so much... So, ultimately, I'm not going to say much about the film as there's no real point. It was just a reaction to the 1 star, bordering racist, filled with crappy personal irrelevant opinions reviews...

Straight Outta Compton (Spoiler Free),"Straight Outta Compton is directed by F. Gary Gray and stars O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, and Jason Mitchell. During a tense time in racial equality, a group of boys from Compton in Los Angles, California, starts a music group called NWA. Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E lead this group to the forefront of the music industry. They rap about their hard lives on the streets and the unfair treatment they receive. Their music causes controversy everywhere and they revolutionize the Hip Hop genre.Although the actors in this movie were relatively unknown, they managed to pull the audience into the film and play their parts very believably. The characters, however, were hard to connect to individuals, because there was a large cast. But the three characters that stood out were Dr. Dre (Hawkins), Ice Cube (Jackson), and Eazy-E (Mitchell).Corey Hawkins played Dr. Dre, who acted as middle ground between the two extremes of this movie: Ice Cube and Eazy-E. His acting was very convincing and there was never a moment when the audience didn't believe the character was real. This character also had the most dramatic arc in the film. The audience can clearly see him develop from a homeless street kid into a very successful music artist. Everyone loves an underdog and this adds to the audiences' appreciation of Dr. Dre (Hawkins).Ice Cube was one of the extremes in this movie. He was played by O'Shea Jackson Jr.: the actual son of Ice Cube. Being related to his character really helped his performance: Not only did he look the part, but his mannerisms and expressions deepened the character for the audience. However this was a very confusing and ill- paced character. The script never seemed to decide what type of person Ice Cube (Jackson) was, and it kept changing personalities until it was hard to understand or relate to. One scene he would be calm and reserved, but the very next scene he would be raging and violent.The other extreme character in Straight Outta Compton was Eazy-E played by Jason Mitchell. Mitchell's acting throughout the film was by far the best and most heartfelt. His character had a very clear motivation and drive: his desire for money. This was a breath of fresh air from the confusing characters in the film like Ice Cube. Once the group takes off, Eazy-E (Mitchell) gets lost in a world of contracts and lawsuits, but his pursuit of money always remains strong. However, this money seeking side of Eazy-E (Mitchell) causes him to come across as greedy and unlikable to the audience. The script tried to address this in the character's arc, but the finishing of the arc felt rushed. Because of the rushed ending, the audience never really got a chance to connect with the character.The tone of Straight Outta Compton can be summarized in one word: Intense. Any scene with police officers in it was extremely high-strung and had the audience breathless. The tension in those scenes poured out of the screen and wrapped the audience up and didn't release them until the end of the scene. The best parts of this film were the intense scenes that took the audience's breath away.The film had one major error: It's run-time. This film would have been more enjoyable and left the audience on a better note, if it had cut its 2 hour and 27 minute run-time to an hour and a half. In the first hour, the film focused on the creation and popularity of NWA and how the public responded, but after that it became joyless drama that wasn't engaging for the audience. The last twenty minutes of Straight Outta Compton was very enjoyable and it tried to wrap up the story. Unfortunately, the ending felt rushed and didn't cover some plot points from the beginning of the film. If the film had avoided the boring drama that took place in the middle of the film, it would have been more interesting.The surprisingly good acting and the intense tone made this film a highlight, but the way the film dragged on and made it hard to connect with each character dragged down the film.

The truth is, this movie is down right amazing. The plot, the casting, the producing, whatever, it's all good. Straight Outta Compton simply shows the struggle that the rap pioneers endured in their era. Racism was a big deal, and so was police brutality. The 80's and 90's had the same problems that we have today. that's why 'Fuck Tha Police' was so controversial. This movie is telling it how it is, or was. People are just mad because this movie shows the reality of America and its police. Alright, the movie is a little embellished. They exaggerated some of the events, and cut out others, but that doesn't change the struggle. That doesn't change that the police were dicks, and that doesn't change NWA's talent.

Incredible Story Telling,What can I say great story great casting. I didn't want to see this at first but my boyfriend convinced me and I was very impress with the way they told the story.

The movie kept me interested in see what's going to happen next we can all appreciate a movie where your eyes are glued to the screen lol. It also made me wanna go out and buy the cd as well the music was great.

A riveting soundtrack of life,"I've seen about 30 movies this year, but this one is by far the best. As somewhat of a movie aficionado, I know it's very easy for a film to fail. Some have a good story but bad casting, or vice versa. Some are good stories but have a bad director. This movie is excellent in all three areas. I don't know how director F. Gary Gray elicited such great performances from his cast of mostly unknown actors, but he pulled it off. He also shows restraint when it comes to the gratuitous violence another director might resort to, considering the subject matter. Straight Outta Compton is not a PG movie by any means, but it uses stellar storytelling, solid performances and a sprinkle of humor as its vehicle. I'm not a big hip hop fan by any means but I enjoyed it as the producers pulled back the curtain and revealed how some hit songs were inspired and also gives insight into the music industry, where greed and intimidation are as commonplace as lyrics and videos. Lastly, I cannot forget the performance of Jason Mitchell as Eazy E. What a wonderful job this guy did of capturing a multi-dimensional man, bringing grit, humor and vulnerability in a totally believable display that is Oscar-worthy.

An Interesting Film About an Uncommon Subject,"Public Enemy's Chuck-D once said ""Hip-Hop is the CNN of the ghetto."" If that be the case, N.W.A. and the talented artists that composed the super-group are the Walter Cronkite of urban black youth in the early nineties. Formed with the collective talent of Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, MC Ren and Arabian Prince, the music of N.W.A. would become infinitely notorious with its anthem F*** tha Police. While comparatively short-lived as a group, they became pioneers, forging a new subgenre of music known as gangsta rap.It makes perfect sense that a movie would be made about the group, their tumultuous first tour, their breakup and their eventual (kind of) reunion. Though with all but one member of the group alive and well, the history of this films development is arguably more interesting and more hectic than the movie itself. The film originated in the mind of writer S. Leigh Savidge who wanted to concentrate on the partnership between Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and manager Jerry Heller (Giamatti) as they forged Ruthless Records. After rewrites, Tomica Woods-Wright (wife of Eazy-E and owner of the lions share of N.W.A. song rights) was approached to head the project as producer. As rewrites mounted, more screenwriters were hired and the scope of the film got larger, more and more producers joined the project. A total of sixteen producers are credited for the making of Straight Outta Compton; and yes two of them are former members of N.W.A. Ice Cube and Dr. Dre.I say all this to point out how good Straight Outta Compton is despite its long crooked journey to the screen. You would think that all the cooks in the kitchen would make for one confusingly disjointed film. Fortunately after years of development, and a number of rewrites the film itself is a well-made, well-told, well-oiled machine. It recollects the impact of the group's rise with gusto while keeping with the ethos of the group. O'Shea Jackson and Corey Hawkins do wonderful jobs portraying Ice Cube and Dr. Dre respectively. Energized by the force and rawness of the story, the two manage to find equal footing in a crowded field of actors walking on as living legends of the gangsta rap movement. Jason Mitchell also does a fine job giving a sense of pathos to Eazy-E though he falters a bit when the third act flirts with aspects of melodrama. The real find here however is R. Marcos Taylor who portrays the lawless Suge Knight whose disreputable antics as the co-founder of Death Row Records were legendary.Yet despite the film's stellar ensemble acting and despite it's break with commonplace music ""rise-and-fall"" stories, the film still feels like an assortment of compromises. Halfway through the movie, after Ice Cube's exit from N.W.A., Eazy and Ice take to the studio releasing tracks meant to diss the other in an escalating battle of oneupsmanship. Yet we're never too aware of the reasons for such resentments. There's vagaries about contracts but nothing concrete that allows us to really take sides. All the members of N.W.A. as portrayed in Straigtht Outta Compton, are uniformly hungry for the limelight, suspicious of authority and aggressively misogynistic. Yet rarely do they cross a line of good taste and good humor that would make us think twice about rooting for them in the first place.All those compromises stack up and are ultimately dumped on the sniveling lap of Jerry Heller who by the end is treated by the film as a pathetic, simpering but somehow maleficent power broker. S. Leigh Savidge had stated publicly that half the battle of getting the film made was getting Ice Cube, Dre. Dre and Tomica Wood-Wright talking to each other. I suppose among the arguments, negotiations and breakdowns in communication, the one thing all producers could agree on was s***ting on Jerry Heller; a man who I'm sure is far from innocuous but apparently has grounds for a defamation lawsuit against the film.Don't get it twisted, the film, if ignoring the drama behind the scenes is still a real humdinger. It's a fine story about the birth and proliferation of gangsta rap sure to have fans of the music genre drool over the likeness and portrayals of various rappers at the beginning of their career. And let's not forget the soundtrack which not only features tons of N.W.A. hits but manages to insert some Snoop Dogg, a little of Parliament and a sneaky insert of Tupac Shakur's ""California Love"". Even if you're not a fan of gangsta rap, Straight Outta Compton is still worth your time, I'm just not sure it's worth all the fuss.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Straight Outta Compton remains one of my all time favorites - My Ultimate Review,"Straight Outta Compton is a biographical drama film directed by F. Gary Gray, depicting the rise and fall of the gangsta rap group N. W. A. This is a film I've loved every since I saw it at the cinema back in 2015, I've seen it countless of times afterwards and the director's cut is brilliant, this is probably my fifth or sixth time. There's so many things that the director, producers, writers and actors did right with this film. It's one of my favorite biopics of all time. Something worth adding is how the members of N. W. A were involved in the production of the film, including Ice Cube and Dr. Dre as producers, as was Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, while MC Ren and DJ Yella served as creative consultants. Ice Cube is played by his real-life son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., with Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, Neil Brown Jr. As DJ Yella and Aldis Hodge as MC Ren. Paul Giamatti also stars as N. W. A's manager Jerry Heller.Visually, Straight Outta Compton sure is a mesmerizing film. Matthew Libatique captures each scene with the upmost skill, having him as the cinematographer helped make the film look a special way, brilliant work done by him and the direction and vision F. Gary Gray had for the movie. I don't think no one could have done a better job at creating the story about NWA.The rap group NWA emerges from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.O'Shea Jackson Jr portrays his father and well he does a terrific job, nailing every mannerism and piece of dialogue. But Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell deserves huge amount of praise too. Mitchell's performance as Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright is in my opinion the best and award worthy. Paul Giamatti is great in the role as Jerry Heller. My honorable mention goes to R. Marcus Taylor who portrays Suge Knight in the movie, he has the looks and mannerisms nailed down, nailing the performance by miles. There are so many great performances, I hope we get a sequel with the actors and director returning, there's more to tell.Though there are multiple of historical inaccuracies in the film, you'll have to remember how the film is a drama and based on true events. It's of course they take dramatic liberties but some of their decisions was worse than others, but in my opinion, the film ""Straight Outta Compton"" is extremely entertaining with some incredible acting and direction but also some of the best musical sequences with each actor being on their top, they're even rapping themselves. The energy these guys has, the energy the crew has, it's incredible. The whole production is perfect with everything feeling authentic. The actors even re-recorded NWA's entire Straight Outta Compton album. There's also a sub-plot in the movie regarding the press and everything about Rodney King and the riots that happened afterwards, it's important but it could easily be seen as a little misleading regarding how they only showed the bad side of the police department. I love the message presented but there's is good ones out there like there are bad ones. But I do dig it, the whole point the film is making regarding police brutality, it gave us who were born after 1991 knowledge of Rodney King and the riots.With the Director's Cut being at 2 hours and 45 minutes, it only gives you a deeper look at the story and its characters, overall being better. But the theatrical cut seen at the cinema, remains superb. Straight Outta Compton is a film I can recommend, fans of NWA and Ice Cube and Dr Dre, will love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Speak a little truth and people lose their minds.""","Oscar-nominated Straight Outta Compton (2015) tells the story of NWA's emergence from the rough streets of Compton in LA in the 1980s, as their insubordinate bravado and controversial lyrics put them in a position of tension with the prejudiced police force who make their racial discrimination clear in the form of brutality towards minorities. NWA's goal? To expose not only the police, but also the brutal and thuggish nature of the city of Compton.First of all I would just like to note that I went into this not knowing anything about NWA at all, and I think that is what made my viewing experience so... awesome. Not knowing what was going to happen in advance meant that certain moments took me by surprise, so it was certainly an advantage for me.I was actually consistently thinking for the most part that I was gonna give this a 9, and that's because there are too many skipped time periods. Vital time periods. Like it just goes straight from x to y. For example, with their first record, it just jumped ahead six weeks to show us how successful that record became, but I wanted to see their gradual rise to that success rather than just jumping ahead. And there were similar moments at several other parts of the movie as well. I imagine that the director's cut addresses these moments though, so I won't be too harsh.But I said for the most part. That's because when things got super emotional in one of the later bits of the film, it just upped it that little extra. That was the kind of push that was needed for me to give this a 10, and they did just that.The main cast were superb in their roles, and they looked so alike to the real people too! So that's a huge credit to the hair and make-up team. As for Paul Giamatti (as Jerry Heller), I honestly can't tell if he was good or bad in this. For the benefit of the doubt I'm gonna say he was good. I just found him to be really annoying, but then again maybe his character warrants that kind of reaction.Aside from the negative I mentioned earlier, the way the story is told is fantastic. It highlights both the conditions of a run-down area like Compton and the unrelenting police brutality that occurred - and still occurs - on minority ethnics. I've seen from some reviews of this picture that people struggle to connect with the protagonists due to their reckless and undisciplined behaviour, but I would argue that sheds a light on the environment within which these boys grew up in. The way they act, the way they live, it's all they've ever known. They're not accustomed to what *we* consider to be the social norm, they're accustomed to their *own* social norms.But I'll finish my review here. I would definitely recommend this feature to pretty much anybody who is willing to see a different perspective on things. Or if you're an old fan of NWA, or even just a fan of rap music, even better, as that's basically a guarantee that you'll enjoy this motion picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The story of how a storm gathers, strikes, and changes everything forever.","It is an interesting and perhaps altogether mortifying thing to note that human progress, by and large, takes an awful lot of time. While our technological prowess grows exponentially by the day, threatening to overwhelm us and outrun us as we give it its own consciousness, we fail to understand that it is the very nature of the computer mind to NOT continue to make the same mistakes, over and over again, in pointless, deadly cycles. While that is very much the case for HUMAN minds.I haven't seen a much better case for said behavior than I did in F. Gary Gray's majesty of a movie, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Even though there aren't any Terminators in it, nor are there any real technological threats to be seen. No, the threats noted here are the same, old, TIRED ones.Inequality. Oppression. Indignity. Ignorance.STUPIDITY.You have to admire racism for its stubbornness. It's not enough that people hate each other based on skin color and culture, you have to remember that the people that HAVE the skin color and culture you hate were brought to America against their will. They didn't ask to be here. And you're nothing more than a damned fool to simply say, ""Well then get the hell out"", after ancestors and generations of idiots enslaved, raped, tortured, and murdered them simply to profit from their labor and rise into strong, almost morally bankrupt country as a result. There's a stereotype that's been created here, for African Americans, and this is a movie that's not shy about illustrating that.It doesn't CHAMPION that, it ILLUSTRATES that. There's no judgment here, and that's one of this film's strongest points.When five young men in Compton decide, eventually, to join together to create a new, completely original music genre based on what they have to go through in the America of the late eighties and early nineties, at the resistance of almost everyone who thinks playing it safe is always the best way to go, they create something truly original. Great art comes from great suffering, and these men suffer regularly at the hands of a society that treats them poorly based on appearance more often than actual behavior, illustrated not only by scene but by historical reference throughout the film. What comes out of their mouths and out of their speakers is an outcry of anger, defiance, and resistance, and it is POWERFUL. Great art is also the subject of great change, and that is what these men have started here, with their bravery and talent.I think O'Shea Jackson Jr. (who plays Ice Cube and is, ironically, his son) and Corey Hawkins (who masterfully plays Dr. Dre) steal nearly every scene they are in. They are the brains of the bunch, the smartest and the most talented of the group, and you can see it and feel it in every scene. This is not to say that Jason Mitchell (who plays a touching, charming and moving Eazy-E), Neil Brown Jr. (who plays DJ Yella) and Aldis Hodge (who plays MC Ren) do not have their strengths, because they do. NOBODY in this production has a small role, from the extras in the backgrounds without names to the women that support our five stars as they battle their way to the front. Everyone is rich, the atmosphere is vibrant and alive, the soundtrack is perfectly placed and implemented, even the shots of city-scapes are those of beauty.I've left out Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller, the man responsible for managing the up-and-coming N.W.A. Without giving away too much of the movie, I will say he delivers as he always does, being the perfect middle-man antagonist, that starts out seemingly innocent as he slowly grows into something more sinister.And finally we come to the message, which is this: Nothing is as simple as it seems. Nobody can be ascertained simply by appearance. Things just don't suddenly go wrong. Change does NOT happen overnight. And the biggest, most powerful message of all, the one that nobody learns, even though it's been repeated over and over again as we continue down this merry path to ever more creative means of self-destruction:You can't keep punching people in the face without expecting them to fight back. You can't continue to try to use fear to hold everybody down while you walk away the victorious tyrant. Those that dared to hold these guys down will be forgotten, while the words they said and the music they made will last long after everyone involved in this era of Americana become food for worms.STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is the kind of truth we need right now. And I absolutely loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Too conventional,"I had high hopes with this movie, but i did not get too excited seeing it. Some cliches about Black comunity confruntations with the police (I am not saying they are not reality based, but they are given in a too standard way and nothing out of common). The events are depicted without too much power or personality. I saw this movie out of curiosity for Eazy E, but I can say the actor who plays him is not a tenth of the rappers badass attitude. Missed opportunity to make a real good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great biopic,"Straight Outta Compton is arguably the best Hip Hop film made in recent history. The film is a fly on the wall perspective of life in South LA. You will see a lot of people giving this film negative reviews because they do not understand what life is like in neighborhoods that American society has a habit of dismissing. I hate to break it to you but the LAPD was and is corrupt. One of the very few ways out of the ghetto is to sell drugs. The movie focuses on the fact that this group, NWA, managed to create amazing music that was a audio roadmap for the hood. The film is raw. This is because late 80s and early 90s Los Angeles was raw. I just wanted to tell others to ignore the 1 or 2 star reviews. They seem to be written by people who have no idea what it is like to be considered an old man in the hood at the age of just 20. The film angers those who do not try to understand. NWA was a group so far ahead of their time and peers. It's sad that decades later many people cannot accept a medium of art that is different than they are used to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
the rap of old,"Rap was probably the most important music genre of the '90s. At the time, I knew about rap and specifically Ice Cube, but didn't know the name of any rap groups, least of all that NWA had led the charge in the late '80s.F. Gary Gray's Academy Award-nominated ""Straight Outta Compton"" tells the story of the group. It sets the stage by showing how they came of age in a world of police brutality, turning to music to alert the world to what African-Americans were getting subjected to. Inevitably, NWA repeatedly got in trouble with the law.There's apparently been controversy over the depiction of the members themselves, since apparently Dr. Dre physically abused his girlfriend. Always bound to happen with these sorts of movies. Either way, the movie has since proved relevant: it shows the footage of the police beating Rodney King, and how the acquittal resulted in massive riots (you may recall what we saw happen in 2020 after George Floyd's murder).Anyway, I recommend the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A film about a bunch of money obsessed aggressive young men.,First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree.,4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Better than expected but slightly untruthful.,"The films good but there are some scenes where they make themselves look better than they are/were. For example blaming everything on there previous manager or the way they were treated in certain situations.Yes there were probably times where they were treated harshly and discriminated against which was wrong, but they did bring some of it on themselves, and in the film they didn't show that when they should of. I feel it would have made this a more genuine film rather than trying to make themselves look good and in the right all the time.Having said that the film was interesting and it was good to see how they all met and went on to further there careers, or unfortunately what else happened to some of them.An interesting film to watch and I would recommend but slightly untruthful in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An important movie,I thought the film was unfocussed and too long but it's an important biopic about a cultural revolution.NWA's music was very important to me when I was young but I look back on it now and cringe.

check it out you wont regret it!,One of the best movies I seen this year. I am a 80's baby so the tone and music of the film were on point down to the coloring of the screen. The actor's acting abilities were average for their first major movie. The film shows how every member equally contributed to the success of the group. Its crazy how people are calling this a racist movie because NWA displayed their interactions with the police they encountered during their times in Compton. Its their movie therefore their story. Even in a society full of technology of video and camera phones people still refuse to recognize the full picture in front of them. The movie never said all cops were that way just the ones they encountered. The nudity is the same for any high rated movie and similar to Boogie Nights.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A music bio-pic on par with Walk the Line and Ray. One of the best movies of the year.,"""You are about to witness the strength of street knowledge."" The 80's was dominated by groups like Bon Jovi and Wham. When 5 kids from California burst on the scene they not only changed music but attitudes as well. The meteoric rise to the top changed everyone's lives, and some friendships. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I love true stories, music and bio-pics but I was never really a fan of NWA. Growing up outside Detroit I heard them a lot growing up but I never really connected with it. All that aside this movie is outstanding. It grips you from the beginning and really keeps you until the end, which seems to come to quickly. Paul Giamatti is great in this, as usual, but the actors they picked to play the group are incredible and are the ones that really make the movie. I could really go on and on about this but just watch this. Even if you don't like the group, just watch it. The fact that this movie got overlooked at the awards is a travesty. Overall, a music bio-pic on par with Walk the Line and Ray. One of the best movies of the year. I loved it. I give this an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Better than your average music biopic (but still a music biopic),"Better than your average music biopic...but still a music biopic. The story felt uniquely relevant to 2015, partly because the director skillfully used police brutality, partly because the music felt fresh and partly because the performances were solid across the board.

Intense Social Commentary with a Great Soundtrack,"Straight Outta Compton was so much more than I expected, I was looking for an excuse to listen to some classic rap really loud in a theater. Like ""Mamma Mia"" for Abba or ""Across the Universe"" for the Beatles, this movie gives you that and a stylized documentary. It paints a picture of a world most of us can't relate to, with a soundtrack most of us have heard.From the first minute it hits you and keeps you hooked. There are so many dark and tense moments that almost hurt to watch but is broken up with characters that add humor/hope to these situations. Obviously this is set in the past but it also speaks to a reality people still live with: racism, abuse of power, poverty, exploitation and a lot of issues touched on in the film/music.That being said it was great I laughed/ smiled countless times. Though not a die hard fan of NWA but really enjoyed the story, music and loved watching the introductions of new artists over time.This was my first movie review, primarily in response to the reviewers who gave this movie a 1/10. There is a lot of irony in the fact people would be so hostile about an NWA film, when the movie is about people being hostile towards NWA music for similar reasons. Take a step back and realize you agree with the oppressive society of 25+ years ago... who are (kinda) the bad guys in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Well-Done and Convincing,"8.5/10I have been eager to see ""Straight Outta Compton"" since I first saw the trailers back in August. Despite having no knowledge on the subject of rap, hip-hop, or NWA, this movie attracted me, partially for the music, but even more so for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of life in real-life places like Compton, Los Angeles. The world that Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and the rest of the members of NWA grew up in is as foreign to me as one from a sci-fi or fantasy movie. The difference? This sh*t is real.My first praise for this movie has to go to the actors. Everyone in this movie does a remarkable job of bringing the story to life, and their passion and dedication really shows through. There were times I found that I had to remind myself that this was a movie, that's how good they were.As for the movie itself: this is a beautiful story, and you don't have to love rap to appreciate or enjoy it (though I imagine it certainly helps). I often find rap music too crass and abrasive, and there are a lot of times that it is. However, this ""reality rap"" that NWA brought to the stage is something else. One of my favorite lines of the movie comes from Ice Cube (played by the REAL Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr.) when, during a press conference, he says ""Our art is a reflection of our reality."" This message is pertinent throughout the entire movie. Growing up in Compton has given these young men a very different world view, and while to most of America the song ""F*** the Police"" may seem disrespectful and ungrateful, seeing the way these men were targeted, attacked, and harassed by the police shows where that anger came from, and even it's justification.""Straight Outta Compton"" is both history and current events. While I would like to say that things are better now, there is no doubt that issues displayed in the movie are still present today. Police brutality/harassment, unnecessary force, racial profiling--we see these issues in the news far too often. And I would surprised if someone told me that the conditions in Compton have dramatically improved since the 80s. These are real struggles that people today are facing, and so the relevance of this film is undeniable.This is a film about music, passion, dedication, ambition, overcoming adversity, injustice in the justice system, racial profiling, and life in dangerous areas. It is powerful and all too relevant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good biographic movie,"Music is a big part of my life, hip-hop being one of my favourite genres and I've been listening to NWA pretty much since they became famous so naturally I was keen to check this out, especially as I didn't know a great deal about the actual history of the group. Eazy E was arguably NWA's most colourful & controversial member and much of the film is focused on him. On the other hand Yella (who I saw live last year) and Ren sadly don't get much screen time. And apparently there are omissions in actual events too. 
I was in LA on my first trip to the USA during the Rodney King incident, I remember it well, and this is touched upon effectively several times throughout. The film is well made, has a good cast, obviously (if you like rap) has a great soundtrack & despite it's 2.5 hours running time it never gets boring. Great footage in the closing credits too, so keep watching!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not even the actors could save this movie,"The story of NWA is so diverse and interesting, all of these portrayed artists are very different from each other and highly talented. Even if you took away their background & heritage there would be still a lot of oddities and interesting anecdotes to tell us about. Instead the movie is as formulaic and stereotypical as it can be. I would have been able to look past that and enjoy it for what it is: a mediocre attempt of rap group biopic of the early 90s except that is were its weak point is. The wardrobe, lingo, streets, mannerisms it's all wrong. Very wrong. At a pool party you get a close up of a woman shaking her giant booty in a g-string. Let me tell you in the early 90s you had high cut baywatch style bikinis, yes. But no lady showed up to a pool party in a g- string, big asses were not really considered attractive and nobody danced by staying in place and bouncing their booty. Perreo dance styles that made it into hip hop culture appeared in the early to mid 2000's.The only redeeming part of this movie are the actors which come very close to the characters they portray, except of course when they speak. In that regard only Ice's son did a somewhat good job by shutting his mouth and talking through mimics like the real Ice would when he was fronting.For someone who lived the era, who knows how South Los and Socal looked like, who has seen it up close this movie is painfully wrong. There are other things wrong too like the story being too drawn out and the pacing being weird. (It felt in many scenes like there was a build up, hinting that there was something significant going on and then it flattens out, really weird!)Altogether its a bad movie and I could not recommend it, not even to the die-hard fans. As a fan of the music and the artists the wasted potential is really imeasurable, a big disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"58 Year Old, White Republican's Review","So, what am I doing reviewing something like Straight Outta Compton? First, I am a lover of everything about movies.

I look for the entertainment value in a piece of work. These things compel me to comment.The haters of this movie need to get over the facts. This movie is not a documentary. Entertainment writers write to entertain. They are not required to pigeonhole the fact into a boring account of details. They make movies exciting by adding conflict at each and every turn. They write in extremes in order to entertain. Stop tearing down this movie over details and facts. If this is what concerns you, watch documentaries.I personally loved this movie. I was entertained.

Straight Outta Compton,"Chronicles the creation of the hugely successful and influential 1980s hip hop group N. W. A and the associated life styles and in-house fighting around the usual music biopic message, music, management, money and ego issues and the subsequent inevitable fallout.I can't pretend I knew anything of NWA or indeed hip hop, but felt compelled to watch this regarded and successful film and I'm glad I did. The story is well told, the performances are without exception first class and seeing the pretty awful LA in the eighties helps you understand the politically controversial music these guys made, which I rather enjoyed. I will admit I couldn't always follow what everyone was saying but I was still pulled along watching the rise and inevitable fall of the group, seemingly partly due to group egos but also because they had been taken advantage of. It has been mentioned in various reviews that as it was produced by members of NWA the story, gritty though it is, reflects a particular version of events and omits certain events or paints certain characters incorrectly.

Its not meant to be. This shows a great representation of life down in the streets of Compton which made me interested throughout the movie.I believe that this is a pretty accurate representation because every single scene in this movie had a say by Dr Dre and Ice Cube.Before this movie Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy E were getting the fame.

One of the best ones ever.,"Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise of rap group N.W.A and boy does it deliver, if you wanted guns, girls and kick ass music you've come to the right place. The story is raw and keeps your attention throughout the movie, moving between the different members of the group and the different trials they had to go through. The writing is funny, powerful and shows just what N.W.A stood for when they first emerged in the late 80's. The pacing is strange at times but ultimately it doesn't take away from your enjoyment of the movie, and a few things feel a little bit rushed but it's only a minor negative in an otherwise awesome movie. The real stand out element in this movie is the acting as every single person in the film is absolutely brilliant, particularly original N.W.A member Ice Cube's son: O'Shea Jackson Jr who plays Ice Cube in the movie. Every actor had me believing they were the character they were playing, which is not easy when you are playing such recognizable people like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. All of them really gave it their all in the movie.In summary, Straight Outta Compton is a damn fine film. It has plenty of action and comedy, with a lot of heart thrown in as well and it is interesting to learn about the groups rise to fame and how they all ended up after the group disbanded. If you like N.W.A you'll love this movie, if you like rap music you'll love this movie, and if you like great movies, you'll love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Amazinggg movie!!!!,"2 and half hours of realistic ,emotional,fascinating and tearful musical drama. A very well directed, provocative and comprehensive. It is a long movie but worth it. biopic that shines with exquisite camera movements and amazing performances to tell this compelling story of the three men who popularized the rap movement that came up in the 1980s.

I bow to the Black Americans who had and have to endure so much racism!,"I just don't know how Black American people can stand so much racism! This movie shows it so well! As a character says : ""it's police harassment"" that the young Black Americans have (had) to endure. Racism everywhere, showing its ugly face. These very days you can see it a lot on social networks, such as Youtube, but even here in the comments. Because it is impossible to deny this movie its artistic qualities, the amazing acting, and the creative camera viewpoints. And so if you dis all the cinematographic qualities of this, it might very be that what bothered you first and last was this was a movie with black people (not ending poorly).I am glad that the movie showed the real video of the poor man beaten by the police, and showed it not once, but two or three times. Because that can't be forgotten. Especially as that keeps happening! I tell you, I find that Black Americans are quite gracious about all they have to still endure.You may not be a fan of rap culture, and then not really appreciate this movie. But still I invite you to see it for the historical knowledge it spreads and for the educational piece it is. Peace.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Straight Outta Memes,"Even if you had no idea who NWA is (or what those initials stand for, be careful, you might be offended by it!), you will after watching this. What you won't get much out of this, is how some things came to be. This is not getting too much into the mindset or the making off (producing) songs or writing lyrics. You'll get the end results - and there is one song in particular, that is high on the ""diss-scale"" and as funny as it could be (especially considering the history).But this is a movie and it's more interested in showing you were characters are coming from and where they go/went. Performances are great and unfortunately 2015 showed us, that some of the things that were happening back then are still relevant (and are still happening). If 22 Jump Street (and Queen Latifahs reply to where she's from), was your first contact - then be prepared to be amazed.There is a lot of evil stuff happening and there is a lot of bad characters or at least bad choices. Some things never get fully explained or fleshed out, but there wouldn't be enough time for that. As it is (and having watched the extended Version already), this is a good if packed music Bio, with some very good music in it! Some things are surely comprised, I can't imagine everything happen exactly as shown, but the ""jist"" of it is surely right. So most ""issues"" the movie might have, are in it's time constraints ... but it does make the best of it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
how you like it,"Whether you'd like Straight Outta Compton depends on how you like hip hop. However, if you're a NWA fan you probably know all there is to know about the events depicted in the movie.With Dr. Dre and Ice Cube among producers i can assume that the facts are slightly skewed. But even this notion, and i admit it is slightly below the line, doesn't influence the big picture. This is one fine biopic.The rest is really your opinion. If you're into hip hop, this is one of those movies that would be a candidate for the Holy Grail. My opinion, though, is implied by my vote...The resemblance of the actors to the real-life NWA members is amazing, although i didn't expect less from O'Shea Jackson Jr. for obvious reasons.My strongest impression, though, is how biopics such as Straight Outta Compton influence my opinion about the protagonists. I like to call it ""Wikpedia's drawback"". In this particular case, i've listened to NWA and later mostly Dr. Dre and formed my opinion both about the authors and their output. This is some kind of idealized picture. But when you read on Wikipedia or see a biopic and realize how it all really happened it always gives me a whole new insight. And such insights are not always positive.Yet again, this is all just my opinion.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Skillfully Executed Biopic,"Just a little background: I am a very avid hip hop fan, familiar with NWA's music and a huge fan of Dr. Dre's solo career. This certainly added to my enjoyment of the film, but my brother, who is not familiar with much of NWA or pre-2010's rap music, enjoyed it as well.About the movie: S.O.C. is a captivating chronicle of the formation and dissolution of one of hip hop's most notorious groups. Overall, I was very impressed with the casting and the acting was great, too. Each actor bore a striking resemblance to the artist they portrayed, even down to manners of speaking and movements This may have been easiest for O'Shea, who was acting as his father, but I was especially impressed with Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E. I've heard varied critiques of the accuracy of story, but I was too young to experience this in real life, so I can't comment either way. Regardless of how honest the plot was throughout, it was fun to have musical milestones to follow, specifically in the form of each album released.If you're a fan of hip hop and are even remotely interested in the history of NWA, you should find yourself enjoying S.O.C. That being said, if you are NOT a fan of hip hop culture, you might find this movie disgusting. I've seen so many 1 star ratings on here, citing the excessive profanity and glorification of violence, which I find humorous because it's no secret that this was the nature of gangsta rap and NWA. You can't walk into this expecting some polished and safe biopic like ""Imitation Game"" or ""Theory of Everything."" The poster itself has the movie's title written in the form of a parental warning sticker. I will say that as far as profanity and sexual content is concerned, this movie is actually below the level that we saw in ""Wolf of Wall Street"" a couple years ago; this leads me to believe that some folks are harboring extra offense because the film is entirely black (actors, director, subjects) and the ""enemies"" are white (cops specifically). As Ice Cube says during the movie, ""our art is a reflection of our reality."" Police brutality and gang violence continue to be issues today, so if these themes disturb you, you should be equally disturbed by the real events that occur in America.I understand that this movie isn't for everyone, but if you've got thick skin and a respect for hip hop culture and the freedom of expression, you should have a great time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Best Rap Movie Ever Made!,"That's right, this is the best rap flick ever. It tops other flicks of its kind such as 8 Mile and Notorious. While I don't like hip-hop music, the SOC documents the days when it had a technique and was had meaning. Aside from that, Straight Outta Compton has so many things to offer.NWA was a rap band in the 80s and 90s that was part of the hip-hop explosion during that time. Public Enemy and Run DMC were other hip-hop groups around that time, but NWA broke new ground with aggressive, shocking, and truthful lyrics. They were just a group of guys from the inner city that dealt with poverty, drugs, racism and crime. Sure these things are shown in nearly every urban movie, but the way SOC deals with these issues is better done as it helps enhance the plot and evolve the characters. All other flicks have these elements but are not used best like in here. You feel like you are watching something truly excellent. Each member of the group is developed well (some more than others) and the relationship with each other and society is awesome. As a bunch of black guys from the ghetto, they are often harassed by racist cops. It is things like these that they write about and rap about with lots of conviction. There's meaning, not just wining about a bad life. This movie really takes us into what inspires them to rebel and be themselves.When they get to be famous, we get to see life on the road and parties just like in other musical biopics. One thing I loved was the subplot with exploitive managers and producers. Biopics hardly ever show this. If they do, they don't dive deep into like this does. Doesn't sound interesting? SOC make it very interesting. That is ultimately what breaks them up and moves them to different record companies. Something I loved was they showed NWA's influence of society. Not just rappers, general society. In the backdrop of the last little bit is the Rodney King Controversy and how NWA's rebellious attitudes could have influenced shock waves in society such as the Rodney King Case. Most musical biopics hardly show the influences on society and relationships with other groups this well.I hate rap music, but I love this film. Easily one of the year's best.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Surprised how much I enjoyed the movie,"First, I'm not a fan of the music so I only knew parts of the story going in. What I did remember of these events were from those discussed at school or I saw in the news. And that gave me enough background to relate to the movie.First, I found this movie fascinating and I left wanting to know more. It's a long movie, but felt pretty short to me. There is so much going on that I never felt bored. Unfortunately, that is the one thing I had a problem with. There was so much going on, so many individual stories, that none of the stories never were flushed out completely. So to Google I went to fill in the spaces.Yes, this is a movie. Yes, I understand facts were probably changed, that's just the way these biopics go. But seeing events unfold on the big screen and remembering talking about them in the halls of my school was pretty cool.Interesting movie, and I hope to see it again. Wouldn't even mind an uncut version if more scenes could be added.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Awesome,"The N.W.A. biopic hits all the right beats and notes in bringing to the silver screen the rise of The World's Most Dangerous Group.As someone who grew up as a teen listening to the original NWA and The Posse album, Eazy E's Eazy Duz It and all the follow up albums, as well as following the drama, and the careers of the Ruthless artists, and watching the careers of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre explode, it was nice to sit down and watch it all get summarized in a great movie.I took my son with me to the film, and he was blown away to know I actually lived through this time and he has started to love N.W.A.The movies has it's up moments and down moments. I think seeing Eazy realize he was dying was tough on not just me, but the audience. Jason Mitchell gave an excellent performance as Eazy E.I also have to recognize Oshea Jackson Jr, for portraying his father. The mimicking of his fathers mannerisms was spot on.Straight Outta Compton is a gritty look at the Rise of NWA, but what an entertaining look it is. If you know the group whether by growing up with them or just discovering them, this film will help you get a more up close and personal look.Highly Recommended.(I only gave it a 9 as IMDb doesn't always count 10 reviews because of site trolls.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent Biopic,"Straight Outta Compton is a inspiring, sad, but hilarious story about the world's most dangerous group! When the movie first open, you'll be on the edge of your seat. Although the movie is long, 2 1/2 hours long, a lot of scenes are left out. Hopefully the Director's Cut will clear that up. I do recommend people seeing it though. It's a very educated film.Although a 90's baby, I've been a fan of NWA. When I heard they were making a film about them I was ecstatic. For people who are not familiar with the group, I recommend you watching this film to get a better understanding of the group and who paved the way for society. Although they weren't most of time positive, or what I considered them ""Anti- Public Enemy"", the were honest. They spoke the truth about what was going on in not only they neighborhood, but turns out every neighborhood that was dealing police brutality, culture, the law, and people. Straight Outta Compton demonstrates all of that. Not only was it well produced and accurate, but the acting from the main and supporting cast was realistic and somewhat Oscar-worthy. I hope more biopic including more Hip Hop films follow the same treatment with the realistic performances and script.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Emotional, entertaining, riveting.","Wow, what a movie. Where to begin? So I saw highlights of this movie on HBO and what drew me in wasn't the actual backstory of N.W.A. but the soundtrack. I love music so that drew me in immediately, considering that I knew most of the songs. I don't know how true to life this movie is, but I was impressed with both Ice Cube's and Easy-E's character. This movie explains (to me anyway) why Ice Cube hardly ever smiles, and I had no idea he was a key contributor to N.W.A. Ice Cube was and still is a really talented dude. Same with Dre - his scratching - was amazing to watch. To be honest, this movie has some emotional elements to it, despite the Compton feel and hardcore background. I cried when Dre got the bad news and when Easy-E found out he had AIDS.It was a completely riveting movie and all the actors did a phenomenal job, especially Ice Cube's son. He pulled off his Dad perfectly!Great movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton on to the big screen,"No Spoilers because I grew up around the same time that Rap Music was growing and this is a story that no many would know about so I'm keeping it spoiler free for those who don't know the history of the group N.W.A.I knew about Dr.Dre and Ice Cube from their solo careers and their other work as well.It wasn't until ""Behind The Music"" that I discover both were in a group called N.W.A. But over the years I gain knowledge about the Group and listen to their songs it makes you go wow this group really had something.Straight Outta Compton is a Biography/Drama film that tells the story of how N.W.A. emerges from the streets of Compton in Los Angeles with their music and tales that explain the life in the hood. I went into this movie knowing some history but what I got here was I never saw comingThe movie theater wasn't full but it had a good crowdThe five men would be Ice Cube, Dr.Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and Dj Yella.The film present itself very well and it is crafted to match the tone of the story where we learn about the history of N.W.A.The performances in this film are actually so well done that you can feel the emotion. It really hit home in some scenes plus with some impressive performance it is easy to forget that you were watching a movie.The music in the film has a collection of the classic Hip Hop songs from the mid 80s and 90s. It really good how they gave other classic songs some play time in the movieMy main complain about the movie is the slow down that take place. It was like they stall the film for a while perhaps it's me but that's how I felt.But if you enjoy movies about music than this should be consider seeing.While the film does lack in some areas it does make up for being truth to the style of N.W.A.With strong acting, raw music and good history on the group that made Hip Hop like it is you will be quite surprised I give Straight Outta Compton an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Blast with Great Music,"Straight Outta Compton is a terrific journey through the music, and culture of the 80's and 90's despite it's stereotypes. This movie is fun to watch, for multiple reasons, but the biggest is the music. While you watch and jam out to the awesome music, you also get to see the culture and society of the 80's and 90's. Besides the music, the acting is also surprisingly good, as all of the actors are given moments to shine. My biggest complaint is the portrayal of police in the film, I understand that a large majority of police in Los Angeles were corrupt, but not every cop was a racist pig, I think the racist cops would have been even more resonating if we saw a normal cop every once and a while, not just a bunch of growling, racist, asses. In essence Straight Outta Compton is a funny, well acted, engrossing, music jam fest, that chronicles one of the more important rap groups of all time, but could have layed off of the stereotypes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Gripping and powerful portrayal of a legendary rap group,"It was 1987 when the legendary rap group N.W.A took the nation by storm with their astonishing hardcore rap performances that redefined the genre of rap. This gripping and powerful biopic tells the story of the five young men: Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr, Ice Cube's real-life son), Easy-E (Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.), growing up in the ghetto streets of Compton, California, and forming their rap band known as N.W.A. With the help of their manager Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti), the group becomes an smash-hit success and begin performing on a nationwide tour. While the group makes their way into massive fame, they also become a target to the law enforcement agency who condemns their music as acts of defiance. This film follows how this group on their success and how they left a long-lasting legacy on the music industry.The story behind this genre-defining rap group is quite fascinating and definitely deserves a movie deal. This film brings an incredible amount of energy to the story, and the narrative is so riveting and engaging that it strongly grabs your attention. It begins with the five young men who are struggling with their home lives and having frequent run-ins with law authorities and gang members, and it authentically depicts their lives in the violent streets of Compton. The best example would shown in an unnerving scene with Ice Cube on the school bus. The story then dives into the start of the group's career. As the story goes on, we watch as the characters rise to fame, but then gain unwanted attention by the law enforcement agency in the process. The agency becomes highly offended by their music, claiming it to influence gangs, violence, and crime, and begin taking legal actions on the group as well as their manager. The group responds by claiming that their music reflects on the reality that they are living in. The film has some comedic moments and dialogue that will have you laughing, then there are some dramatic moments that could have you choked up as well as some thought- provoking moments like the depiction of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the beating of Rodney King.The cast brings some outstanding performances as the N.W.A members. I was particularly impressed with O'Shea Jackson Jr, who is the real- life son of Ice Cube. It's very interesting to see him portray his father. The cast brings such incredible energy to their characters with not only their acting, but their rapping performances; especially during the scenes when they performing live. The film's soundtrack really leaves a strong impact, particularly the song ""F@#% Da Police"".Straight Outta Compton is quite a powerful film and maybe one of the most captivating biopic films I've seen in a long time. Complete with superb performances, enthralling storytelling, and a killer soundtrack, this movie is certainly a must-see and guaranteed to do huge at the box office. Even if you are not a fan of the band or the rap genre in general, this film is still worth your attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Straight Outta Compton is a well done bio pic with fantastic performances by new comers,"Straight Outta Compton tells the true live events of the rap group N.W.A and is produced by Ice Cube and Dr.Dre members of the group. Not going into too much detail but if you are a fan of N.W.A like me here is the movie for you. The film is directed F. Gary Gray and stars O'Shea Jackson JR (Ice Cube's son) Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown JR, Aldis Hodge and Paul Giamatti. Thought this movie is a little bit too sugar coated and leaves out some events that I wish were explored in the movie, But now let's talk about what works well the first hour is close to amazing. The acting is incredible, O'Shea Jackson JR prepared for this role for 2 years and I was a little skeptical because he is the son of Ice Cube and I thought other actors should have been cast instead but I was totally wrong he owned it. Corey Hawkins was great he did not feel Hollywood is his performance natural like an actual person and Jason Mitchell was fantastic as well. Like really, really, really fantastic. The Editing, Pacing and cinematography is beautifully put together. Although the first act is top notch the second act lost some steam, some parts got confusing and felt like someone else directing it, and like I said this movie sugar coated a little too much. But those our my only complains really. Also forget to mention this but you might have figured out by now that the music is freaking awesome!! Straight Outta Compton might lose some steam at end and they missed some events that would have been great to see, none the less this is a must see for fans as for with great directing and acting I say check it out 8.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Overall, this movie is OK. NOW I understand WHY they did that song F.T.P..

"Straight Outta Compton is a 2015 American biographical drama film that chronicles the rise and fall of the Compton, California hip hop music group N.W.A.","Straight Outta Compton is a 2015 American biographical drama film that chronicles the rise and fall of the Compton, California hip hop music group N.W.A. The film borrows its title from the name of their debut studio album and its title track. Straight Outta Compton was directed by F. Gary Gray (Director of Friday and The Italian Job) The cast includes O'Shea Jackson, Jr. as Ice Cube, Corey Hawkins (Non-Stop, upcoming 24 television series) as Dr. Dre, Jason Mitchell (Keanu, Kong: Skull Island) as Eazy-E and Paul Giamatti (12 Years a Slave, Cinderella Man) as N.W.A's manager Jerry Heller. Among the film's producers are Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright, with MC Ren and DJ Yella as creative consultants. The film was released on August 14, 2015, and received positive reviews from fans, critics, and is about to receive a positive review from me.This is actually the same director who was supposed to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but he left that project to tell this story and I'm glad he did. I mean when you pass up Marvel money to do another film, you better be passionate about that project. I believe this is a story that should be told. It may make some people feel a little uncomfortable with the topic, language, sexism, and violence. However, this film is about art, history, reality, freedom of speech, and simply survival. If this is a difficult topic for you, don't go in judgmental (or don't see it if it upsets you). I would at least give it a chance. Even if you are not a fan of this genre of music, the story alone is worth investing yourself into, and it's entertaining. The viewer can learn about goals, music, history, fame, money issues, business, dreams, and more in this one film.The strongest part of this film is the cast. These guys were like the Justice league of gangster rap music. O'Shea Jackson did an exceptional job playing his father Ice Cube. He really is a copy and paste of Ice Cube. Almost everyone in this film is so well rounded with character development and depth. You see the good and bad side of everyone. The entire cast does extremely well, especially Jason Mitchell portraying Eazy-E.I do believe the first half of the film is the best. It's the origin story, the N.W.A. assembles! Then it becomes the typical biography drama film. It feels a little rushed at the end, and like they had to wrap everything up quickly. Such as Eazy-E getting sick, I think they could have built that up a little bit more, make it more sympathetic and have him be the emotional centerpiece. Also, the actor who plays Suge Knight is straight up horrifying. He could really play a super villain. He wore a red suit looking like the Devil, flared nostrils, heavy breathing, big bold eyes, muscular. Even the real Suge Knight even ran somebody over with a vehicle, so he practically is a crazy super villain. If I were casting director, I'd hire him to play The Kingpin in Marvel, and he couldn't even have to act, just be himself. The actor playing Snoop Dogg, was a little off in my opinion. He really didn't look like Snoop Dogg, and came off like a guy trying to do a Snoop Dogg impression. But Snoop really is just a cameo.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Straight Outta Compton. I really like this movie, even though it is a lengthy film I wanted more. Even if you are not a fan of this type of music, I think you can still find some entertainment value in it. I like the cast, directing, acting, music from Dr. Dre's The Chronic and 2001 albums, reminded me how good and real rap music use to be, etc. I would love to see more bio pics on musicians and music groups. I always thought Brad Pitt could play Kurt Cobain. Maybe a Rancid movie, Tupac, Michael Jackson biopic next? I would fight it. I believe Straight Outta Compton gets a straight up...9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie you real Muthaf#ckin' G's as Eazy-E would put it. Thank you for reading/viewing, and I hope you have an amazing day as always. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Somewhat Whitewashed but a Welcomed Flashback,"The Actors representing the N.W.A. members are Folded Into the Movie Without Missing a Beat. All are Believable and Bounce to a realistic Rhythm that is Righteous. The Music Soundtrack is Thankfully all from the Originals and the short Concert Scene is Filmed Impeccably.This is a somewhat Whitewashed account of a spontaneous Eruption of Street Rhymes, Sampling, Back Tracks, and Turntables that Created a Phenomenon. They did Change the World. Not only with Their Music, but Attitudes, Fashion, and Art.Here is an Inconvenient Truth to Some but Truth it is...Black Music is almost Always at least Ten Years Ahead of White Music.This is just one more Example. Because of that this is an Important Film. Not a Complete and Thorough Account of What, Where, How, and Why N.W.A. Influenced Popular Culture (what one Movie could do that), but a necessary Signpost nonetheless. It's all worth Revisiting, Examining, and Exploring even in Thin, Shallow, Doses.Overall, Authentic as it needs to be for a Commercial Cash-Crab and Entertaining enough for devoted Fans and Rubberneckers.

This film has got somethin' to say,"This movie would not have been greenlit 15 years ago.And this movie took a decade to finally receive the full backing it needed to fully produce the story behind the rap group that started it all.Perfect timing too.Straight Outta Compton a surprisingly powerful and deep film that looks into the trials, tribulations, successes, and failures of the three main men behind N.W.A.; a group that fueled a short-lived but powerful revolutionary run of success with its urban attitude, strong lyrics, and absolutely biting commentary on devastating realities that music had never dealt with up to that point. N.W.A. became notorious for bringing light to living in the deepest parts of California while dealing with a society that constantly makes it difficult for them to branch out. This film doesn't just highlight their beginnings and eventual rise to success, it also deals with the outcome of their decisions and what happens when the wrong people are mixed in.Some have argued that the aftermath bogs down the movie, that the third act becomes a slight drag. But truth be told, no storm literally or figuratively is at its strongest in the aftermath, but at the point of impact. From the first tense scene on, Straight Outta Compton holds very little back in terms of the lyrical content, the violence, the drugs, and the disturbing environment they have to survive in as they fight for a way out. Gang members pleading for the next generation to stick to their books, cops destroying houses they believe might have drugs, and a systematic cycle of violence and grimness that comes with the impoverished life. The script gives light on the good, the bad, and the ugly part of representing the hood culture that N.W.A. managed to (slightly) escape with their bittersweet poetry.Movies representing this lifestyle and the people in it hardly get a good budget and good production value to back them up. But thanks to the powerhouse moneymakers that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube have become, it is now a hell of a lot easier for them to tell their story: and they got a great writing cast, great production team, and a superb director (F. Gary Gary has Friday and Italian Job in his resume) to back them up. Back then you couldn't have dreamed of an N.W.A. movie containing great cinematography, wonderful editing, and fantastic musical score (outside the source material) to follow a talented young cast that emulates the men behind the group perfectly. The movie is sleek, crisp, and sounds better than most of your biggest blockbusters.There is no scaling back the content and the lifestyles during Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Easy-E's rise to the top. Some of what you see is concerning and slightly paints some ugly on their personalities, and that's why the third act albeit not as energetic is required. Consequences are indeed dished out, people are lost, friendships and partnerships are tested, and devils left and right challenge the foundation and wellbeing of our main cast. The story is never pretty, whether they are buying a new house or losing it. This is why Straight Outta Compton succeeds as a film, very little sugarcoating while giving each character their good side as well as their dark side.The sugarcoating does exist though. With Ice Cube and Dr. Dre producing, I'm sure there were some skeletons in their closet that were not going to be revealed; especially when it involves the N.W.A. tours, the nasty rap beefs that followed (back when rap beefs had some actual meat), and especially during the darkest days of Death Row Records (led by rap music villain Suge Knight). Reputation is key, and I'm sure that Cube and Dre want to avoid any further controversies as their market value remains strong. They are now businessmen far removed from the dirty days of mixing records and avoiding arrest for being black. But hey, it's their money, so it's their story.Straight Outta Compton is a big budget biography that hits all the right notes, even though it doesn't aim to tell the entire story. But there's a lot that needs to be said, and plenty was unveiled within the 140 minutes of great acting, superb writing, and tight direction. It is a rags-to-riches story, except for the fact that the rags followed them long after the riches came pouring in. If you think it's just a simple movie glamorizing the gangster life then you aren't seeing this with an open mind and both eyes open. The story took a while to be displayed on screen, but thankfully the moment has finally come, and it definitely doesn't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A biopic of the highest calibre,"When it comes to sending out a message, music is one of the most powerful means of communication. Some like to use violence or force but never underestimate the power that music can have. Straight Outta Compton charts the story of one hip-hop group who would go down in history as one of the most vocal and influential groups in the history of music. That group is N.W.A.When five friends; Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), combined their musical talents and formed N.W.A in 1986, they revolutionised the genre of hip-hop forever.With the help of manager, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), N.W.A were signed by Priority Records and released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, in 1988. The album caused controversy upon release and gave N.W.A the reputation of being the most dangerous group in the world.Their lyrics were said to be disrespectful of women while glorifying the criminal lifestyle and even speaking out about their deep hatred towards the police. This biopic depicts the trouble N.W.A had with the police as well as the big personalities that would cause a power struggle within the group.As well as being a great film, Straight Outta Compton is a very good biopic. With any biopic, the actors have to do justice to the public figures they are portraying and in Straight Outta Compton, the performances are of a very high standard.In particular, the three main performances stood out and show the passion that these actors had towards playing these iconic figures of hip-hop. Jason Mitchell is the one getting the most praise for his portrayal of Eazy-E, which is the hardest of the group to play in my opinion. There have been a few murmurs of award nominations and while I certainly think that might come at a stretch, I definitely wouldn't complain if Mitchell's performance was to get that sort of recognition.Corey Hawkins is impressive as Dr. Dre while O'Shea Jackson Jr. proves that he bares more than just a resemblance to his father, Ice Cube, by stepping into his shoes with brilliant confidence and presence. Paul Giamatti is also worth mentioning with his supporting turn as Jerry Heller, the man who there is most definitely more to than meets the eye.Straight Outta Compton was a real eye-opener for me when it came to N.W.A. I had no idea about what happened to cause the struggle within the group or how their run-ins with the police came about. A lengthy runtime of 147 minutes may put some people off however, with the film covering such an interesting topic and a fluid screenplay from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff, the 147 minutes fly by pretty quickly.I wouldn't class myself as a die hard hip-hop fan but I can appreciate the music and lyrics, all of which is made easier with some brilliantly executed musical scenes showing the group either recording their music or performing it to thousands in sold-out arenas. There is some wonderful cinematography from Matthew Libatique and the editing by Billy Fox that brings such an energy to proceedings that you, at times, might actually think you are watching the performance from the same arena.You can sense the devotion that went into making Straight Outta Compton such a memorable experience and director F. Gary Gray really brings his A-game when it came to making the film. Gray has a history of making music videos for both Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, as well as the film Friday with Ice Cube back in 1995. Straight Outta Compton is Gray's most accomplished work yet and a film that he can be immensely proud of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Simply well done.,"Very entertaining, from beginning to end.Although sex and violence are of course part of the story, the main focus stays on the Music and Career of NWA and the characters involved.Casting was excellent. Ice Cube's son getting the role was the only way to go. Knowing he wasn't given the role by default and put in the work necessary showed the seriousness of the casting.I believe some scenes were cut as certain situations were alluded to before they happened and also after yet the actual incident being referred to was never shown. This is really my Only complaint, if it can even be considered one.Well done all!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cultural Impact of N.W.A.,"Straight Outta Compton is a biopic about one of the most influential hip hop groups and also a remarkable history about how their music became the voice of how unfair young African-American people are being treated. When it centers how this group impacts the music industry and the American culture, it's all downright interesting. But when the story shifts to a more personal outlook, the movie somewhat struggles juggling these other stories, which sometimes get lost from what is supposed to be the center. But it still pictures this story compellingly which alone made it intriguing to watch.The movie opens exploring their ordinary lives until it leads to forming the group they are now known for; from their rap music, they could represent their home, their lifestyle and also the awareness of law enforcement's oppression towards arresting young black men, which results with an outrage from the authority, while at the same time more people defending them and their music; with a studio wanting to make them bigger. The impact of their music is the strongest part to look around in this story, but when things get personal, it takes things to a lot of different directions, sometimes away from the center to talk more about the business in this industry and their other issues. These interconnected subplots can be interesting, except it's less easy to concentrate and also robs the supposed momentum.It's still well put together when you're just trying to comprehend the time it recreated. There's no apparent good guys or bad guys, we're basically seeing shades of gray within these people; even the ones who are supposed to be antagonized are given some sympathy (except for the police, probably.) Either way, there's real engaging humanity being presented in this biopic. The direction makes it look stunning to watch. Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins and O'Shea Jackson Jr. did a well job as the three leading roles, though Mitchell as Eazy-E is the real standout among them.Maybe the only major disappointment can be mentioned is the ending; sure it's meant to be emotional, but it's rather rushes, even to how it was setup, which failed to contemplate on the situation, plus being sneaked in with some more subplots. It would have been more powerful, but either way, Straight Outta Compton is a pretty good biopic, whatever it covers or not. Again, the influence of the group is the remarkable feat of the entirety; while the personal stuff hints some intrigue, it could have given a consistent rhythm to handle these stories all at once. Though it's still not all bad, because again, it's put with great effort into it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great story of art and music,"Straight Outta Compton is best throwback for all the old schools out there. Of course, we all know who is in the Group of NWA. It's all about art, music, and their story on how the group NWA made progress into making their voices be heard. This movie is interesting not only the story, but also because of the elements in it. Recommended for all the people out there.First of all, the movie consists of the story of NWA reaching success. there are some things that lack information in the movie. The focus is in Dr. Dre, Eazy E, and Ice Cube. Some information about Dj Yella and MC Ren is not shown. But even if some focuses are on Dr. Dre, Eazy E, and Ice Cube, Dj Yella and MC Ren is not removed from the picture. They are always together, through tough and sad times. We can understand through their music on how they fight everyday struggles of police brutality, struggles in their personal life, how they express what they feel, violence in their surroundings, and how to speak and spread the things that is happening in reality. It started from creating the group, how the group breaks, and how the group reunites. We can relate in this movie if we experience the same.Second, is the portrayal of characters. The actors did a great job on how they portray their roles. Even if the some actors will just appear in less than 30 seconds, they still did great. This goes for Tupac and Snoop Dogg. Eazy E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's portrayal was great. You can easily determine who is who on how they speak, talk, walk, act and their attitudes. It is also because we know how they act in real life and they perfectly impersonated each and every one.Third, is the environment. They provided the same setting on how people live in these places in reality. The time is mostly at night. The concert grounds, houses, recording areas, and even the party place is accurate. It Started from a chaotic place, which soon turns into a peaceful place. The camera angles are also great. It captures the great scenes and characters.And the fourth is the message. The message in this movie is how we can reach success even if we are in our hard times. We stay together because we can't be happy when one of our family leaves. We keep pushing forward, no matter the situation is. We fight our own rights as human beings and have our own way of expressing in through music and words. We should know what is happening in our surroundings, and how to make a change for the better.There are some things that are missing in the movie. The movie focuses on the good side of the characters. But overall, It was a great movie.note: I don't know why some stories are not shown in the movie and I don't know some of it. Maybe it's inapropriate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton makes you appreciate the culture,"STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON review by Mike SmithThe group NWA emerges from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.I'm not a big hip hop and rap fan, I'm not saying I don't enjoy the odd rap song. So going in to this film I was thinking it was going to glorify the rapper lifestyle like most other big budget music movies. But I was wrong, it plays more like a period piece and shows the hardships the young African Americans went through.The story is compelling and is a classic rags to riches story. If you're not a fan of rap it doesn't matter, the drama, action and story will grab you and keeps you watching. Director F. Gary Gray makes you feel like you are in a world most people have never and will never experience. Some of the scenes he recreated are amazing, including sold out concerts and full out street riots.This film focuses mostly on the rise and break up of N.W.A. and the life of Eazy-E. He also touches on Ice Cube's falling out with the group and writing his films ""Boys In The Hood"" and ""Friday"". Also, Dr.Dre's career in Death Row Records, which could be a full movie on it's own. The cast makes you believe that you are experiencing these chapters in music history.Straight Outta Compton makes you appreciate the culture and yes it does glorify the gangster life and violence, but it's Hollywood and they have to put asses in seats. This movie stuck with me just like SLC PUNK did and gives you a glimpse into a world you may not know. Also, if you liked the police before this movie, this film will make you understand why the rest of us don't.

"Opens your eyes to the influence and legacy the group has left on the music industry, both good and bad.","Straight Outta Compton is the biopic about the controversial hip-hop group N.W.A and each of its five members. As far as biopics go, this one was very informative for the most part. It really opens your eyes to the influence and legacy the group has left on the music industry, both good and bad.In 1986 Compton, California, five friends Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella form the hip-hop group N.W.A. Their first hit single, Eazy-E's ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" becomes a smash hit and gets the attention of music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), who is hired to become the group's manager. A short time after this, the group is picked up by label Priority Records, who help them to produce the group's debut album ""Straight Outta Compton"", which becomes a huge success both commercially and critically. With their newfound nationwide fame, the group begins to feel the pressures of the controversy they have stirred in their song lyrics, in particular, the infamous ""F--k Tha Police"". Many race riots ensue and the group is blamed for inciting violence against the police and other authority figures.Whether you're a fan of hip-hop or not, the film still makes for a fascinating look into music history. It transports us back to a time when hip-hop seemed like the only real voice that young people growing up in Compton, California really had. Throughout the film, there is occasional inter-splicing of real news footage showing what was going on in Los Angeles at the time. This adds a feeling of realism to the film's narrative and makes you feel like you're living though what's going on. The film's lead actors, including O'Shea Jackson Jr, the real Ice Cube's son, all did a fantastic job in their roles. Paul Giamatti was great as well, playing the group's manager Jerry Heller. My biggest problem with the film, however, is that it only really shows us the lives of Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Eazy-E, whereas we're barely told anything about N.W.A's remaining two members MC Ren and DJ Yella. I am aware that they had nowhere near as successful careers after the group disbanded, but it still would have been nice to have known more about them at the same time.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Engaging Story and Performances make this a Winner,","Straigh Outta Compton is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast. This true story is very well told, the writing and directing is very impressive. At first i thought this was only going to be enjoyable for fans of these rappers, however it really is an interesting two and a half hours that will have your eyes peeled as you learn about a piece of history that is widely unknown by people outside of their fandom, it's great to have movies like this to make people aware of the struggles faced by both music artists and African Americans at this time. However, I thought the final half of the movie fell flat, and is the main reason I am giving it an eight instead of a nine, the story begins to drag on and becomes a lot less compelling than it was at the beginning, I found it focused on Eazy-É too much when I found myself more interested in seeing what Ice Cube or Dr. Dre were up to. Besides that, there is no denying that the cast is phenomenal, a group of widely unknown actors manage to portray these real life men to perfection, conveying their hardship very effectively, O'Shea Jackson Jr. shines as his real life father Ice Cube, his characterisation is perfect and is the highlight of the film for me, Corey Hawkins and Jason Mitchell also deliver, and Paul Giamatti continues to prove his versatility as the NWA's manager Jerry Heller. Filled with stunning acting and and an engaging, interesting story, Straight Outta Compton may stumble towards the end but it is still definitely worth the watch, especially if you're looking for a good drama or biography film.A rap group cause massive fandom as well as huge controversy across Los Angeles after they debut with their music about growing up in Compton.Best Performance: O'Shea Jackson Jr.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

On the film, I thought it was brilliant, an obviously great soundtrack, to my eyes great acting (they were playing real life people and so you cannot really call it bad acting) and I genuinely felt I connected with each and every character.

"A flawed, but loving, tribute to Eazy-E","I've had an on/off relationship with hip-hop and rap music, and I'm certainly not well-versed in the history or behind-the-scenes goings-on with the artists themselves. However, I love a good musical biopic and STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly that. For those few unaware, ""Straight Outta Compton"" was the debut album (and title track) from rap group NWA, with members Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Easy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (there might be more, but the film focused on those five). It tells the story of how the group came together, created some of their hit records, and broke up due to various reasons, mainly involving money and contracts. If that sounds like a lot to fit into a two and a half hour movie, you'd probably be right. It doesn't just stop with NWA's breakup, then following the solo careers of the three most important members. If there's a strike against the movie, it's that there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do it satisfactorily. Still, the performances were excellent and I thought the actors did an incredible job of inhabiting their real-life counterparts. It should also go without saying that the film has stellar soundtrack. Narratively, the film seems to focus the most on Eazy-E, who the film is dedicated to, and most of the best moments involve him. There were many great moments, in fact, ranging from elation and awe, to a few that will probably have you tearing up. As for the film's Oscar snub, I can see why many felt it deserved a nod, but it honestly was a little too overreaching and bloated. Entertaining and fulfilling? Yes, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. However, Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) was most definitely snubbed. Overall, I feel like NWA's story would have been better served as a miniseries, considering how complex and large in scope the narrative is, but there is a 20-minute longer Director's Cut that I will be checking out in the near future. As for what I just watched, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a fascinating look at the rise of some music legends, an intimate look behind the curtain of the music business, and a loving tribute to a friend.UPDATE (Director's Cut): I honestly couldn't tell where they added a lot of material. There didn't seem to be any new scenes, but what I did notice was extra material added to the beginning or ending of scenes, extending them by a small amount. As I had hoped, most of it fleshed out the story a little more instead of just adding extra material for the sake of it. Overall, I enjoyed the film more the second go-round, although the weaknesses in the second half still remain. Another thing I noticed, or considered, is the possibility that some scenes were probably constructed specifically for the film (all in the second half). Although maybe not 100% accurate to real life, I thought that some conversational scenes dealing with the prospect of bringing NWA back together (before Eazy-E's illness and death), regardless of whether or not they actually happened, worked dramatically and allowed some partial closure to what was one of music's most infamous breakups. Thinking back on the two times I've watched STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON now, I have to consider this a new standard for musical biopics. More than just relaying a series of events, it touches on issues that unfortunately still remain relevant, namely the struggle between artists and management and, more importantly, the often contentious relationship between cops and the people they're supposed to serve. In this way, I think the film really captured the zeitgeist of this day and age, and will endure as a staple of its genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The injustice in the movie are still believed in today.,"I thought the movie was great. It showed how the police treated black people, who the rappers really were, and what happened. I think it's insane, how pretentious people act like the movie portrays afro-Americans negatively when this is actually how some of them, from the ghettos, were. They are just trying to show that they are not racist, by writing that ""this is a racist movie"", etc. But in reality, it seems to me that they are hiding their true racism by writing negatively about this movie. I enjoyed the movie, I liked learning about the NWA, and I liked that they didn't portray the rappers as heroes, more like normal human beings. I can't really seem to find the right words for what I'm trying to say, but stop pretending like the movie was racist to hide your racism.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Pulses with anger and energy,"N.W.A.'s seminal 1988 hit F**k tha Police should now be, as well as a great song, a window into a darker, more brutal past that we can now look back at on in disbelief. Like Billie Holiday's haunting Strange Fruit and Bob Marley's Buffalo Soldier, the record paints an uncomfortable picture of the treatment of black people, specifically, in N.W.A.'s case, the willingness of police officers to beat on any young black teenager that happened to be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sadly, with almost daily reports of police brutality still occurring in America, F**k tha Police is just as relevant as ever, and F. Gary Gray's Straight Outta Compton - the story of N.W.A. - pulses with the same anger and energy.Even though it runs at just shy of three hours, Straight Outta Compton is forced to cram in a lot of incident from the ten-year period it covers, but still maintains its attention to detail throughout. Beginning in a Compton brimming with racial and gang tension, a young Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young (Corey Hawkins), O'Shea ""Ice Cube"" Jackson (played by Cube's real-life song, O'Shea Jackson Jr.) and Antoine ""DJ Yella"" Carraby (Neil Brown Jr.) bring the house down with a performance of Gangsta Gangsta, much to the dislike of the club owner who disapproves of their aggressive style and confrontational lyrics. Seeking money to record, Dre turns to gang members Eric ""Eazy-E"" Wright (Jason Mitchell) and Lorenzo ""MC Ren"" Patterson (Aldis Hodge) for a cash injection, and following the release of hit Boyz-N-The-Hood, the N****z With Attitude are approached by manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti).What follows is the familiar biopic formula frothing at the brim with enough in-fighting, doomed business relationships, personal conflict and artistic milestones to fill twenty stand-alone documentaries. But Gray infuses the film with such ferocity and authenticity that its easy to forgive the films misgivings and be utterly enthralled by almost every scene. The live performances especially - and there are many - are utterly thrilling. Bolstered by the sheer raw brilliance of N.W.A.'s music and a terrific ensemble who all share an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts (obviously in Jackson Jr.'s case), the film truly comes alive in these moments, whether it be in the concert hall or the recording studio. When the group defy Detroit police with a literal middle finger and belt out the song they were warned not to play, you feel like standing up and chanting with the crowd as the police swarm the stage.The first half of Straight Outta Compton is the best, as the gang rise to fame and speak out against police brutality (the beating of Rodney King being the breaking point). Darkness looms and is teased with the presence of ex-con-turned-producer Suge Knight (played a terrifying R. Marcos Taylor) and Cube's increasing unease with Eazy E's blossoming business relationship with Heller. As Knight lays seeds of doubt in Dre's mind, everyone apart from Eazy seems to be getting screwed out of their money. The film strides along with swagger and attitude, with highlights including Eazy's crack deal gone slight awry in the opening scene and a one-shot tour of the band's hotel room as armed strangers come a-knocking.The film then gives way to some slightly overwrought sentiment and a who's who of the 90's West Coast rappers. Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and 2Pac (Marcc Rose) show up for no reason whatsoever, and Eazy begins his rapid descent to an early death of AIDS in some not-so-subtle scenes depicting the deterioration of his health . A end credits montage seemingly celebrating the wealth of Dre and Cube as well reminding us of some of the not-so-great things they've done over the years (Dre was responsible for 50 Cent after all) also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. These things stop it from being great, but this is still one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's best to let yourself get swept up in 90's nostalgia, savour the fantastic music (unless you're a rap Nazi), and watch the world only now seen in fuzzy music videos feel alive once again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Excellent drama, unrealistically violent","This is a well made drama, with an excellent cast, genuine depth and a powerful ending. Now for the not-so-great part: the makers of the film seem more interested at times in creating a filmic version of N.W.A's sensationalistic, violent music than authentically portraying the lives of the people in the group. That said, the film opened with record setting opening weekend sales, which is really something for a legacy hip hop group, and one that has a pretty selective audience.For those too young or just too polite to know, N.W.A. sort of ""broke down the boundaries"" for offensive, sexist, hardcore street rap, partly spearheading the Gangsta Rap controversy of the early 90's. What that actually means in terms of studio recordings often boils down to old Funkadelic tracks (Funkentelechy Vs The Placebo Syndrome, anyone?) with expletive laden raps over the top - middle class white kids get off on the danger and power fantasy of gangsta rap etc, while major label record companies made off with millions.Is it exploitative? Definitely, but also N.W.A. really did come from Compton (or pretty close to, anyway), and the film details their beginnings recording in rough neighbourhoods and playing dive bars to their later career, mentored by a middle aged Jewish-American music industry professional called Jerry Heller, who hid financial details from the group, both promoting them and ripping them off at the same time.Discriminatory racial profiling, police harassment, and gang activity are all played out in a harsh, realistic style of combining hand- held shots, expert editing and a concise script. The casual sexism, nudity and obnoxiousness of commercial hip hop culture might be a bit tiresome for some; these people are actual adults but behave like overgrown 18 year olds themselves at times.Two points: the film actually has dramatic power rather than sentiment, eschewing Hollywood gloss for a ""real, in the moment"" feel, but also there's a LOT of scenes in which estranged performers and dodgy record industry types get straight-up punched senseless on camera. It almost seems like the writers have included multiple scenes regarding the groups mismanagement and infighting to push the story forward, but it hardly seems realistic the sheer number of times people get angrily dealt to; even Dre, the most clean cut and work-focused of the group, apparently beats the crap out of people just for partying and making noise while he's recording. I highly doubt stuff this crazy actually happened so frequently, while at the same time the pertinent and very serious issue of wealthy producer and headphone sponsor Dre assaulting three women as a youngster is conveniently removed from history altogether.Last thoughts: see this movie, its got a great character arc and some powerful themes that fall well outside of the standard rap bio narrative. Rated for nudity and strong language, I guess.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
White Sox didn't change logos until 1991,"First sign of trouble was Eazy E wearing a White Sox hat in the beginning when the group was forming in 1987.Only problem with that is he didn't wear that hat until 1991, when the White Sox changed their logo.Somebody looked at a photo of Eazy E and didn't take the time to figure out when the photo was taken and do their homework.That is what this movie is in a nutshell. It's not based on historical accuracy and actual descriptions of what took place.It is a big studio glamorization of a group which was never glamorized during their controversial tenure. Most of the dark areas of their lyrics and incidents are glossed over and ignored.One of the founding members is cut out of the movie entirely as if he didn't even exist.Total trash.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

This is all a product of their surroundings, but the the internal struggles are relatable to all artists and dreamers.Whether or not you know anything about these stories, or even the main players, this is something that will inspire most.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
If you can't listen to gangsta rap without being offended... Don't watch it!,"Let me start off by saying, I'm a 26 year old Caucasian woman that has always loved rap, hip-hop and every other kind of music since I was a kid. I'm also well educated, but very open minded and realistic. Too many people are offended by this movie as if it's something personal. This movie is real and it's about all of their lives. I enjoy the fact that they didn't downplay or cater to those who are too sensitive. If they didn't show exactly how these guys were brought up, what they went through, how it all played out... It would be fiction! & to say it was disgusting, or racist, or ""porno"" like... That's ridiculous. You can have your own opinions of course, but the movie is called ""Straight Outta Compton"". What did you think you were going to see?! & it's rated R, so that was your warning. & you know you're lying if you say you didn't at least nod your head along to the beat! These guys are talented- their success, along with all of their fans, proves that. Awesome movie!! & amazing music. Oh, and by the way... f**k the police.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
More than just a biopic. Compton will leave you revved like a '64.,"I've seen a lot of forgettable films this year. Straight Outta Compton isn't one of them.Even if (like me), you're not too familiar with the West Coast hip hop scene, the fact that N.W.A are still relevant twenty years on is reason enough to check out their story. Directed by Gary Gray (Friday, The Italian Job), the film follows friends O'Shea 'Ice Cube' Jackson (played by his son O'Shea Jackson Jr), Andre 'Dr Dre' Young (Corey Hawkins) and Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright (Jason Mitchell), who dream of breaking out of 1980's Compton, Los Angeles and becoming rap stars.You'll leave the cinema pumping your fists, downloading N.W.A's entire back catalogue and questioning whether the racist, violence-fuelled world the group was born from has really changed much at all.

"Thsi movie was insipred from the real events, it couldn't be positive","Noticed some sensitive complaining in the reviews below that this movie wasn't positive and that it would make teens today have a ""monkey see monkey do"" attitude, hence it got a one star review and a comment that this is an insult to humanity. To the guy that said this: wake up bro and see the world you live in...it's nothing positive, it was nothing positive in the 80s...so why should the movie have a positive vibe overall if things happen as in the movie script? Ignorant people like you should watch soap operas instead.I think this movie was great and not only for hip hop/rap fans. It is not a masterpiece but definitely worth watching. Don't listen to totally negative reviewers as they are subjective. Watch it for yourself and pull conclusions from it alone.I give it 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent History of Rap Music,"My husband and I watched this last night on DVD and although we aren't fans of rap music, we both found this movie an excellent history of the genre. It tells the story of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Easy-E, MC Ren and D.J. Yella, all well played by Corey Hawkins, O'Shea Jackson, Jr., Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown, Jr., and Aldis Hodge respectively. The story begins when Dr. Dre leaves the home of his mother as she wants him to get a regular job to support his girlfriend and newborn son. He is frustrated by his need for self expression and his dream of creating something new that will speak to the young people struggling with unending police harassment and discrimination. He meets up with Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager who offers to manage Dr. Dre and his like minded friends, N.W.A. Dre is the producer and Easy-E and Ice Cube write and rap. They produce their first hit with Straight Outta Compton. As the police continue their harassment of them they express their feelings of anger and frustration through the lyrics and rhymes. This resonates with young people around the country and they are soon stars. The usual problems come up and they move away from each other and Jerry, some making better decisions that the others. Although they part ways, the bond remains a deep one that will eventually bring them back together after a tragedy.This movie was well acted by all and even though we have never really liked rap, this was truly eye-opening. We understand and appreciate where it began now and can respect the genre in a way we never expected. This movie engaged us throughout and I can recommend it for any one that can get past the language and violence. It was needed for authenticity. Really good movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Powerful,"I grew up between Spain and Paris, but NWA was too hard to ignore even in a country where we did not fully understand the lyrics of their songs. We used to listen to their music with tapes and copy their dressing style, but with very little taste. As I look back now, I don't think we could have been tackier if we had tried.About the movie It's hard to tell how much the director stuck to the real story of what went down in Compton in those years, but either way, I choose to believe it was like we see in the movie. The powerful force of rap music carving a hole into the roots of society at a time when police brutality was questioned more than ever. A group of guys who grew up with nothing and ended up being listened by millions. You can feel the power of their music, their passion and their message. All made for a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.The story is still on going for some of them. Dr Dre is the one who succeeded the most, no wonder he gets to be the one that gets the last scene.Watch it! You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Boys from the Hood !!!,"'Straight Outta Compton' directed by F. Gary Gray commences with police radio conversations about possible criminal activity happening on the spot which gets overlapped by reporters talking about the increased potency of the gangs in L.A. and the associated danger to society that comes along with that. So right from the get go, even before the arrival of any visuals, the director establishes the rough and chaotic surroundings that surround the characters in the film. 'Straight Outta Compton' portrays the rise and fall of the gangsta rap group N.W.A. and explores the band members, their natures, their motivations and also pays homage to their talent.Although the film is basically about the group N.W.A., but the screenplay written by Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff which is obviously based on real events has a very potent social poignancy to it that not only portrays America and L.A. during the late 80s and early 90s, but it also lays down the unfortunate relevance of the storyline and themes explored in the film with current times. We start off with the young men who before they became N.W.A. We see them living their ordinary lives in the poverty-ridden hoods of L.A. We can feel the discontentment with their lives in their eyes and can also feel their anger about the somewhat blatant racism in society which on many occasions gets perpetuated by cops, the upholders of the law. But they use this anger and oppression to fuel their talent through lyrics in their songs. But apart from the racism and the social inequality, 'Straight Outta Compton' also deals with the theme of what it means to be a celebrity. After the boys achieve success through their talent, we see them standing at the proverbial crossroads where they have to choose between continuing to work hard and use their talent, or allow the business side of their careers to overwhelm their art and reap the rewards of their success and drown themselves in money, random sex and parties.The film is directed really well for the most part by F. Gary Gray. The pacing is good. The cinematography is also brilliant. The film starts out in the late 80s and then progresses till the mid 90s and we do get that period feel to it. The editing is also great specially in the concert scenes which are directed and edited with a passion and the viewer feels like he/she is in the audience.The acting is also very solid. Although the film follows the whole group itself, but the main focus is on Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. The actors playing these characters are Jason Mitchell, O'Shea Jackson Jr.(Ice Cube's own son) and Corey Hawkins respectively. Although the film has been accused of ignoring some elements of the real lives of the characters, but as far as I am concerned Gary Gray never completely makes angelic and flawless figures out of these characters which ends up helping the actors to show their range. We see the darker and somewhat objectionable elements of these characters which allows the actors to venture into grey areas. Paul Giamatti also comes up with a very good supporting performance.The film still isn't perfect. One reason for it is the fact that although the screenplay is based on real life events, but I still think the story gets a bit predictable from the midway point onwards. The storyline is very standard depicting the rise of a group of artists and then their downfall through in-fighting and the obscene excesses of wealth. These transitions could have been presented by Gray in a better way without some of the mainstream elements. There are also some guest appearance of real-life artists which felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped and looked a bit gimmicky.I am not a rap/hip-hop fan. I have always been a classic rock fanatic. I have admired the poetry and depth of the lyrics that have been written by a number of rap artists, but never really have I gravitated towards hip-hop as a music genre. So if you can make a film which is primarily based on a hip-hop group and make me like it so much, you have clearly made a brilliant film. The brilliance for the film lies in its technical elements coupled with the substantial themes that are explored that range from individualistic to a broader social level. I don't think it's perfect, but it still is a significant biopic of talented musicians.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An interesting story,"First off I want to point out the negative reviews I've seen, opinions are opinions but honestly if you are not a fan of hip-hop this really isn't the movie for you.I love hip-hop but I wasn't a massive fan of NWA. I knew their music but I preferred KRS-One, Tupac, Biggie and Rakim. Regardless, I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The beginning of the movie has some good humor and you see some important character development. The acting isn't something I'd praise though, however they wanted to cast people who looked as closely to the young NWA crew and in that regard they did very well.One thing that shocked me was the character Jerry (The NWA manager) and his character development. This isn't a spoiler he's well known to be shady when it comes to money. I was expecting him to be an evil mustache twirling villain but I was wrong. There's a scene where Jerry stood up against police officers that were harassing the young NWA crew outside their studio. He genuinely showed care for them as told the police officers they were a disgrace and they had no right to harass people by the color of their skin. They also showed African-American police officers being prejudice which was something you would see in the LA area at that time. So the movie wasn't anti-white people.The drama is played up well as you see these characters be put into difficult situations. They covered the NWA song F The Police while later in the movie they show the LA Riots and what anarchy looked like. It wasn't too preachy though, there were scenes that had me laughing a lot. They mixed the emotions up enough to show the good times they had which made their moments of struggle more effective.It's not a cinematic masterpiece by any means but I feel the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting moments as well. People say negative things regarding the party scenes, but haven't we seen movies with sex in them before? We're adults here right? Lastly, the comments regarding anti-sexism... there was a scene where they treated a woman poorly but it was inside a crackhouse. Later in the movie we see Dr. Dre with a nice respectable young woman who is treated like a proper girlfriend. They are not always degrading women in every scene.If you're a fan of hip-hop I would recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
You gotta like Hip Hop,"Crazy how many people are outraged, and come on here and post their hate reviews many times!!!If you grew up enjoying that kind of music you are likely to enjoy this movie. I sure did and guess what? I'm not slinging dope or act disrespectful towards women. Some folks said the acting was horrible ... I disagree (Paul Giamatti as Heller, Cube's son playing his Dad, Jason Mitchell's portrayal of Eazy-E, and R. Marcos Taylor as Suge where on point to just name a few. Others claim the plot was weak ... or that it isn't based on the real facts. I just have to say A 2.5 hours are not enough to tell everything in 2 decades and B none of you were there ... so don't pretend you know anything. If you are outraged about the strong language or the nude scenes, go back to finding Nemo. And people quit bashing ...

Epic and Timely,"Straight Outta Compton is a musical biopic whose story not only supports the subject's songwriting, but deeply informs it. Individual moments drip with power as we see the shock of the supposed post-racial culture on these talented young men. The music itself is a punch to the ribs, with a liveliness that is beyond contagious. So even as SOC suffers the classic biopic problems of losing focus and cohesion, it overcomes its undeniable faults by being piercingly memorable, strongly thematic, and pulsing with dramatic life. The beat of the film captures what happens when justifiably and systemically volatile young men come into positions of immense power. All the while, we are essentially given a nostalgic history lesson in early-90's pop culture. Some of the dialogue and biopic clichés seem to come straight out of parodic Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, but the beautiful direction and fantastic casting skillfully cover over the weak script. Documentary-like at times, the interplay between the near-perfectly cast NWA members is funny and real. Each of the three core members (Easy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube) are so complex I wish we followed each of them individually in overlapping narratives over different films, negating some of its plot-focus issues. Luckily, where the story gets sloppy, the themes stay solid, never resorting to easy answers or morality tropes when trying to understand the complex (and sadly timely) relationship between race and society. Kinetic and vital, SOC is an epic warning about success that could make waves the way its titular album did upon initial release.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Straight Outta Compton"" almost hits the ball outta the park.","There's a baseball expression that we've probably all heard: ""touch all the bases"". It's a reference to the rule that a player who hits a home run has to run around the entire baseball diamond and make contact with each base for the run to count. Every player comes to home plate wanting to accomplish this feat, but, over the course of the game, relatively few of them reach their goal. In order to be successful at telling its story, a movie has to touch all the bases too. A group of young men wearing baseball caps help ""Straight Outta Compton"" (R, 2:27) do just that although, in this case, an instant replay may be required to verify the accomplishment.This film tells the story of the pioneering gangsta rap group N.W.A. and its five main members who rose above their circumstances on the mean streets of mid-1980s Compton, California to help create a new sub-genre within hip-hop music. Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) are spinning discs in a local club, while a friend, Ice Cube (Cube's real-life son O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), has been writing rhymes in spiral notebooks. When Dre gives Cube a chance to rap in the club, a couple other guys from their neighborhood, MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and small-time drug dealer Eazy E (Jason Mitchell), are in the club and are impressed with the music. When E bails Dre out of jail after Dre mouths off to a cop, E and Dre start talking about making something out of that music. With Cube and the others joining them, N.W.A. is formed. Cube writes, E raps and Dre produces their first song, ""Boyz-n-da-Hood"" which becomes a hit.This began a relatively short, but eventful, impactful and timely run for the group. Their first problem was how to gain wider acceptance for a musical art form that few people considered music or art. The answer was a white Jewish record producer named Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti). E starts Ruthless Records with Heller, who becomes the group's manager and gets the guys their first record deal. N.W.A.'s star rises quickly. Maybe too quickly. Egos, greed and petty jealousies divide the group's members and come between them and Heller, all of which threatens all of their careers – and their growing fortunes. These problems become grudges which lead to anger, violence and the kind of tension and drama you might get in, say, game 7 of a Major League Baseball playoff series.""Straight Outta Compton"" really does cover all the bases, even if it just skims the tops of some. Along with the rise and fall of N.W.A., we get very good character development of the main players (including a family tragedy for one of the characters, the death of another and Cube's developing career as an actor), and we get to see what happens to these men post-N.W.A. We're also introduced to other rappers who became popular during this period, some of which are still recording today. A few soundbites of mid-80s news clips open the film and very quick video and audio clips, carrying forward the stories of several of the characters, close the movie. In between, we some news events and commentary which give context and significance to the group's music.The problem is that the depiction of some developments is unbalanced. We see video of Rodney King being beaten by police, but there's no mention of white bystander Reginald Denny being beaten by rioters enraged over the outcome of the officers' trial. In fact, every one of the group's encounters with the LAPD (and police in other cities) is shown as confrontational, and every single police officer portrayed as racist and abusive. Understanding that their mistreatment by police is a major source of the anger that fueled N.W.A.'s music, this completely one-sided portrayal of police is as bad as recent movies ""Merchants of Doubt"" making everyone who questions climate change appear unscrupulous or ""Do You Believe?"" showing every atheist as depressed and immoral.Then there's the ambiguous characterization of Jerry Heller. He is shown throughout the film helping make the group successful and caring about them as individuals, but a rising distrust of him from some of the group's members culminates with a scene that leaves whether he was in fact good or bad for N.W.A. very unclear. Were all the bases touched? Yes, but it would have helped the film if all were touched with authority.But even these weaknesses don't negate what this film accomplishes. As a portrait of late 80s and early 90s rappers and the groups and record labels they created, their movement can be seen with a wider lens than in 2009's commendable, but limited ""Notorious"" (about the life and death of rapper Notorious B.I.G.). As a depiction of actual events and the people who made them happen, this movie is even more powerful than impressive and dramatic movies like 1991's ""Boyz n the Hood"" (which is referenced in this film's script). At the end of the day, as it takes a long, hard look at problems black Americans still deal with today, this is one of the most important movies of 2015. ""Straight Outta Compton"" may not have quite hit the ball over the wall in centerfield, but an inside-the-park homerun is still pretty impressive – and gets this entertaining, informative and very relevant film an ""A-"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Greatest Biographical Film of a Rap/Hip-Hop Artist or Group,"I credit NWA with introducing me to hip-hop back in seventh grade.Prior to this, I wasn't a huge fan of the genre (except for maybe some Eminem) mainly because I only heard the rap/hip-hop music played on the radio or music video shows, which by the 2000's seemed to decline in quality.I then saw the music video for the song ""Straight Outta Compton"" on TV one day and immediately I got into NWA which started me on a path to discover classic rap and hip-hop.So of course when I heard that there would be a biopic of N.W.A, I had to see it.Overall, I was very impressed with the film. The runtime is 2hrs 27min but it felt much shorter than that. The film does a good job of detailing the beginnings of NWA, how a group of young men from Compton, Ice Cube, MC REN, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and Dr.Dre wanted to make music that would make people aware of the dangers of living in Compton and other ghettos, despite the fact that due to the use of gratuitous foul language and depictions of sex, drugs and violence in their music were thought to glamorize the ""gangsta"" lifestyle.The film shows the controversy which surrounded the group, the police brutality they and many people living in Compton faced on a day to day basis as well as personal issues regarding whether or not their manager Jerry Heller along with Eazy-E were skimming money from the rest of the group which eventually led to Ice Cube and later Dr. Dre's departure. The film also depicts the gangsta rap scene of the late 80's-mid 90's and other issues such as the L.A Riots.The performances in the film from a cast of mostly unknown actors are also very good.The only issues I had with the film are that I would have liked to see at least some of the Eazy-E/Dr.Dre feud as well as more of MC Ren, who even took to twitter to complain about his reduced portrayal in the film.If you are a fan of NWA or rap/hip-hop in general, then you owe it to yourself to see this film. Even if you are not a fan of this genre of music but enjoy music biopics in general, you would likely still enjoy this film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I am really unsure as to what all these people degrading the film and calling it 'pretentious' and other things were expecting? Perhaps if they had to look into the history of this internationally loved rap super- group, and the circumstances in which they were born into, they might see that what they were able to accomplish in such a short time together as a group really was incredible, and this film more than does it justice.

As an ACP toting, anti-Obamite, white, conservative-Republican, Rush listener, I have always thought the racist card was over played but after reading all this negativity I just may be naive.

Yes, there will be several straight corny puns in my movie review of the music biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"", but please don't leave and call the pun police! Director F. Gary Gary's movie tells the tale of the late 80's gangsta rap music group N.W.A.- their rise to stardom, and the turbulence that tore the group apart. The group's infamous artists Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E are the main premise of the movie. Gary's direction was not ""outta this world"" but it was very commendable on how he provided a integral perspective of the group's history, and its biographical tunes (I mean, tones) on Dre, Cube, and Eazy. The ensemble acting from young thespians O'Shea Jackson as Cube, Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E was sweet music to my ears; well, maybe not ""sweet"" but definitely hardcore effective.

"A beautifully crafted movie, with clear storytelling, solid acting and an unmatchable soundtrack.","There are a ridiculous amount of 1/10 reviews for this movie. To rate a movie 1 star it must be completely horrific, with almost all aspects of the movie being poor, no redeeming positive features and an insult to the viewers. How this movie has received ratings that low, is mind- boggling. It is not a bad movie, it may not be to everyone's taste, people may have expected more, they may be disappointed with many aspects, but it simply isn't a 1/10 rated movie. I cannot comprehend how so many reviewers gave it this score.I'm a hip hop fan, the 90's – Early 2000's are the golden years for me. N.W.A were just before my time and I have never really had a solid interest in them – I knew of the members and was aware of their troubles with society and the American Government, but not to any real extent. Dr Dre and Ice Cube had huge hands on involvement in the production of Straight Outta Compton and their fingerprints show quite clearly. Much of the focus and heroism is focused around their two characters, which was to be expected in my opinion. Controversial story lines regarding Dr Dre were kept out which isn't surprising. It could have been seen as brave for it to have been included but you can hardly have any real shock that these scenarios weren't added into to the movie. Straight Outta Compton has a real epic movie feel about it, it's a huge production. It's vibrant and beautifully shot, the use of the music scenes is done to perfection, whether it's the studio sessions or the portrayal of the concerts. No expense is spared and this aspect of the movie cannot be faulted in the slightest.Casting was solid, with a good balance of 'lookalikes' and acting quality. Ice Cubes son, who played his father in this movie did a very good job; especially when you consider it was his acting debut. It was a risk to use him in a film of this size but it definitely paid off which was nice to see. All other lead actors did a solid job, although sometimes the emotional scenes felt uncomfortable and unconvincing which was disappointing.As you would expect the soundtrack was incredible! It's a shame that I didn't view this movie in the cinema to get the full experience. The concert scenes are especially great with many of their best known tracks being redone. Some other tracks from that era get cameos, such as Tupac plus Dre & Snoop tracks – offering some more nostalgic affection.The portrayal of Eazy-E has been met with a lot of criticism from fans; people believe they exposed him as being too soft and the only band member who was ever in the wrong. As I previously said, my prior knowledge of N.W.A was minimal so I couldn't make any comparisons off of my own opinion of him as I didn't really have one! Eazy-E obviously wasn't around to tell his side of the story and we are forced to hear it from Dre and Ice Cube, whether that is extremely biased or fair, I have no idea.It's a long film with a run time of over 2 and a half hours but the pacing is spot on and I didn't find it dragging whatsoever. It starts off at a blistering pace; it then slows down to introduce the band members one by one. There are parts which I felt were rushed and didn't get the attention/screen time they deserved but since watching this movie I have read that it had an initial run time of 3 and a half hours. It was required to be cut down significantly, over an hour of footage was removed which could explain why some scenes felt rushed and cut short. It has a real hood feel to it, set over the late 80's – early 90's, sets and styles are perfect to this time and you feel transported to this era effortlessly.Also, people overly complaining about the final scenes when the credits role are embarrassing themselves. Criticising Dre for advertising his Beats headphones and describing the whole movie as 'an advertising campaign'? The credit scene was expertly done in my opinion, it shows a time reel of old clips and photos, followed by up to date clips showing us what the band members do in the current day. This includes Ice Cubes acting, Dr Dre's production and business ventures and it is ended with a fitting tribute to Eazy E. People simply love to complain about absolutely everything, picking holes in whatever they can.Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie, a biopic of 5 young black males rising up in an era of racism, police brutality and society's general unacceptance of aggressive, gangster hip-hop music. It's of course glorified, and negative aspects are left out of the movie in order to create a more rags to riches, underdog story, making the viewer see these men more positively. But it is a very, very well made movie which is getting far too much stick from 100's of reviewers on the internet. The marketing campaign was huge and it was lapped up in the masses by a worldwide fan base. For example, my girlfriend watched this movie with me, she has next to no interest in 'old school hip-hop', yet she thoroughly enjoyed Straight Outta Compton appreciating the film for its fantastic features.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"These black guys started off labeled ""at the bottom of the barrel"" then rose up!","I personally LOVED the movie. I've never been/have ever lived in the hood (so I can't relate); I can say that I felt the pain and struggle that was portrayed by the characters in the movie. The acting was AMAZING. It helped me get an understanding of the lives of black lives (especially males); even to this day racial stereotypes are still going on. The music might not be understood by people that haven't lived the life of N.W.A. But it's exactly what Ice Cube stated: ""their art reflects their reality."" Again, I've never been to the hood, but I do have an understanding of the struggles that these young black men faced; there are still crooked cops today. It was very informative and full of action. However, if you're not open to learning new things/narrow-minded, you probably won't enjoy the movie! The movie leaves me guessing at the end though, when Eazy-E contracted AIDS, and when Dr. Dre started a new company (Aftermath)..these black men rose to the top; coming from the bottom of the totem pole (labeled that way too). This movie shows anyone can achieve success; as well as how jerk-ish some dirty cops are.

Okay musical biopic..,"Okay... ""Straight outta Compton"" meant nothing to me before I saw this film. The rapping sounds of NWA and their tales of woe weren't near as popular outside the US as there; plus I'm a Jazz and R&B musician so regarded most rap music as s h i t; plagiarised grooves and riffs with someone yelling words over it; hardly original and far less soulful than the original... And a turntable / sampler is NOT a musical instrument... however; it is what it is.I found the back story behind NWA and the offshoot acts from Compton quite compelling but no more so than most other musician bioflicks... (Ray; Walk the Line; The Doors etc etc..). The movie was enlightening to me and the characters were painted and acted well.I found it dragged toward the end and it sort of petered out in a way.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Straight Outta Compton"": Stark Examination of  Rise & Fall of American Music Pioneers N.W.A. deserved more Oscar Love","I needed to see ""Straight Outta Compton"". Not because I'm a fan of the music. Not because I embrace the mentality inherent in such. Not because I am familiar at all with the ruthless ghetto reality that inspired the songs. I needed to see it because I understood that it's a hell of a movie. And it is.I also understand that the members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences did not deign this film worthy of neither a Best Picture nor any Best Acting Oscar nominations. And to paraphrase the real life characters composing the '80's pioneering rap band N.W.A. in this captivating story, ""That's some real sh--, man.""Nothing wrong with being in your 60's, male and white as most of the Academy voters reportedly are. The problem is when you have absolutely no intimation as to what is happening on screen and can consequently generate no semblance of appreciation for it.The exceptional performances in ""Compton "" were thoroughly authentic, resonate and impactful. The hardcore rap and hip hop music featured in this production have significantly influenced our culture to this day.

I expected a lot and my expectations were exceeded.,"So for months and months people have been telling me to watch this movie and boy am I glad I finally listened to them. I love hip hop and the hip hop culture but the story itself is so much more than that. It's about the struggle of making a better life, starting a business, flourishing, and trying to stay on top.Its about friends and family. It's about art. And it's about finding love and grieving those we have lost. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film. My emotions ranged from anger to pride to sadness and everything in between. The film was everything I expected it to be and so much more.O'Shea Jackson Jr. was sensational and overall the acting was pretty stellar. Great movie.

Fantastic,"I actually signed up with IMDb specifically to leave my thoughts on this film, after being completely perplexed by some of the strange reviews.I will start by pointing out that this is the biopic of one of the most controversial groups in recent times, so to leave a bad score seemingly based on the fact the film features swearing, sex & violence is just ludicrous. Furthermore, I did not feel it was in any way gratuitous considering the subject at hand. Conversely, I thought these aspects were handled very well.Cannot really give marks for the storyline because - as a huge fan of NWA, I can attest (from my reading at least) that what is portrayed herein appears to be a fairly accurate account of events. What I can confirm is that said-storyline & the way the film has been directed makes for compelling viewing from start to finish.The casting is absolutely impeccable. From seasoned vet Paul Giamatti's incredible (as always) portrayal of Jerry Heller to O'Shea Jackson's impressive debut playing his father - across the board the casting is spot-on.The music - which, let's be honest, was always going to be vital in a movie of this nature - has been handled brilliantly, featuring snippets from Dre's recent Compton album, original NWA recordings, & fantastically produced edits performed by the cast: who do a great job of sounding the genuine article.The film has taken flack in recent weeks due to the omission of scenes detailing Dre's abuse of women, but I can't really see that this is directly relevant to the story of NWA in any event, & I don't think they'd add anything to the proceedings per se.All in all, I really enjoyed this from start to finish. I would reiterate that I am completely confused by the negative reviews. If you have any interest in NWA, Hip Hop, or just inspiring stories period: do yourself a favour, disregard them & give this a go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton,"The movie was great. It has only been showing for three days and has already pulled over sixty million dollars. I identified with the plot from the beginning when the late rapper Eric White; also known as Eazy-E found himself in a situation that I once found myself in as a kid. The movie brought back so many memories of my youth, I felt as though someone had pushed my replay button. My emotions ran wild as each exciting scene was played out. There was a steady fast pace that kept my adrenaline flowing. There were several morals to the story concerning money, friendship, and unprotected sex.""Straight Outta Compton,"" is a story of five young men that started a rap group in the 1980s. The name of the group was, ""N.W.A..."" Eazy-E is the star of the show and the owner of the company/rap group. The actors are the sons of the original N.W.A. Rap Group. The actors seemed to have a knack for the screen; they seemed to naturally play their parts. I felt the story was a tribute to Eazy-E.A few scenes probably will stay with me for some time; Producer Suge Knight made a mockery of a man. The man obviously wasn't from the west coast. Suge made the man repeat after him, ""the west coast is the best coast."" It went something along those lines. I can't remember the exact words but I do remember getting extremely upset because it seemed obvious the man was from the east coast. There were several subliminal pot shots taken at the east coast that got me a little emotional. Weather the subliminal pot shots taken at the east coast was a figment of my vivid imagination or not those scenes were emotionally moving; and for that I'm giving the movie another star.(Spoiler Alert) This movie sparked some controversy concerning the police brutally scenes. Some theaters are reluctant to show the movie because the police brutality scenes may insight violence. Of course, the brutality scenes are of police assaulting young black men. I do understand the concern about violence in the movie theaters because there has been several shooting in movie theaters. I also agree with, Rapper Ice Cube, ""there has never been a black perpetrator."" Showing the brutality on screen can't make the situation any worse. America knows what's going on, besides we'll more than likely see it again on the news by next month. I was more upset about the east coast subliminal messages than the police brutality because police brutalizing young black men has sadly become the norm. Theaters and movie goers don't have much to worry about.I recommend you go see this ten star movie. Do not buy the bootleg copy. It is obvious the team that made the movie worked hard for their money. I'm promoting these guys because they did a hell of a job.

Straight Outta Compton,5/10 - sometimes interesting biopic felt really long and had several dull moments,5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An incredible film and one of the best biopics around,"This is one of the best films of the year, that is all. Straight Outta Compton was just absolutely incredible. It was a biopic that told the story of how NWA came to be and what happened while they were active and after. Now i don't know the history of NWA to the point where i know what is accurate and what is not, but from looking stuff up if you are looking for the most accurate retelling, this probably isn't it as it is a biopic not a documentary. But with Ice Cube and Dr Dre as producers on the film i guess you could say some things were more accurate than not. The fact that this film managed to entertain me from start to finish even though i am not exactly an NWA fan speaks for how spectacular this movie was. It was intense at times, sad at times and in the end was just a really fascinating story that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It had incredible performances and covered many different events that all came together to tell a what is a really great story. Really, this film just had it all. I love a good biopic, and this is one of the best of them all, amazing.Lets start with the performances by the actors because every damn actor in this movie KILLED IT as their character, especially O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his own dad. For a group of people who were relatively unknown they did a damn good job. Every single one transformed into their character (especially visually) and were so convincing that they may have actually gone back and gotten the characters' younger selves. Having that realism of these actors looking exactly like the real guys added even more authenticity to the film and the story they were trying to tell. Even Paul Giamatti was fantastic as always and the fact that all of these actors got me to care about or not care about every character whether i knew of them or not speaks again for the effort put into the film on the actors' part.The plot of the movie was gripping and an undeniably exciting ride. The fact that all of this stuff (more or less) happened in real life is so fascinating that you just couldn't make this stuff up. These stories and events made for a plot that flowed so well all the way through and it was never too slow or too fast and never had a boring moment in its 2 hour and 27 minute runtime. Even though i had heard of some of the events that were coming up, the movie still had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation. The film also has a little drop of humour thrown in there to combat some of the darker more serious events that take place. Again, i'm sure they glossed over stuff and skipped certain things in order to not have this movie go for 4 hours but to someone not really familiar with everything going on with them at the time, it was all fine to me. Did it make me want to know more about these events? Heck yeh it did, mission accomplished.So in the end, if you haven't realised already, i really really loved this movie, a story that was very well documented (or adapted), and fantastically acted right through to end up with an all round fantastic biographical picture and film - 9.4",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Terrible, but Perfect","This movie had gotten a lot of hyping up by people and advertisements, to me, so when I saw it, I already knew that I was supposed to be in love with it. However, sadly, I will say that it is stupidly exaggerated in most aspects of the realistic portrayal of a real life music industry giant that has gone on to now self- produce it's own movies and music videos in the capacity that the genre has begun recycling so many ideas, and still coming up with new ways to spin the story. I think that the best thing about this movie, is that it is the definitive story of the plot behind many sub-culture hip hop movies. To say that it had been anticipated would be necessary then, for the true understanding of a sub- culture, itself. It seems redundant, and misinformed with guidance and any methodology to ethics, in many ways, too, and glorifies violence in the same way as it's predecessors, but in the innovative true story element, and a big enough budget, it is truly quite spectacular of a movie watching event, for the very same reasons that you would dismiss it as being over the top or uninspired. Straight Outta Compton (2015) is a 10 out of 10, movie, whether you would like it to be, or not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Review for Straight Outta Compton,"Anyone that has listened to rap music in the last few decades has heard of the group N.W.A, but not every one knows their story and the impact they have had in the music industry. The film Straight Outta Compton shows the rise and fall of the infamous rap group. The movie starts out introducing us to each of the five members one by one, and shows us how they came to form the rap group, N.W.A. The first person introduced is one of the three main central figures, Eric Wright, a.k.a. ""Eazy E"". Wright is portrayed by actor Jason Mitchell who gives a great performance. O'Shea Jackson, jr. the real life son of ""Ice Cube"" plays his father in the movie. He does a good job not only looking like him, but also with his voice and mannerisms. The third main member is ""Dr. Dre"" played by Corey Hawkins. While he bares a similar resemblance to the real Dr. Dre, he managed to play him with a lot of compassion and drive as a person. All of these actors do a great job interacting with each other and brings a realistic feel to the movie. The other two members of the group, MC Ren and DJ Yella are given little screen time and character development, probably because they are the least known members of the group.Some other notable performances are from the actor that portrays Suge Knight. Known as a threatening person, the way Knight is written in the movie comes off very looming and menacing, captured well by the actor that plays him. The audience really feels like this guy will kill anyone for anything and is ruthless. Small cameos are made by actors playing Snoop Dogg and Tupac, both of which did well with what they were given. The last main character is the manager of N.W.A, Jerry Heller, played by the talented Paul Giamatti, who gives a solid performance. Playing the caring yet manipulative manager, who claims that every thing he did was ""just a part of the business"". The character runs a fine line of being a caring person towards Eric and a sleazy business man.The first half of the movie plays out like a straight drama narrative building to the formation of the group, depicting their life struggles as well as run ins with gangsters and the police. As the movie progresses it becomes more about showing the major events that occurred starting with the concert riot in Detroit. From there most of the events shown were basic media covered incidents, that is publicly known. Such as Ice Cude and Dr. Dre leaving the group and starting their solo careers. The ending of course comes with the death of rapper Eazy-E, which played out well and was very emotional. This is one of the better music biopics made, while some liberties were taken, not everything is 100% accurate and many smaller details left out, it is still a solid story narrative.For the most part the pace of the film is good. The first act moves along well, while there is a bit of a stumble later in the movie but it never drags along. At a length of 147 minutes, the movie is so engaging that the time flies and next thing you know the movie ends. By the time the movie is over, you are left wanting to know more of what happened next with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. Not only is the pacing well, but the movie is shot well and has very nice cinematography, that draws you into the world that these characters live in.There are several good comedic moments that help lighten the movie and allows the audience to be entertain in more than just the dramatic scenes. The movie also does not down play the way African Americans were treated by the police, and how that inspired the graphic lyrics to some of the groups most popular songs. This is a well directed, well shot and well acted biopic that deserves the recognition and acclaim it has earned. The original running time was over three hours long and could have easily been made into television miniseries. Hopefully when it is released, it will include the extra footage. Overall this is a very good movie and character study based, on true events that left a mark in popular American culture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The path less trampled by sheep to the American Dream.,"The sheeple buying into the manufactured racial divide are picking sides over this one; look at everyone up in hooves in the reviews. Fact is, the narrative of NWA's rise and the requisite controversy is no different than any artists who change the game, and this film did a fine job depicting it. A line from Moneyball comes to mind: ""The first one through the wall always gets bloodied"", and these guys were the right guys in the right place and right time to do it. The movie is a worthy testament to their accomplishments. There's a lot to fit in when telling their story, and I felt the script writers didn't want to be accused of pulling punches. Any missteps in that regard are attributable to the constrictions of the movie format itself. The direction is top notch. The acting is uniformly great across the board, and the actors look and sound a lot like the people they were playing (O'shea Jackson Jr is the spitting image of his dad!). Also, the cinematographer captured LA's hazy orange green perma-dawn halogen glow and the blue heaven brilliance of its hallowed hillsides nicely. The liberal use of NWA's catalogue along with other seminal tunes of the era keeps the soundtrack fresh. If you like stories about paths other than hoof beaten ones to the American Dream, check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Important,"Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie in my opinion. N.W.A represented life as it happened in Compton but not only there, what is happening in life all over a nation. They represented the people who did not have a voice during the time of their come up. This film showed every important aspect as to why N.W.A. existed and how much talent these men really had/have. It was great to see the early stages of some of the most notable songs and sounds in hip-hop that is commonplace in many households. For N.W.A. it was more than just making music and getting popular. It was about putting music out that had purpose, their music meant something, meant something for someone. Gave mistreated individuals a voice. Whether you agree or disagree, that is obviously your choice but I can at least tell you; You will be the minority in this case.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The corniest casting ever.,"They cast the most corniest people to play 'gangsters'. Dre, Cube, Yella, Ren, even snoop actors were corny af and wasn't believable thugs. The acting was horrible and cringe its like a bunch of friends trying to be hard. And when they rap it doesn't go with their look, like they sound that the real people only when they rap. Ice cubes son looks like him but that literally it, he can't act, he's movements and line delivery was just cringe. Also the one scene Dre is making a beat that he didn't make from scratch when he just sampled in real life was inaccurate. Most of them don't look or act like the people they're portraying especially Dre, snoop. And the bus scene was so stupid, what bus driver would let someone on the bus with guns? The bus was already stopped when they pulled in front of them. I don't know how it was nominated for an Oscar. I couldn't even finish it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Straight Outta Compton""—A Rap on Censorship and Racism","The critically acclaimed film, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is an unlikely blockbuster for its ""R"" rating and timely depiction of the mean streets of Compton, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Although taking place in the mid-eighties, the clashes with the police resonate today. Chronicling the rise of N.W.A. (""niggers with attitude""), this biopic of music pioneers belongs in the company of ""Ray"", ""Walk the Line"", ""8 Mile"" and more recently , ""Love and Mercy"" and ""Muscle Shoals"". The seminal South L.A. hip-hop group N.W.A is the story of the creation of rap and hip-hop culture. Composing controversial lyrics, through word wizardry and brilliant poetic rhyming, N.W.A. music rages about the daily lives of young black men and the fears and violence they confront. Truthful, and not pretty, the music of N.W.A. was often censored, and considered dangerous and criminal. Read my entire review at www.unhealedwound.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Dee Barnes,"I would have given this film a better rating if the Dre/Dee Barnes incident had been included. Maybe a 6 for authenticity or something. I've been in South Central at midnight--and places in L.A. just as dangerous. So I've brushed shoulders with those who have been marginalized and have not looked to Jesus for their salvation but to drugs, sex, and money/power--all of which fail every one of us in the end. Anyway, this film should be Rated X even if for the one scene alone that shows actual cunnilingus and very possibly coitus, though the latter could have been simulated. But the Dee Barnes attack by Dr. Dre was never mentioned, and this is wrong. It should have been. It's an important part of the picture.

"Featuring NWA History, Fantastically Told","I'm not head bopping, you are!Straight Outta Compton is one of the best & well acted musical biopics in the past decade. High praise from a solid cast headlined by GREAT performances of O'Shea Jackson Jr, Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell & Paul Giamatti. The portrayals of the entire cast, were full of energy which elevates mere imitation. Their raw power and emotional depictions are contagious to the audience as they felt as real & relatable as the story behind it. Speaking of story, this is one of the film's strongest asset as well as it shares with us the unfiltered and deeply interesting history of NWA, from individual backstories, success and controversies. More importantly, it shares with us the motivations behind NWA, how the 90s social crisis, led to this specific movement of 'gangsta rap'. Sounds familiar? That's because the story is quite timely as well.Director F Gary Gray did a fantastic job here as well. His camerawork further elevates scenes with perfectly timed panning and close ups. He chooses focus points & subjects very well, effectively conveying messages of each frame. Together with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, the audience is also treated with fantastic visuals that is both warm & seriously inviting.Overall, SOC successfully tells a highly riveting story on one of the most influential artists in the hip hop scene. Despite my limited appreciation of 80s rap, I was enthralled by its storyline & messages, and quite absorbed by passionate performances all around. Simply put, I became a fan not only because of our characters' skill and output, but because of their journey, their story and what they represent, which still resounds up to this day. This is then, an obviously entertaining film & an important one to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton - Great film,I mean going into watch this film and never listened to NWA in my life was a pretty big deal as at the time when they were around I was into NKOTB. Never really got the whole gangster rap scene but after watching this film I completely done a 180 and now love their music also want to point out I'm an eclectic fan of music now. I'll say this about this film though it was an absolutely brilliant film. Loved every minute of it and to be perfectly honest I love long films over short ones. I feel the longer the film the more effort goes into the finished product.The casting was spot on to the point I turned to my friend saying whoever played Ice Cube in this film they nailed only to find out who he was - only Ice Cube's son.I've watched this a few times now and I still can't get enough of it. 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

When this movie came out we saw it in theaters on opening day and it was not a disappointment, so we saw it two more times over the next couple of weeks.If you have been following the lyrics of the songs and watching interviews and documentaries about NWA and Death Row Records over the years, this movie will absolutely resonate with you. Even if you haven't, give it a chance, as it tells the harrowing true story about these boys from the streets of Compton. Rags to riches. And riches to stitches.

"I recommend this film for the unbiased, open-minded people","I see a lot of negative reviews about this film which I deduce came from a single individual, or group of people, who hates on the black community or the ideas they inspire. (Statements contain the same flow of idea, etc. as if it came from a dedicated hater. You could take a look at them yourself.)Really, this movie shows us a slice of life from the people who are oppressed; the ones whose voices would have otherwise not be heard if they didn't do something about it. And this film does not support violence. In fact, the whole point was to be against it. (Which makes me think those last 1 starred reviews didn't even watch the whole film and understood it.) So what if violence was their way of life? They we're born into it. It's what they have known ever since. If people would actually treat them as people, violence wouldn't even exist among them. And it all goes way back... What sets them apart is instead of succumbing, they voiced it out. And they struggled to get away from it. Make a change for the better, not just for them, but for all the people who face the same crises everyday of their lives.I recommend this film for all those who'd want to step back and rethink about the next time you judge people just because of their color or way of life, and for all those whose voice want to be heard too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Amazing Character Development, Acting, & Social Commentary","This is an incredible true biographical film that shines in its ability to successfully showcase the character development of the NWA members over the years hustling and making music. As the years progress in the film, we see the members' attention become pulled in different directions from outside forces, such as labels, gangs, management, clout, and money. NWA drift apart and back again: this film uplifts second chances and different seasons of friendship and community even against impossible odds.The film depicts the emotional truth experienced by the members growing up in the hood, but also holds space to celebrate the beautiful/nostalgic elements of street life that are not widely accepted in society, but widely experienced by people living in cities like Compton regardless. This is certainly contrasted with many examples of the ugly parts of growing up in a gang neighborhood. The members graduate from plotting how to come up from their situation, to living in rich success, and ultimately feel disconnected even in their wealth: true happiness can come from things in life money can't buy, and this film taught me that.Lastly, I think the true genius of ""Straight Outta Compton"" lies in its irony; Black culture and music sold to mainstream white audiences who overlook or dilute the transcending sociopolitical commentary provided. The inclusion of the King verdict, as well as LA's response to such an injustice, has sadly become more relevant since this movie first released in 2015. This film made me consider wealth, what true personal success actually is, and most importantly, the systemic barriers faced by NWA on their way to success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Great film,"If you want to see a film that give you a tiny bit of insight in the start of one of the most important hip hop groups, this is a must see. The challenge is of course to be able to represent all different artists and their background, and some things feel it barely scratching the surface of some interesting details. But it does focus on some really important things like showing what actual role each artist brought to the table, and important events which manages to actually convey the feeling so well that you are grabbed and taken on a musical revolution. The portrayal of race and gender has more nuance than might meet the eye at the first glance. Of course, some people with a narrow view will say that the N.W.A. members are portrayed as violent thugs with no respect for rules and people. This is however a story about young men from areas where you probably don't even let yourself dream of a tenth of what N.W.A. accomplished, and you also neglect to understand the reality of black people. Really, white people are not subject to the same treatment as black people. The gender representation is actually pretty OK, the main characters are the men in N.W.A. and of course you could wish to see more women in the film. Straight Outta Compton does manage to show anything from the character Felisha, who is represented as an object to Dr. Dre's mother who is a working independent woman that try to raise her sons well, and Eazy E's wife who is the one that gets to have the traditional logical male quality of logic while Eazy E has the passion.In short, Straight Outta Compton is a really well made try rags to riches film with music and real anger at it's core. See it if you want the basics about N.W.A, then find their discographies and individual biographies. Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fire movie,"I first came across this movie on Netflix. As a person who likes hip-hop and rap, this movie came into my interest. This is one of my top favorite movies that I have ever seen in my life. The music and the lifestyle as an African American in the 80's and 90's was interesting for me. The actors also looked very similar to the N. W. A. Group. I enjoyed this movie because all of my favorite 90's rappers were in this movie and shows the originality of the rappers back in the days. This movie also shows the history and birth of Gangster rap, a new genre of rap that sky rocketed through out and across America that quickly got popular.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Terrible, but perfect","This movie had gotten a lot of hyping up by people and advertisements, to me, so when I saw it, I already knew that I was supposed to be in love with it. However, sadly, I will say that it is stupidly exaggerated in most aspects of the realistic portrayal of a real life music industry giant that has gone on to now self- produce it's own movies and music videos in the capacity that the genre has begun recycling so many ideas, and still coming up with new ways to spin the story. I think that the best thing about this movie, is that it is the definitive story of the plot behind many sub-culture hip hop movies. To say that it had been anticipated would be necessary then, for the true understanding of a sub- culture, itself. It seems redundant, and misinformed with guidance and any methodology to ethics, in many ways, too, and glorifies violence in the same way as it's predecessors, but in the innovative true story element, and a big enough budget, it is truly quite spectacular of a movie watching event, for the very same reasons that you would dismiss it as being over the top or uninspired.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 8,"The (mostly) true story of N.W.A is the sort of film that never let's up. There is no real downtime within the near two and half hour run time. For fans of classic hip-hop this feels like a non-stop roller coaster ride through iconic stories and important moments in the genre's rise into the mainstream. That said I can totally imagine that for someone who is less familiar with the key players in the story the fast paced nature may be slightly off putting.Personally, I think this might be one of the best musician bio-pics ever made and a must see for all hip-hop fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"One of the better ""band documentaries""","In this age of ""Rocketman"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Elvis"" and what not, this is truly one of the best band/group/artist documentaries out there in my opinion. I don't mean in terms of realism or accuracy, it's just a well made movie overall. This could be a completely fictional movie and it would still be just as good, which proves just how amazing the story of NWA was.To be fair, I have not read any NWA autobiographies, so I don't know how much is based in reality and how much is not. Adaption to TV/Movies always require some dramatization so whatever.Either way, it's a great movie, recommended to *everyone*, including rap-freaks and even rap-opposers(if there is such a thing).

What's N.W.A. stand for anyway?,"Never Watch Again? Nah. Need-to Watch Again.The dramatic retelling of the real-life story of the greatest hip-hop group in history, Straight Outta Compton is a cinematic masterpiece.Eric Wright was just a boy in the hood and life wasn't so easy. But, things started to change when Eric transformed into Eazy-E. Partnered with Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, D. O. C., MC Ren, and Jerry... the N. W. A.

In the late 80s and early 90s are documented in an epic tale you have to see to believe.With dope cinematography, near perfect casting, and of course a killer soundtrack, Straight Outta Compton draws you in from the opening beat and becomes more enthralling with every passing moment.Whether you are a hip-hop fan or not, this movie is certified platinum.

Nothing special.,"I've been a massive hip-hop fan for decades, so this isn't a review from someone that 'doesn't understand the game'...trust me, I get it!For the most part, the acting, sound and cinematography were all great, but the film was so boring. For a biography about a group as infamous as NWA, it really lacked.I got more enjoyment/entertainment from documentaries on YouTube about them.I got nothing new from this at all. It was almost like I was watching it for the 2nd time.By no means a bad film...just really boring.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Cracking,"Great movie. I've always been an Ice Cube fan and kind of held off watching this because I thought it wasn't going to handle the NWA 'aftermath', only how they kicked things off.But I couldn't have been more wrong - the film covers it from the perspective of Cube, Dre and E in great detail. We grow to hate Jerry for the worm that he was.Which is ironic, because for me, the casting of a comedy actor (Giamatti) as Jerry was possibly the only weakness of the film. In an otherwise serious and realistic film, he stands out and casting would've been better served choosing a more serious actor.Nothing against Giamatti incidentally, who is very talented - good on him getting the gig. This falls on the people casting to me. Goes in the same category as Vince Vaughn in True Detective, for those who get that reference.That said, this film still gets a nine from me. Between the soundtrack, storyline, honesty and compelling nature of the film, one casting mistake is not going to ruin the movie. More than pleasantly surprised, I was compelled and thrilled throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I've got something to say,"When the fallout between Cube, Dre, and Eazy takes center stage, however, the script's zeal is camouflaged by the actors' impeccable familiarity and comfort with one another. A fast-forwarded montage during the recording of the title album suggests their tight-knit mantra, but it's moments such as a darkly comic armed hotel confrontation with an angry boyfriend or watching Eazy step up to the mic for the first time only to whimper the opening line to the amusement of the on looking group that makes these performances work so well. Even Paul Giamatti as crooked manager Jerry Heller get involved, bringing reason to the aggressiveness and maintaining a vulnerable stature underneath his alternative motives. But where this chemistry comes into play most effectively is making the group's various conflicts impactful despite being given minimal attention. Boldly bumping 'Fuck Tha Police' in front of an FBI head, Cube effortlessly telling a CNN reporter to eat a dick during an interview, and, most notably during hospital visits to a bed-ridden Eazy when personal vendettas climaxed only a few scenes prior.Perhaps 'Straight Outta Compton' would have worked better as a mini-series or, at very least, a film that reduced its battles and increased its attention to the alluring crew dynamic from a plot standpoint. Still, after a glaring 148 minutes the film achieved what it originally set out to do and more – featuring a terrific cast, booming soundtrack, and swift – albeit shallow – script that boasts genuine heart when you least expect it.FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/09/07/straight-outta-compton-review- indieadam/",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It was Pretty Good,"This film was really good! It's about how NWA was formed, their rise to the top and their subsequent fall. The film uses a lot of the music from the band which is nice if you're a fan of gangsta rap and the entire film just feels like an accurate representation of what the band and black Americans were going through at the time. The movie talks about police violence and it's definitely relevant with what's going on at the moment. Great watch, would recommend. :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Biased Biography,It never seizes to amaze me how many of these movies are made with the utmost intention to educate the masses with misinformation. In a world where we are fortunate to have YouTube at our disposal I encourage anyone who has seen this movie to do some research into NWA and namely Eazy E because Cube and Dre have done him dirty in this movie. If your fans of Dre and Cube by all means watch this movie because they truly had influence on their stories to the point both come out like gods. Out if respect for Eazy and what actually happened back in the day I can firmly stand by my rating and know that this is the biggest pile of garbage known to man.,1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
BEST BIOPIC EVER,"Straight Outta Compton is the best biopic without a doubt. It truly describes the struggle that the group NWA went through. Even with its two hour and thirty minute run time you will not be bored due to the amazing cinematography, acting, dialogue, soundtrack and more. Another amazing thing about this film was how they managed to make the audience fell sad when something devastatingly emotional happens and joyful if something good happens. The 3 stand outs in this movie were definitely Ice Cube, Eazy E, and Dr Dre. I can guarantee that even if you are not an NWA fan you will still love this movie.

Some real gangsta music,"After thoroughly enjoying the movie 8 Mile, I thought I was in the mood for another rap blast. I don't regret it. Straight Outta Compton is a proper load of gangsta rap that I've been looking for. It features dudes like Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and even my favorite of them all - Ice Cube. There's also Snoop Dogg, but he's in short supply. The story is mostly about the three rappers already mentioned. But Eazy-E got the most space. I enjoyed the film immensely. It also helps that this is a biopic and several things we see here actually happened. But the main draw is of course the tracks you hear here. It's really a matter of taste here. I really like 90s rap, so I really enjoyed this. I'm a little tempted to compare this film to Bohemian Rhapsody. A movie based on a true story accompanied by songs and that brings me to my recommendation. If you like old school rap, I would venture to say go for it. Even though the film is 2 hours and 26 minutes long and the pace was slowing down towards the end, I still had fun. In fact, if you like any of the artists already mentioned, I believe you will devour the film. If you're not into 90's rap, hands off this movie. To sum it up. Straight Outta Comptom is a great movie in my opinion and I recommend it to fans of this music.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Gritty, inspiring and impressive","This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I missed it at the cinema, as I was doubtful it would be any good but having now seen it three times, I thought I'd add this review.I had bought the album of the same name some years ago but never knew the background story, which turns out to be very inspiring and thoroughly engaging.Rap legends Dr Dre, Ice Cube and Easy E formed NWA in the late 80s. This biopic tells the riveting story of the band and their stereotypically manipulative manager Jerry Heller and we see some appearances from other characters along the way, like Snoop Dog, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine. It focusses on the formation of the band, their music and the events which drove their creativity. Fans of the original album, like myself, will probably get bonus enjoyment from seeing some tracks performed during the movie.The gangster myth surrounding the band is put in the spotlight here. These kids were no saints but they weren't hardened gang members and had the sense and drive to take their lives in the right direction. There's little difference, aside from the music, between the likes of NWA and other controversial bands like Motley Crue, yet the establishment's prejudice saw them as thugs and criminals.It's nothing entirely new - other band stories follow a similar theme of inception, climb to fame, controversy and turmoil, band splits, etc. but Straight Outa Compton has fantastic performances from all the cast - especially Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti - and is gripping on three levels.The first is witnessing the birth of the joint genius of Dr Dre, Cube and Easy E and where it takes them as the story unfolds. The second is the rise of the band and the usual issues that arise from fame and money in the music industry. The third and most powerful is the band's battle against the authorities and, in particular, the FBI. There are no dull moments in this movie and, at nearly 150 minutes, is a solid achievement for the writers and director F Gary Gray.Don't expect the uplifting vibes of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's aptly gritty in places and the movie's tone is in keeping with the hard edge of the band's music.For me, it does justice to their story and is an impressive film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Decent...,"A interesting look into the band and the many struggles it faced. However, it's debatable if the film is completely accurate or not.Has some good editing but not much unique cinematography, just rather conventional. The settings and lighting were very well done however; it has some very thoughtful locations that really add to the immersion. Some of the scenes are very well executed and extremely memorable. Most of the actors were quite good and look similar to the actual performers. The themes it focuses on were powerful and really added a deep layer to the film.However, the portrayal of women is awful. There are either completely objectified or absent through most of the film. It can be quite degrading watching how they are shown.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An fun and emotional look at 1 of the great hip hop groups.,"5 schoolboys from the hood are discovered by a music manager at the local hip hop club and rise to the top. This is the story of NWA! A hip hop group from the late 80s that took the world by storm with their raw and brutally honest lyrics about how tough life is in the ghetto.Is a kid I listened to this album over and over, just wishing I was black. These guys were the coolest thing to hit the scene at the time. Their lyrics gave me a confronting look (and listen) at how tough life was as a colour gang member with raw and non apologetic rhymes that I fell in love with. Now, this movie showed me the human side of this group, and the performances from the cast are just stellar in particular Jason Mitchell delivers a touching and very emotional performance as Erik Eazy E Wright. This movie renewed this white boys' love for their music and a new respect for their human sides. A great movie!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Straight Outta Compton Review,"In 1988, an innovative new musical group revolutionized pop culture, changing the way we know hip-hop forever. The group, N.W.A's first album, ""Straight Outta Compton"", created some controversy because of its honest depiction of life in Compton, California. With the assistance of their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), members Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Easy-E (Jason Mitchell), DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.), and MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) have to steer their way through the music industry while acquiring fame, fortune and a place in history along the way.One thing I liked about this film was how authentic it was. It definitely sounds and looks like the late 80s with the soundtrack, the decor, and the wardrobe. I've never really been a fan of rap music ,or even music in general but I don't think you have to be to enjoy this film. The group in question has 5 members but the film really focuses on 2 (Ice Cube and Dr. Dre) and also Easy-E to a lesser extent. The performances were great across the board where O'Shea Jackson Jr's Ice Cube and Jason Mitchell's Easy-E standing out. Despite some of the dramatic moments coming off a little cheesy (a common complaint I have with certain dramatic films), there were still decent moments with the acting making up for the others. I thought the story flowed well for the most part even with the 2 and a half hour running time. I thought the beginning and end were strong but it lagged a little in the middle. The story was told in a way that felt real going back to the point I made about authenticity. You get to see what they had to live through and how they were able to overcome it and make something out of themselves. The dialogue was authentic in that it featured certain words that are not in my vocabulary but I would think they would be in theirs and I assume that was where the film's 18A/R rating came from. My favorite thing about this film other than the acting was the musical performances. I think they were well shot in that they made you feel like you were there and what added to that feeling was the sound work that captured the crowds and their noise. What I didn't like about the film was how they depicted police officers. They were a little too over-the-top for me which came across a little unrealistic in that I understand what that time was like but it's unlikely that they would all be the way they were. Some people may be offended by the language, nudity, drugs, and/or violence but that was what they were like and not having these would mean not telling the story properly. People should not be surprised by any of this considering the rating and the subject matter. I did not mind this and I think that most wouldn't either.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Entertaining does not equal Accuracy.,"A compelling drama that leaves viewers salivating for more of these Pop Culture Giants, ""Straight Outta Compton"" is nearly as impactful as the gangsta rap group N. W. A. The film is based on. It follows them on their rise to stardom, international fame, along with the controversy that would expand rather than strain their impact.The performances don't exactly expand the value of the film, but they prove to be as rock solid as the visual portrayal of the social environment around this group, and how the direction and narrative building builds into that.What the film had clearly omitted in terms of quality were the deeper, more intricate parts of storytelling, in order to build a strong narrative. Although I believe that those omissions give way for the film to build deep themes that'll allow for viewers to use the film as a lense into how the powers that be tries to break down its most vocal, and impactful members.Still, those facts omitted keep the film from staying true to how the bond of these brothers truly wore through their rise.7.7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.,"Though 'Straight Outta Compton (2018)' may not be one-hundred percent historically accurate (with some 'undesirable' events being omitted seemingly simply due to the people producing the piece), this extremely entertaining bio-pic cuts to the heart of its story in an impressively acute way, always feeling innately cinematic and properly engaging as it weaves together its complex characters and events into a single narrative. It does brush past, and even entirely omit, a couple of its key players in an effort to focus on the trifecta of Cube, Dre and Easy, but this is just a casualty of a more concise narrative and is, essentially, completely necessarily, if unfortunate, in order for the film to work as well as it does. The two-and-a-half hour picture flies by as it really drives home the messages found within its focal group's music (even the ones they couldn't write into their lyrics) and paints a clear picture of the time, place and general situation that lead to its creation. Plus, all of the flick's actors give near-perfect performances that aren't just imitations and actually recreate the iconic songs themselves. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It was not a movie merely to let you live in the times of the late 1980's and reminisce over the struggle, it is to show you that something amazing was being created, and no matter who got involved or who was against it, it was always stand tall. If you have any doubts of that, go listen and read the lyrics if you have to, and you'll see just how far people can come because of the people such as those part of NWA who believed in something.
