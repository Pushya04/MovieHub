"Great movie, I hated every minute of it","This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.9/10 would recommend if you are looking for a heavy, dramatic movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
No Need For a Comfort Zone,"Requiem for a Dream (2000), is a human character-study on film. Darren Aronofsky's, crazy, drug-induced, rollercoaster-ride, gives that 1980s feel to the viewer, throughout the whole film. It has a fantastic calling to that old-Hollywood-style of filmmaking. The best component to this film is most definitely, the acting. Ellen Burstyn is Sara Goldfarb, a retired couch-potato, who is addicted to a bad self-help TV show, that cons her into believing she can lose weight if she uses certain drugs. These pharmaceuticals eventually destroy her mind and create a horrible addiction for her. Meanwhile, her dead-beat son, Harry (Jared Leto), comes up with the brilliantly dumb idea of creating a haven for himself, his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), by getting into the street-drug business. Unfortunately, he and his friends are now all junkies and things don't go so well as planned.This film is not for the squeamish. It involves many horrible aspects of life. It shows the terrible things human beings are capable of doing, to themselves and the consequences, of such poor decision-making. Requiem for a Dream (2000), does manage to pull at your emotions and makes you feel, very sorry for these people. I won't say anymore, but there is a reason why Ellen Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for this film. The directing, camera-work and editing, is fantastic. Aronofsky's direction is quite fitting, for the drug-incited delusions seen in the film. Jennifer Connelly's performance is staggeringly good. She definitely leaves her comfort zone for this film. For myself, Requiem for a Dream (2000), was shocking, brought out many emotions and contained a life-lesson, we should all pay attention to.PMTM Grade: 9.0 (A-) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Awful and Essential,"I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.  Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it's a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them.  It's a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this, but can't *recommend* it to them.  I've recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction:  I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I'm still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River's Edge,and The Deer Hunter.These films all share a quality that's difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.""Favorite"" does not apply to this for me - this isn't about entertainment. One of the most devastating and beautiful experiences I've had watching a film.  One of the top five films I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,Drama

Downer Picturesque.,"I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say, I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries, has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing with(or succumbing to) addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork, intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style, in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people, living with their respective addictions.Jared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definately deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.The cinematography of Matthew Libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting Aronofsky's sick world, from the sliently flickering sick-green flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting Coney Island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. A Downer Picturesque, as portrayed by the photographs of Robert Frank and the Frank influenced cinematography of Darius Khondji in Seven. In my books, Matthew Libatique has just joined those ranks.Jay Rabinowitz' editing stands out as well, with in-your-face smash title cards(emphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons), as well as the close-up constructions of the drug taking process. The latter sequences, edited so tightly and seamlessly, make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting, as is the case with drugs. The sequences are almost like a drug, making you crave for more of them, a fix which you get, whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. Lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it, and then it's back to Harry, Marion, Sarah and Tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix, which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.The film is also superbly scored by Clint Mansell and hauntingly performed by the Kronos Quartet. A series of hauntingly shocking, yet mind-numbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.Lastly, the direction of Aronofsky, brilliant, beautiful, empathic. There are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and I think the best way to say it is that I am speechless. Aronofsky has shown me that, jaded by so many films, something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. To see something that I have never seen before or learn something I don't already know. The ending, is sheer power. A masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about, mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face, burning hot and scalding. The film leaves a deep impression, in fact, a huge scar. And it is a scar I am proud to wear.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Brutal, honest, and a must see movie","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two).  This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Film Making Excellence.,"I watch this movie like twice a year and it gets to me every time. By far my favourite movie ever. Instead of a regular review, here is everything this movie does perfectly.Character Development: this could really be separated into three biopics. The way The film is spliced between three main characters that evolve an enormous deal over 100mins is a work of art within itself.Plot structure and timing: This film is the pinnacle of an effective slow burn. At no point does the runtime seem to drag on, but it is slow enough to make the payoff incredibly valuable. Plot structure and timing are two of the most difficult things in film making, and they were executed perfectly in this one.Sound and score: one of the most effective scores to date. The ups and downs of this film are only expressed further with an extremely effective and catchy score. At no points does it feel obnoxious or out of place, and you'll be thinking of it long after your viewing.Cinematography: The beautiful mix of cinematography that are found throughout this film is perfect. Extreme close ups, split screen scenes and snapshots are all used to express the films ideas in a beautiful way. It does an excellent job to break up the story and to show you the multiple perspectives.An incredible third act: So many great films fall down during the third act. Many-a-film has been ruined by a less than average third sequence, but this one ties up the whole story in a beautiful, non-abrupt way. I couldn't think of a better ending.Performances: Each and every main performance in this film is done with grace and respect. I am always super surprised at Jared Leto's performance, as I've never seen him as an excellent actor. He steals the show here, with a genuine and emotional performance.I really cannot think of anything I don't like or would change about this film. Incredibly engaging, beautiful story and told excellently.Do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece of filmmaking",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Over-rated morality tale,"The real descent into the quagmire is the last 30 minutes of this film, not the characters within the film. According to this film this is what you can expect from drug abuse: 1. Being force-fed in a public hospital (have these people heard of the IV drip?) and then ECT without any form of anaethesia (every bone in that woman's body would have shattered)- did they take her to a hospital in Eastern Europe?? 2. People with severe septicaemia will be denied hospital treatment and thrown into a cell on suspicion of being a drug addict until they require amputation.  Watch and learn - it's fine to be a junkie as long as you don't get caught. 3. A man will be allowed to vomit into food being prepared in a government run correction facility. If you are bad, you eat vomit. OK? 4. A middle class chick will end up on the other end of a black dildo in order to feed her drug habit. Yawn... I mean, this film says more about what kind of overblown morality Americans are willing to accept in films than anything about drug abuse or its consequences. The anti-drug message descends into hyperbole and farce and I found myself laughing hysterically where I was supposed to be shocked and repulsed. Give me a break. These sanitised stories are just too ridiculous.  As well as this, we are offered the same old, same old routine of white-powder-imagery and colourful-pill-popping. These guys injected something and were bopping around the place, next minute they snort something and they are all on the nod...go figure? And please, the heavy handedness of the junkie losing an arm...spare me, I am not that easily shocked or unaware of symbolism-overkill.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
the summary of a history.,"being someone who had a history with drugs, i found this movie to be slightly more than ground-breaking. i saw this film in the midst of a downward spiral, and it turned me right around! having friends with the same plans, such as sell drugs to buy more drugs..it made me look at my life and theirs and see exactly what the future had in store.now, every time i see this movie since escaping that life, i cry. i cry for my past and those who still live in it. this movie has more to say to people my age than any drug education movie we were afforded in school. honestly, i wonder when the school systems will wisen up to what is really going to get kid's attention; movies that show that pros as well as the cons of drugs, or a movie that shows the complete and utter devastation drugs will bring to your life, and the lives of those around you. honestly, had i seen this film before my sophomore year of high school, i would have never even dreamed of taking more than the prescribed dose of advil.granted, my little summary or comment of this movie does not entail anything informative about the movie itself, i must say, i feel this is the best way i know to express my views.",,Anonymous,Drama

Punishing and Unforgettable,"I respect and admire this movie, even though (and perhaps because) it is complex, occasionally irritating and often very hard to take.  Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.The subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character's utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew ""scary movies"" forevermore).  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.My only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively.  That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).In sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise).  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I'm not sure whether I'd necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic.  For my part, while I don't expect to watch this film very often in the future, I'm sure glad it'll be on the shelf.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Suicidal,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very heavy movie.,"It is a very heavy movie that leaves a bad aftertaste. Acting and production are top-notch. Jared Leto resembles a junkie even without this role. Excellent casting.That said, try not to watch it alone or when you are depressed. Certainly not something for a casual evening. One of the few movies that I'd actually recommend reading some reviews before you watch it to get an idea of what to expect.This is not for everyone. Easy to get disgusted and even depressed.

Requiem for your self-respect,"Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, ""this is your brain,"" and then screams, ""this is your brain on drugs!"" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, ""and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..."" and so on?If you can imagine that commercial going on for two hours, done with great visual style and editing, with acting that ranges from excellent (Ellen Burstyn) to terrible, you can skip this movie. While Requiem for a Dream sells itself as an important movie about important subject matter, it does nothing to explain why REAL PEOPLE do drugs. Its characters are not people. They suffer without reflection on their own states, while the filmmaker attempts to bombard you with visual symbols explaining what they want and feel. While one could interpret the device used to explain why the Burstyn character continues her downward spiral, the game show, as a meaningful symbol for individuals' desires for acceptance and recognition, I don't think it is one. It is a gimmick that condescends to the character by making her desire for acceptance pathetic and silly. The movie tells you what to think about her inner motivations by staging them in a highly subjective way.This way of revealing character is consistent throughout the movie. Characters are without interior lives, or at least their interior lives are not revealed. At the same time, the movie uses symbols (the game show, the television, etc...) to suggest the reasons for their desires. While real people do drugs for complex reasons which are hard to unravel, these characters are living in a movie-world symbolism which suggests familiar, ""important"" reasons for their behavior that tie into the most materialistic, shallow aspects of our society. And of course the shallow, cheap aspects of our culture are harmful to us all, and we recognize them in the movie. So despite their lack of depth, is not hard for us to relate to these characters, and maybe even feel sorry for them, since they exist only as empty vessels into which we may pour our own self-pity.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Disturbing, Graphic and Great","I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close.  I was totally amazed by her.All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

Message Received!,"No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Harrowing,"A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.Aronofsky, previously only known for indie hit PI, works wonders as director. He incorporates plenty of frenzied editing and stylish flourishes in a way that complements the story rather than distracts from it. Some of his work, like the chest-mounted cameras, is sublime and gets us into the heads of the characters like never before.Of the cast, Ellen Burstyn towers head and shoulders above the rest in a performance that can only be described as haunting - perhaps one of the most haunting acting turns you'll ever see. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly share equally interesting story lines and are both strong, while what a surprise it is to discover that Marlon Wayans can actually act! The subject matter is grim indeed, with imagery that will stay with you long after watching.

when dreams and nightmares collide...,"My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.To watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie ""Pi"" (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. ""Requiem for a Dream"" strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way ""Requiem for a Dream"" illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in ""Fight Club"" (1999): ""things you own end up owning you..."". On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, ""Trainspotting"" (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disturbing unique vision,"Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C.

These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of.

Im sure that was a desired effect so they could show how deeply they were getting into their usage, but after awhile its just like ""ok...here we go again. Borrrring.""

I love the style in which it is filmed, there are lots of split-screen technique, exaggerated sound effects and huge close ups, and all these manage to be stylishly used. The music is stunning too, Aronofsky directs superbly and the script is brutal and very honest. Requiem for a Dream has one underlying theme, the creeping menace of addiction, this theme is explored in a lot of forms and with chilling and compelling effect. Not only that, the highs and lows of drug-taking are conveyed. The story is hard-hitting, moving and draws you in and the characters feel real. The acting helps with this, Ellen Burstyn is amazing and gives one of the best performances of the decade. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also excellent, and Marlon Wayans I think hasn't been better. In conclusion, a powerful film, while not all people may like it it is for me one of the most important films on this subject. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
No Future At All,"Requiem For A Dream is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen in my life. These poor people from two generations are a lot like Anthony Quinn in Requiem For A Heavyweight. As a boxer Quinn in that film saw his career at an end and faced a very unpromising future. These people have no future at all.I certainly recognized the Coney Island/Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, an area of projects and an amusement area that has seen better days. Like Atlantic City, some in Coney Island eventually see casino gambling as the gimmick for a rebirth. If you see Requiem For A Dream, imagine it in that kind of Las Vegas type setting.At one time Brighton Beach was a template for a working class Jewish paradise of sort with families housed in apartments that partially built with the backing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Back when I was doing senior citizens crime claims at New York State Crime Victims Board, I can't tell you the number of claims from men and women who listed a small ILGWU pension as part of their income from that area. Such a woman is Ellyn Burstyn playing Sara Goldfarb.Things haven't gone right for her. As the neighborhood decayed, so did her life and family. Her one son Jared Leto, a promising kid at one time is now a hopeless addict with an addict girlfriend in Jennifer Connelly and an addict best friend in Marlon Wayans.I've known a few junkies in my time also. After a while they only have one thing on their mind, their particular addiction of choice and how to service it. Even if they want to rise in the dope trade business, they haven't got a head for business any longer.Which in a nutshell is the position of Leto and Wayans with Connelly in support figuring her own habit can be taken care of by following their lead. Of course its disaster all around.As for Ellyn Burstyn she gained Requiem For A Dream's only Academy Award recognition with a nomination for Best Actress. She's not just clueless about her son, she's caught up in her own chemical dependency. She dreams of her 10 minutes of fame on some daytime quiz show and gets herself nicely hooked on diet pills. Unlike her son, she does have some memories of better days and talks about them with her peers on the benches outside the apartments.I recognized a lot of the Brighton Beach/Coney Island area of Brooklyn where this was all shot on location. Requiem For A Dream is a sad film about sad people, definitely one to bring you down from any kind of high you might be on.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Everything goes blank,"It seems that, all of a sudden, after the film, everything goes blank. You can do nothing but feel shocked, afraid and get to understand how hard the life would be.With a big 'X' presenting on the scene, the dream, one they pursued so hard, proves to be impossible. The tragedy goes without saying. It's not surprising, mostly for the wrong way they insist. Reasonable as it is, it appears to be so unacceptable, due to our lack of thinking ow miserable living could be.It uses many details in particular ways.

Drugstore Cowboy did it better...,"I must admit that I was somewhat surprised to see that this film is rated at #46 (at time of writing) in the IMDB Top 250. While it was a good film, I don't think that it was powerful enough to rate so highly.Perhaps it's that there are relatively few drug-culture films around and that the viewer is not accustomed to the shock that the inevitable downward spiral finishes at. Or maybe it just got a much wider audience than many of those that came before it.In any case, the film is a good watch, but the highlight by far is the story of the mother and her obsession with dieting. I found myself drawn into her story far more than that of the other three characters.Overall, I'd give this 7/10.

Pretentious and overrated,"I really can't see what's so great about this movie. It was a big disappointment to me. I really tried to like it but I just couldn't. I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 20-30 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring, I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. (somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie) It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie, they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying ""hey look at me, have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool camera-angles and these amazing close-ups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too."" Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show close-ups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch ""panic in needle park"" or the german movie ""christiane f"" both those movies are far better than this one (and rated lower). I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40% voted a 10 for this.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
The film-making quality is secondary- this film makes you FEEL,"Often hype about films lead to disappointment and after waiting 14 months after release for my local cinema to show this film, I was done thinking about it. Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.This movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the 'slasher flick', this stuff is REAL.In a country amid a 'war against drugs' this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government ""task-force"" or classroom lecture.",,Anonymous,Drama
A Real Nightmare,"The feelings that Requiem for a Dream leaves you with makes it hit way different from other sad movies. Sad endings sometimes make the viewer cry, but the viewer can always assume that either the story is over or that there's still the possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. With this movie those are not options. The viewer knows that the hole in which the characters got themselves in just keeps getting infinitely bigger, and that the possibility of getting out of that hole became inexistent a long time ago. What makes this feeling so peculiar is that this movie is real. Addiction is real and Aronofsky did an incredible job portraying how it snatches away the dignity of human beings. Watching someone become a slave of their own mind and knowing that hoping is futile is why this film breaks the viewer's heart in such a peculiar way.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made),"Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance.In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
.....haunting the viewer long after the final fade.,"(I originally wrote this review for a journalism class. It's my first film review, and i hope to write many more in the future.)I have a theory that the longer it takes me to utter a word at the close of a film, the harder it has hit me. After walking away from Requiem for a Dream, it took me forever to utter even a sigh. I felt as if I had just watched a car accident, and I could remember every gruesome detail.Requiem for a Dream is terrible, haunting film; the kind of film that's dark images that might chase me into nightmares. The film is a nightmare. When I say this I am not speaking from a critical standpoint and this is not a `horror' movie in regular context. However, this piece, about the horrors of drug addiction, is not for the faint of heart. The film was critically a masterpiece, perhaps the best I have seen this year.Requiem was written and directed by Darren Arnofsky, better known for another dark film about life, Pi (1998). Requiem revolves around a young dreamer named Harry Goldfarb, (Jared Leto of My So Called Life, Fight Club) and his widowed mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn of The Yards, Deceiver). The film also features Marlon Wayans (of Scary Movie, In Living Color on television), and Jennifer Connelly (of Dark City, Labyrinth).This isn't the average, run of the mill `Drugs are Bad' stereotypical film, despite the fact it was Arnofsky's mission to create a film that dutifully rendered the theme of the book it was loosely based on, Hubert Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, A book about the ills of drug addiction. Instead, the extraordinary cinematic technique of Arnofsky makes it hard to look away. He uses sped up sequences, split screen shooting, and various camera angles as a few `brushes' to illustrate the film's basic storyline.Harry Goldfarb (Leto) and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans) have big plans. By getting hold of a fine score of Heroin they are able to cut it themselves and sell it on the streets. With Harry's end of the profit he wants to assist his girlfriend, Marion (Connelly) in making her clothing boutique a dream come true. Somewhere along the line major complications arise, the three frequent the drug more often, and the three are thrown into a wild mix of various trouble with drugs, violence, and the police.Meanwhile Harry's mother, Sarah, (Burstyn) has settled into a painful and lonely routine of cooking and cleaning.  After a phone call from a television game show scout, Sarah wants to diet and look her best. She has even picked out her best dress to wear on television. When her diet seems certain to fail she enlists the help of a doctor. Without so much as a care he prescribes her pills in the form of speed. At first these pills work, yet she slowly becomes addicted, abusing the medication. As time drags on she eventually loses track of herself and reality.Requiem is a shocking look into the world of addiction and denial. The film painstakingly focuses on a mere heartbeat of the lives of Harry, his mother, Tyrone, and Marion. It glorifies and downplays their personal day to day struggles, their fears and hopes, and the eventual destruction of everything around them through their respective addictions.Arnofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libatique have put the film together is such a manner that time races by when it's characters are on their drugs, yet it seems to drag when they're not. The feeling that the characters believe that life between highs is dull, and they are waiting for the next hit becomes hauntingly evident. In addition the scenes of drug induced highs are bright and busy, while those without are seemingly drab and clouded. One thing that got to me was how dimly lit each of the character's apartments were how little sun came in, the emptiness, and openness of each. In one scene Harry is walking out a pier in the beautiful summer sunshine to Marion, who is waiting patiently in a red dress. I found it interesting since in one of Connelly's latest films, Dark City, she is featured in a similar sequence. It is also interesting to note that Ajay Naidu, Sean Gulette, and Samia Shaoib, who appear in small roles, were also in Arnofsky's film, Pi.One of the most influential techniques in this tale is the music. Clint Mansell (Who worked on Pi as well) employed The Kronos Quartet to perform every song on the soundtrack, such as aptly titled pieces `Ghosts of Things to Come' and `The Beginning of the End.' Each piece is as haunting and nervous as the images on screen, and the music is impossible to ignore as a reminder of the tension and collapse. It is equally as powerful as the film in haunting the viewer long after the final fade.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Stunning,"I was skeptical of seeing this movie because I have to admit Pi was not exactly my favorite movie.  But after seeing Requiem, I left the theater stunned.  This was an incredible movie, with beautiful imagery and the entire cast was amazing.  Ellen Burstyn definitely deserves an Oscar for her role as a lonely and unknowing speed addict, and who knew that Marlon Wayans could act??  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly were great as usual. The last few minutes of the movie left me horrified, but in a surprisingly good way.  You MUST see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Mind numbing!,"It seems that most people either hate or love this movie. I do both.Yes, it did make me feel numb for the past hours and it IS a powerful movie the first time you watch it.For me, the true power of this movie lies in the shock value. What I mean by that is that they throw so many awful things in your face time over and over again and it just gets worse and worse and worse. Your brain gets kind of ""uhm...oh...wow"". It didn't make me think. It made my brain numb.If you really look deep in to it though, you'll not find much other than the message that ""Drugs are bad, just look how awful these people's lives has turned out!"". There's not much more to it. The characters don't really have any deep struggles (other than drugs of course), at least not that we see. They are pretty one dimensional.In the end, I didn't really feel sympathy for them per se, because they didn't really tell me anything other than ""wow...oh...this is just awful"" and they where just so incredibly pathetic, the whole lot.On one hand, I hate this movie for making my brain numb and removing my thinking, and by that ignoring that this movie ISN'T that deep. It'll make you it is, but really isn't.Once again, it's the shock value. This is really thanks to the whole feeling of the movie and the way it's filmed and the lovely soundtrack it has! It's really powerful, but there is not much behind it.The acting is good.I give this movie a 5 out of 10, just because it's so impressive how the movie affected me.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Ellen Burstyn losing the Oscar to Julia Roberts: Historical and Irreparable Injustice.,"Everything that could be said about this film was said . Both by the critics and by the reviews posted here on IMDB. It is a spectacular film, depressing and very difficult to watch. End of conversation. But after watching the movie again, I have to express my indignation at the injustice committed by the Academy when it gave the Oscar Award to Julia Roberts and did not award the fantastic performance of Ellen Burstyn. In yet another of those historic Hollywood episodes that can never be repaired. Similar to the injustice of 1976, when Rocky was given the Oscar for Best Picture and overlooked the superb Network.

Initially I thought it was merely a film about drug addiction, I'm not as sure now, maybe it's as much a film about addiction in general, Harry's addiction is of course plain to see, but Sara's addiction is more complex, sugar? I didn't consider the possibility before.This film is genuinely uncomfortable to watch, but you cannot take your eyes off it, it's a brilliant film, it should be shown to anyone thinking about having their first fix, it may just make them think twice.Jared Leto is great here, Ellen Burstyn is tremendous, her spiral out of control is incredible, it's so good it hurts.Amazing, but uncomfortable.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not Legendary But Still Pretty Good I Guess,"Lux Aeterna is my introduction to classical music. It is one of the first 10 pieces of music I listened to on my S3353 phone. I don't like this piece just like that. I still listen to it. It is one of the most popular pieces in the world anyway. Even though it dates back to my childhood, I have never sat down and watched the movie. Whenever I imagined something about this music, it was terrifying. Especially when I watched the Illuminati cards on YouTube and they played this music in the background, I would get so scared that I can't explain it. For that reason, I always thought the movie was about the Illuminati, but it was true. It was an adaptation of a book. For that reason, it would be a bit incomplete to write this review before reading the book, but I still want to write it, maybe I will come back here after reading the book in the future.The story of the Requiem for a Dream movie seemed a bit normal to me. In other words, there weren't many moments when I was surprised, scared or sad while watching it. Of course, I don't want to say it's a cliché, but I mean, a person expects a point where they will be surprised. The film tells the story of a woman who wants to appear on a TV show and develops an eating disorder while trying to fit into the clothes she wants, and her son, who loses his mind with the local drug dealing business and naturally becomes a drug addict, and the film progresses exactly as you can imagine. At first, everything is bad, then there is hope, then a peak and a decline. In other words, I didn't expect anything different. The story seemed quite banal and standard to me. I looked around a bit, and they called the man who diagnosed the woman and prescribed medication a criticism of the health system, but I think it would have been a criticism on the same level if it had written ""the health system is very bad"" on the screen instead of this scene. It is of poor quality. But of course, the highlight of the film is not its story. It is more the way it presents this story to you. So now let's talk about the cinematography a little.The film is shown to us in parts. It has divided these into seasons. Each season is divided into good beginning, a peak, a fall and a devline. The flow of the film for the characters is like this. At first, they start calmly. Then things peak. Then the devline begins and we watch their final collapse. As a scene, sometimes the idea of seperating characters side by side was nice but it seemed boring to me. Maybe it is revolutionary for the year 2000 but I don't think it is a bad stage play. The only think I found beautiful about the movie is its ending. At the end, we see everything as its very bottom with very fast scene transitions. We see that everything is completely over but as I sait, I can't fully emphasize it because there is nothing surprising in this. In other words, I can't get the main idea of the movie, even if there is, I don't accept something that simple. I also listened to the soundtrack and it wasn't a pleasant surprise for me that everything except Lux Aeterna was just a repetition of 5-6 songs.The acting is the best part of the movie, believe me, I never like acting. Our old lady played wonderfully. I really liked the tremors in her voice. She played as if she really lived her head movements, eyes, conversations, I congratulate her but I can't say much about the rest of the cast, it's normal.I probably look a little disappointed. It happened that way, while I was expecting something more legendary, I encountered a more standard movie but of course it is not bad and it is definitely not a waste of time. I still say try it but unfortunately its level is low as a plot and story. It is only watched for its music and last scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
It will leave you with an Emotional Hangover,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a little too depressing to be a movie I would say that I like a lot. I don't mean that as any sort of disrespect, because it absolutely is a well made movie.It is apparent that writer and director Darren Aronofsky successfully put together the movie he intended to make. Every character development point along their arc, every scene and even every frame fulfills its purpose. Drugs enter the lives of each character - an aimless young man, his girlfriend, his friend, and his widowed mother. They all experience the euphoric highs when using drugs, and they experience the swift and devastating lows. Desperation flows through each character.Aronofsky creatively makes use of disorienting camera angles to illustrate the unhinged frame of mind that these people deal with while high. Closeups are meant to make viewers uncomfortable, as we are forced to closely encounter a manic drug addict. Aronofsky also uses intentionally repetitive drug use sequences to make clear how often they are using and how completely consumed their lives are by the drugs. Another creative touch I'll mention is his use of split screen of two characters who are lying right beside each other. At first it seems like a superfluous choice, but after consideration I realized that it is meant to show how alone these characters are, even when they are together.What a depressing thought.Fair warning to anyone who hasn't seen this yet: the movie is a bummer.

Still is the best picture I've ever seen.,"I'm sitting here, in September 2014, thinking of my all-time favourite movies, and Requiem for A Dream has been there, on top of my list, for 14 years.I have never felt such raw emotion watching a movie; before and after Requiem's release. I went through all possible kinds of emotions watching this masterpiece. I've seen it probably 20 times over the years and the result is always the same. It's a jaw-dropping experience. I remember hearing the soundtrack the first time in 2000, while watching the movie, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was added to the 3 seasons of the movie. The soundtrack has been used many times since then for commercials, trailers and whatnot, but to me, this is the Requiem's soundtrack.The 4 main acting performances in the movie are perfection. I connected with all of them. The cinematography, the editing and the directing are still amongst the best I've ever seen. The movie doesn't age at all. I always wondered why it wasn't up for many Oscars? (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Supp Actor and Supp Actress). I guess not many people saw the movie when it came out in the Fall of 2000.This is movie perfection, an experience I will never forget, one of the best movies ever made, a tragic story but yet so close to what many humans must go through in their regular lives.If someone out there has not seen this masterpiece, I envy you. I wish I could re-live the 2 hours I went through the first time I saw this. A moment I will never forget. A must-have in any movie collection. A movie for the cinephiles.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Master Piece,"It's very rare to watch a movie or a show and you don't get bored during the whole thing not even a second, the movie from the beginning to the end kept moving the story toward its end and kept developing its characters... small and meaningful conversations, no wasted scenes no boring and nonsense conversations, the music was beyond great and it played a huge role to make me invested more into the events and with the great production and the great acting, I felt all characters emotions as I were one of them.Finally and most importantly the message behind the storytelling is incredible something that will stick in your mind for years and it will definitely affect your personnel life, it was clear and very easy to understand. What a great movie well done that's really a peak art.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Never again,"I just finished watching this and I've never felt so empty. I cried a lot ,not because of the sadness of the situations all four characters are in though
(as much as they are all very sad) I was crying because of how horrible and disturbing the whole ordeal was especially those last 20 minutes. Seeing the consequences of all the characters addictions rapidly thrown at your face within such a short amount of time was so overwhelming and intense to the point I had to pause the movie to just process how I was meant to be feeling. For this reason I hate this movie. Not one bit of it was enjoyable. It was SO amazing though. Technically speaking I think the movie does a great job of getting its point across and telling the character arcs. It's acted very well especially by Ellen burstyn and I can really appreciate the camera work and stylisation of the movie as a whole with the very quick and intense shots creating a really fitting atmosphere for the horrors of addiction the movie portrays.this film is really really great. But I hated watching it and I will probably never do it again lol.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Unlike any movie that I've ever seen.,"Over on the ""Noah"" board, I made a thread wherein I expressed my opinion on that film. I also mentioned that it was the first Darren Aronofsky film that I had ever seen, which surprised the people who read my review, and so they recommended a few of Aronofsky's films, and the one that was recommended the most was Requiem For A Dream. And so, I rented the film off of Amazon, and gave it a watch, unprepared for what I was about to witness.Requiem For A Dream is like no other film I've ever seen, and even now, as I type this, I'm still attempting to figure out what I make of the film, but I will do my best to put my thoughts into a cohesive manner, so here it goes:I was going to start off by talking about how the film handles its depiction of people doing drugs, but I'd rather you look up Confused Matthew's review of the film, he discusses it better than I ever could, so instead, I'm only going to talk about the performances and the direction.Everyone in this film gave great performances. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and especially Ellen Burstyn (who deserved her Oscar nomination) each turn in some of the best acting I've ever seen from each of them, and that helped give each of their characters extra depth.Then, there's the directing by Aronofsky. The way he shot and edited the film is REALLY trippy and bizarre, but it works, because it gives you the feeling that you too are on drugs, which gives the audience a little bit of insight as to what the characters experience when they, you know, ""do the good stuff"". And you could also say that it helps the audience know why the characters do the drugs in the first place.Oh, and the ending to the film? Without a doubt one of the darkest endings I've ever seen in a film, and yet it's somewhat poignant in its message. I refuse to tell you what happens in it, just so you know.If you haven't seen this movie, I wholeheartedly recommend it, but I will warn you that you will not, I repeat NOT, be prepared for what you will see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Overly stylised, but a much cleaner second half with a harrowing ending.","For the most part this movie ambles along, caught up in a few stylistic touches that it doesn't quite manage to deliver. The repeating mundane and reinforcing dialogue and visuals just go to remind you of events and circumstance that you already know.However, it is in the second half of the film where it really gets its message forward. It shows how four peoples lives career out of control when drugs begin to take over their lives, and not all from the illegal point of view.From the second half it's a very interesting and compelling film, dropping to total despair by the last twenty minutes. The final sequence is one of the most harrowing to endure in the movies I've seen in the last few years, and tackles the issues head on without flinching.Overly stylised it certainly is, but if you can endure those moments and progress onto the latter part of the movie you will have a head on crash with the ending. Harrowing is hardly the word.I have to say, stunning performance from Jennifer Connelly, and an equally amazing and surprising show from Marlon Wayans. Dump that Wayans trade mark movie and get into the real thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the greatest films of all time that evokes raw emotion,"Requiem for a dream is one movie of many about drugs but this one really sticks it's landing. It's a tear jerker, a stomach churning drama, and an exciting thrill ride. Words can not describe how good this movie is. Saying it's a great movie that is up there as one of the best movies of all time, Goes against the saddening subject that the movie is really about. The movie centers on the life of drug addiction. And there is nothing good let alone great about drug addiction. Addiction is a very complicated and challenging situation for those who are addicted to a substance and those affected by the ones they love who are addicted to a substance. But Darren aronofskys ""requiem for a dream"" shows what the most brutal, maniacal, deprived, and sadistic look at drug addiction can be like. And again to say this movie is great is very contradictory to how it feels to watch this movie. It is very horrifying and sickening to watch at times but the overall movie is great. Those who appreciate film and can understand and appreciate the quality of a story no matter how vile the story may be, will truly love this movie. I will leave spoilers out of this review so people can see and judge the movie for themselves. But I will say Ellen Burstyns character in the movie is one of the best characters I've seen in my whole life her acting is flawless and she deserves a round of applause for her performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict...","An unflinching, dark, gritty exploration into the life of an addict with no hope and no positivity. It still holds up as perfect example of excellent film making. Every shot is purposeful and conveys the emotional impact of the situations on the characters. No second is wasted.The pacing builds with the film, beginning with long, slow scenes and becoming quicker cut as the tension builds. The soundtrack mirrors this progression, starting with orchestral pieces and moving into more aggressive electronic sounds. After about an hour of the slow build the film then just repeatedly punches you in the gut for the remaining 30 minutes and leaves me, for one, feeling empty inside after and I love it. This is what cinema should do make you feel.The themes of dependency run throughout the film. The addiction to diet pills and television that Sarah Goldfarb suffers from parallels the drug addiction of Harry and Co. and are shown to be equally as destructive, both mentally and physically. Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sarah Goldfarb is superb. During a scene where she is explaining her crippling loneliness her lips quiver and break into the occasional, subtle, nervous smile, which is a something that you just don't see from lesser actors. Each scene with the young cast (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) is juxtaposed with a scene of Sarah to further show how any addiction has the power to control you and it is the lack of control that ultimately takes your life away.The film is littered with extreme close up, quick cuts of drug taking which reflect the constant, unescapable repetition that the characters live.I could probably write an entire essay about the genius of ""Requiem for a Dream"" (I have barely mentioned the cinematography, lighting or sound design) but ill stop here for now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Superb,"Darren aronofsky directs Jared Leto, Ellen burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans in this disturbing spiral of a film.The story centerers around four ""drug addicts"" the characters played by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and marlon wayans are all teenagers who start off dabbling in heroin, until it stars to dominate their life and starts to get out of control, the two boys start to get into very dangerous situations and Jennifer Connelly starts to get into prostitution. The key character however is Ellen burstyn, mother of Jared Leto who lives by herself sat in her armchair all day watching a day time television show. She receives a letter one day claiming that she has won a competition to be on television, of course she is over the moon but unfortunately she can't fit in to her old red dress. she comes to the conclusion that diet pills are the way forward but to her peril, she soon finds out that the pills are addictive and unhealthy. Her life starts to go the same way as her sons life.This film is one of the best examples if not the best of modern society and culture. Aronofsky will get a Lot of stick from some people about this film but he doesn't pull any punches and why should he? There is such a deep meaning here, even if it isn't finding nemo (great film) but aronofsky is saying that don't have a go at kids for drugs, because it is ingrained in our society he shows this by using Ellen burstyn, she is an innocent old lady and she becomes a drug addict, burstyn portrays her sweet innocence well but also the characters deranged side. What is very clever is for most of the film we know that the younger three are on heroin but we don't see them use it exactly until Jared Leto uses it in his infected arm. Perhaps the most chilling scene is where Jennifer Connelly ""performs"" in front of a crowd, just for some drugs, Jared Leto her boyfriend encourages her to do this but she doesn't seem to even hesitate with it.I'm not surprised that this film didn't win any Oscars etc this isn't a film that the ""higher powers"" would vote for but that doesn't take anything away from it.This film is a huge statement about our culture and one that some people won't like but as a teenager myself I would find requiem for a dream as a greater warning, as opposed to the kind of films they show you at school about drugs, this is nowhere near government propaganda as some of the others are but a realism story about how harmful drugs really are.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Bleak, depressing but","Requiem for a dream follows three different story lines that are connected to each other with four different characters; Harry, his mother Sara, his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone. The movie vividly shows the sensation of what drugs actually do to your body and your life in generally. The four characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, disgusting addictions. The film touches on themes like racism, family conflicts, trust issues, extreme self confidence, neglecting the surroundings and more. The film, however, fails at creating unique and original characters with even the slightest amount of depth. I get that the bleak lighting and dark subject matter is meant to amplify the effect of the film's portrayal of drug addiction, but it left me feeling detached most of the time. It's a series of events within these characters lives that we're watching unfold, but the characters don't have any real goals they're working towards. Any obstacles they face are induced by themselves due to their poor decision making which I guess is the point. At the end of day, this movie tells us nothing we don't already know. However the technical elements were really something else; the cinematography is slick but with odd camera shots/angles; the editing is also great albeit it's gets too comfortable with the use fancy effects; the MVP of the film for me is the music, It is very charmingly and hauntingly scored, having a real presence while also allowing the atmosphere to speak, which it wouldn't have done as effectively if the scoring was louder, brasher and more constant. Requiem for a Dream definitely benefitted from having a more melancholic, lilting and sometimes sparse approach to the music. The main theme is very memorable too.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
do not see this movie...,"Do not see this movie if you thought Julia Roberts really deserved that Oscar.  Do not see this movie if you really dig romantic comedies.  Do not see this movie if you don't enjoy thinking....or being pushed to the edge and left for dead.  Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted, moved, sickened, and utterly amazed.This movie did for smack what even ""Trainspotting"" failed to do.  Although ""Trainspotting"" had a definite anti-smack message, and some people died, and it was pretty disturbing it pales in comparison to this movie. ""Trainspotting"" had a few really disturbing scenes, but even they were ""prettier"" than half of what goes on in ""Requiem For A Dream"".  Renton crawls down a toilet; Harry shoots up into a festering wound and has his arm amputated.  And while no one dies physically in ""Requiem"" (at least no major characters), in the end everyone is left with a large part of their soul missing....not to mention their mind.  There are other comparisons and contrasts to be made, but the point is: if you can still think drugs are ""cool""  or anything other than ""mind bending-ly terrifying"" after watching this movie you are scary.Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Trainspotting"" and I know that it wasn't meant to be what ""Requiem"" was.  But the similarities were too obvious for me to ignore.  ""Requiem"" isn't meant to tell a story as much as ""Trainspotting"" was.  ""Requiem"" is meant to put the fear of God into you, and it succeeds. And Ellen Burstyn is INCREDIBLE!Yes, the movie has flaws.  But I still haven't seen the ""perfect"" movie yet, so that can hardly be held against it's brilliance.  Darren Aronofvsky is going places.  ""Pi"" was really good, ""Requiem"" is great, I can't wait to see what's coming next...So don't watch this movie if it sounds too hard to watch (and it is very hard to watch) and don't watch it if you don't want to be depressed (in a beautiful way).

Beautifully tragic,"Most reviews will either be a 1/10 or a 10/10, those who gave it a 1 never gave it a chance, never opened there mind or saw pass the technicalities of it all. I gave it a 10 because I hate how this movie made me feel, I've never been more disgusted at life than after seeing this movie. When the credits came up, I started crying and stared at the watch next movie sign on the rental screen for a good half an hour. I couldn't bring myself to watch anything or thing of anything but this film. A movie that induces that much thought after the fact deserves a 10. Even those who don't like it because of it's disturbing theme, to admit that it was so powerful to disturb someone is to admit that it is worth the highest rating for being that powerful.I went in this movie thinking it would be like ""The Basketball Diaries"" I was really wrong. It's not just another story about drug addicts, it's not trying to shove it's meaning down your throat and it's not meant to scare your children out of taking drugs as we all know doesn't work. This movie is a piece of art. The way it's shot is one of a kind, the music helps every scene to be more powerful and the acting is so down to earth you really believe the struggle they are going through. Jared Leto, playing Harry Goldfarb gives the best performance of his career and in the end you will cry for him because you sympathize so much with him. Ellen Burstyn gave an incredible performance as well and her story is the most haunting because it's her story that makes you realize this can happen to anyone and everyone.I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone but I can honestly say I could, at the same time. It's a movie so powerful and haunting I could never watch again but I feel as if everyone should see this. It's a story about life and the craving you have. Whether it is sugar, TV, sex or drugs, we all have cravings and they can bring out the worst in us and this movie shows how they can go terribly wrong if we don't realize our addictions.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

One of the most dangerous movies indeed,"This movie was considerer by Premiere as one of the 25 most dangerous movies, and i really feel like it is. Darren Aronofsky gives us a amazing movie about drugs, how it changes our lives, by showing how time can go faster or slower with the more than 2000 cuts that make us always be on the edge. It also reveals the dark side of the human condition who prefers a drug induced utopia than to do something meaningful to change their lives. It shows dramatically the pain of the characters and their endless search for something that at the end they always knew they wouldn't be able to achieve. The futility of current society is showed on the shallow goals of the characters who prefer a tragic ending than to choose different things for their lives.Although all the performances are very good, there's no shadow of a doubt that Ellen Burstyn gives a performance of a life as Sara Goldfarb, we feel her pain, we understand her needs, we feel her desire...Ellen makes totally drawn to a character who gets what she wants and no one deserves.

"A Frenetic, Visually Stunning Addition to Film History","I have to admit, I have wanted to watch RFAD for a couple of years now. However, I let other people's opinions keep me from seeing it, which is something I don't normally tend to do.  Everyone who has recommended it to me has said, ""You will LOVE this movie, it is so dark and heavy.  It's REALLY dark and REALLY heavy.""  So for a couple of years, I've had it on the back burner but hadn't actually picked it up. RFAD seems to have become a staple on some of the ""pay"" movie channels on cable, and on Friday night it was a choice of one of my DVDs, Swingers on HBO or RFAD.  I chose RFAD and was cautiously delighted.I will preface this review by stating that I have not yet seen Aronofsky's first film, ""Pi"" so I am uncertain if the visual style in RFAD is his normal M-O, but I was thrilled.  The use of color, vibrant during the character's high points during these months, and sallow during the more prevalent low times was subtle yet stylishly done.  The frenetic cinematography is something that has been used often in the last couple of years and is becoming more and more mainstream, but I believe at this time it wasn't as overused as it is today.  Even if it is not original, it's effect is very heavy on the viewer. The use of drugs was primarily limited to very quick montages (similar to ones done in Snatch) that got the point across without being too graphic. Additionally, the scene with Ellen Burstyn waiting in the doctor's office in the last act of the film was extremely frightening, due in large part to the brilliant camera work and the sound.In regard to sound, I am very picky when it comes to music use in films. Being a product of an MTV generation and having studied video production I am sensitive to when music is appropriately placed in films.  The effective use of techno music in films is rare, Run Lola Run is one of the few films that come to mind, but I can add RFAD to this list.  The score is also extremely haunting; it compliments the action and the characters.Which brings me to the acting.  This movie would have simply been stylish with a decent story without the incredible performances of the four principle players.  Jared Leto was very good as Harry Goldfarb.  He conveyed the struggle between his reality and his drug-enhanced reality very well. I wasn't expecting much from the ""cute guy"" in My So Called Life.  And Marlon Wayans.. talk about not expecting much.  I'm not a big fan of comedic films unless they were made before 1960 generally, so I am not well schooled in the Wayans Family.  Marlon Wayans'character was less dimensional than Leto's but sympathetic nonetheless.  I've never been a fan of Jennifer Connelly. I remember sitting through her C-grade films in the 80's and early 90's with boyfriends who would readily admit she was a terrible actress but that she was a goddess because she was beautiful.  Of course, none of these films included a gorgeous male co-star (Frank Whaley? I think not.) so I couldn't dip into that superficial fantasy world that would make those films more endurable.  This movie was definitely a welcome change.  Whereas I was rolling my eyes during her early performance in the film, her acting drew me in to her character and eventually made me both pity and feel repelled by her.And finally, Ellen Burstyn.  This woman is not used enough.  I remember when she was nominated for an Oscar for this role, they showed her clip, then they showed her in the audience and I was literally shocked by both her beauty and the transformation into abject dowdiness in this role.  It is Burstyn's performance in this film that terrified me.  Perhaps it was because we actually see the origins of her addiction from beginning to end. Nevertheless, her performance made me ache.  It made my heart hurt.  I've seen Burstyn in several other films, but based on this film alone I want to see more.  She was amazing.For two days after I watched this movie, I sat back and had to figure out whether I liked this movie or not.   I knew that I liked the technical aspects, and having attended film school that's the first thing I base my opinion on.  During the weekend, the movie was always in the back of my head, but I still was sorting out whether or not I truly liked it.  Then this morning I came to a realization.  I liked this movie in the same light as I liked Schindler's List.  Both movies are brilliantly directed with excellent performances, and they were both extremely thought provoking. However, they are so heavy and compelling that one can't take it out to watch it on a regular basis without climbing into your own Bell Jar.Bottom Line:  A must-see.  Just make sure you don't watch it before you head to work at your gig as a Clown for Hire at little Susie's birthday party.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Requiem for a disappointment...,"Talk about a let down. I had heard nothing but raves about this one in the genre of ""drug films"", but when I finally saw it I realized that the raves were from raving lunatics. You might want to head to a fallout shelter if you're planning to watch this bomb. It only shows that a populace raised on the current standard of unrealistic ""reality t.v."", will buy anything.Right off the top, the acting is reminiscent of an over-dramatized silent movie. Not easy to do when you have experienced actors like Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons (whose performances while very good, become almost comical as a result of the script and the director's efforts). While Ellen Bursten does a great job of portraying Harry's rapidly deteriorating and lonely mother, for a film that tries to take itself and it's subject matter so seriously, the comedic aspect of her scenes seem very out of place.The film's hysteria and sensationalism reach ridiculous heights. It's overloaded, absurd and unconvincing. Camera angles that would serve better in a music video make up most of the ""substance"" of this very gimmicky film. And don't get me started on some of the worst New York accents I've heard since I visited Kentucky.If there's one positive thing I can say about this movie it's that it is very likely to dissuade the type of impressionable NAIVE young minds that could fall victim to the very real perils of serious drug use (most of which is grossly exaggerated in this farcical film). However those same impressionable minds are undoubtedly the ones that will believe this film paints a ""stark and real"" picture of what happens to everyone who uses drugs, without exception.Overall, if you have never had a drug problem, known anyone in your entire life who has had one, ever used drugs, or heard anyone talk realistically about drugs, then maybe this is the movie for you. An MTV version of the ""real world"" from a junkie's perspective. It's not even amusing as the joke it ends up being.

Captivating Horror,"Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies that I can clearly look back upon, and remember the first time I watched it. It was with my roommates in college (Go Sun Devils) and once the end credits rolled, the room was completely silent. No one said a thing for a good five minutes. The images going through my head was similar to Jay Rabinowitz' editing in the film. Having gone through a battle with drug addiction myself, this one hit home pretty damn hard. That was six years ago. Now when I watch Requiem for a Dream, I admire it for what it is. A brilliantly told story about four Coney Islanders whose lives spiral out of control over the course of a single year. Addiction slowly breaks them down and we, the audience, have front row seats to the horror show that slowly develops. The camera angles and quick cuts practically teleport us into their dark, drug fueled world and the music in the background makes every shot eerie. Clint Mansell provides that score which intensifies every scene by 100. There are no winners in this film. If you think you will find redemption in these characters, stop looking, because you will find none. The phenomenal acting alone will make you cringe in your chair for each character makes you believe that they are truly suffering horribly. Ellen Burstyn provides the performance of a lifetime. One of the best acting performances I have ever seen in a movie. Leto, Connelly and Wayans are brilliant as well, but Burstyn takes the cake in this one. If you are in a good mood and watch this, it will be gone by the time this is over. If you watch in a bad mood, it will only get worse. I know I am not making the film seem enticing, but if you have not seen it, I suggest you do. Like it or not you will come away with something.

They all have dreams, but as dependence on drugs is increasing, their dreams are turning into nightmares.The acting is phenomenal. The story and how Aronofsky tells the story is just fantastic! The music is extraordinary. The cinematography is amazing! The directing is great. I also love how Aronofsky expresses his feelings without words and body language but with camera!I've almost seen a thousand of movies and no movie has ever affected me like this one!Even though this movie is amazing, I warn you: This movie will haunt you for several days!Mr.Aronofsky has done a great job, if you feel sick,depressed or got the feeling that you're not going to touch drugs, after you've seen this movie! The movie is very brutal,tragic and honest. I hope you stay off drugs after you've seen this!This is a cinematic masterpiece and a fantastic work of art!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

SO OVERRATED,"The soundtrack is the only thing that's good. The storyline...well, there's no storyline. The whole movie is boring and senseless.

"Innovative, Wow.","The story of four people who get too much into drugs, it poses several questions, not all of them about drugs.  One of them is, how stylized can movies become before they are so thoroughly stylized that they lose their narrative roots?  It's rather like music in some respects.  At one end of the dimension, which I won't try to name, there is a simple tune like, oh, ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,"" which is easy to remember, fun to whistle, cute, and rudimentary (although Mozart did some very odd things with it). At the other, three minutes and some seconds of silence.  In movies, at the simple end, we can have, say, a one-hour film consisting of nothing but the same shot of the Empire State Building.  At the other end of the dimension we might get something resembling what one sees in a kaleidoscope while stoned.  (Or maybe we come back to the Empire State Building; maybe it's not a dimension at all, but a circle.)This one certainly hasn't lost touch with the events it describes but it's pretty highly stylized too, as far as the direction, photography, editing, and sound are concerned.  Sometimes this stylization works to support the narrative and sometimes it doesn.  Sometimes it actually works against it. Example:  all of the drugged-up scenes are in fast motion, including those involving, not just speed, but marijuana and heroin.  The hyped-up action we get while Ellen Burstyn is on diet pills is evocative, peppy, full of accelerated business.  But heroin doesn't work that way.  And marijuana practically ablates one's sense of the passage of time so that, for instance, it sometimes seems to take half an hour to urinate -- so they tell me.  If you stop using speed abruptly you can get some wizard hallucinations.  But no one hallucinates on heroin, although this film suggests they do.  The result is that the stylization is sometimes over the top, not slowing down enough to give us a chance to take a breath.  It's nerve jangling and leaves the viewer a neural shambles.  The performances are fine, by everyone concerned.  In particular, Jennifer Connoley has by far her juiciest role and, somewhat surprisingly, is up to it.  Burstyn is excellent too, her accent pretty well Brooklynized.  But some of that shredding of sensibilities is unearned and unnecessary.  The editing is increasingly jumpy and shocking, though it never leaves us in doubt of where we are or who we are with.  The score is a blend of mostly scratchy, unpleasant electronics and ordinary sounds with the gain on high -- each pill accompanied by a ""plop"" on the sound track, each flick on a lighter by a ""pfft,"" and so on.  (Sometimes it sounds like a Popeye cartoon.)  The photography too is highly distinctive.  Fisheye lenses abound here. Cameras are fixed by harness onto an actor's body so that the actor's face and shoulders are immobile while the background seems to swivel around him and he walks and turns corners.  The effect is so disturbing that it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.I found Aranovsky's earlier film, Pi, plan irritating and depressing because of the high-contrast photography and other directorially imposed effects. This one is depressing too, but less irritating because, despite the high style, a story is being carried, and the story is about characters we care something about.  They may be self absorbed, like the subject of ""Pi,"" but they're hardly self confident.  Their weaknesses are pathetic but entirely recognizable.  Ellen Burstyn wants to lose weight so she can look good in that red dress, just as she did at her son's graduation.  She pursues the cultural ideal of slenderness and youthfulness.  Her son and his pardners in euphoria pursue the cultural ideal of pleasuring one's self.  The drugs could be a neat stand in for the values that prevail in our community currently.  Why else, except out of a desire to look good, would people buy a three-hundred-dollar simulacrum of a rowboat and use it so regularly? Why else, except out of a desire to feel pleased with one's self, would anyone buy a forty-thousand-dollar ten-gallon-per-mile Suburban Assault Vehicle with a revolving machine gun turret atop it?  Hey!  Look at me, everybody, I'm young, beautiful, and happy!  Of course I can't figure out why I'm alive, but I don't ask myself that question.This is an extremely innovative film, but the director has made clear his admiration of earlier movies, including ""The Panic in Needle Park"" (the same general idea), ""The Godfather"" (ominous oranges), ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (""Feed me, Sara!""), and maybe ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (the acceleration of the cuts, tempo, and onscreen movements from moderato at the beginning to molto agitato towards the end).It left me saddened and panting for breath.  I'm not sure I'd like to sit through it too often, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to miss it.",,Anonymous,Drama
Should Be Required Viewing,"After watching this for first time, I thought to myself, ""Wow, with some appropriate editing, this ought to be required viewing for high school students as it's probably one of the best ""anti-drug"" presentations one could ever see.Young filmmaker Darren Aronofsky takes a depressing subject and makes it fun to watch, if that's possible. However, I'm speaking in general terms because - warning - a couple of scenes are anything but fun to view. Aronofsky uses stop- action/fast forward techniques, sound effects, hallucination scenes, etc. all to make this a good movie for the senses.Ellen Burstyn is outstanding in this film and many people who viewed this thought she should have won an Academy Award for her performance. Boy, if she doesn't scare you away from taking diet pills, nobody can. She's the only one in this film that is actually fun to watch. Jennifer Connelly can be one easily ogled by us guys but she plays so many sleazy, unlikeble roles, it's tough to warm up to her.Jared Leto, meanwhile, does his best to show us the horrors of what could happen when you hooked on junk which involves needles. In the last 30 minutes there are a few horrifying parts as Leto's infected arm gets worse and worse. People who have seen this film know what I'm talking about, It is grim, very grim but maybe that's what all of us need to see once in awhile.To watch Bursteyn and Leto slowly disintegrate is unforgettable and for Aronofsky to make this watchable was quite a feat. But for the grace of God, as it is said, one of these characters could be us.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
mind-blowing,"I didn't know what ""Requiem for a Dream"" was about when I rented it, and I was stunned. This ultra-gritty look at several people's lives degenerating due to drug usage is like nothing that you've ever seen. It's more polished than ""Pi"", but no less eye-popping. As mentally decaying retiree Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn makes your blood freeze the same way that she did in ""The Exorcist"". Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also bring to their roles an intensity rarely seen on screen. And let me tell you, I never could have predicted what would happen during those last few minutes! In conclusion, see this movie if you dare. I should warn you that it may knock your breath out.

A Deeply Emotional Story About Addiction,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film about addiction and the capacity it has to destroy lives. The film explores this idea through the following of four different characters, addiction all gripping them and acting out its malice in distinct ways. Aronofsky produces a highly emotional snapshot into the lives of these characters, and masterful camera work and creative shots display it in full. Aronofsky's use of timelapse, close-ups, and various other imaginative tricks allow the viewer to enter the perception of a drug-fueled mind; which in turn produces greater empathy for the characters as they embark on their downfall. The world Aronofsky creates is deprived and suffocating, prompting the viewer to understand or perhaps reconcile the characters' desire to escape. The acting by Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are true and imbued with vehemence. ""Requiem for a Dream,"" is a difficult movie to watch, but is worth viewing on the basis of the quality of the storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Heartbreakingly incredible,"Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended.The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty.The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful.Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come. You may not be able to watch it more than once but I urge anyone to rent it out and give yourself the cinematic experience of a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
How depressing,"I have watched this film once and will never ever watch it again, perhaps the single most depressing film ever made.

"Much, much more than just another 'drug movie'","Some of the mainstream reviews I had read about this movie prior to watching it didn't describe this movie favourably. Many of the criticisms were that this was just another 'drug movie', just another tale of hopelessness and despair. Some said that the story of addiction told here was 'unrealistic', some even suggested that this movie and it's approach were glorifying drug use.After watching this I wondered if these reviewers had just watched the same film I had?? This has to be the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalising, or condoning drug use in any way.It tells of the plight of 4 individuals, their respective descent into drug dependency, the effects this has on their relationships with each other, and the eventual lengths they will go to feed their addiction. On the contrary to the reviews I had read earlier, it occurs to me the depiction here is perhaps a little too 'realistic' for recreational viewing. Though this movie is certainly not 'easy going' it is a rewarding experience in the end.The film benefits from first rate performances (particularly Ellen Burstyn - an acting tour de force), superb cinematography and solid directing. The jump cuts and fast editing work really well here too, setting a suitable tone for the movie, conveying the character's disjointed and erratic perceptions of reality to the viewer effectively. Lastly the haunting musical score composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is as striking as it is original, complementing the mood of the movie perfectly.There is always a danger when making a movie dealing with issues such as these that the end result may appear contrived or over-sentimental, that the overall message become muddled; conflicting. This isn't the case with 'Reqiuem for a Dream', thanks to faultless execution in all aspects this movie is nothing short of excellent - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
on reading some negative comments.........,"after reading a couple of the comments on this film, which i saw for the second time last night, i must say some stuff.  kids, its the responsibility or art and of the artist (that includes filmmakers) to talk about EVERY aspect of life.  sometimes it doesn't always turn out nice in the end, which i think is one of the opening lines of the movie.  this is true.  i can't seem to make people understand that if the director intends to produce a feeling, and then succeeds, then the result is good.  quills is another example of this. you are SUPPOSED to feel disgusted/depressed/hopeless etc. it's only a movie.  at the same time one may argue that they go to the movies to feel good.  well, this is one guy's opinion, but i say go get a massage.  i go to the movies to be captivated. also, any movie which makes the audience think twice about going to the movies in the first place is a huge success in my book.  movies, films, thus art are not about having a good time, and then going home to forget about it.  movies can talk about the good times, but they also have to talk about the bad.  you dont like it, dont see it.  hopefully you'll see it accidently and then think twice before you pay for your next movie ticket. wonderful film.-c",,Anonymous,Drama

But this is, in my eyes, exactly what this film should be like! It shows every little piece of destruction in the lives of the protagonist, until the final end. Another aspect of the film that I truly liked was, that the mere showing of the damages, physically and mentally, without trying to be too moralistic and to spread wisdoms each of us has heard thousands of.I think I am ready to watch it again by now, but I have to say that this is not a film to see for pleasure.

"Devastating, grotesque masterpiece","When I go to the museum, I am often awed at these still lifes from dutch painters of the 16th and 17th centuries. There were those beautiful still lifes, showing a vase of flowers down to the slightest detail. But oh, it would be the one that captured some sort of devastation or ugliness that would capture my attention. The strange thing was as devastating and grotesque one would be all the more beautiful and engrossing.What is beautiful about such a painting is the thing that makes Requiem for a Dream such a beautiful film. A true artist captures what he or she sees, lives, or feels. If the artist fails to do this, then they create a sugar coated work. It is satisfying for the moment, but ultimately fails to leave a lasting impression. Too often, ""artists"" compromise their work for the sake of commercial success, painting ""beautiful"" pictures that are often too common in the field. Requiem for a Dream defies this by painting a grotesque, gripping portrait of addiction. Not once does Darren Aronsky flinch in creating this pictures. It is at time ugly, grotesque, sick, and devastating. But like a classic still life, you can't turn away as you stare at every stark detail.What I love about this film is that you know your own in for a downhill ride when you begin the film. Jared Leto's character is taking his mother's TV to be sold to get drugs. This moment just scratches the surface of the downward spiral we are about to witness. Aronsky's characters suffer and never turn back. And nothing more need be said of Ellyn Burstyn's fantastic performance as she deals with delusion, drug addiction, and an addiction of a different sort, with the television.The film has a big finish which is one of the most classic scenes in American film. Although I imagine most pointed towards this review have seen it, I dare not spoil it. It's the final detail in the still life. The one that makes you stare and stare - not so much at its beauty, but its sheer unrelenting truth.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Must watch, but only ONCE","From a viewer point of view, sometimes you like movies not to be so frank. Sometimes you prefer movies lie to you and let you get away from this ,somehow, ugly world. But if you are looking for this you should never watch this ""requiem for a dream"". This is a truely honest story of poor poeple engaging themselves with drugs and start destroying their not-so-beautiful life, second by second through the film. Like othe aronofsky films, the atmosphere is bothering in almost every scene, specially in the first 60 minutes. You might feel nothing about the film and want not to continue. But then the final 30-40 minutes arrives, everything changes, the atmosphere, the composition, the rhythm, everything, and it engages you with the story, with the characters, and then you can't move away. You want to find out where these people gonna reach. So you will stay with the film and you will follow it. To be honest the atmosphere remains bothering, torturing your mind and soul. But you are somehow surprised and you can't just let it go. So surely you will be more satisfied with yourself for choosing this film to watch when the final credits apear with that amaizing soundtrack in comparison to when you were watching the opening scenes with the same soundtrack.
Finally, perhaps this film is a little bit overrated with that 82 position among toprated 250 movies. But no doubt it is a very good, dark but honest movie you should watch. But only once because you can't and I think you don't want to watch it again.

The triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse,"This movie struck me as utterly phony, which was surprising as Aronfsky's prior film, ""Pi,"" was amazing. Never once, from the very beginning, did I believe I was watching anything but specific actors play-acting. Ellen Burtsyn's thick slice of ham cut close to the bone was embarrassing, and her New York ""Jewish"" accent coming in a film released in the year 2000 struck me as outrageous! I mean, are we going back to ""The Goldbergs"" and 1950?The whole film struck me as ersatz, artificial -- it had this 1950 junkie sensibility of Selby grafted onto this ""hip hop"" style that was simply jarring. The screenplay, which was co-written with Selby, was so predictable I began amusing the woman I was watching the film with by actually giving her the next line. I was right too often for comfort. The massacre during the dope dealing sequence in the back of the supermarket not only was telegraphed far ahead, but was incredibly STUPID. I did not believe the scene for a minute. Is it supposed to be a dream? I ask that as it has NO LOGIC.Perhaps the biggest problem were the two leads -- Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. While their acting was quite good, they looked like they had deplaned at JFK from Beverly Hills that very morning. Connelly is too good looking for the role (she does not look the part of a junkie; in contrast, Samantha Morton, who granted is a better actress, looks the part of a junkie in ""Jesus's Son""); a woman that looks like Connelly could be a call girl making many thousands of dollars a night, which made her ""descent"" into hell ridiculous. What is the problem with her character: she's just plain stupid?Leto looks like a male model. (There used to be an old joke when I was a kid: Funny, it don't look Jewish. Leto, whose character I assume is at least half Jewish, looks as pure Irish as Connelly; in fact, they look enough alike to be brother and sister, which I'm sure was intentional but which was downright weird.)The ending, the denouement of the three main characters' stories, was so over-the-top that my friend and I began laughing out loud. (I will say, Burstyn was excellent during the harrowing scene of the force feeding. The look on her face of pain, humiliation and resignation was haunting -- a great moment in screen acting.) Just intercutting two of the stories, son and mother, would have been enough, but the sexual imagery and situation of Connelly's character was so evocative of a throwing everything in but the kitchen sink mentality, we just couldn't stop howling. I mean -- COME ON! I'm chuckling right now thinking of the scene. It certainly dissipated the power of the son's horror (though not that of Burstyn, due to the great control she displayed in her acting; perhaps Aronfsky should learn the value of SUBTLTY from that part of her performance).I think people were wowed by the directoral pyrotechnics, but frankly, this film's triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brutally disturbing masterpiece; true life story of the lives of addicts.,"Its been two hours since I saw this movie, and I'm still having trouble concentrating or just being able to type. This movie is very powerful,& difficult to watch, but it does hit the nail on the head with its poignant and pathetic portrayal of four very lost souls searching for a happy life. Ellen Burstyn's performance is of Academy Award caliber. I'll be looking for her name this year for Best Actress. She is phenomenal! My heart broke for her.  All performances were masterful,intense, and believable. This movie is not for the squeamish. It deals with real life situations of these four people that makes it sometimes hard to watch, but at the same time cinematically brilliant. Thought provoking and depressingly disturbing when it goes to places that you know exist, but do not have to deal with, unless your old and alone with no one in your life, or a  lost teenage heroine addict in N.Y.

Not for the faint-hearted!,"Darren Aronofsky is one of the craziest filmmakers working today. His latest film, mother!, was crazy but Requiem for a Dream was on another level.Requiem for a Dream follows four characters and the effect their drug addiction has on their physical and mental state.When the credits started rolling, I was in a state of shock and horror. I don't think a movie has left me feeling so disturbed. I breathed a sigh of relief as this film gives an experience that's completely anxiety inducing. This is most certainly a film NOT for the faint-hearted.The way Aronofsky handles this film is perfection. We start with each character at the best point of their life and then see their addiction slowly spiral out of control over the course of the runtime makes the film engaging from start to finish and shows Aronofsky as a master of build up. The camerawork and editing is very stylish and fast paced, not allowing you to take a breather at any given moment. The quick edits and close-ups puts the audience into the state of mind of each character creating a more terrifying and immersive experience. The soundtrack is also great. It's filled with music that's ominous which fits the tone perfectly.What makes the film even more horrifying are the fantastic actors on-screen. Jennifer Connelly delivers a solid performance for a role that requires a lot from her and Jared Leto proves to me he's a capable actor with a powerhouse performance here. Marlon Wayans really surprised me as I'm used to seeing him in comedies and I wish he would take on more serious roles as this film shows his talent. However, the winning performance here was done by the excellent Ellen Burstyn. Especially for her age, her role was very challenging and demanding and she gave the performance of a lifetime here. It's sad she didn't win an Oscar for it.If there's ever a film that deters you from taking drugs, it's Requiem for a Dream.

Dreams turn to nightmares in this tale of four Coney Island residents troubled by addiction,"In the summer four residents of Coney Island dream of better times. Widow Sara Goldfarb spends her days watching self-help programmes on television; then one day she gets a phone call inviting her to be on a show... she is determined to go on wearing her favourite red dress. Unfortunately she is a little too large for it; dieting doesn't work so she turns to pills. Her son Harry and his friend Tyrone are regular drug users who have a plan to fund their habit and raise money for a better life by turning to dealing... all goes well till their supply is shut off. Harry's girlfriend Marion is also using and resorts to prostituting herself to get her fix.It must be stated that this film isn't easy viewing; in the opening scene we see Harry taking his mother's television to pay for a fix. Then, even as things are getting better for him, we see his mother drawn into a different but no less dangerous addiction... prescribed by a doctor. As summer turns to autumn things get much grimmer and one wonders just how bad things will get... and it gets worse. Director Darren Aronofsky's use of rapid cuts captures the manic urgency of the addicts' lives. The cast is impressive; in particular the four leads; Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb; Jared Leto as Harry; Jennifer Connelly as Marion and Marlon Wayans as Tyrone.

A Harrowing wake up call,"As the credits rolled and the hauntingly intense score of Clint Mansell reverberated in my ears, I sat there in stunned silence, my mind grappling with the visceral impact of Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream."" This cinematic masterpiece, released over two decades ago, is a raw and unflinching exploration of addiction that left me both emotionally shaken and deeply reflective. In the aftermath of this harrowing journey into the abyss of substance abuse, I found an unexpected source of motivation to steer clear of the perilous path of drugs.""Requiem for a Dream"" presents a stark portrayal of addiction through the intertwined lives of four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn). The film follows their descent into the chaotic and destructive world of drug abuse, depicting the harrowing consequences that spiral out of control with relentless momentum.The film's unflinching realism is a testament to Aronofsky's directorial prowess. From the pulsating visuals to the tight editing, every frame serves as a stark reminder of the corrosive power of addiction. The characters' struggles become a reflection of the broader societal issues surrounding substance abuse, providing a chilling snapshot of the cyclical nature of addiction and its pervasive impact on individuals and their relationships.What struck me most profoundly was the film's ability to evoke empathy and compassion for the characters despite their flawed decisions. As I witnessed their dreams crumble and their lives unravel, I felt a profound connection to the very human vulnerability that underlies the destructive lure of drugs. The characters weren't just cautionary tales; they were complex individuals with dreams, desires, and ultimately, a desperate need for escape from the harsh realities of their lives.Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sara Goldfarb is nothing short of a tour de force. As her character succumbs to the seductive promises of a weight-loss television show and amphetamines, Burstyn captures the devastating toll that addiction takes on both the mind and body. The haunting transformation of Sara from a hopeful dreamer to a shell of her former self serves as a poignant metaphor for the destructive allure of substances.The film's powerful impact lies not only in its portrayal of the downward spiral but also in its portrayal of the brief moments of euphoria that keep the characters ensnared in the web of addiction. The rapid-fire editing, coupled with Clint Mansell's haunting soundtrack, creates an immersive experience that pulls the audience into the characters' highs and lows. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that left me breathless and contemplative.As the final credits rolled, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of gratitude. ""Requiem for a Dream"" didn't just shock me into submission; it served as a powerful reminder of the preciousness of life and the importance of steering clear of the self-destructive allure of drugs. The film illuminated the destructive consequences that can befall even the most well-intentioned individuals when they succumb to the tempting escape offered by substances.In conclusion, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a cinematic tour de force that transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling. It's an unapologetic exploration of the dark underbelly of addiction, leaving an indelible mark on anyone brave enough to witness its brutal honesty. As I sit here, haunted by the images and emotions the film evoked, I am profoundly grateful for the wake-up call it provided. ""Requiem for a Dream"" isn't just a movie; it's a visceral experience that has motivated me to stay resolute in my commitment to a life free from the destructive grip of drugs.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Powerful film, but not an ""enjoyable"" movie","As the credits rolled and I thought about what to say here, my first thoughts were that ""this was almost as much an expose' or a documentary than it was a feature film."" Obviously it's fiction, but it so hauntingly captures the brutality of drug addiction in EVERY unsavory aspect, that it's almost a beautifully produced 2 hour ""just say no"" public service announcement designed to scare you straight. This movie is hardcore and not for the faint of heart.It's stark and riveting with crazy real characters & situations and crackling dialogue that takes you right into the lives of four tortured souls. It's power and message on the evils of drug abuse is a baseball bat to the face, and the four leads are incredible in their depictions of the euphoric highs and catastrophic lows of addiction. It's truly worth seeing, but be warned... you will respect and appreciate the story and the efforts by all involved... but you will potentially not ""like"" the movie. Buckle in and prepare to be stunned.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Did Project D.A.R.E. sponsor this crap?,"I cannot believe the high ratings this movie has gotten. This is one of the most superficial and one-dimensional films I have ever seen. I grant you that Ellen Burstyn did a fine job, but what about the rest of the story? It seemed to me to be something Nancy Reagan might have written and produced. The seeming demise of Harry and Marion at the end showed how little the actors and Aronofsky know about the descent into drug addiction.What was really disappointing was that although Aronofsky demonstrated interesting techniques in ""Pi,"" he never really developed them in this film.I don't understand why everyone was so deeply affected by this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
fabulous,"This movie is out of this world. That's the only way to describe it. It was incredible, yet I felt like I wanted to kill myself afterward. It really goes into the depths of some really twisted lives. The cinematography is absolutely unbeatable and really adds to an otherwise seemingly boring movie. I have nothing but good things to say about this flick except that you should really only see it if you need feelings of depression to compliment your already low-on-life attitude. Jared Leto actually did a wonderful job as the lead, and of course Ellen Burstyn stole the show. As a first time viewer of the movie with a friend of mine, my friend commented that she thought it was such a great movie, but could never watch it again. It's understandable. People that own this movie should really be questioned as border-line depressed or addicts. This movie can really be used in different contexts.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Essential viewing,"I first saw this when it was released on DVD when i worked at a video store and i recommended to as many people as i could. A few were amazed and many were shocked.But thats what i love in a film,something moving,gritty,shocking,grimy,confronting,and just plain different from the rest of the garbage out there. I know this has been said but the academy should be very ashamed for not awarding Ellen Burstyn HER Oscar. She was robbed. I only started watching them again this year to see Scorsese receive HIS statues (at last). Burstyns performance was just so heart wrenching I'm still amazed 7yrs later. Jared Leto showed us that he can really act, Jennifer Connelly (when she picks the right roles) can knocked you out and does so here and Marlon Wayons turns out a star making dramatic performance. Christopher Macdonald also deserves a big mention as Tappy Tibbons who i read that a lot of his lines were improvised. Nothing else to say but go watch it!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Divisive,"I have not read the novel upon that this is based upon. This has gotten very mixed reactions... is it almost criminally engaging and effective, or is it MTV-type manipulative drivel? I have to admit, I can't ignore the craftsmanship of this movie, so if you must place me in a booth, I'd be in the former of those two. The stylization is incredible and fitting. Editing and cinematography are accused of being gimmicky, with jump-cuts and this utilizing quite a few different angles and the Snorricam, but I disagree... they're part of Aronofsky's cinematic language. Whether he is a genius or a madman is open to debate. This is not easy to watch. It is rather cruel to the audience, and entirely uncompromising. It deals with addiction, in general, not only to drugs. The writing is impeccable, script, plot and dialog alike. All the characters are credible. The acting is amazing, yes, including Marlon Wayans, and Burstyn is, simply put, excellent, and utterly devastating in her performance. This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done. The one complaint that I particularly have is that, for three of the four leads, there is little to no explanation in this for how they came to use narcotics. I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the medium, provided they feel they have the nerves for it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Excellent movie! Very emotional.,"I have always heard about requiem for a dream from my friends and i found time to watch it and it was so excellent. The woman that plays Jare Leto's mother did an excellent job. all characters portrayed themselves so well. Wonderfully acted, the movie starts out with the mother of Harry played by Jared wanting to go on a diet to be a contestant on a television show so she does on a grapefruit & egg diet which is not working. She goes to a doctor to get diet pills, which eventually make her addicted.Harry and his friend start drug dealing, he needs it to live. Harry's girlfriend and him live together. They become desperate so Marion (Jared's gf) starts to sell herself for money.Their lives spiral out of control, and it's an emotional thing to watch. It really hits you in the heart, and tells you a thing about drugs and addiction. It makes you think and brings you on an emotional ride the whole movie.Excellent photography and visual elements. Sound effects were 'Realistic' sounding. I can't explain it.I think it is my all time favorite movie. Very well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Powerful tell-all film,"Well the title says it all doesn't it, this movie certainly was a Requiem for a Dream. What a brutal, tell-all film that does not hold back on anything. This film focuses on the issue of Drug addiction, and how something that started out as a small addiction can lead to catastrophic events beyond belief. Throughout the movie I was thinking: ""by the end of this film I am going to be in shock"", but to be honest I was not as shocked or in disbelief as much as I thought I would be. But I think this is due to the fact that these days we have been subjected to so much knowledge about drug addiction and we see so much of it that I guess we have become desensitized to the issue since the movie was made (2000). Overall it was a very well made film with some really interesting camera and editing techniques that you do not see used that much anymore. The acting was amazing; Ellen Burstyn who played Sara Goldfarb was absolutely brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was astonishing as Marion Silver, My god that would have been a hard role to play but wow did she pull it off, and quite fantastically I might add. This film is definitely not for the weak at heart and it will leave you thinking and somewhat shocked long after you have turned it off. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A devastating film with exceptional editing and score to drive its impact home,"Requiem for a Dream is the first movie I've ever watched that truly felt like it took a toll on me - that it was truly a hard watch. It is a sad movie, and one that is heavily stylized, which normally I dislike. Here, I think the style amplifies the substance of the film, as Aronofsky uses aggressive editing, warped perspectives, and a propulsive score to highlight the way addiction and desperation accelerate for all the characters throughout the film. This is a narrowly focused film with a clear idea and direction. Each of the four main characters feels they have to get ahead, each for their own reasons, and in their desperation they turn to things they don't truly understand. In this case, drugs are what end up bringing them down, but the film is focused on a much broader idea of consumerism and the constant pressure people feel to be succeeding, to mean something. Harry didn't have to be so aggressive in securing drug suppliers, but he pushed and put them all at jeopardy and coped by becoming addicted. Ellen Burstyn is exceptional as the lead, especially in her monologue about how she feels she has nothing to live for and is yearning for her younger days when she felt a sense of purpose. When she gets a glimmer of hope, that she could be on TV and wear the red dress of her youth, she turns to pills she doesn't understand. The story is nothing remarkable, but it is an unflinching look at people falling deep into a rabbit hole, looking for a quick solution to get them out of it, and falling even deeper. What makes Requiem an exceptional movie is its technical elements. Requiem is a showcase of the power of cinema. The score is fantastic and has a manic energy balancing the hope and desperation the characters feel. The directing and editing is brilliant in showing how the four characters each have their own unique troubles and reasons, but all fall prey to the same general problem. We've seen spirals into drug addiction and losing control before, but it's well done in showing what each character is dreaming of and how they fall, and I haven't seen such a stylistically apt rendering of the phenomenon. Hats off to Aronofsky, because the technical elements accentuate the film's themes perfectly.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A complete waste of time disguised as ""art""","Following up his pseudo-intellectual claptrap ""Pi"", Aronofsky gives us another example of his inability to direct anything other than an hour and a half long music video. And a poor one at that. Any comparisons to ""A Clockwork Orange"" are completely off the mark. While I'm no fan of that movie, either, I'll admit that Kubrick had talent.Basically, rather like some other inexplicably popular movies, such as ""Boogie Nights"", this movie is akin to being stuck in a room full of crackheads for two hours, and we're supposed to find it not only interesting, but tragic. Sorry, but no go.

Cocaine Pi,"There is already a glut of films on drug addiction. Filmmakers love this subject just as actors love to play mentally handicapped characters. In a comment on one of them, I plan to provide a survey of this and how addiction of the subject feeds the addiction it depicts. But not here, because what is interesting about this film is not that Aronofsky started with a notion of a world and might have successfully portrayed it. Rather the interesting thing is that he has a particular style of film-making that seems inflexible, and his problem is to find that one subject that is apt for the style.Consider Terry Gilliam, the visual pythonista. He's very talented in creating quirky worlds with odd juxtapositions of props and sets. And he understands self-reference, the type found in British humor. But his overall sense of profundity is thin, and his mastery of narrative immature. So while his films are interesting in the sense that unlikely accidents attract attention, they are generally disappointing and messy. That is, until 'Fear and Loathing.' That's because the drugged mind is precisely composed of odd juxtapositions and weak profundities. And Gilliam's sense of self-reference (aided by Depp) is able to combine his condition with Hunter's. It works; it works well.Now turn to Aronofsky. He comes from a different visual tradition, one where slicing and dicing is the rule. Its not so much what the camera sees but how it sees it that is important. His first product: 'Pi,' was a spectacular mess. That's because he assumed that mathematically induced hallucinations were something drug-like, and that mathematics was arithmetic, and that the connection between mystical cosmologies and axiomatic dissonance was something simple. No one noticed the lemonade-stand approach, because there may only be a couple dozen people alive who know uncontrolled mathematical visual worlds, and there is scant literature on this to be found.Here, he turns to something that everyone thinks they know: simple erosion of the mind and will from drugs. Here, his cinematic approach is more apt. He shuffles, he jiggles and follows, he splits, he injects a repeating snap when the character does. Burstyn does an Emily Watson and completely bares her pathetic soul, and we are shocked at the supposed cost to her personally. The camera does succeed in intensifying the documentary feel, so the blur between character and actor is increased.So both Aronofsky and Gilliam have now produced, with the aid of talented performers, the one decent film their styles can accommodate unless they mature. What then? Well, in Aronofsky's case, it could be to develop the other thing he has done here -- he has created a somewhat masterful narrative of frustrated dreams. Personally, I prefer the understatement of 'Stranger than Paradise,' to the continual beating of the obvious we have here. But the self-referential notion of the fabricated TeeVee image defining this woman's hopes, mirrored by the similarly fabricated Movee image defining (not merely reporting) the loss of those hopes shows a promising narrative mastery.Let's hope he works on that for a few films and takes the Ridley Scott approach to growth on the cinematic side: do stuff you don't understand and develop the ability to adapt the vision to the narrative, not the other around. Not the other way around.",,Anonymous,Drama

Disturbing Movie that will make you never touch drugs,"I've never used drugs in my life but this movie truly makes a great effort in showing what drugs can do to people regarding physical, psychological and behavioural aspects.I just finished watching this movie and Oh My God is it disturbing, where you really feel the torment of heavy drug addiction and how it controls the users body. What the characters do in order to get their drugs just makes you sick, sad and disturbed all at the same time.The movie is all about feelings and emotions of the viewer. With sound effects, music and surreal settings you are put in a disturbing mood from the start which also changes and escalates throughout the film - Really Brilliant way of getting the audience not just watch, but also feel the agony of the main characters. I also liked how the drug addiction starts with some ""good times"" where they enjoyed getting high, ending up with desperation and having to do literally anything to get the necessary drugs just to not shake from abstinence.This is the first performance I've seen with Marlon Wayans where he's not in a comedy and man is he good! Most actors a great, especially Ellen Burstyn.This is my first view now in 2019 and I do feel that there are some flaws. Jared Leto is good but some of his lines felt forced like the repeated phrases ""Ma!"" and ""...for Chrissakes!"" which is too bad. The style of the movie reminded me of the TV show ""24"" which is also an early 2000's work which for me feels a bit out dated.

It's hard film to watch...but it also lacks much of a reason to.The story, if you want to call it that, starts and finishes at the same point. There is no beginning, middle or end...it's just a sequence (though a terrifying one at that).For a film to take itself as seriously as this one does, a viewer should...no wait, NEEDS to care about the characters. For me, at no point did I feel much sympathy or care about any of them, with the exception of maybe the mother.Despite my frustrations with the script, it is well acted. It's gritty and certainly conveys the despair and dark underworld of addiction. But again, without any sort of arc, I never felt sucked into it and was really expecting some sort of payoff, which never occurred.The editing is certainly unique and worth showing to film students.

Requiem for a Dream studies the various types of addictions in life,"This cult film got recognized and reached mainstream success thanks to great performances from Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly. It is a very controversial movie which deals with drug addiction in a very crude and realistic manner. The director was not afraid of tackling the issue of drug addiction and presenting it in a raw manner. The different kinds of addictions are addressed as you have a lot of sniffing, injecting, and coke dealing on the one hand, and medical prescript weight pills on the other hand so the different kind of addictions are addressed here and yes the medical drug pills are considered as equally addictive and harmful as the rest. At the end they both can have devastating results and the director tackles these issues. The film is very original and has several interesting filming sequences which just add to the overall mood of the movie giving it a more realistic and crude vision as do the dream sequences and hallucinations. At first it might seem as the movie is going nowhere if not paid attention too but at the end every sequence adds up to the mood of the film creating a crude and real film sending out a mirror message of the effects that drug addiction has. The movie succeeds in that the viewer experiences the hallucinations and the effects of the drugs and it pulls us in to a world many of us perhaps never have experienced.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Requiem For a Dream - A Review,"It takes a considerable degree of cinematic madness to venture to make a movie like Requiem for a Dream. The reckless psychological thriller by Darren Aronofsky stands tall and bold in its title of the 9th most disturbing movie of all time according to esteemed sources. Only having been the director of Pi before Requiem, it seems to have been a leap for Aronofsky to take up a project about dark subjects like those the movie reeks of.
Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) receives a crank call about having won a spot on one of the electrifying commercials and lucky draw shows she obsesses over out of fascination. Being the spick-and-span old lady she is, she unknowingly begins speed pills to lose weight and struggle into her favourite red dress. Meanwhile her son, a spoiled junkie called Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), opens a drug business with his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) to help his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) set up her own boutique. The three miserable youngsters and Sara slip into grave miseries and ricochet into the darkest mirage of their dreams in a requiem that plays its purpose effectively.
There is not one performance in the movie that fails to compete with the other three. Leto and Connelly are perfectly successful in their chemistry and tragedy. Burstyn takes up a terrific makeover since her The Exorcist role years ago and her performance never lets you get comfortable in your seat.
Aronofsky and his hip-hop montage are amusing portrayals of the movie's disturbing theme. The exactitude of the pressure created by Hubert Selby Jr (also the author of the novel of that inspired the film) and Aronofsky's screenplay and Clint Mansell's music and Matthew Libatique's cinematography are what keep you interested enough till the movie takes a deep dark drift. A drift which will make every conversation about drug films excluding Requiem for a Dream incomplete.
Here is a movie so unabashed, so heavy, I say it should be a lesson to all those teenagers looking to experiment. Because it explores the dark side of the dark world. Because it tells you how you face the music after the fun. How letting lose into an addiction can cost you your freedom, body, mind and soul.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Superb, a true modern masterpiece","When I decided to start my DVD collection, I decided it had to be composed by only the best available titles.  I did not want to fill my cases with summer blockbusters which lacked storylines, but wasted special effects. I wanted true filmmaking, preferably independent.  We all know that Hollywood has their stars and their money, but most of their movies lack everything a real movie should have.  Someone recommended Requiem for a Dream, so I read reviews about it here on IMDB.  I proceeded to purchase it and view it with some of my friends.  We were absolutely impressed.The story is so strong it leaves deep marks in those who view it.  Hubert Selby Jr. wrote a great novel, and he and Aronofsky did a terrific job in turning it into a screenplay.  The decadence of human beings of different ages, races and sex is true in everyday life, and the movie does not hide it.  It is strong and is shown as it should be.The performances are brilliant.  Ellen Burstyn gives her best with the role of Sara Goldfarb.  Jennifer Connelly, besides her beauty, portrays a perfect Marion, who takes advantage of that beauty in pursuit of a dream.  Jared Leto and Mr. Wayans do not fall behind, not to mention Christopher MacDonald as Tappy Tibbons.  Their interaction onscreen is absolutely marvelous and they never let the story fall apart, unlike the lives of the characters they play.The music is great.  Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet provide a solid musical background in every scene.  The soundtrack is so good everybody I know comments about it and some, including myself, have it constantly playing in our computers.  It is strong, it is suspenseful, it is brilliant.The directing by Aronofsky is excellent.  I saw Pi after seeing Requiem and I was impressed by how much this director can put into a movie with so little experience, but not little talent.  It is directors like these what films need, not greedy producers who want to make money out of the dumbest ideas.  Filmmaking should be an art, not a business.  Picasso didn't paint or sculpt to live in riches.  Neither did Beethoven or Mozart when they composed their symphonies.  As a matter of fact, most of them lived rather normal lives, contrasting with the opulency of those who now buy their belongings or works at auctions.  Thank you, Mr Aronofsky, for being a true artist.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brash and up-front depiction of an array of people and their connecting with varying forms of drugs; an ambitious piece which works really well.,"One of the more terrifying things about Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is how numerous extras appear to just 'exist' amidst proceedings and merely get on with their own lives, fleetingly mentioning the odd happening from recent times, as they intermingle with the film's core characters whom are witnessing their own existences fall apart at their very seams. Watching these people going about their business on screen reminds us of the same way those figures, or people, in our nightmares mingle around in the background as we dream on; we're aware of them, much like the central characters are aware of them here, but we cannot really make them out nor indeed really work out what it is they're saying or plotting. Often, we feel at the mercy of them; we pray that they're not speaking or plotting against us. Such are the situations the numerous leads, in this rather eye-opening urban drama that does carry an hallucinogenic, nightmarish quality, eventually come to bury themselves in; a sad, sorrowful film depicting the gradual falling away from reality of a number of people because of drugs or drug addiction in varying forms as well as falsified dream chasing.What is most admirable about the film is the manner in which how, the now somewhat renowned American director, Darren Aronofsky manages to take an idea one might surmise with a one-sentence pitch and manages to spin a tale out of it all that's cinematic and with a distinct, applied aesthetic which engages without ever glorifying and never at once feels like a lecture. The film revolves around a handful of disparate New York-based characters, their tales running parallel in a multi stranded fashion with their coming into contact with drugs, or the drug trade in some form, making up the meat of film's core. It is, much like 1996's Trainspotting, a smart and cunning drama applying a post-modern spin to what might constitute as what the British used to refer to as 'kitchen sink drama' in its depiction of predominantly young, attractive people destroying their lives through the lust for a drug fix. In this sense, Aronofsky has made a 'whizz-bang' film guaranteed to keep those of a younger disposition in their adult lives occupied whilst tell a tale systematically demonising the activity within, and yet retaining enough intensity for it to appeal to those well beyond the dangers of slipping into drug addiction.Jared Leto plays Harry Goldfarb, a young Brooklyn based man with a penchant for class-A drugs, which his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) additionally shares, and constantly on the look for ways into the narcotics trade operating out of this shady corner of The Big Apple. Living not so far away from Harry is his elderly mother, Sara (Burstyn); a woman living in a decrepit apartment with a flurry of other elderly women, of whom spend most of their time sitting outside in the summer's heat on the pavement, and whose lone item in her flat that's worth any money at all is her television. The things in life to which she holds dear lie in the form of one of her son's school photos, depicting the kid at better and more affluent times, and that television through which she gradually observes herself becoming the newfound star of a kind of reality TV show following a phone call from the network inviting her in.The film dances between the two strands with the sort of consummate ease that would have you think it were were a piece composed by a filmmaker seemingly nearing the height of his game; Marlon Wayans' local lowlife Tyrone Love filtering into proceedings on account of being good friends with Harry and later heading his own story of grief when things reach a hilt. Aronofsky seeps a sense of repugnance through proceedings; a 'sickness in the stomach' feeling; an aesthetic feeding off what can only really be likened to that of the drug-induced, nauseating aesthetic certain American films from the turn of the 1970s, in the form of Easy Rider or Midnight Cowboy, carried with them. There is a gross repetition to some events that unfold which, rather than frustrate the audience, has feel the clammy, grotesque sensation rife throughout. Sara's gradual obsession with weight loss pills and the necessity to essentially look as thin, and therefore ill-mindedly beautiful, as possible dominates her story; the film, as it depicts her seemingly withering away to a desired size, rears the other way in its depiction of her surroundings by gradually bulking out her apartment into this medieval chamber of filth and mould – a locale in which she looses her mind; hallucinates inanimate objects coming alive and suffers premature proleptic shifts to stardom plus the conclusion of this celebrificated process she desires.Harry is a good looking boy with a good looking girlfriend; both of whom admit they love one another very much and we sense in an alternate world, they'd be able to settle down away form all this. Their brief, gentle early embrace is a hundred-times more erotic than the depths toward which young Marion will have to later plunge for her drug 'fix'. Then there is Tyrone's path formulating out of the events, a strand more akin to being a gangster film or drugs trade thriller which might have made a fascinating short all by itself. The film, in spite of being driven by a very simple message or core thesis, is constructed around the incorrect use of lens' deliberately done so to induce sickness; excruciatingly low camera angles and cinematography encompassing good uses of extreme close ups of objects that aren't nasty to look at, but evoke reactions of disgust anyway. The film is a hardened and substantial peek into the crevasses of drug addiction merging uneasily with mental illness; a peek that is studiously executed in what is a highly effective drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Not as good as everyone thinks,"I know I'm in the minority on this, but I found this movie to be more hype than content. This to me, is a classic example that just because a movie ultra-realistically depicts the ups and downs of addiction, doesn't make it good. The acting is fantastic, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, who in my opinion gives the best performance of his young career, but at times, especially the end, this movie seems to get morbid just for shock value. I find myself not rooting for the character, but just waiting for it to end. While it realistically shows the lives of four people, all reaching out for their dreams, there is really no hope that they'll succeed, they all seems doomed to failure from the beginning, and redemption seems to be nowhere in sight.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Beautifully Shot Film With A Harrowing Subject Matter,"I had already seen - and loved - Aronofsky's debut film PI (1998), and so I went into this with high expectations. The film managed to exceed them by far; it's a masterpiece that manages that rare feat where the impact of the dead serious subject matter (substance abuse) is enhanced, not subverted, by the director's choice to offer a truly cinematic, stylish and visually exciting experience. A sad, beautiful work of art that features a career-best performance by Ellen Burstyn; an uncompromising - and often shockingly graphic - depiction of a downwards spiral that leaves no viewer unaffected.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A harrowing depiction of the addiction process,"Requiem for a Dream, the latest film from Darren Aronofsky, the acclaimed director of 1998's Pi, can be described with a word that is not often used in conjunction with today's film offerings - that is, groundbreaking.Aronofsky, a meticulous director, uses distinctively innovative techniques to set the tone and convey the themes within this dark, beautiful, complex depiction of the nature of addiction. Aronofsky makes use of split screens, revolving cameras, extreme close-up, distorted angles, blasting sound, and repetitive symbols, all in an effort to convey the actual experience of the substance user under the influence. The film is a visceral experience, unrelenting in its portrayal of each character's descent into their own personal abyss.The film focuses on three main characters: the Jewish mother from Brooklyn, Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, the son, Harry, played by Jared Leto, and the girlfriend, Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. Mom is addicted first to television, and as a result of a proposed appearance on her favorite show, decides to lose weight with the aid of diet drugs, prescribed by an unethical physician. Harry and Marion are fond of heroin, but they will settle for something amphetamine in a pinch. All three start out as casual users, but as they persist with their addictions, each character's environment deteriorates and they all sink deeper into unreality. Aronofsky portrays this by having the characters interact with each other in a relatively normal way at first, focusing on the familial relationship between mother and son, and the romantic one between Harry and Marion.The early scenes are brightly lit and pleasant to watch, with many shots of the gorgeous Leto and Connelly lying head-to-head, looking remarkably alike, awash in drugs and love. Even the screen-wide use of the symbols and sounds of drug use seem exhilarating and exciting at first, and it is not until the viewer is bombarded with them relentlessly that they become uncomfortable to watch and hear. Aronofsky splits the film into three parts, subtitled Summer, Fall, and Winter.  The seasons change along with the characters, and as time progresses, the characters split from each other, each advancing more deeply into their own addiction and despair. Their individual descents parallel each other, which Aronofsky represents by quick cutting from one character's current predicament to the others, all the scenes infused with garish colors, murky lighting, and disquieting music. At one point Aronofsky unites the characters by showing the visual similarities between the bloodshot, bruised, and terrified eyes of the mother, the heavily made-up, smeared and bleary eyes of Marion, and the infected, bloody and blackened wound that Harry grows on his inner arm.The performances in this film are very strong, especially from Ellen Burstyn, as a perfectly realized suburban junkie. Her character is really the sympathetic one, caught not in a desire to get high, but just to be a little more attractive. Her plight is the most saddening. Also notable in his role is Marlon Wayans, playing against type in a non-comedic role as Harry's drug buddy.In a conventional drug film, the addict usually dies, as a morality play, or to accomplish some finality for the storyline. Aronofsky refuses to go for the easy way out. The last twenty minutes of this film possess some of the most harrowing footage I have ever seen, and there is no respite for the viewer or the characters.",,Anonymous,Drama

One of the best movies I've seen about drug addiction,"REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a shocking, compelling, and visually stunning film that explores the tragic downward spiral of addiction. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr., the film follows the lives of four people as they descend into a world of drugs and desperation.REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important one. The performances are all excellent, but it is Jared Leto's turn as Harry Goldfarb that stands out. Leto gives a brave and heartbreaking performance as a young man who becomes addicted to heroin and will do anything to get his next fix. Alongside his spiral downwards, Harry's mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn) becomes addicted to diet pills in a desperate attempt to lose weight and be accepted by society. As their addiction grows, both Harry and Sara lose touch with reality and descend into a world of hallucinations and delusion.The film's director, Darren Aronofsky, uses innovative camera work and editing to create a visually arresting film that is as difficult to watch as it is impossible to forget. Aronofsky never shies away from the horrific realities of addiction, and the result is a powerful and tragic film that will leave you reeling.A couple of things to remember if you are going to watch REQUIEM FOR A DREAM: 1) in Australia, the movie is rated R18+ and earns that rating. It contains strong drug use, sex, and nudity. 2) One of the scenes shows Sara (Harry's mother) being treated with Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT). ECT is not performed without anaesthetic nowadays, so the scene is not accurate in terms of modern medical practice. When ECT is applied today, it is given with general anaesthesia and muscle relaxants.This powerful and harrowing film is both difficult to watch and impossible to forget.

You've just been punched in the back of the head.,"It hurts, no?  Thump. It happens again. Two hours later, you've been punched in the back of the head thirty two times. Doesn't hurt so much anymore, does it? This is the failing of Requiem For A Dream.It's an interesting concept, but looks far too clean and stylized to be taken seriously. There could've been many more ways to approach this. And personally, I feel Aronofsky should have chosen a less gimmicky one. By constantly attacking the viewer with ferocious images, Aronofsky defeats his own point. He wants to show you that what's going on is real, but the way he shows you seriously detaches you from the film after a while. He takes several camera and editing techniques that were great in Pi and runs them into the ground. This movie tries to be gritty, but the fancy camera tricks ultimately just propels the cinematic quality way over the point. Give it a try, you might like it, but I personally felt it simply tries too hard to be real and ultimately comes off as fake.",,Anonymous,Drama

Everything just fits here, the road to h*ll for each character just couldn't be portrayed any better. Visuals, acting, plot, message, pace...everything just hit me like a full-speeding freight train! Brutal!It is a horrible, devastating, gruesome to watch. And that's exactly how it should be, cause that's how drugs are! Drugs WILL kill you, and they'll do it slowly, painful and messy. First they'll destroy your brain, then your body and just slowly drag all life out of you. Drugs are most definitely one of the most horrific things on this earth. And still, I couldn't keep my eyes from it. I just had to follow Harry, Sarah, Marion and Tyrones destroyals of themselves, to know the end. It was a very special feeling to be both repulsed and fascinated at the same time.Another thing that fits 110% is the soundtrack. Wow!

un-believable,"first off, this movie is a bit repetitive, which is of course on par with the idea of showing people being addicted. (mother likes her chocolates a bit too much first (later on she turns to diet pills), her son and his friends are into harddrugs of various kinds) and all are constantly on the outlook for more of the same kind. the problem with movies about drug-addicts is that however alien their situation may be to a person watching it, the person still needs to feel compassion or have similar feelings towards them in order for the movie to 'succeed'. alas, no such thing here. the main characters (apart from the great acting mother) all look like the lousy but oh so trendy 'actors' you see in commercials or videoclips (there are plenty of references to both, but i can't think of a single one right now that wasn't a cliché or that wouldn't be beaten senselessly by the overall sublimeness of 'magnolia' or the freshness 'trainspotting' had at the time). so, the movie's protagonists are mostly 20+ year olds with nothing on their hands but trying to score and use drugs (and screwing even that simple given up). the characters just don't come alive for me and the obligatory postmodernistic/ nihilistic/ apocalyptic downward spiral which sets in is boring as hell to watch through even though (or just because) the whole thing is cut up much like a flashy videoclip. obviously so to hide the lack of insight on behalf of the makers (though i have to say here i absolutely loved 'Pi', aranofsky's debut which i rate very highly). the crappy finale was partly stolen from kubrick's overrated 'eyes wide shut' and it almost made me laugh because it was so unbelievably unbelievable to see the various plots develop as they did. on a more positive note, the soundtrack is great though, as was Pi's (nevertheless aphex twin would eat mansell any day of the week, kronos quartet or no, but the soundtrack is without a doubt the most intriguing facet to this otherwise one-dimensional fiasco) - go see terry gilliam's 'fear and loathing in las vegas' instead if you want a 'bad trip'. at least gilliam doesn't solely rely on clichés or gimmickry and even when he does, it always shows somehow that he doesn't take himself too seriously or that he uses the right amount of irony / cynicism, something mr aranofsky obviously has yet to master).",3.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Disturbing Masterpiece,"While watching Aronofsky's uncompromisingly bleak journey into the downward spiral of four individuals living in Brooklyn, I couldn't help but think of the famous Nine Inch Nails tune Hurt.The lines, ""The needle tears a hole, The old familiar sting, Try to kill it all away, But I remember everything"", bring to mind Harry's (Leto), one of our protagonists, heroin addiction.In a way both Hurt and Requiem for a Dream (RFAD) deal with similar themes regarding individuals engaging in self-harming activities (in this case, drug use) as a means to escape their empty lives.This isn't to imply that RFAD is just a simple anti-drug PSA because while the four main characters such as the aforementioned Harry, his grandmother Sara (Burnstyn), his girlfriend (Marion) and his friend Tyrone (Wayans) are each addicted to different types of drugs; what truly drives their actions are their obsession with achieving the idealistic American Dream in order to find happiness.RFAD MWWith Sara it's being on TV, with Harry and Sara it's starting their own clothing store, and with Tyrone it's the simple desire to be loved by someone like his mother did when he was a child. Protagonists with obsessions that eventually lead to their downfall is a common theme in Aronofsky's filmography whether it's clinging on to their 80's glory days (The Westler) or perfecting ballet dancing (Black Swan) and RFAD is no exception.Aronofsky has also never been afraid to get weird. Much like David Lynch, Aronofsky uses surrealism and unorthodox film-making techniques as a tool to help externalize the emotions and state of minds of the characters.This is on display with the film's then revolutionary ""hip hop montage"" technique (previously used by Aronofsky in Pi) in which a large number of rapid short cuts are used to illustrate the character's transition from sobriety to intoxication.While there are plenty of crazy camera techniques and visual elements utilized throughout the movie such as body cams shots (Ex. Tyrone running away from a gang hit) and rapid visual distortion to showcase the characters suffering from withdrawal, by far one of my favorite moments is a quiet moment that features Harry and Sara talking face-to-face while lying in bed together.Instead of being in the same shot, both of their faces separated by a split-screen format. Despite saying they love each other, the cold dialogue delivery and the separation by the editing serves to illuminate the hallow-ness of their relationship. Harry and Sara are more in love with the idea of each other if anything else.There are many other tricks being used in order to immerse the audience into the subjective emotions of the characters, none more so than with Sara who as the film progresses experiences more vivid delusions of being on a potentially non-existent game show in addition to increased stress from trying to lose weight. Let's just say you will probably never be more scared by a refrigerator than when watching RFAD.Speaking of Sara, it would be a crime to discuss RFAD without mentioning Burnstyn's magnetic transformative performance. This isn't to minimize everybody else because the acting quality in general is great, heck, even Marlon Wayans (playing against type in his only dramatic role so far) more than holds his own against the likes of Connelly and Leto. If there was any weak link in the cast (if any because once again, everybody is awesome) it would be Leto due to his uneven New York accent in the first half of the film. Despite all the characters having less than admirable qualities, the acting gives each of them a level of believability that works in conjunction with the guerilla-style cinematography to lend an air of authenticity to RFAD.RFAD SaraHowever, seeing Burnstyn going through her transformation from absent-minded white- haired grandmother to a pill-popping anorexic red-haired wreck is both horrifying and an awe-inspiring testament to having dedication to one's craft. Out of all the characters, Sara is the one I had the most sympathy for since she was the most innocent out of anybody. She sincerely cares for her son Harry and wants nothing more than for him to be happy. This is what makes her ""nothing is left for me"" speech to Harry simply heartbreaking. Burnstyn gives some of the best acting I've ever seen because the sadness in her delivery and expressions was so moving that even cinematographer Matthew Libatique broke into tears while shooting the scene.Needless to say, RFAD is far from an uplifting film and is easily up there with Grave of the Fireflies as being one of the saddest films I've ever seen, but it's also a great Greek tragedy-style psychological character study that isn't afraid to show the ugly side of humanity.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Perhaps US raver kids (born after 1980) who have never seen a good film might find this to be ""different"" & ""unusual"", but for anyone that's seen non-US or pre-1980 films, this film is one big bore. It's presentation of drug use is no more complex or realistic than the ""This is your brain on drugs"" PSAs that graced US television sets more than a decade ago. If you're into stream-of-consciousness & lots of style in your drug film check out  ""Naked Lunch"", If you're into the drama & humor of it all then check out ""Trainspotting"", or if you need a dose of pessimism & reality then check out ""Drugstore Cowboy"". Hell, even ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" is better than this mess. The acting is awful, especially Ellen Burstyn.  I was never convinced that her over-the-top performance was anything but acting....if you really want to see a food performance from her check out ""The Last Picture Show"".   What irks me most about the film is that its MTV-style quick cuts & soundtrack really mask the fact that there is really nothing to it.   I could have spent the 90 or so minutes I wasted watching it doing something more productive...like my laundry. By far the most boring drug movie I have ever seen.

TIMELESS!,"I promised myself that I was never going to rewatch this movie. After years and years of the easiest promise ever, I succumbed to the temptation to see if it still holds up.This movie deals with drugs abuse in the least exciting and glorifying way possible.If this isn't film as art... then I don't really know what is. It works at every level. As a message about drugs, as we see the self destruction of four lives in a slow and excruciating demonstration of addiction. Also as an experimental film with weird editing and cinematography and a great score.Also at acting, because we watch a clear descend into drug madness and all the changes the personalities of the characters go through as they fall.It might be a bit over the top here and there, but it is mostly grounded.One of the best decisions was not to pay too much attention at the ""fun"" the guys were getting with their hits. They skip the ""fun part"" that 90% of movies about the subject get so enamored to.And with that, Darren Aronofsky created a masterpiece that is a punch in the face to Hollywood usual and glorifying portrayal of drugs... the punch goes also to our stomach.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The most affecting film of all time?,"Requiem for a Dream is not a film I will be watching again.  Not because I didn't find it absoloutely stunning, both visually and psychologically.  I did.  It's because of those reasons that I will not be watching it again.Some films touch you in a way that the standard Hollywood blockbuster yawn-fests can't.  They ground you, force you to take a look at your life, and the lives of others around you.  They show you what is going on in the world, a world which many of us have been protected from all our lives. Requiem for a Dream is one of these rare movies.From the claustrophobic opening sequence, to the horrific finale, the film takes you on a journey that you will never completely recover from.  It shows us the lives of four addicts who want to become something better, but merely become shadows of their former selves.The acting is simply breathtaking.  At times, it feels like you are watching a documentary because of the impressive casts realistic performances.  Jared Leto is fast becoming one of my favourite actors, taking roles which fight against the ordinary.  His Hollywood good looks (thankfully hidden in this film) mean that he could become the new Leo Dicaprio or (God Forbid) Ben Affleck if he wanted to, but his roles in Fight Club, American Psycho and now this show his true acting abilities.Ellen Burstyn is the real revelation, though.  She is absoloutely astounding the gameshow-obsessed mother who wants nothing more than to fit into a little red dress for a TV appearence.  Her scenes with Jared Leto brought a tear to my eye everytime - the two had a real connection.If I have one gripe about this film, it's Aronofsky's complex and much-heralded use of camera angles.  There is no denying that this man is a technical genius, and there are times when these camera shots are genuinely effective.  But most of the time they distract from his amazing cast.  The film works much better when he simply takes a break and lets the superb acting take precedence.Like I said at the start of this review, I will not be watching Requiem for a Dream again.  My one viewing of it is enough to last me a life time.  But everyone from fifteen upwards should be forced to watch this film once, if only to highlight the awful price of addiction.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a disturbing movie,"A very dystopian film about the uses of drugs and how utopian dreams can end up in the dystopia.Darren Aronofsky continues doing movies with strong messages and using the Icarus myth majestically. Showing how the ambition that exceeds limits can sometimes destroy us.We see an amazing performance by all the actors and actresses, especially Ellen Burstyn who takes the madness to a next level. Also, we see one of the films with the best cinematographic edition seeing an amazing work upon cuts and the montage.

A Real Work of Art,"This movie is a perfect example of what film is supposed to be: using the artistic medium to present scenarios you can sympathize with and using those to create emotion in the viewer. I absolutely loved Requiem for a Dream. I think Darren Aronofsky had a lot of balls to portray such a difficult subject matter, and to do so in such a relentless way. I think Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans were absolutely brilliant in this film, all of them playing roles that are a difficult emotional roller coaster to watch, but that you can't ever really take your eyes off of. The score for this film perfectly compliments the tone and gravity of its subject matter, the creative decisions were perfect at every step along the way, and the film always stays true to its intentions, never deviating to shock or surprise its audience.All of that being said, I'll never watch this movie again. I can't stomach it. From beginning to end it has a gloomy tone to it and, once the story starts to get going (by the 30 min mark), you can pretty much tell where it's going to go. You don't know what the journey to get to that point will look like, but you can easily predict the conclusion. Yet, it's so compellingly written and the characters are portrayed so brilliantly that you can't stop watching and, when everything finally does start to go downhill, no human being capable of love and compassion can watch this film and not feel disturbed and heartbroken by the content being portrayed.It's not for the faint of heart or sensitive viewers; even a desensitized viewer like myself wasn't immune for the emotional punch this film packs.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most powerful movie ever,"After I watched requiem for a dream I immediatley thought it was the most powerful movie i have ever seen.  Before viewing it I didn't think it could get much worse then American history X, but Requiem takes it to a whole other level.  Not only was it the most moving movie ever, but also one of the best.  After the credits rolled i sat on my couch for an hour contemplating the movie.  the next day i went to amazon and ordered the unrated version.  Since then i haven't gone a day without thinking about it. I would reccomend this to everyone not because it's a happy movie, but because you have to see it.  I don't know about showing it in school, it's a lot to handle especially unrated, but what a great message it has.  I don't know who wouldn't think twice before injecting heroin in there arm after watching this.  A great story with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Not only was the acting great, but the directing stood out especially when they take the drugs.  The music at the end also is very moving and powerful.

Jagged little pills,"Anti-drug drama from director Darren Aronofsky and screenwriter Hubert Selby, Jr. was no doubt designed to make an impact on (one assumes) young people--what with reckless lovers Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly and drug buddy Marlon Wayans at the forefront--though it's Ellen Burstyn's performance as an elderly pill-popper trying to lose weight that makes the film worthwhile. One can see right away Aronofsky's attraction to this material: told from each of the four addicts' perspectives, it's one long, brutal spiral downward, climaxing in a fury of sucker-punch editing. Burstyn received the film's only Oscar nomination for her bravura portrayal of Leto's television and weight-obsessed mother from Brooklyn who slowly starts to crack apart from uppers (Leto says to her, ""I can hear you grinding your teeth from over here!""). Not a pleasant experience, but full of showmanship. Aronofsky seems to have learned from the best, pulling a Kubrick-esque barrage of tricks from his cinematic manual to create both a narcotizing and a nervy effect. The lulling, deluded daze these characters fall into isn't romanticized--it's seen as a trap; soon, they're just rats in a maze, filmed by Aronofsky through a fish-eye lens. We get insight into the sickness of drug addiction, but little sympathy--perhaps that's why the film isn't moving on a gut level (Burstyn, for instance, already lives in what looks like lower-middle class hell, and the kids have no direction right from the start). As a case study, the movie does falter due to the content of style over substance; however, as a visceral experience, it's a flamboyant triumph. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Necer seen anything like this.,"Camera lenses used in scenes with mother, the eyefish effect is genius. All the techniques they used to show her feelings, time lapse, slow motion, camera angles and everything they used was so cool and made sense for people watching. The editing is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. Two frames in one, short frames, time lapse, slow motion, visual effects and everything that has anything to do with postproduction was just brilliant. Maybe it made the movie shorter, but it just sucks us into the movie. Haven't seen anything like this before.The sound effect in every scene is on point, they used the most compatable sounds and made it all look and sound really real. Also when we are talking about sounds, music adds so much suspese to the movie. I won't talk about how it is probably one of the best compositions for movie ever, but in my movie experience, l've never heard better. Besides the scenes where music is the main characher, it is also added to some dialogue parts where it adds completely different feeling than if there was none.The acting is so on point, Jared Leto out did himself for this one. He is a brilliant actor, but in this movie you are able to see everything- mad, nevrous, high, happy, sad, in love and he completed every of those roles just perfect. Also, Ellen Burstyn. Lets just take a moment for her acting and her emoniton change. The scene where she has gone crazy shows it all. Her being high, confused, mad, sad, lost every emotion is visible. The director of photography and director made that scene probably the best one in the movie even if it had so many brillant ones.

The Hit,"Requiem for a Dream is a grim, intense, choppy, trippy film about drug abuse. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a frumpy retiree who watches television all day. She wants to fit into her red dress as she believes she will appear in her favourite show and is on diet pills to lose weight.The pills are actually amphetamines and they make her hallucinate.Sara's son Harry (Jared Leto) is a drug addict, he steals from her, he is gaunt from the drugs, his arm ruined by the injections.His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is on a downward spiral. To score, to survive she will have to take part in sex parties, humiliating herself. Their best pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) realise that drug addiction has overtaken their lives and they are heading for the bottom of the barrel.Director Darren Aronofsky is fascinated by the use of the camera and sound. He uses split screens, fast cuts, speeded up editing, flashbacks to show the characters wanting their drugs, then the effect of the hit and later the withdrawal.It is an assault on the senses, it is also a provocative film but I felt that the visual tricks were disguising a thin story.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
What a terrible waste of film,"Requiem for a Dream is a movie that has its heart in the right place, but not much else.  Much has been made of the technical aspects of this film. And some of the technique does impress.  The rampant use of split screen very effectively, quickly, and cleverly underscores the selfishness of characters.  They are literally separated from one another within the film frame.  The repetition of certain elements--the rapid fire images that accompany every hit of heroin taken by the characters--is cool.  Less cool are these crazy point of view shots, lots of odd angles.  Why are they there?  They do not enhance the film in any way.  They are as pretentious and unnecessary as any technical thing in film this year.The other thing about this movie is that I didn't care about most of it. Jared Leto Marlon Wayans and the girlfriend--sorry, can't remember her name--go through all these horrible things.  And we're supposed to sympathize, feel their pain.  Oh, look what drugs have done to those poor creatures.  But look:  these people are junkies and dealers, spoiled brats doing their own thing and paying the price.  As callous as it may seem to say this, they deserve what they get.  But look, here's the other thing. Aronofsky is so heavy handed and obvious about one fact--that these characters WILL BE PUNISHED--that it becomes almost laughable.  I mean, these are cliches that even most hacks would steer clear of.  Simplistic, naive, are the words I would use to describe Mr. Aronofsky's take on this whole thing.He goes so far over the top--and he does this in the other main storyline, involving Ellen Burstyn--that he undercuts the potential power of his own piece.  It becomes a movie of bombast, a trite piece of audience manipulation.  Look at what drugs have done to this person and that person.

Extreme anti-drug sentiment,"Shallow, narrow minded, opinionated and a overall heavy-handed opinion on drugs. Aronosfsky's 'Requiem for a dream' manages to holds our attention with interesting and unique cinematography which is used to paint a subjective experiences of several drug-addicted/influences characters. Unfortunately, this is done in such a extreme anti-drug sentiment that it leans more towards some sort of anti-drug propaganda than true, insightful art.Empty of sub-text and any sort of thought-provocation, Aronosfsky holds our hand through this highly implied story and suggests that if we touch a drug, we could end up having our arms amputated, or working as a prostitute for cash. Was this Aronosfsky's intention? I cannot say - but this is what seemed to be implied in the film. If he had high ambitions for the films overall impact, it certainty fell short. I found this film like Riefenstahl's Nazi-propaganda piece ""Triumph of the will"", great cinematography, masterfully crafted - but it's overall message highly disagreeable.This could have been a great film if the story was handled more carefully without these disgustingly over-the-top vilification of drugs.

"Not emotional, not shocking...not a masterpiece!","This movie promised to be a lot but overall it only disappointed me. This movie promised to be emotional, shocking, confronting, nightmare giving...the greatest anti-drugs movie ever made! It wasn't any of it.There are several problems I had with this movie. The first and biggest was the style. Now, I love Tim Burton movies and I'm a Brian De Palma fan, so normally I like unusual and unique styles, however the visual style of ""Requiem for a Dream"" just didn't do it for me. In my opinion it also didn't do any good to the movie and the story. It made some of the emotional scene's even almost look comical like. I know the style was meant to give the movie a 'trippy' kind of feeling but if you truly want to have a 'trippy' movie experience watch ""Natural Born Killers"" instead.I don't know but the movie also gave me the feeling that the cast and crew didn't really did much if any research on drugs and the effects. They could have had at least spoke to some (ex)-junkies or spend 10 minutes in a room with Courtney Love or sit down all together in an Amsterdam coffeeshop for a day. I don't really know why but the movie didn't gave me the feeling at all that they did any of this. Maybe if they had done this they also wouldn't have had miss cast Jennifer Connelly. I like her as an actress but she is far to pretty and 'normal' like to play a convincing drugs addict.The story was also quite standard and pretty far fetched. I mean, if you're a drugs user this is about the extreme that could happen (but not the worst). I Only really liked the Ellen Burstyn story line. Mainly because Ellen Burstyn self acts wonderful and her character is the only one that doesn't start as an addict and is the most believable and emotionally involving one.That brings me to another I had with the movie. I couldn't feel for the characters.I make it sound like this is an horrible movie which I totally hate. But however this is not the case. There are enough positive things to say about this movie. Such as the hectic ending, that really made up a lot for me and nice little musical score by Clint Mansell was also good. I still have respect for this movie and what it tries to be but for me it overall left simply just a disappointing impression.A bad movie? No! Over-hyped?

A very over-rated disappointment.,"""Requiem..."" tells of the downward spiral of several lives into a drug induced oblivion. A much over-rated non-story which won no major awards, this extrapolation of the ""Pi"" mentality treads more in the the artsy-fartsy fringe than the mainstream offering an excellent performance by Burstyn, over done artistic effects, and little else. There are many better ""druggie"" flicks with real stories to tell which don't make the viewer feel like a lookie-loo at a traffic accident.Because of it's overwrought creativity, which is more of a liability than an asset, ""Requiem..."" is the critic's darling. However, it is too far from the mainstream to be a popular which probably accounts for the small space occupied on Blockbuster's shelves by the new release. Blockbuster -does- know their market. As for the high marks given by IMDB.com users, one can only speculate. However, there's no way this flick could possibly score an 8.7 of 10 (at this writing) given voting by a demographically typical cross-section of the population. Over half the votes a max score of 10....I don't think so.Recommended for those into art for art's sake films and younger adults who haven't seen this kind of kaleidoscopic visual creativity before.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"A unique film, albeit overrated","In an age where drug abuse has become an increasing problem and ""normalized"" throughout much of society, this film's portrayal of addiction and the progressive decline it brings is a refreshing one. The lead actors, especially Burstyn, gave notable performances. I found myself often comparing her character to my own mother, and how I'd hate to ever see the latter fall into the same drug addiction spiral. I sympathized greatly with Connelly's decline, and couldn't help but resent Leto for his active role in that, while at the same time neglecting his mother throughout the film.Those are the good points. The hype for this film may have set my expectations a little too high, however. I personally didn't find it as revolutionary or disturbing as other reviewers made it out to be, with films such as ""Grave of the Fireflies (1988)"" being much more impactful in that regard. An IMDb rating of 8.3 is entering ""masterpiece"" territory... and while it has a powerful message to convey, this is no masterpiece.The constant close-up cuts of ""needle, eyeball, pill, mouth, eyeball, needle, eyeball"" etc. Were intriguing at first, but ultimately overdone. When you consider the average 100-minute film has 600 scene cuts, while this one has 2,000, you get an idea of just how overdone it is. This, along with certain special effects, didn't age well at all, making it (at times) come across as a film made in the late 1970s (and all the cheesy SFX that entails) rather than a film set in the late 1970s.While it's fascinating to watch the train wreck that is these characters' lives reach its climax in the end, the film did go a little over-the-top with certain scenes (e.g. Being violently electrocuted while awake during a simple ECT procedure), but others are much more realistic, such as one drug addict remorselessly prostituting his girlfriend for drug money and a woman being severely degraded in an adult film to feed her drug addiction. The message hits home and I'm sure many viewers can sympathize or even relate to the pain and suffering we see in these characters' lives.7/10 for a film that ended on a powerful note and is even more applicable today than it was over 20 years ago, even if certain aspects of it left something to be desired.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dullest movie ever,"I'll never understand why people are so quick to defend dull and boring movies.I know some like ""art"" movies and this is perfectly normal and acceptable, but to claim that people are ""dumb"" because they find a film dull is snobbish.I'll admit, I knew nothing of this movie when I rented it, so had no expectations or pre-conceptions and yet found myself bored to tears, and my companion was worse. It really is that bad.Some will cry that is movie is a powerful telling of the slow decent into hell that drugs bring, fair enough, but that doesn't make it interesting or good.I mean, there's artistic merit in a movie about paint drying and I'm sure if such a film was released (if not done so already) there would be people on here saying how powerful and beautiful it was and those who disagree are only interested in explosions and flipping cars etc.Truth is, rubbish is rubbish, whether it's peddled as ""action"", ""drama"", or ""art"".Whatever this movie was to you, to me it was hours of my life I won't get back. Dull, boring, pointless.Ah, yes you say, that's the point, cause drugs,,,,, blah blah blah. You can show the loneliness of a sentry guard by having 3 hours of a guy sitting in a shed looking out, pointless, dull, boring, but is it art? Who cares!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
A masterpiece that I might not watch ever again,"A common question that is brought up in film discussions is, ""What is the saddest movie you've ever seen?"" A common movie that is said is Up, Toy Story 3, Marley and Me, and Schindler's List. I have to agree that all of these movies are sad, but not nearly as sad as the movie I will be reviewing today, Requiem For A Dream. I, personally, think this movie is the saddest movie I have ever seen. The only time I saw it was months ago, but it is still fresh on my mind. I get the chills everytime I think about it, heck, I'm getting chills thinking about it right now.I don't want to get into much spoilers, but Requiem For A Dream is about drug addiction. A few people get addicted to various drugs, and it ruins pretty much the rest of their lives. That's all I'm gonna go into in terms of spoilers. The presentation of this movie is in your face, at times it's very fast, and at other times, it wants to make you remember very disturbing scenes. This movie is pretty disturbing as well because drugs are represented as the worst thing that can ever happen to you. The first act wasn't too dramatic, it essentially builds the characters so that you know what they're going through before drug addiction. Then the drugs come in and the movie gets more and more miserable before the third act. The third act is so intense and sad at the same time, it gives me chills typing about it.Jared Leto is one of our protagonists and he is the first character that is introduced in this movie, and his acting is outstanding. Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are also in this movie, and their acting is also really good. Especially Ellen Burstyn's acting, she blew it out of the park and also earned an oscar nomination for her performance. The movie has a low budget esque feel, and it utilizes it so well because the presentation feels dirty and raw, just like many of the things happening in the movie.The famous Lux Aeterna song is in this movie, and I freaking loved it. This movie has impacted me in so many ways, it's probably one of my favorite movies that I will never watch again. It was done so well and I think Darren Aronofsky blew it out of the park with this movie, and I'd give Requiem For A Dream a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
powerful and compelling story of addiction,"the movie was awesome.  aronofsky explores the effects of addiction in an uncaring world.  i do not believe this is a movie about drugs per se.  the drug use, although central to the movie's theme, is only a vehicle for the message about addiction.  i think everyone can identify with this movie because we're a nation of addicts.  caffeine, nicotine, food, love, money, sex... addiction is not limited to illegal drugs.  the movie is just sort of a hypothetical exercise and takes the one theme all the way down to rock bottom. on a side note, i think all that split screen stuff is just a way to show how each character is isolated from each other by addiction- after all, isn't that what addiction does?  and how can i forget... ELLEN BURSTYN ROCKED!  definitely robbed.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A haunting and mesmerizing film,"This is one of the very few films that can leave a person with a lasting impression. Requiem thoroughly encapsulates the horrors of drug addiction with the use of imagery, disturbing incidents, and realistic acting.

The structure of this film is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Disturbing and Enthralling,"There are many reviews of this movie already, and I have not much to add. The film tends to fall into either the 9-10 or 1-2 range based on the reviewer. It's clearly controversial, though I think the high scores make a better case and aligned more closely with my experience. (Many of the low reviews chastise the movie for being apparently unfairly harsh on hard drug use, like a Hollywood version of a D.A.R.E. film, without presenting a more nuanced view of why people begin using drugs in the first place. I think that's an unfair criticism, as the film starts well after most of the characters began using, meaning those reviews are complaining about something that isn't the focus of the movie, at least with respect to most of the characters.)I believe Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that engages in a darkly captivating way where you can't look away even as you know you're watching a tragedy unfold. It's expertly done and powerful, even though it's certainly not a ""fun"" time, much as you might not ""enjoy"" movies like Schindler's List or American History X, though most people readily would recommend them as required viewing. Requiem for a Dream falls into the same category of masterful films that leave a mark on you long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Like Breaking Bad... it just gets worse,"Very disturbing visually as the director seeks to manifest the emotions of characters to the viewer. I appreciate this film direction, writing and acting more than years ago. It summarizes the insanity of drug use and equally foolish choices we make when we have no moral standards, self-discipline, and perseverance to make an honest living. The result is selfish-yet-self-destructive behavior that ruins the lives of others as well. What would America be like if we reset history and made drug use UNcool?",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Shattered Dreams,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is written to scare the hell out of anyone who even thinks of using drugs.Ellen Burstyn was Oscar worthy as Sara, the lonely Jewish mother who passes time by watching TV and talking to the other old Jewish women on her block in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She's important to no one until she receives a mysterious call telling her she's going to be on TV. She finds a red dress that she hasn't worn in years and no longer fits into. She sees her doctor, who prescribes weight-loss stimulants. She quickly becomes addicted to both TV and the pills, begins hallucinating, and eventually suffers full-blown schizophrenia.Jared Leto is Sara's son Harry. His drugs of choice are marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) score and distribute the drugs around the Coney Island-Brighton Beach area. (Wayans is an ironic choice, as he is pro-drug and thinks addiction is something to joke about, as evidenced by his ""Scary Movie."")The incredibly beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is Marion, Harry's girlfriend. She gets hooked almost immediately, and her dire need of future fixes is rough. But her frantic search for drugs around the apartment mid-way through the film is gut-wrenching.My main problem with the movie is this: Am I supposed to feel sorry for these three cokeheads? Because I don't. Unlike Sara, whose ethically challenged doctor prescribed her addictive drugs, they made a conscious decision to use. In a way, they got what they deserved. My other problem is that I did not need the extreme closeups of dilating eyes, popping pills, coke snorts, and nickle bags being zip-locked. The sound effects got really annoying too. I got the hint the first time around; they didn't need to repeat it a dozen times.The end of this film is absolutely brutal. Addiction defeats all of the characters in different ways; they all suffer different fates, all horrible.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Oh, it's ""dope""","This movie is disturbing. It is also great. The two aren't mutually exclusive as most might assume. Everyone in this world has been, or knows someone, affected by drug addiction. As we will continue to see in society, it ravages. Most cliche interpretations of this revolve around young people. Rightfully so. But Requiem's most heartbreaking narrative(imo) comes from the old woman. It truly illuminates how drug addiction affects everyone. With help from one of the most unsettling scores ever created, this movie should be seen. Like going to an HIV ward at a hospital. Or visiting a homeless shelter and speaking with people. So you know it exists. This movie is straight up hard to watch. But do it for yourself. If anything, to remind yourself how good you really have it. But also, to recognize how things can ALWAYS get worse. The only reason why I didn't rate it 10/10 is because it's so unbelievably depressing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"If you're looking for a great date movie, look elsewhere","I just watched Requiem for a Dream at a sneak preview.  Going into the film I had high expectations, but let me just say that the film surpassed all of them.  This film WILL GET TO YOU! Watching the main characters slowly destroy their lives from drugs is not an easy thing to sit through, especially the way it is portrayed on screen.  Anyone who is taking drugs or is even considering taking drugs should view this film.  I know people who are faced with the reality and consequences of drug addition and drug abuse. Sadly, this film accurately portrays the affects.  It is an important film that needs to be seen.The writing, directing and acting is the best.  Even Marlon Waynes brings his acting status to a new level. But when Oscar time rolls around, I don't know how the film will sit well with the voters.  But one thing is for sure, the editing and cinematography should be shoe-ins for nominations as well as Ellen Burstyn's performance!  My God... she HAS TO BE NOMINATED to say the least.  The haunting images and fantastic score will forever be in my mind.After my friends and I left the theatre, no one was talking... we were still absorbing the film.  This film is truly an EXPERIENCE unlike any other. It is shocking, scary and horrifying- several people covered their eyes during scenes. Be careful going into this film and keep an open mind. Remember, it was going to be rated NC-17, but Artisan decided to keep the film as it was and release it as ""Unrated."" This was smart on Artisan's part b/c if the film had been edited down to an R rating, the affect wouldn't have been as great thus the entire point of the film might have been lost. Bravo to the filmmakers and everyone who worked on this film for taking the chance and making an extremely risky film. It is truly in a class of its own.Unless you have no soul, I guarantee it will move you and leave you stunned by the time the end credits roll.  It is a very, very TOUGH film to sit through and IMPOSSIBLE to forget. One of the best films of the year, right next to Almost Famous.  I highly recommend it- with caution.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

When I walked into Requiem I knew nothing about it, only that it was the same director as ""Pi"".  for the next 90 minutes I was locked in my seat, unable to shut my eyes, or even think about nothing except the movie. This movie turned out to be my favorite of all time. It was so powerful, and the message so clear. Honestly I believe it should be shown in every classroom, as it will scare anyone out of the drug culture. It personally frightened me out of any hard drugs. The characters are so loveable and believable that whenever something happens to them you get more and more depressed. The movie ended on such a powerful note. The artistic integrity of the movie was astounding. Filmatography was excellent, and the director couldn't have done a better job.

"Good movie, but be warned","It's a good movie, but it's not for everyone. The reason it's not for everyone is because it's beyond accurate... the actors did a phenomenal job! Thousands of people struggle with drug addiction everyday, and if you have some sort of history with drug addiction, this movie can be overwhelming. The parent guide had severe on each catergory. In my opinion this is more accurate.Sex and Nudity - more than severe
Violence - moderate
Profanity - severe
Alc and drugs - more than severe
Intense scenes - severeEvery second of the entire movie is filled with intense music and sounds that are similar to a horrible comedown or a high filled with anxiety and/or paranoia.Sadly, a movie with many great scenes isn't always enough, this movie could have been so much more. I was able to predict everything that was going to happen, not the ""shock"" value ofc, but things like the outcome of a scene, and even the ending of the movie.

Dreaming for an Audience,"The BeginningHubert Selby Jr. wrote a novel in 1979 about four addicts on a downward spiral entitled Requiem for a Dream.  Working alongside young writer/director Darren Aronofsky (Pi), Selby co-wrote the screenplay based on the novel.  The film is now in select theaters.The MovieRequiem for a Dream follows the life of four characters, (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans, and Ellen Burstyn) connected to one another by family or friendship, trying to live a happy life.  Leto is a young man trying to make a lot of money selling drugs with Wayans in order to start a real business with his girlfriend, Connely.  Burstyn plays the mother of Leto's character and she dreams of being on television and losing the weight she has acquired over the years in order to do so. While Requiem is obviously an anti-drug film, it goes one step further and is more about addictions and self-destructive behaviors.  The characters are trapped in a vicious circle of behaviors that are impossible to escape and only grow deeper as time moves on.  The dreams fall further and further away as they enter a downward drug spiral. When people hear a movie is NC-17, they automatically think of hardcore sex or excessive violence.  And most of the time, they're right.  But Requiem is about the realism that goes along with drug use and addiction and the hopes and dreams that are shattered because of it.  The film should be seen and appreciated for the message it presents.  But because it's NC-17, many people won't even give it a chance.The ReviewAmazingly powerful and poignant. Now, marijuana is one thing.  Folks who say, `drugs aren't that bad, I've smoked weed here and there and I'm fine' don't know a thing about big time drug use.  Watching the characters in this film use hard drugs and then watching as their lives are slowly destroyed is not an easy thing to sit through.  Director Darren Aronofsky makes sure that you don't take it lightly with his quick editing and extreme imagery that is sure to stun. This film truly shows the horrible life that drugs can lead to.  And for you weed aficionados out there, this isn't nearly the same thing. Ellen Burstyn is absolutely remarkable.  I have not seen much of her work but she is top notch here.  This was not a simple role and she was completely convincing as well as touching and diverse.  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connely both shine in their roles.  They share a sweet relationship even through the rough times as drugs lead their lives in terrible directions.  Marlon Wayans was terrific.  After seeing his comedy sketches and Scary Movie, I was unsure he could pull this type of role off but he did it well.  As we hope for all of the characters to pull through, Aronofsky gives us the realistic resolutions that happen in the life of drug users. The cinematography is wonderful as it changes with the seasons in the film and the characters ever darkening lifestyles.  The soundtrack is mesmerizing and perfectly suits the film.  Many argue that the editing of the film is pretentious or down right excessive.  The difference in shots and, most importantly, the drug use scenes are critical parts in the delivery of this film.  See it and you'll know what I mean. Because this film is NC-17, theaters will not allow admittance to anyone under 17, even if the parent is there and approves.  At the age of 22, I got carded trying to see it.  Hell, I had to travel an hour to Denver to see it because conservative Colorado Springs won't show it.  And even in Denver, it was only available in one theater.  There is a big spectacle about young people seeing this.  I would rather it be Unrated or NC-17 than to have seen it cut down to an R rating.  Cutting down this film would take away from the entire point and the true affect would have been lost.  I also think that this movie should be seen by a younger demographic because in many instances, that's where drug use and addiction begins.  Sure, there are many scenes of gratuity and brutal honesty in the depiction of drug use and the surrounding life but that's the point.  And this is the type of film that can stop people from pursuing that type of life.  And instead of turning teenagers off to that type of lifestyle, we're keeping one of the biggest reasons for them to avoid drugs away from them.  But hey, they can always watch flicks like Natural Born Killers, right?  Since we forbid them from seeing a gripping film about drug use, we'll make it up to them by letting them watch all sorts of films filled with sex and violence everywhere else. Bravo. No other film I know of can compare to the reality that Requiem for a Dream portrays and the emotional turmoil surrounding such events. Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, to name a couple, don't even come close.  The film is hard to stomach for many people because the images are definitely disturbing.  But so is drug use.  This film spares nothing in showing the viewer the lengths people will go to in order to feed their addictions and the results that come from it all.",,Anonymous,Drama
Brilliant but very disturbing,"A chronicle of four people (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn) and their drug addictions and what it does to their lives. Starts off OK but becomes darker and more disturbing as it goes along. It ends with a montage showing what happens to all four of them--this sequence contains some of the most harrowing imagery I've ever seen in a film. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see it again--it's that graphic! Still, see the film. Leto is OK; Wayans is (surprisingly) pretty good; Connolly is excellent--I've never liked her until now; and Burstyn is simply superb--a sure Oscar winner if I ever saw one.

"Intense and Haunting, 'Requiem for a Dream'","""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie that I found to be just good. It definitely has its strong points, but I didn't find it to be amazing. The film tells the story of four people whose lives are destroyed by drug addiction. The plot is quite intense and emotionally heavy, and it shows how addiction can ruin lives in a very real and gritty way.The acting is definitely one of the highlights. Ellen Burstyn, in particular, gives an incredible performance as Sara, an older woman who becomes addicted to diet pills. Her portrayal is heartbreaking and really captures the desperation and delusion that come with addiction. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans also deliver solid performances, making their characters feel real and relatable.The cinematography and editing are also noteworthy. Director Darren Aronofsky uses fast cuts, split screens, and other techniques to create a sense of chaos and disorientation, which fits the movie's themes well. The score by Clint Mansell is haunting and adds to the overall mood of the film.However, despite these strengths, there were a few things that didn't quite work for me. The movie is very bleak and doesn't offer much in the way of hope or redemption. While this might be the point, it can make the film hard to watch at times. The relentless focus on the dark side of addiction felt overwhelming and a bit repetitive. Additionally, some of the characters' actions seemed exaggerated, which made it harder to fully connect with them.Overall, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a powerful film with strong performances and striking visuals, but its unrelenting darkness and intense subject matter might not be for everyone. I appreciated its artistic qualities and the message it was trying to convey, but it left me feeling more depressed than moved.

That's something most of us realize, and for those that don't, I don't think Aronofsky's sledgehammer is going to do the trick.

The best of 2000. Period.,"You know Darren Aronofsky is a great director when you see his name above the title in large letters, and it's only his second picture (the first being the excellent Pi).Requiem follows the tale of four people's journey into spiraling into addiction, whether it be food, cocaine, weight-loss pills, etc, etc. The message hear is clear: Addiction can come in any form, any shape or size. But the movie NEVER becomes preachy, and does not hesitate to show graphic images (if you are looking for lots and lots of nudity, you will sorely be disappointed) of the drug's effect, using what Aronofsky appropriately, 'Hip-Hop Montage', which is basically quick images and sounds thrown at the viewer, along with many fast-forward parts, during the drug scenes. All of this style really shouldn't work with the subject matter, and turn it into nothing but an MTV film (cough, The Cell, cough, Hallow Man, cough, cough) and is probably the first serious drama that used so many special effects shots (keep your eye out for the revolutionary 'Snorrie Cam', which is a camera attatched to a person's body part, like the head) but...the whole thing is successful.PlotEllen Burstyn plays an overweight mother who just gets a call to be on a game show. Excited, she tries on her 'red dress', which doesn't fit, and ends up resorting to weight-reduction pills (which are really speed) and the red dress is her source of the addiction, she wants to get in the dress, but the pills have horrible consequences.Then, there are three drug dealers (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly) hoping to make it big on a sale. Their own paths change, for the very worst.The plot's simple, the charcters are four-dimensional. In fact, all four actors probably give their best performances ever, and Burstyn actually deserved that oscar more than Julia Roberts - her character is the most human, and, like the whole cast, totally believable. Marlon, fresh off of Scary Movie, also shows that he is indeed a great actor.The Bad?The whole thing is very dark. Too dark for some. If you are a little squemish, or faint of heart, please avoid this film. You may think, ""Hey, it's just a movie"", but some people have been actually pretty disturbed by its dark nature (It was released to only a few theateres because Artisan knew the NC-17 would give it the flush. It should have been called ""Requiem for a Nightmare"".Overall, if you find it at a store, pick it up (the DVD is especially great) and watch it with a high school student or by yourself or whatever (this is definitely not a date movie), just watch it.

If you want to be blown away by a movie you need to see this. The end completely drained me emotionally, it should easily be higher on IMDb's list. There are drug movies like Blow and Scarface(I love both) and then there is this...in a league of its own. I am yet to see a movie that i can relate it to.The acting was superb, Jared Leto was incredible and completely believable. Ellen Burstyn showed one of the most heartfelt performances I believe I have ever seen. Jennifer Connelly played what I saw as the most mediocre performance of the main characters, but was still so much deeper than most characters you see today. Finally there was Marlon Wayans...He is so talented and showcases himself perfectly in this movie. All in all, this movie had an incredible plot, the camera work fit perfectly, and the cast put forth the best overall performances I can remember. WATCH THIS MOVIE",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Brutally Awesome!!!!!!,"I love this movie. From the underlying theme of addiction to the social commentaries to the sheer beauty of the cinematography. But ultimately, I like movies that force you to either look away or hold on, squirm in your seat and continue absorbing the visual imagery, no matter how beautiful or disturbing. There is rarely a point in this movie when the viewer does not realize that the main characters, although battling different demons are all entering individual downward spirals. Although the uninformed may label this a ""drug"" movie, drugs are only the catalysts which propel the characters into much deeper and interesting battles with their own souls. When I hear the song that plays during the final and most harrowing shots elsewhere, it always brings me back to the imagery of this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Burstyn's performance will haunt you to the last tear jerking scene, possibly the strongest movie ever made","**** Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, Keith David, Louise Lasser. Directed by Darren AronofskyI'll start off by saying that ""Requiem"" is possibly the strongest, saddest and most well acted movie I've ever seen. I wish there were more adjectives for the word ""astonishing"" just so I could have more words to compliment Ellen Burstyn's captivating performance. Never in all of my life of watching movies have I felt so connected with the character study or let alone believe what is being done to these poor people.The four stories of a few patrons in New York city consisting of an ailing, old mother Sara (Burstyn) and her dead beat, junkie son Harry (Leto), his pal Tyrone (Wayans, a surprisingly great performance) and Harry's lover Marion (Connely). When their drug addiction warps into something unimaginable it renders them helpless and scrounging for a way to live through the day with just one more taste of that sweet sweet drug they begin to crave.Hubert Selby is a great writer, he did a well adapted screenplay of his book (which I am still reading). The lines are beautiful, everything down to that look on their faces when the realization of their dreams being crushed apart is there. And what is so shocking, what is so engaging of ""Requiem"" is that it is believable. I even began to care for them, for their lives and the effects on each action.Aronofsky has met his high point, since ""Pi"" wasn't that great, but ""Requiem"" will be the one he'll be remember for. And Marlon Wayans who never astounded me, does a great job his character as well is played perfect. This is by far one of the best ensemble casts in a movie that all work well and function through out since I can remember.And I have never been so outraged as when Burstyn did not win the Academy Award, those people must be out of their f@#&%ng minds to not see the beauty in her performance. This movie will in fact haunt you to the very last frame with Clint Mansell's ""Summer Overture"" playing in the background. Mansell's beautiful sounds add to the effect, making it a perfect tear jerker. And this is part of the very elite list of movies that made me come so close to actually shed tears at the sight and sound of the last scene. So in one word if I had to describe ""Requiem"", that would be REAL.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Deeply Disturbing,"This is probably the most disturbing thing I've ever watched.I felt sick to my stomach watching this film and honestly I think I wish I hadn't watched it. If your goal is to shock yourself into quitting drug abuse, maybe this is a good movie for you. I feel like I need to see a therapist or something after watching this. It really dives into what it looks like to break down a human until they are nothing but a shell.All this being said, it is a movie that made me feel such strong emotions and for that reason I give it a high rating. I can't imagine what the actors had to go through during the filming of this.If you are looking for a very dark, unsettling movie this is it.If not, go out with some friends or family and appreciate your life.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A forgotten movie,"This kind of curiosity behavior insults a great and outstanding movie. It has to be pointed out that in fact, 'Requiem of Dreams' is a forgotten film, which is too outstanding and has a dark theme, leading to its forgetfulness. After careful attention, one day you may discover that it was also listed in IMDB and its ranking can be taken seriously. It has outstanding performances by actors, sharp editing by directors, high-speed switching of images, amazing montage, heart wrenching music, and a heavy theme that modern people should reflect on for a long time.If you want to correct the shortcomings of the film.

Misunderstood Movie,"I think the people criticizing the film for being ""style over substance"" because of the fancy editing have missed the point. The director seems to be using these effects for a purpose, to portray psychological time accurately, and in my opinion he succeeds. By slowing down time in some scenes or by speeding up events, he is showing us how it feels to be his characters, either under the influence of a drug or in a hurry to the next fix.Also notice that he does not hit us all at once with these devices. He starts out slow and gradually builds to the horrifying climax. I am not claustrophobic but I felt that way during the final 15 minutes all because the movie forced me to understand on a psychological level what was happening.",,Anonymous,Drama
A key film for the new generation.,"One of the most influential but somehow underrated movies from the new millennium. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is not an easy watch because it displays the real horrors of drugs and it's consequences. The events of the movie perfectly show what it feels like to be under the influence of a narcotic or any kind of drug (even alcohol). Through it's running time there's a feeling of sadness, desperation, and fear. By any means the director tries to state an opinion towards the use of drugs; the movie only shows what really happens.Anyhow, watching ""Requiem..."" is like being for the first time in a roller coaster because it takes you by surprise and you really feel desperation but you can't stop watching.The acting is perfect, excellent. Ellen Burstyn's performance always manages to send me shivers. Her performance is impressive, breath taking. Jennifer Connelly also delivers a strong performance. She's always great in her roles. Her eyes have many things to say... She can display deep feelings such as desperation, happiness, sadness, and even confusion. Jared Leto surprised me as the desperate junkie who had potential to be someone in life, but he wasted it. He was very good.The direction is from other world. I mean, it's genuinely impressive. The director knows how to transfer the character's feelings to the audience. That's not easy even for a movie that is very dramatic. It also blows away the viewer with bizarre and surreal images that are supposedly caused by drugs. Really, some events in the movie truly show what someone can ""think"" or in this case, hallucinate under the effects of a drug.I can't praise this movie enough and I believe that there are minimal things to spoil. ""Requiem..."" should be watched with regular expectations in order to be 100% shocked and pleased after the ending credits. But don't watch this movie for shocking purposes; I mean, watch it as a serious piece of film making that does not tries to prove anything. The whole viewing experience is an instant impact.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Amazing movie that changed my life,"I viewed this movie while under the influence of many drugs, at a point in my life sometimes I'd rather not remember. This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I knew nothing about the movie before watching it. By the end of the movie I had completely broken down, and was crying miserably. I ended up calling up my parents and some buddies and admitting I had a serious drug problem, thanks to this movie. Since then I've gone clean, and my life has been improving more and more. I think it takes a terribly powerful and amazing movie to bring somebody to this point. I recommend this movie to everybody, and think that movies like this would help people to stay off drugs more than all those anti-drug campaigns you get to see all the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A haunting masterpiece of modern cinema,"Requiem for a Dream was almost six years old before I had a chance to watch it beginning to end. I had seen a few scenes from it on television before, but I'd never seen the entirety until a few days ago. What I thought would just be a standard ""good film"", has turned out to be a merciless, haunting masterpiece, that leaves the viewer changed forever after viewing it.The film is a parallel story. It jumps between Harry's (Jared Leto) story about trying to score enough heroin with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to live out happy lives, and his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) story about her desperate attempts to get onto television. The film chronicles these four individuals, and their ups and downs through the course of three seasons of a year.I have nothing but praise for this compelling and thought provoking film. It may be about junkies, but I'd be lying if I, who has never done hard drugs, said I could not relate to any of the characters. Each is played to perfection by their actor. Wayans performance is a total departure from his usual comedic roles, and is only a joy to watch some real acting chops being showcased by the young actor. Leto continues to impress me, and continues to prove why he'll be a heavy hitter in years to come. Connelly is excellent as always, shining through in a role that came just before her Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind. Burstyn is absolutely fabulous in her role, and clearly overshadows everything that won Julia Roberts her Oscar that year. Every supporting character, from Christopher McDonald's turn as infomercial king Tappy Tibbons to Keith David as the twisted Big Tim, to all the even lesser supporting characters, all are put to screen excellently and only complement the main actors.The writing is an absolute marvel. I cannot even begin to imagine what some of the sequences look like in Selby Jr.'s novel, but I can only come to think of them either being nowhere near as good as those created by Selby Jr and Aronofsky during the creation of the film. Watching some of the features on the DVD only helps to make the viewer feel more aware of all the planning and implementation that went into creating these gorgeous and appealing shots from the film. This is a Generation X film through and through, and the way it has been created only helps to make it more of a marvel six years later.But while the performances are all excellent, it's the style of the film that makes it absolutely unforgettable. Shots are all over the place. From crazy tracking shots, to shots of both characters view points, to the absolutely insane cuts all over the film, it all makes for a fantastic visual pleasure for the eyes. There are a few grainy scenes, but they only make the authenticity of other scenes become that much better. The cinematography and art direction are just astounding. Every piece of digital and normal camera work put into the film is put to the test here, and works magnificently in the final product. Not once does the editing falter, and not once do any of the visual elements not work. They all have been meticulously created to look and feel real, and they work as a result.This is just one of those films you cannot forget, and cannot keep your eyes off of after it starts. It is brilliant in every sense of the word, and deserved more praise than it ever got. The fact that it was nominated and lost its one Best Actress nomination is an absolute travesty. It is a visual treasure, and a true thought provoker. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end, and just cannot believe I waited so long to see it.Don't make the same mistake I did. See it now, before the opportunity evades you.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Absolute Genius.,"Beautiful, artistic, haunting movie about 4 people whose lives and relationships are destroyed bye their drug addictions. There's so much to think about and so much symbology. Not recommended for people who like to have movies ""spoon-fed"" to them. Certainly recommended for people who like more from a movie than just a few laughs or a few scares. Certainly not the sort of movie you forget about.The editing is absolutely beautiful. And note the position each character is lying in for each of their last scenes. I'd love to talk more about the symbology but I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet.Excellently acted. Jared Leto is WAY under-rated. Most likely because he's always linked to some no-talent in Hollywood (eg. Lindsay Lohan).Marlon Wayans also showed that he's a terrific actor. It's a shame he doesn't do more movies like this, because he certainly proved to be a very versatile actor. A few more serious movies and the man would've had an Oscar under his belt by now.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Incredible,"Requiem for a Dream is not a merely a film but a jagged, unrelenting decent into the desperate world of addiction. Shrouded by denial and a longing for fulfillment, the characters in this story feed their vices and insecurities until they are consumed by them. Aronofsky fuses his creative genius (i.e. ""Hip-hop montages"") with Selbey's macabre and emotionally ravaging writing to produce a work of art that brands itself to the minds of its viewers. Augmented with a stunning soundtrack this is the complete package. Inducing empathy and sympathy for people you would usually scorn, this is a shining example of the modern anti-hero. Though at times the imagery is gruesome, this only amplifies the pervasive motif of desperation. In my opinion, it should be required viewing for all high school drug prevention programs.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The director works the audience as if he himself is a drug dealer supplying what they crave.,"It's surprising to see how many people are being duped by the director of this pretentiously and gratuitously violent film.  What the director offers are quick fixes of rapid fire imagery and viciously cut scenes without any need or opportunity for the audience to think hard or deeply about anything. Take,for example, his treatment of the character played by Jennifer Connelly. How is his degradation of that character any different than her debasement by the other men who exploit her for their cruel pleasure? The director consistently keeps his view of her ""objective"" in the literal sense of presenting her as an object -- upon which he projects his own fantasies of how an addicted woman would sell herself. Why doesn't he allow her to have any inner, believable life that could make her more real and make her conflicts more intense? (His objectification of her is so extensive that it feels at the end as if he is one of the men zeroing in on her pain to feed their horrifying pleasure.) Ellen B's character is more fully drawn, but even then, why does the director need multiple shots of electric shock treatment when one shot would show what she is feeling? The answer is that the director knows the fix his audience is seeking.  We say we're appalled, but we can't stop watching what the slick photography and postmodern soundtrack turn into the very kind of media-induced high that his movie supposedly is critiquing. Wake up, audiences, and try to think for yourselves. The best directors want us to do that; the worst are afraid of what will happen if we dare to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Holy crap!,"This movie really shook me up. This is why I had to give it 10/10. Any movie that gets me thinking (even if it makes me feel bad) is a good one.This movie sucks you into the lives of these four souls as they are consumed by drugs (3 heroin, 1 speed). The quick cuts of cutting drugs, shooting, blood flowing through veins, pupils dilating is very powerful. The quick cuts get faster until things spiral totally out of control.I've know my share of junkies. This movie is if anything kind to the world of heroin use. The junkie in this movie are more together than the ones I knew (note the tense).When my sons are about 14 I'll show them this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a ""just say no"" person. I'm a legalize all drugs and educate people. If we spent all the billions we spent on law enforcement on educating people we would have less junkies in this world. I have no doubt about that.

But in the end it's morally simplistic. Drugs bad.It was almost saved by the inter-generational drug abuse, but this was so cheesy.

The director's intention is clearly to upset you, give you a headache, and instill in you a hatred of addictive behavior.

Why people die alone,"It's fun to read the ""Hate it"" comments, and usually they have a point. Surely, this is a morality tale with worst-case-scenario ending, not a documental feature on drug abuse (for that, take a look at the German film ""Christiane F."") or an investigation into the American health care system (although after watching Michael Moore's ""Sicko"", I think anything is possible).The comments I read all overlooked that this is a very moving film about loneliness and alienation - the best I've seen yet besides ""Blade Runner"" and far above ""Collateral"" and the like. If you watch a lot of movies, you'll get a spooky sense of the screen looking back at you. Ellen Bustyn as the mother lives inside an incoherent TV dream, until she completely vanishes into that ""brighter world"" where she is not only loved, but adored. The kids have high hopes and seem to be more firmly on the ground, but Marion needs to pump up her courage and Harry loves to go easy. All three are junkies who keep the world at arms length or behind locked doors while they artificially enhance their feelings. They're not only addicted to uppers and downers, but to more-than-life-size dreams.By contrast, reality seems drab and without purpose and the individuals utterly alone. Like true average heroes of modern society, they are frantically trying to keep up happy, successful faces. Nobody takes the time to listen to or check on the old lady. The world doesn't care, and they in turn refuse to need it until it's too late and they lose limbs, minds, relationships, freedom, self-respect and finally the will to care.Jonathan Demme has laid a finger on a rift in society's fabric that's not easy to expose without boring the audience or adding thriller elements, and the shocking imagery gets more people to see it (as the comments confirm). Definitely a recommendable film that provokes nagging questions and engages even those who don't ""like"" it.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Bleakest Film Ever Made,"Yes, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a beautifully made film, and exceedingly well-acted. But in a way, those positively-spun accolades are irrelevant red herrings and tangential false flags. Because the core attribute of ""Requiem for a Dream"" wholly eclipses every other with its pitch-black truth: Sometimes, dreams just don't come true. This is the bleakest film ever made, and there are people who should actively avoid it at all costs. It offers razor blades. Hopelessness. And the promise that if you subject yourself to watching it, you will know too much.There are experiential darknesses that leave scars in life, but they're relegated to real-world experiences -- abuse, torture, addiction, death, grief. In film, only the experience of watching ""Requiem for a Dream"" can mimic in the psyche some of those destructive true life horrors. Consuming it can take things away from you.""It's just a movie,"" you say. But when you say that, consider the possibility that you say it irresponsibly. The safe play here is to avoid ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and run the other way; the revelations it offers are just too insidious.

One of the Best Films i have Ever Watched.,"I have seen this film two years ago i believe, and it is still one of the greatest films out there. This is how it should be done. You got characters to care for, relate to, and feel horrible for. Every single character here has it's own tragic story, and it makes your heartbroken. The acting is amazing, the story is perfect, and hands down one of the best films out there to check out. This film is a masterpiece, and it deserves all the love and respect it has. It would be a pity for me to spoil what happens, but this is the kind of content schools should provide kids to watch, instead of a stupid system that we willingly accept. Imagine a child watching this film when they are 12, 13, they most likely never will try drugs, prostitution or robbery. Instead in a corrupted system, you got children watching stuff like Lil Pump, 6ix9ine that straight up promote all of the content that this movie is fighting against!

"Well made, but I have no desire to ever view again","It's taken me a longggg time to finally commit to watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream and now that I have, I have no earthly desire to ever, ever see it again. Aronofsky's filmography is a fascinating one for me personally; one of his films (The Fountain) is in my top three of all time and has endless rewatch capability, while every other one I've seen I've either not been huge on, or admired but felt like once was enough. That certainly applies here, this is a well made and thoughtful film yet it's pessimistic to the bone and so bleak in its outlook that you feel a dark stain on your soul when it's choking narrative of several Coney Island drug addicts comes to a hellish, cacophonous ending. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are a pair of sad sack heroin junkies, Jennifer Connelly is Leto's equally strung out girlfriend and Ellen Burstyn his hopeless mother who withers away at home, getting sicker and sicker on poisonous diet pills that rot her body, and a toxic daytime TV talk show (hosted by Christopher 'Shooter McGavin' McDonald, no less) that rots her mind. These various individuals each occupy their own disheartening downward spiral and weave in and out of each other's orbit as they all proverbially circle the toilet bowl of a very dark outcome and while there are momentary flashes of what could be called compassion for these people, Aronofsky mostly just ruthlessly focuses on this very disturbing, apocalyptic chapter in their lives with little room for rhyme, reason or philosophical commentary. Perhaps it's best that way for this film, and seems to mirror the lack of answers or understanding all of us seem to have when we drive through a particularly derelict part of town where these horrifying trajectories can be observed in real time. The film starts off with false hopes of being kind of comedic in the fashion of other drug films like Spun or The Salton see but, like those films, it's all fun and games in the beginning stages of addiction and when the situation becomes dire, things spiral into oblivion faster than anybody can comprehend, especially those it happens to. So, while I will concede it's a terrific film with solid performances and a now iconic score from Clint Mansell, I'll tuck the dvd away, change the channel when it comes on and skip past it in the streaming queue, for I have no inclination to ever experience it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's kind of akin to a drunken storyteller at a bar who is always afraid of losing your attention, so he exaggerates and he lies.There is definitely a lot eye-candy in this film, but even the ""innovative cinematography"" often comes off as gimmicky and pointless.Sometimes power lies in restraint.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Jared,"ared Leto, gives an excellent, solid performance as Harry Goldfarb, a man living an inch from his life, always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance, he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However, it appears to be a Hollywood in-joke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club, he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho, his head cut off. In Requiem however, it is the mutilation of his life, his whole character, that takes centerstage, ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his power-packed performance.However, the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film, not really knowing if it is, in fact, her. Her performance as a television, sugar and eventually, diet pill-addicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years, watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto, never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role, you tend to forget how she really looks like, given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say, she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her person(as Aronofsky so creatively did), an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definitely deserves her Oscar nomination, if not, the Oscar itself, for her tour-de-force performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two above-mentioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver, Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick, who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love, Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here, Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed, to portray a boy trapped in a man's body, just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead, in drugs. Connelly as well, who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years, is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama

This film truly transfers the pain of the characters on the screen to the people in the audience.Jennifer Connelly gives a stunning performance.  I have never seen her go through such a transfermation of character as she did in Requiem.  She is truly fit for the role, and she should be given her due kudos.  Not to slight any of the other actors in the film.  Marlon Wayons and Josh Leto give great performances as well and the women that plays Leto's mother in the film is stunning.

"""Juice by Tappy""","Not a whole lot of movies these days get you to actually think.Luckily, Requiem for a Dream is one of the few that require thinking and feeling.This movie is not for the faint of heart or feeble-minded.The movie tells the story of 4 people who have big dreams of happiness only to have them ruined by drug addictions. Sara Goldfarb, a TV-loving widow who is addicted to diet pills, her heroin-addict son Harry Goldfarb, his coke-addicted girlfriend, Marion Silver, and his drug-dealing friend, Tyrone Love.You learn a lot about each character and begin to sympathize with their situation as they begin to spiral downward with their addictions.Ellen Burstyn was excellent in The Exorcist, so I knew she would give a good performance as Sara Goldfarb. I had never seen Jared Leto in other movies, but he sure didn't disappoint here as Harry Goldfarb. Marlon Wayans is usually in bad, over-the-top comedies, so I was really surprised with his excellent performance as Tyrone Love. I personally do not care for Jennifer Connelly, she wasn't bad as Marion though, just wasn't great either. And Christopher McDonald was perfect as Tappy Tibbons, the icon of Sara's TV addiction, who runs a talk-show talking about how he managed to lose weight and gain his life back.This movie wasn't perfect, but was still great. It claws into your senses and burrows in deep, making you really get the full-blast of what this movie is trying to tell you.

So close to reality it's almost scary,When making a movie about drugs and addiction it's quite easy as a director to slip and fall in the insubstantial trap. Meaning that everything that plays out is too far from reality. When you create a movie who's story is based on real life situations about drugs and addiction and make it too far from reality it just comes out as a big mess. Following that the viewers won't be able to feel and experience what the characters in the movie is feeling. Darren Aronofsky defenetly did'nt fall for this trap which led to him making in my opinion one of the best movies I've ever watched.I sat with a gut wrenching feeling throughout the last 20 minutes of this film.

requiem for the American Dream... a masterpiece,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is not merely the elegy for any dream, it is a requiem for the American Dream...Hard on the eyes, hard on the nerves this movie gives inisghts into the fatal pandemic of addiction, which has been strangling the US for many decades.Must watch.Must endure.It is a true masterpiece of it's time which still stands tall 22-years later!The transitions of the main characters slowly sliding into the abyss of substance abuse is trly stunning. Each and every performance was much more realistic than I expected.In addition, the movie is being carried by the amazing musical score.""Lux Aeterna"" by Kronos Quartet sets the perfect tone and sums everything up for the closing titles, with every single note cutting deep and finally washing over you, like calm ocean waves after the pefect storm.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Must see.,"I am happy to say this is the best film I have ever seen, The direction by Aronofsky is INCREDIBLE, realistic, touching and brilliantly implemented. Acting is superb and the plot will blow you away. Not a bad word against it. If you haven't seen it, see it. It's a tragedy that so many people see high concept films yet such brilliance gets over looked.However, I think this film is a hard watch, this is the best film I have ever seen and you see more each time you see it, the editing makes the film, but the end scenes are SO rapid.If you want a happy story this isn't it, keep scrolling, the title says it all.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Very disturbing and a somewhat overrated, but still worth a look if you have the stomach for it","I was expecting this film to be a little bit better, considering its rated like #25 in the 250, but all it really was is a bunch of repeated disturbing images that take front seat to the interesting storyline.  Ellen Burstyn plays an elderly Brooklyn woman who becomes addicted to diet pills, and fantasizes her own dream world, at the same time her distant son(Jared Leto) is having his own drug problems.  The repeated visuals are very weird and are bound to stay in your memory for a long time.  The only real reason to see this film is to see a really weird, and somewhat visually fascinating film.  I cant give it any more than a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Incredible and unforgettable,"I just saw this movie last night and I've thought of little since.  Its already in its own place in my movie-memory bank, and I am grateful to have the pleasure to see such a cinematic experience.  I don't know how the movie was made, I don't know how the actors did what they did and I don't know how much money was spent but its all great, I mean GREAT.Ellen Burstyn must be given a special mention, for the work she does.  All the actors are excellent but Ellen does some amazing things and should be remembered by serious critics at the year-end awards.  I did not know Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans could act, but they can, and they were fantastic.  That leaves Jared Leto, who was just as good as everyone else and breaks your heart several times as well, especially his last scenes. There is also a very strong supporting cast, including Chris McDonald, Keith David and Louise Lasser.I urge any moviegoer, casual or dedicated, to see this in a theatre.  I swear there are parts where you will literally forget to breathe.  No kidding.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Most painful movie I've ever seen,"Brutal, upsetting, wounding movie making. You will remember this movie Like you remember being punched in the face.  It gives no answers and unlike a classical tragedy there are no obvious weaknesses that these characters could have overcome to avert this tragedy.If you or anyone you know is in danger of becoming addicted to Heroin this is the movie to show them. Watching this movie is to drugs what Scared Straight is to crime but with the VOLUME ALL THE WAY UP.  This movie is as intense as any that I have ever seen. It should come with a warning label. Some folks will need therapy just to deal with the trauma of having watched it.I can't bring myself to condemn this movie, if it de-glamorizes heroin use, its probably worthwhile, but think twice before you see it. It will probably ruin your mood for much more than a night.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Visually painful, intellectually void","What I miss in this film is the attempt to address difficult social questions about drugs. Instead we are treated as Pavlov's dogs: drugs=bad, drugs=filth, drugs=pain, drugs=ugly, etc. All this may be true, but does that really suffice to make a film?No, I answer. For example, why not try to address the question WHY do these people in one way or another do what they do, why do they inflict these things upon themselves? What drives them? And why not try to put drug addiction in a bigger picture? Who gains from this abuse, why does a society accept that many of its citizens are paralyzed at their television sets, doped by drugs, completely consumed by their need or engaged in small gang wars (small in comparison to what governments do)? I do not say that one single film should address all these questions, but a drug film above the ordinary must see beyond the individual. This one fails in that respect, thus making it uncontroversial (the nudity and sex scenes are filthy and terribly voyeuristic, but I do not consider them to be controversial except to a very prude audience), which probably is the reason why it has been so well received... no one in power is criticized, it is the addict which is the loser, end of story.The film has some inventive visual effects and some good acting, but form can not make up for lack of challenging content. So I end up with 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama
Definitely a True to Life Movie,"When this movie came out it did not look appealing to me. I didn't think I would like it because when it came out I was a junkie, just as bad, if not worse, as the couple that were the main characters. The movies that I had seen about drug addiction in the past weren't real. The were always glamourized. I am now a recovering addict and saw this movie about a year ago (after I went into recovery). It had an impact. It was like looking at my life from an outside perspective. I was seeing what I looked like and had gone through. The acting in it was superb. They really made you believe that that was their lives. The directing was phenomenal as well. The angles, the camera work, the real emotion that you could tell went into this movie were unbelievable. Not many people see or understand how dark of a world drug addiction can be unless the person has been there but this movie shows the truth of that harsh reality. I believe this movie helped me and maybe can even help someone else in that dark world or even help someone avoid that world.",,Anonymous,Drama
Best movie of all time? .................. Maybe.,"Context of my opinion: I am 33 years old, Brazilian physician, movie addict. My top movies are 2001: Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Shawshank Redemption, City of God. Among theses movies, I set Requiem for a Dream.There's to much to say, but the movie shows it prominence on its own.There's no flaws, no second views, no subtle information, no blurred plot. Everything is clear and precise. The movie doesn't lay over the pseudo intellectualism.No other movie depict the human mind fragility so well. We are addict to television, drugs, medicines, status, and others values of modern society.The union, synchronization, marriage between frames and sound is perfect. Yes, PERFECT. The music is a masterpiece.Arronofski had such control of his picture that he knew that audience were gone destroyed (in good sense) at the end, so the credits rolling in silence (almost)... like a time to recover the breath.This picture is a life changing.Among the 5 best movie of all time.

"Raw, unflinching, and so realistic it's unbelievable.","Never has a film been made that captures the disease of addiction like this one. It will haunt you for days. And if you're an addict, it will haunt you for the rest of your life.This film knows its subject. Knows what most of the world don't. Drugs are not the problem. They are a temporary cure, or maybe just a symptom of a devastating disease that manifests itself whether you're using or not. You can see it in the subtle behaviors of the characters that are brilliantly acted by the films four stars. You can see the sadness in Marlon Wayans's character as a child, long before he ever picked up his first drug. That scene with his mother is one of the most powerful aspects of this film, as it shows that addiction is a disease that is ever present long before the use of drugs becomes an issue. Reaffirming that no matter what you think, will power cannot save you.The film is criticized for extensive cuts and repetitive images. But I know better. I'm a recovering addict, and not some, but all 12 step programs define insanity as this: doing THE SAME THING over and over and over again; expecting different results. The films ability to show this visually, constantly darkening with every repeat, is metaphoical genius.Some may like the endings to the laughably unrealistic, Clean & Sober, or even the Basketball Diaries( which if you read Jim Carols second diary you'd know that his story didn't end that way). And like Requiem's sad conclusion, the truth is the ends are ALWAYS the same; jails, institutions, and death. Because if you pull any four addicts out into the spot light, there chances of recovery and survival are most likely a dream.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Beautiful Film, Will Change You","Needless to say, anyone who has viewed this film with an open mind, and has carefully considered the cinematography and sound, will be able to conclude it is a wonderfully made piece of art. Also, it is quite disturbing also, visually and mentally. The characters are portrayed to perfection; anyone who has read the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. can agree with that statement. This is one of very few films that truly ""moved"" me. Not moved necessarily in a good way, but moved. It should be noted anyone considering viewing this must keep in mind it will not leave you feeling happy and ready to take on the world. Rather, it will possibly upset the viewer, and if it doesn't accomplish that, it will at least leave you pondering much of your own ways in life.This is one of the best films made in the last twenty years, and the mix of great visuals, amazing sound, and a great cast combine to make it so. I own the film and have watched it at least twenty times. One thing I can say with confidence is I have never duplicated the feeling I had when I first watched it. I was left so speechless it amazed me, as few movies can really do that to me. Every time I watch it, I am left feeling reflective to say the least, but the first viewing is almost an out-of-body experience which will go un-matched for most. I say watch it, and really take it in as a whole, otherwise you will have missed out on a great opportunity to learn something about yourself and life in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Shattering expose of the fallible human condition.,"What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. Love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Style cannot make up unoriginal substance,"I saw this last and thought it was total and utter crap.  The plot seemed entirely unoriginal, as if the screen writer thought that he could just borrow themes that had been presented in previous movies and novels(which had something to say about society not just a bunch of worthless junkies) and throw them over a bunch of rather unlikeable characters and boom, you've got an art house classic.  To throw the viewer off from this we have a bunch of fun and new camera tricks, some of which are also heavily borrowed from other films(Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction for example), but these eventually seem to get boring and repetitive, how many times do we have to watch a closeup of drug preparation, method of ingestion, dialated pupil. As for the performances Jared Leto can't compare to the better written and more likeable characters that are presented by Ewen McGreggor in Trainspotting and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Basketball Diaries.  The other characters are convincing enough but that really doesn't matter because by the end of the film I wanted all of them to put a gun in their mouth and end their wasted lives, especially during the way to long climactic montage of them all hitting rock bottom.

"""I don't think you'll be puttin' any more dope in that arm.""","Excessive drug use inherently destroys human bodies, destroys human lives, destroys human minds, and kills human dreams. We all know it. But people habitually do it anyway. What follows is a bleak downward spiral of decay and despair.That's exactly what this film entails: four characters who suffer from their habitual addictions. By the end of the movie, it seeps nothing but bleakness and sorrow off the screen and really pounds it into the viewer. Combined with an extremely stylish visual style, the film has the power to grab you and stay with you long after the credits roll. It is that powerful (at least to me).The story is pretty simple and is populated by acceptably well-developed characters (ones who seem fairly realistic though). What makes it stand out is the presentation; the photography is vivid and always interesting to look at. Editing techniques are just as varied and wild, especially in seeing rapid-fire successions of close-up shots. The use of sound accentuates the wild visuals very well. The music is freaking epic.By the end of this film, I was thoroughly saddened. It is definitely a bleak and sobering look at addiction and obsession, and it has affirmed my resolution to never pollute myself with drugs or meds.

I don't want to say, I wanted to see a good movie and that's what I did. This movie, is, like another translation, Desilusion over Addiction. A perfect narrative and a magical sound.

"Plenty of substances, just very little substance","Now, let's start by making it clear that this is an extremely stylish movie. There is no denying that the camera work, visual effects and creation of atmosphere are extremely effective. The drug taking scenes are very powerful when they are viewed the first time, and the second time, maybe even the third, but by the fourth, fifth...tenth..twentieth time the same rapid sequences of drug-taking and their immediate effects wear very thin. Had the film been any longer I think I would have thrown a bag of flour at the screen.The plot is very, very predictable and the visuals are tacked on in categorizable chunks. After a while you will be waiting for the next step down on the ladder of visual hallucinations. These, like the other effects, are very stylishly done and are quite disturbing at times, but there is really nothing new here.For some reason this film reminded me a lot of 'Jacob's Ladder', though I think the latter is better and has a much higher re-watchability. In places the camera work was very similar to 'Killing Zoe', again, a slightly better film in my opinion. 'Requiem for a Dream' just doesn't have any substance beyond it's own simplistic message and clever effects; there is just too much repetition here.Is the acting any good? I don't think so. There was really nothing challenging to be acting about unless you count stereotypes as challenging acting. Each character gets high, gets into a stuporous rage and eventually gets hurt - there is no restraint and everything is just blended together so that even a hint of a good performance is lost in the mixture (a problem I find with many American films these days).However, my final comment will read, ""this movie took me somewhere I didn't want to go, and it did it effectively. It just did it about fifty times in less than two hours and then ended"".Note: I loved Pi, and was quite disappointed with this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Nightmares Come True,"My god. Where to start with this? Darren Aronofsky's follow up to indie hit Pi could be one of the most brilliant and emotional films ever. Aronofsky has managed to adapt Hubert Selby Jr's magnanimous novel to the big screen  and he's done a superb job of it.The cast is amazing. Ellen Burstyn's TV addicted, speed taking mother was robbed of an Oscar by Julia Roberts' frumpy, irritating Erin Brokovich. She gives one of the most emotional performances you will ever see, her passionate monologue about what it's like to be old, and her paranoid acting makes you truly believe that acting is an art. Jared Leto, as her drug addicted son, also gives very worthy performance as does Jennifer Connely as his girlfriend. Marlon Wayans, too, delivers an amazing and serious performance that belies his slapstick comedy notoriety.But this is a director's film; Aronofsky pulls out every directing trick in the book to make this a truly original experience. The shot of an overjoyed Sara Goldfarb as she runs out of her apartment and walks across the street with her old female friends as the camera swoons in front of them, creating a strangely eerie shot is one example. But it is the editing that shines, Aronofsky never leaves the viewer board with his unique style of hiphop montage editing and special effects.The music in this film also shines, the classical score is wonderfully composed and highly dramatic in a film which demands it so heavily.Although disturbing, this is a film that everyone should see, it is full of great acting, editing and truly memorable story.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

This piece of art shows anything and everything that can go wrong when involved with drugs of such a caliber as cocaine and the like.A stunning performance of Ellen Burstyn, accompanied by the helpless role of Jared Leto, the desperation of Jennifer Connelly, and the emotional trouble of Marlon Wayans leads me to believe that this movie can, and will, impact any person of any age or upbringing.I have recommended this to a few of my friends, and one of them thought about their older brother throughout the whole movie because he saw so much in the characters that was in his brother, as well. The other thought of someone, whom she considered her older brother, because he had a drug problem and later passed away due to unrelated events.I give this movie 10 stars out of 10 because of how much it influenced me, despite the fact that I have had a very limited past with drugs. I haven't known anyone that has done drugs of this magnitude, but seeing this film could prevent any young mind's ideas of how 'fun' shooting drugs into your arm looked.Personally, I feel this movie should be featured in schools everywhere; with heavy editing and censorship, of course. I feel it would impact students much heavier than the generic movies they show about how a student was killed by sniffing Windex, or something of the sort.This is, by far, the darkest film I've seen, yet it is one of my favorites of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

It's kept simple and subtle yet so moving. The background score makes the scene even more dramatic and scintillating than it already is and it keeps us hooked to the screen till the end.The cinematography is simply brilliant. The wide angle shots, the close ups of the characters, the effects is perfect for this genre. Overall, Requiem for a Dream is a hard hitting, depressing, disturbing yet beautifully made which makes it hard not to watch it. So I recommend this movie for anyone because it brings out emotions that you never knew you had it in you.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Heartwrenching,"I had unfortunately already spoiled this film for myself by going to Wikipedia but decided to be a good sport and watch the entire movie as well. The actors give superb performances. Ellen Burstyn is tragic and realistic (that Oscar was stolen from her). Jared Leto as the gaunt Harry Goldfarb is amazing. To those that never pictured him as a good lead actor, he will awe you to the point of tears. Which is exactly what happened to me. The impact of the film hit me on the head like a board. This film is not for those looking for light-hearted entertainment or a little action flick. This explores the intense reality of drug abuse and addiction and the consequences it brings about to the four protagonists. A difficult film to watch but a must-see for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Smoke-and-mirrors.  Flashy, overrated drugs movie has little to say","Darren Aronofsky followed up Pi - a super-stylised near-masterpiece - with this highly-regarded drugs picture which uses almost every visual trick imaginable. Were such technical wizardry enhancing the story (as in Citizen Kane), it would be an admirable achievement, but here it seems to have replaced it. With as many meaningless subplots and unpleasant characters as the similarly-over-hyped Heat, Requiem is not the classic that it has been described as. Rather, it is a deeply flawed piece which loses its emotional impact through a relentless barrage of visual tricks. Indeed, ""trick"" seems an apt word to use, for much of the film's audience appears to have been deceived and led astray by the showy direction and obvious symbolism. Ellen Burstyn is brilliant, but plot and screenplay are markedly sub-standard, and both Leto and Wayans deliver unmemorable turns.In terms of editing and visual originality, then, Requiem may be judged a success, but in grand terms, simply a mess, despite Burstyn's unforgettable central performance.",,Anonymous,Drama

Old fashioned morality play reworked for the hip-hop generation.,"Four loosely connected people get caught up in the world of prescribed and illegal drugs.Pretend this is a school project. Write a first draft of a screen play about the subject and where it all leads. Just kidding, just pretend you have. Then go to this movie and tick the boxes: Yes it is fun, fast and making life better in the early days, but in the end it is just downward spiral towards despair, degradation and serious illness.Given the story is just one giant cliché (in capital letters), the question is how well and how originally the cliché is played out. I have to say pretty well. If you enjoy hip-hop and fast cutting. Some real low budget style from Darren Aronosky. Keeps it moving along at a steady clip.Yes, the budget is pretty low and the actors a little bit too good looking (Jared Leno is the only junkie I have seen with a six pack), but this is for the MTV generation. Bad/good messages have to a bit of boom-boom-boom in the background or the audience will fall asleep.Oscar people love over-the-top (look at the rewards for Deniro and Nicolson) and Ellen Burstyn makes it to the red carpet by going completely and utterly bonkers. So bonkers that you ask, how could she have got on a subway train? Found a building? And what happens to her after makes no sense either. They don't force feed people/shock people like that in hospitals - that went out decades ago! The script is as mad and over-the-top as her fantasy world.I don't take drugs. Not from a moral or legal point of view, only that I have never viewed self poisoning as a way of making my life better. If coke was on offer at the local petrol station I wouldn't touch it. Some people do, that is their knee-jerk. I am not better than these people, only different. Who connects with this story (and some must look at the IMDb rating!), it must be people who think, ""drugs have a place and can help."" As I said before, maybe they can for a while.The popularity of the film is a clear indication that people need - still - reminding about what they are really doing and where it can lead. Requiem is a small failure in that it doesn't seek to highlight lives that were going anywhere or leading to anything anyway. If you prostitute yourself you are obviously capable of prostituting yourself. Despite being movie cliché and law - some people don't prostitute themselves even when starving. However they never get their lives portrayed on film. And sex is always exploitation in film - even when it is pretending not to be...",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Nonsensical nonsense that has no point.,"I was told by several people that this was an excellent movie.

Amazing.,"This movie is amazing. It grabs you by ensuring you relate to at least one of the characters and pulls you down with them. It shows what can and will happen if you take these drugs, and how it affects not only you, but the people around you. This movie makes you feel for the characters and what they go through, you go through. The film making quality is outstanding and the performance by Ellen Burstyn was fantastic. I never thought I'd see a better actress then Meryl Streep but I have, and it Ellen. I rarely see a movie with quality such as this. It is painful at times, but it is essential.

Purposefully hideous tale about a far too real journey,"You will come out of Requiem For A Dream feeling like you've just seen your children die. It's a heart crushing experience that runs on flashy paranoia and vomit inducing grit. If you don't feel sick you will definitely be upset. It's such a powerful film that features inspired performances and spot on direction. This is a film that utilises every ounce of material it is given to put it's audience through a torturous yet utterly compelling voyage of why drug addiction is anything but glorious. It's not the easiest film to watch, but it is certainly an important one.Harry and Ty are partners in petty crime. They both dwell into cocaine and heroin which leads to increasingly gruesome consequences, sending them on a long road trip to Florida. Harry goes out with Marion, another recreational drug user who along with Harry, is having money issues, and sets out to degrade herself in order to avoid freezing to death in the New York winter. Harry's mother Sara is a lonely, weight-obsessed TV addict, who is naively given speed pills in order to shed her pounds and get on a TV game show. All of them are spiralling out of control.Two things that amazed me about Aronofsky's film: Marlon Wayans, that really unfunny bloke from such laugh riots as White Chicks and Don't Be A Menace... is excellent here. Secondly, a film this bleak and raw is actually one of the most visually stylish films I've ever seen. This is all done with purpose in mind. Whereas other directors have used hazy cinematography and quick-fire editing for solely experimental purposes (I'm thinking mostly of Oliver Stone) Aronofsky creates a style that is every bit as flashy as it is meretricious. One minute Marion and Harry are lying together in a stoned haze of ecstasy, professing their love for each other in poetic, yet disturbing words. When the characters are on the move, everything illuminated, and sized up to show New York at it's most gruesome and low-key. This style makes for an incredibly watchable experience, without ever adding a lighter touch to the drama. Similarly themed pictures have had comedy touches such as Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Scorsese's Goodfellas. Requiem owes a lot more to the horror genre, as in many ways it is an endurance test, one that kicks it's audience in the head with it's visuals and pierces through to the heart with it's narrative. The soundtrack is by Kronos Quartet, who also provided the music for Michael Mann's Heat. It provides a simmering sound wave that always suggests danger, and then goes full tilt along with the narrative's varying crescendos.It is a career high point for all concerned. Jared Leto continues to eschew his heartthrob aura by dirtying himself up as much as possible, and choosing an intelligent project, when he so easily could be Michael Bay's poster boy. Marlon Wayans really surprised me here. I'm tempted to forgive him for all his previous misdeeds, as I see a really good performer trapped behind the shtick. But the standouts are the females: Jennifer Connolly is great as the self-degrading girlfriend of Harry and Ellen Burstyn delivers a gruelling performance of an isolated woman slowly walking the line of sanity and insanity, and delivering some of the films most heart-shattering moments.There isn't much room for hope in 'Requiem'. The screenwriter, Hubert Selby Jr., has never been one to shy away from the less-than-cheerful, and we are presented with a story full of darkness and repulsion. There is too much power in this tale to make it depressing. It is more than tragic, but serves a very pertinent purpose. It has to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The beginning starts off somewhat happy, but the more you watch the darker and more disturbing this film gets.

To anyone who ever thought Trainspotting was as rough as it gets...,"A dense, dark drama which explores the stomach churning and mind warping effects of drug abuse. This film is an absolute must see, and stays with you long after it has ended.There are superb performances from Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto as the erratic mother and junkie son whose distant relationship is severed more and more by their persistent drug use. The compassion you are made to feel for Burstyn's character is so intense that the film's climax is almost unbearable. Loneliness like that is not at all unusual, and may just make you give your mother that extra phone call or visit once in a while, just to show her that she is not alone.Although you may not have a drug habit, the focus on relationships makes the films seem uncomfortably personal, and really makes you stop and think. Aronofsky's fresh and original style keep the film moving at a fast pace, keeping it interesting, even when not a lot is going on in the story at that time.A triumph in modern cinema, and one of the most original, brutal and touching films i've ever had the pleasure of watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Robbery, pure and simple!","Let's get this one downer out of the way first. That Ellen Burstyn lost the Best Actress Award was a horrible travesty. That she lost it to an above average actress in a marginally average film about an incident of below average interest actually takes a little of the sting out because it demonstrates the political b-s- which is the Academy's voting process. Burstyn delivers the performance of her career as Sara Goldfarb, an older woman whose loneliness drives her to a dependence on diet pills. Had Burstyn won the award I'd probably be complaining about the inadequacy of the honor.I don't believe in the concept of any artwork being 'definitive' of its style or subject matterbut this one comes pretty close. I can't think of any other film about drug addiction which deserves to be in the same conversation with ""Requiem"". It's depressing, horrible, tragic, powerful, and intensely compelling.I really want to avoid including anything which smacks of a 'spoiler' and might lessen the power of the rabbit punch a new viewer will inevitably receive but I can't help returning to Miss Burstyn's performance. My first reaction was to feel for the tragic young lovers Harry and Marion but their plight was really of their own making. Sara just wanted to be popular. She wanted to be on TV and be envied by her friends. She wanted to turn back the clock and fit into her best red dress. I know, I know, the doctor's prescription for amphetamines flies in the face of common sense and gives us a convenient heavy, but it in no way diminishes what Miss Burstyn did with the character.There should be lots of other kudos attached to this film; Jennifer Connelly's delivered her best ever, as has Wayans, Leto, and Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr. put a lot of love into this screenplay. Selby's hands on to the point of living on the set and acting in a minor role.Films are supposed to entertain us. For many of us the surest way to entertain is to evoke strong emotion.

A moving example of man's drive for happiness.,"The first time I saw this movie was in shock. I was so moved by Jared Leto's performance and Ellen Burstyn's. They choose the right people for the movie. The last fifteen minutes are painful to watch, NOT because it's bad acting or boring but because it's so real and gritty that I feel sick when I see Jennifer Connelly on the table ""dancing"", Jared Leto in the hospital, Ellen Burstyn in the ward and Malon Wayans in prison.The movie made me realize how far people are willing to go just to be happy. I always knew I would do whatever it takes, legally, to become what I want but to see on the verge of life and death running toward what they believe to make them happy so sick you can really see how far people are willing to go.I think everyone should see this movie AT LEAST once in their life. When I bought I took it over to my friends house and we watched it in his living room with is 12 year old sister and I told her ""watch this. just don't leave until the end, and you'll feel something inside.""

Good Heavens!!!,"A punch-in-the-stomach, kick-in-the-rear, slap-in-the-face of a movie that is as heart-breaking and difficult to watch as a Super Bowl involving the Buffalo Bills. ""Requiem for a Dream"", along with ""Traffic"", was bar-none the best film of 2000. Both deal with the hidden drug war this country faces. ""Traffic"" is an epic that has a wide scope while ""Requiem for a Dream"" has a very exact focus. Coney Island is hanging on by a thread and so are four of its inhabitants. There is elderly widow Ellen Burstyn (in an almost unrecognizable role that is her finest performance which garnered her an Oscar-nomination), her young-adult son (Jared Leto), his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans). Burstyn gets a call one day explaining that she has been chosen to be on her favorite game show (hosted by the priceless Christopher McDonald). Burstyn is lonely and wants to go on television in her old red dress (which she cannot fit into anymore). She learns from a friend that a shady doctor will give her diet pills to help her burn off those pesky extra pounds. Meanwhile Leto, Connelly and Wayans are addicted to cocaine and heroin. They support the amazingly quick high they get from the drugs by pushing nickel and dime bags all over the city. However they get a bit more ambitious. They decide to buy in bulk in order to get more money in order to get high more often. The three want the simplest things in life. Leto wants a life with Connelly, Connelly wants to open a store that sells designer clothes and Wayans wants a woman to provide the love and compassion that his late mother gave him. It appears for awhile that the dreams may indeed come true, but drugs are not the answer and the trio soon learns this in a vividly disturbing way. Burstyn, addicted to supposedly legal drugs, will head down a path of destruction just like the three young people. Darren Aronofsky's (of ""Pi"" fame) haunting film is the wildest cinematic experience I have ever had. The film makes ""The Exorcist"" look like ""Sesame Street"" gone stark-raving mad. The revolutionary camera techniques and wild sequences make the film feel like the most death-defying ride at any amusement park. Hubert Selby, Jr.'s intense novel comes to frightening life (he also has a small role as a wise-cracking guard at a jail) due to a really smart screenplay, tight direction and revolutionary performances by the four key players. Burstyn goes beyond the best work she did in great films of the 1970s (most notably ""The Last Picture Show"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Harry and Tonto"" and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""). Wayans proves to be a really solid performer after being in silly productions that had little merit. Leto also proves to be an actor that can do much more than just stand in front of the camera. Connelly's performance (a role that is hard as nails to play) just continued to show what a versatile and risk-taking actress she is. She should have been Oscar-nominated here at the very least, but the Academy did make up for their mishap with her Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"". Not a joy to watch, but an immensely important film that should be experienced at least once by all individuals who are of a mature age. Rated NC-17 (that is warranted), ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a sledge-hammer of a film that will leave you visibly shaken long after you first see it. It could best be described as a guided tour of Hell on Earth. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Drama

You may not like it but...,"...you MUST see this film.Darren Aronofsky has much going for him. He has recently completed and released the critically acclaimed graphic novel entitled ""The Fountain"", with a movie of the same name, starring Hugh Jackman, soon following, easily making it one of 2006's most anticipated films. His directorial debut was an acclaimed indie film called ""Pi"". The movie, shot for only $60,000 was a critical success and led to the next step; the masterpiece, Requiem for a Dream. Based on the book of the same name, this movie is a very grim, mature, and dark tale of the lives of those addicted to drugs. The addiction becomes more and more severe as the movie progresses, causing the downfall of each of the characters. They each become desperate and begin to not only become mentally unstable, but also financially, and securely unstable. There is no happy ending here, just a stone cold look at the reality of what one's life might succumb to if one were to become addicted. Requiem for a Dream was hard hitting for me; it changed my life. This movie is one of the few movies that I am able to look beyond the surface and really be affected by. It is not meant for pure entertainment, it is an artistic and original vision of addiction brought to us by the genius Darren Aronofsky.

"The strongest, saddest film I've ever seen.","A bit of background: I'm 16 years old and I've seen around 350 films in my lifetime, and several weeks ago, was looking to see another.

I was very doubtful; I've never cried for a movie before that I can remember, and I didn't expect to be moved that much by this film. Nevertheless, I sat down to watch it.By the end, I was sobbing so hard I couldn't believe it - for around ten minutes after the film ended.

This doesn't mean that Requiem for a Dream is hard to understand nor that it contains any big, hard to predict, surprises. Nonetheless, Requiem for a dream is not just another movie about drugs, in my opinion the drug use depicted in this film is just a framework that helps to the exposure of the characters and to intensify their problems and emotions. The essence of the film lies within the colourful portrayal of the characters that succumb to their problems and insecurities that finally drive them to desperation.An absolute must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Ouch,"The reviews of this movie on this site are great, and I don't want to belabor the point that this was an astoundingly wonderful and incredibly disturbing and upsetting film. I have to say that this movie upset me and affected me more than any other I've seen. Just to think about the fact that people really do this to themselves really gives me the creeps. The film was beautifully done and I especially loved the split screen scenes. This film is unique in every way. In the most beautiful scene in the movie, our two lovers are in bed together talking, and the camera shows in such a magnificent way their love for each other, by panning over their bodies and showing them tenderly touching each other. This is when you really learn about their relationship and their love for each other, and it just kills you to see the heroin addiction rip them apart in so many ways as individuals and as a couple. Actually, just about every aspect of this movie kills you. It will leave you speechless, breathless, and really make you think about your life in a different way.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
dark.,"..if you want to be disturbed by the dark and seedy world that surrounds us, the underbelly of a sick society that we are not usually privy to, watch it. Brilliant characterisation and a very believable plot makes this film enjoyable - it's all about drugs and addiction; how it can corrode your soul and mind. The story is based in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York and we follow a year in the life of a trio of twenty-somethings and the main character, Harry's mother. The story reveals how people can get sucked so easily into a dark and complicated vortex, where there seems to be no escape. Few films show the truth about what can happen with drugs and don't just glamoriser the whole scene, this is an exception, well worth the watch - wish that I'd seen this as a teenager!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Art in images, dynamics and content","Today is the second day after I've watched Requiem. So, the influence of primal effects is not present. I feel like I felt when I've read Dostoyevsky's Demons. The implications in my consciousness are massive... The movie shows the reality in the most genuine way, and the consequences of social deviations are dramatic. It's unbelievable! Both the creativity of the author of the book and of the producer. The movie involves psychology, social psychology, psychopathology, picture art and great music. The time line which is structured by the seasons is also a impressive way of integrating art. The only thing I have to do is to read the book to see if there is content that isn't shown in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Pretty horrific but disappointing,"I saw this movie after seeing the top 250 inclusion and the 8.5 rating and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed......as horrific as the movie is and as aware as it makes you about drug abuse and its effects...I would not necessarily recommend this movie to someone looking for a good one and a half hour of entertainment.If you are into moralistic movies and such then this might be for you.Otherwise there are a lot of better options.Though Jennifer Connelly fans might really like this movie for her young - ""I just lost my virginity"" look.

Harrowing to say the Least - Remarkable Film!!!!!!!,"""Requiem for a Dream"" offers an absorbing, terrifying, yet fascinating look at the downward spiral associated with drug addiction. While the picture certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know already, it is an unflinching look at the possible consequences of drug addiction. Amazingly enough, while you certainly don't condone even the reasons (excuses?) of each circumstance, you cannot help but feel empathy for the four lives depicted.The standout performance, hands down, is Ellen Burstyn who was cheated out of an Oscar. Her performance is quite simply spellbinding. Even more so are the supporting players, most notably, Marlon Wayans. Because he has previously been cast in comedic roles, it is quite surprising how well he handled such a dramatically demanding role. He should invest in more dramatic parts as he proved to match his stellar cast members.This is one of those movies where you immediately need to take a walk and ""shake it off"" or merely have a nice long cigarette. This is an intense movie experience following the results of drug addiction on 4 hapless souls. Even more harrowing is that the movie offers not one shred of hope. In that instance alone, it should be applauded because it implies there is no hope as long as you do not possess enough responsibility to recognize dangerous behavior and do something about it.I highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
The story of a red dress,"We all have dreams. Very important aspirations for us. We all should make something so that our dream is made reality.''Requiem for a dream'' are bitter, quick, slow , imaginative and real. The cast, the music and the edition are excellent.Is a movie about desire, pain, delirium and madness.The movies that depict the drug addiction usually are not as strong as this. Let me take as example ''Trainspotting'', is a comedy and drama about the adventures of drug addicts. We can take too for example ''Christiane F.'', a movie of young drug addicts... ''Requiem for a dream'' is very different.Ellen Burstyn are a great actress, you believe her character and feel her dream, her solitude, her pain. I only saw once it to her in a movie: '' The exorcist''. Jennifer Connelly was another actress who i saw just in one movie: Labyrinth.

shockingly real. and scary,"I actually went to the video store expecting to come out with a copy of SPUN, but it was hired out so the attendant suggested i should give this movie a try. I got home angry about my choice. But when I started to watch this movie I was like ""what the hell is going on"" but as you watch it, it stabs you in the heart and leaves you wanting more. Just like the many drugs used in this movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is addictive. But for some strange reason this movie relates a lot to so many of my friends, constantly in the drug scene. So I guess if you don't know anything about drugs to begin with, you will get a massive shock. Because this is the utter truth. But it makes me really sad because, well I wont give away any plot lines but it just tears you inside to see these people wrecking themselves and how horrible and scary their lives become. Plus my heart races even more when you realize that not only do these for people have to go through so much trauma but these kind of things happen to so many people everyday.

Speechless,"I almost never give a movie a 10 out of 10. If any movie I have ever seen deserves it, it is Requiem for a Dream. I had heard all the hype about this movie prior to seeing it. About its intensity, about the infamous final scene.... everything. Consequently, I expected to be let down. This was ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. Requiem's ferocity is not due to explicit drug use, but to its intense depiction of the effects. The film follows the dark journey of a lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb (Burstyn), her son Harry (Leto)and his two friends (Connelly and Wayans) as they struggle with drug addiction/ achieving their respective dream in a dismal Coney Island backdrop. The dismal tone of the opening scene with Harry and his mother set the stage for a film that, if anything, shows the devastating and indomitable control drugs can have on a person's life. Whether they are together or separate, Aronofsky intertwines the experiences of each character so brilliantly and artistically that I was almost unconscious in terms of the transition between scenes; they seem to bleed into each other. The camera work and ultra-fast montages don't come off as abrasive or excessive.... they left me breathless.Each character in the story has a dream. They look to drugs to help themselves get there, and in doing so lose sight of the fact that everything they truly desire is right there in front of them. There are several moments to the film where I found myself frustrated with the characters. Why can't they open their eyes? Drugs. That's why, and like the characters in the movie, Aronofsky's brilliant direction leaves us feeling helpless.The characters are enthralling, despite screen time being divided up. Harry (Leto) is the central character because of his direct relationship to each protagonist, and the plays the role unbelievably, seemingly with ease. Ellen Burstyn shines as Sarah, taking on a challenging role at her age that certainly doesn't pull any punches. Connelly is convincing, seductive and gorgeous, so appealing at times that it's almost understandable why Harry seems to think hes unworthy of her. Wayans' role is the most minor of the four, yet he exudes the desperation of addiction as well as anyone else.When I see a movie, I often ask myself ""Could anyone have played these roles better than the casted actors?"" To me, this movie answers that question with an emphatic ""NO."" These actors absolutely nailed these parts to the floor. They convey their pain with such conviction that it's difficult not to squirm.When the movie ended, I turned to my friends who had already seen it. All I could do was shrug my shoulders and shake my head. LITERALLY, I swear. Never had a movie left me so literally speechless. This movie will stay with you, haunt you, lift you up, drag you down, and hit you where it hurts. Its a film about false promises, the pursuit of a dream, and the crash landing that drugs bring to such a journey. Go out. Rent it. Right now. It will change you, I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Of Dreams and their Death,"Drugs kill and the death is not necessarily physical. They kill focus, they kill the wish to live, they kill the humanity of attitude but most damningly they kill hopes and dreams. Ironically enough, the lead characters of Requiem for a Dream are drawn to drugs seeking a short cut to a life which is beyond them but which they yearn for. Eventually this very short cut paves the way for their downfall.An old lady's dream to be on TV, a young man's urge to be rich and happy, his friend and girl friend's need to tag along while aspiring to live a rich life - all these dreams die an untimely death. However, the audience is not subjected to any drama. The narrative is evenly paced, and realistic with some exceptional cinematography making the viewing experience a delight. The end is tragic, realistic, and painful but every bit true. Conforming reality to art is as much a challenge as conforming art to reality and on both counts this movie comes out on top.A must watch movie for the young aspiring generation regardless of which air they breathe in.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
An unforgettable film,"One of my friends recommended this film to me in July.  I rented it and watched it with him and a friend from out-of-town.  After we watched it, we sat in my room in silence for at least an hour.  This film is the most dramatic, terrifying film I have ever seen in my life and I love this film. Since then, I've recommended it to many people and have only watched it again once.  I mean, this movie has a story that could possibly happen (a few things added in for drama though but I won't mention anything in particular).  It's amazing what kind of hell four individuals go through just to live their dreams, only to pay for them later on.  Everybody loses.The acting is amazing.  Ellen Burstyn stole the show, with her obsession with being on television.  I feel she terrible for her in the film, since I feel that she was the one who was hurt the most.  Jennifer Connelly did an awesome job, showing what people are willing to do to feed their addictions. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans did an excellent job as well, but not as good as the two leading female characters (in my opinion at least).The camera angles were awesome.  Some of the ones in this film I had never seen before, where the actor/actress was following the camera, while walking forward (kinda have to see it to get my point).  It helped pull me into the film, relating me to all the troubles the characters were going through.The music is probably better than the acting.  The tracks range from a soft orchestra to techno to creepy, loud, and sudden noise.  The music helps the viewer delve deeper into this dark universe.  The music flows well, going from soft music during tender/non-active moments to hightened, intense music during intense sceens (especially near the end of the film).  The soundtrack was so good I went out and bought it.Although I don't plan to use drugs, this film single-handedly shows why you shouldn't.  This story of addiction is not to be ignored.  I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  Addict or not, watch this film!  It might not leave you silent for an hour, but it is a good, artistic film that demands watching.  I personally give this film a 10/10!",,Anonymous,Drama

Very Intense,"I had heard great things about this movie for maybe a few years now from many whom I know. I finally decided to get a copy of it as well as Pi, an earlier film by Darren Aronofksy.As the movie went on I became increasingly amazed at how Requiem for a Dream utilizes sounds, certain imagery, and many subtle effects that really elicit emotion from the viewer (me in this case). The cinematography was of a style that I hadn't witnessed before, but it was definitely great.The soundtrack is a simple yet powerful combination of techno beats with the Kronos quartet, and it's simply a great soundtrack. The songs are the types of songs that really bond to the emotion of the overall movie and continue to astound you if you listen to the soundtrack much later.Simply stated though, the movie was overall a great and painfully truthful movie. What begins as a harmonic situation and relationship among the characters turns to a symphony of discord that's filled with grief. And the way that it plays out is heartbreaking, for each characters' situation.Anyway, all in all I loved this movie but it definitely made me feel depressed. The way Darren created this movie and all the great acting can make anyone tied to the lives and emotions of the characters. Truly a heartwrencher.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

A surreal trip into the realms of different forms of intoxication.,"It was in 1998 that American independent cinema director Darren Aronofsky burst on the cinematographic scene with his highly acclaimed début film ""Pi"".This film was well ahead of its time with its admirable ideological stance on the importance of the most famous mathematical symbol.The critical success of this film gave birth to an animated climate of high expectations.The thing which worked in favor of Aronofsky is that he did not disappoint his admirers as his next film ""Requiem for a Dream"" was as successful as his maiden effort.For this film technical brilliance proved out to be a boon as a sort of hypnotic,hallucinatory atmosphere was created in which the film's characters were placed under the influence of intoxication.It can be said that innovative camera angles and flawless technique assured that the mundane lives of these junkies got transformed into a celebration of life.The filming and critical as well as commercial success of ""Requiem for a Dream"" proved that television is also a fine piece of inebriation for most ordinary of human beings.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
How dreams are shattered,"Well an 8+ rating on the IMDb site does raise the expectations for any movie. Add to that some good recommendations by friends and I was really wanting to the see the movie.

I haven't seen a better movie made on the harmful effects of the drugs. It hits you hard, in your face. Brilliant performances by Ellen Burtyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen is simply superb in the portrayal of a single, lonely aging mother of Jared. She even won an Oscar nomination for that.In the end, its a sad movie.

If for nothing else, don't just see this movie to be convinced of what you already - drugs, especially hard drugs like heroin and speed, are terribly dangerous, but for Aranofsky's daring, original, provocative style, the well-paced plot, and the excellent performances by the ensemble (especially Ellen Burstyn in a truly frightening, unique performance).",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Highly entertaining. Brutal. Beautifully made. Educational. In my mind, the perfect film...","I rate most films I see based upon the acting, the direction, the score, the sound, the amount I think about the film after I've seen it, how well I remember it after-wards and finally, the how much the movie effects me. I believe that a great film satisfies all of those. I have seen about three films in my life (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Donnie Darko and Lantana) which satisfy all of these categories, and I was really beginning to wonder whether or not I could come across one which I thought was perfect...I watched Requiem For A Dream about a week ago when I had chickenpox, and just as I am when I watch any film of its caliber, I was cautious. But it did something to me which no other film ever has and probably ever will. It left me so amazed, shocked, terrified, saddened and intrigued that I proceeded to watch it another three times after-wards before I couldn't watch it anymore...It has a brilliant ensemble cast, probably the best I've ever seen in a film. Ellen Burnstyn had me crying quite hard by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen.It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favourite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict.Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of s***, but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come.Before this film, I didn't know who Marlon Wayans was or what his filmography was like. But I finished this film amazed at the performance he gave, and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love (who I believe I could've easily forgotten if it had've been played wrong). Amazingly well done.The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times.All up, Requiem For A Dream is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and effected mentally than Requiem For A Dream.For that reason I give it 10/10. I loved it...Sincerely, Dave Ward.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Bravura film-making - genius all around ; superbly acted, adapted and conceived on all counts - one of 2000's best films; in a word: harrowing","REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (2000) **** Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Keith David, Sean Gullette, Dylan Baker. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's sophomore film endeavor and adaptation of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s cult novel (co-scripting the screenplay with the novelist) is in a word: harrowing. Brilliantly realized with state-of-the art film editing (kudos to cutter Jay Rabinowitz) and photographed with acrobatic elan and verve by cinematographer Matthew Libatique. Drug addiction is the central focused theme between junkie Leto (in a surprising display of low-key sublime perfection), his aspiring fashion designer girlfriend Connelly (ditto for the sexy actress) and his partner in crime Wayans (in his first dramatic turn) who conspire to score some pure heroin to make their dreams come true. But it is hands-down Burstyn's film in a virtuoso Oscar caliber performance (arguably the career defining one) as Leto's doomed, widowed mother in her trappings of her Coney Island (a fine metaphor of what was once a wonderland now a weed choked wasteland) apartment whose ritualistic watching of a frenzied TV infomercial has visions in her head of being on the show leading her to take prescription uppers to lose weight with only her sanity clearly dwindling away. Her genuinely moving and convincing flesh and rotting bones performance eats at the heart and is truly wrenching to watch her downward spiral into utter madness. Depressing and at times shocking to watch the horrors unfold until its chilling, nightmarish climax the film succeeds in displaying just how unerotic or glamorous the subject matter has been perceived and skillfully ricocheting its fast-cut of fixing the drugs makes it even more resonant. One for the film vaults: Leto's sudden discovery and confrontation with Burstyn that her drug intake is on a path to self-destruction is a thing of brutal beauty in her long-standing close up confessing to her son just how meaningless her life is; priceless. One of the millennium's best films and the year's bar none.",,Anonymous,Drama
"An OK movie, with a great ending","To be honest, Requiem for a Dream is not a great movie. Especially in the beginning it is very weird at times and one cannot really say that it is exciting or entertaining. What one can say with certainty though, is that it is at all times interesting and that it remains above mediocrity at all times. The sad thing about this film is, that the distortions our addict friends' go through, do not always work in the films pace and sometimes they do the film more wrong than right. What makes this otherwise only' OK movie, worth watching in the end though, is a great and disturbing finale, which will make you remember this film for a long time after you have seen it. In the case of Requiem for a Dream, the ending definitely made the film, which as a whole might be an interesting character study for some and possibly great prevention for anyone who thinks about taking drugs. If you like these kind of films I can recommend Bully and Irreversible to you, which I thought were both better than this one. But then again, you could also try Memento, which is even more over-rated on IMDB, than this film. Requiem for gets a Dream 8,5 out of 10 ranking at # 46 and Memento gets a 8,7 ranking at # 14 in the IMDB top 250. My guess is that these two films are that high in the top 250, because the ending of a film, is the last thing you see and the endings of those films really stick around in your head and in Requiem's case it is really a top notch ending. But people, let us NOT forget that the rest wasn't too great and that a great ending alone does not make a great film.7,5 out of 10post scriptum: due to the fact that this film was just OK for most of it's part, upon voting this film will get a 7 out of 10 by me",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

So overrated.  Not authentic.  Shallow.,"A wallowing in a false underbelly. Ellen Burstyn's one-note shrieking, Jared Leto's awful accent - it's fake and annoying. This movie rode a wave of bs hype. I love it when people claim it's authentic. There's nothing authentic about it. It's all surface. And people fell for it. It's a fake, an emperor with no clothes. Stuttering muttering and yelling, nothing happens but actors chewing scenery and a once-talented director indulging masturbatory fantasies. There's no there there.

"Intense, powerful and thought-provoking","I still remember the first time I saw ""Requiem for a Dream"" at Michigan State several years ago. I think this film will always stick with me for one reason or another. The film is hardly pleasant, but in many ways it is about as perfect a modern film as I have seen. Yes, this is high praise, but it is well deserved. The acting especially by Ellen Burstyn as the ever hopeful Sara Goldfarb is amazing in its seductiveness and completeness. Burstyn was Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman longing for past memories and future moments. The actors suck us right into the story and combined with Aronofsky's direction, Clint Mansell's haunting use of the Kronos Quartet, Jay Rabinowitz's editing and Matthew Libatique's camera-work the results are spell-bounding. The story about 4 people and their battles with addiction is heartbreaking, but it is the way it achieves this effect that sticks in my mind. The last 15 minutes are an exercise in editing, cinematography and craftsmanship by the cast and crew.

Great movie that might be to realistic for some people.,"This movie is #4 on my top 10 list, and although you most likely will not smile once during the entire film, it is still phenomenal. A realistic look at what drug addiction can do to a person. I am a big fan of movies and i recommended this to a few friends, most of them said it ruined their day, but if a film makes you feel that bad it has to be good. The film is so realistic, once it sucks you in you almost feel as the characters in the movie do and thats what a good movie should do. This movie should be shown to teens when they get in high school or maybe even 8th grade. Instead of d.a.r.e class or teachers and parents preaching to their students to not take drugs they should just show this film, if i would have seen this i probably would have never even touched pot, the movie frightened me and i was 23 when i first saw it.

Shock Tactics that mean nothing,"Yes this film does leave you in 'shock and awe' at the end and you could be fooled into thinking you have just seen a great movie. However, when you've had time to rationalise things it is obvious this film is an empty shell of tradegy which the root is caused by 'evil drugs'. There have been comments that this film is 'extremely realistic'  and 'what drugs do to you'. These statements are ridiculous to the majority of people who live in the real world. This film shows the almost comi-tradegy spiral of 4 people into a 'drug hell' which could have been taken straight out of a government 50's educational film.

Addiction and love in a big world's capital where television and money notions are in first ranges of some people's interests.,"Very exaggerated film, but has two hot points: How much bad thing is television - if you sit all day watching shows and drug addiction. Exaggerated situations -according to this story- happen to the heroes (madness etc,) and the point is, that -as for the drugs addiction we don't understand how occurred to the couple of the story, as for the girl, it is enough clear that she suffers from a sort of mental disease- but for the son, it is not clear how he got involved in drugs - the friendship with the other dealer, or money hunting is not enough explained how it becomes a good reason to get into drugs. Mother's madness to the end is the main reason of the exaggeration of the scenario. A point to mention is that from that point it is a good thing to accuse mental institutions and the methods they use to interfere in illness. Also before that atrocious end, it is well explained how bad thing are pills for loosing weight. Despite all that, acting from all four actors is superb, movie's rhythm also.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"The most powerful movie I have ever seen, Burstyn's performance is stunning and tragic","This is the best anti-drug movie I have ever seen. Although the messages are fairly simple, they are presented with competence by Aronofsky. The imagery is horrific and disturbing but so powerful and real. The four actors (Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans) are all outstanding. The score is brooding and haunting, as is the direction.On Coney Island, there are four ambitious people. Sarah Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). They all have hopes and dreams, but they are soon shattered as their addictions to different drugs spiral out of control.This is probably one of the best casts I have ever seen, they all are brilliant and have great chemistry. Burstyn was robbed. What the Academy did was an outrage. Her performance was perfect and haunting, if ever there was an injustice with the Academy, it was her losing. Leto, Connelly and Wayans are all fantastic as well. The music is haunting and adds to the effect of the final scene.What we are presented with is raw, disturbing, haunting and real. The images of what these drugs can do are horrible. The last few minutes of the movie are extremely sad and ever so powerful.

A technical tour de force let down by some weak storytelling,"When this film came out in 2000, I was 24. I would have absolutely loved it.Now I'm 47. Not so much.Two things are undeniable.One: This is a spectacular demonstration of film-making. Aronofsky wheels out a trick of some sort in every shot. It's creative, surprising and unsettling.Two: Ellen Burstyn is the heart of the film, with a devastating storyline about the fading hopes of an ageing woman.However, the young cast are disappointing. Neither Jared Leto nor Jennifer Connelly convince. Marlon Wayans is better in a smaller role. And these three, who start off as ""glamorous"" heroin users, face a sudden change of fortune that is hard to understand, and end up as players in a (graphic) melodrama.Scrape away the technical elements, and there just isn't enough substance to sustain it.

I actualy liked it untill the end, but the end is so horribly depraved and depressing that i hated this movie.  Don't get me wrong i'm all for ""non-Hollywood"" endings for movies, but this was so bad. It's like the film makers tried so hard to make this a ""non-Hollywood"" movie that they forgot to make a good movie.  I'd like to remind everyone that different does not neccesarily mean good.  If you like movies with weird endings that are sad or different from most, then go see AMERICAN BEAUTY, but if you want something that will make you wish you were dead then REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is you film.

No desire to see it ever again...not because it was bad...,"...but because it was so good! It's so heartbreaking and sad to see a film as powerful and numbing as this. What really jumps out at you in the end, is that you can't simply say to yourself 'whew, at least these are just characters and a fake plot', then close your eyes and go to sleep. It sticks with you because you realize that this is not a story of fictional circumstances, but that there are people every day living the nightmare that these four went through, and in the end, all their potential is lost. That is what makes this film such a bittersweet triumph.I got laughed at by some friends when I told them how after watching this, I'd be surprised if anybody would want to do drugs. And frankly, if you DO still want to do drugs after a viewing of this film, there is something wrong with *YOU*. But personally, I really like my arm, and would like to keep it there.Sad, yet enlightening.

"Simply, one of those films that just refuse to exit the confines of your mind...","Shocking. Is the first of many words that come to mind when reviewing Darren Aronofsky's controversial cult follow-up film to Pi. Others include; hypnotic, audacious, bleak, bold, rapid, and brilliant. Not only is Requiem for a Dream an enigmatically masterful showcase of contemporary film-making that blares cinematic success, innovation and awe with a heavy dose of drug fuelled melodrama to spare, but it's also the best anti-drugs film ever made. Yeah, yeah, stop scowling at the back, Trainspotters.Staggering into our cinemas some 8 years ago; groggy, rancid, looking for a fix, Requiem left wave upon wave of horror-struck spectators stumped, wide-eyed while clutching certain bodily limbs in utter disbelief. It's an exploitation film of love, loss and lunacy. Of fame, fear and failure that precariously weaves high entertainment values and culturally imperative content into an indie film of immense aesthetic stature, intrigue and unique visual style.By mixing an operatic yet ace underground rave soundtrack with a semi- surrealist edge, the film itself is by no means easy on the ears nor eyes. In fact, it's damn difficult to watch, even harder to swallow, but emerges a triumphant piece of modern cinema that remains etched in the minds of countless critics, fans and movie-goers afar. Users or non.Based on the equally titled seventies drug novel by Hubert Selby Jr, Requiem is powered by a quartet of compulsive Coney Islanders' and their pipe-dreams, desperations, drug addictions and gradual descents into personal hells of psychiatric admission, prostitution, prison and amputation. In other words, it examines the human consumption of illegal drugs in a way never previously attempted on screen. Through an intense use of uncanny film-making techniques including split-screens, intercuts, wipe-cuts, hip-hop montages and over three times as many individual cuts as your average length feature, Requiem is truly as much a film on drugs as it is about them.Darren Aronofksy deftly succeeds in crafting a severe and visceral sense of how drug use and abuse degrades not only the human body, but also the mind and soul. Through a dynamic combination of cutting-edge direction and heartfelt screen performances, we're forced to sympathise with all of the four hapless characters to the bitterest of bitter ends. Some viewers may even be able to empathise (well, to an extent). Predominantly, though, the admirable film-making tactics employed by Aronofsky are what give Requiem its kick. Sure, the content is horrendous, but the visuals demand that we endure every last frame and cinematic nuance to the absolute max'. Whether we want to or not.Over the course of a somewhat undersized body of work consisting of a mere three features, Aronofsky has emerged as one contemporary cinema's finest makers of surrealist yet intellectual psychological dramas. Clearly drawn to self-isolated and David Lynch-like character driven plots, Aronofsky's Requiem stands firm as the pinnacle of his three- pronged feature portfolio. ""I wanted to make a freefall where you jump out of an airplane and about half way down you realise you forgot the parachute,"" recites the Brooklyn born director. ""The film is the moment you hit the ground"". And it is. Requiem for a Dream is visual, vicious and vital. As paranoid and intoxicating now as it was then. Quite simply, a innovative filmmaker's film whose complex theses ring so true in a global community ravaged and maimed by illegal drugs.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Requiem for a Dream: A Hauntingly Powerful Exploration of Addiction,"The film's storytelling approach is incredibly unique, juxtaposing the parallel stories of a son and his mother, both succumbing to their own forms of addiction. Aronofsky doesn't hold back on the psychological and physical horror, crafting sequences that are visually unsettling, making it a challenging viewing experience.The only potential drawback of ""Requiem for a Dream"" is its extreme graphic content, which might not suit every viewer. It doesn't sugarcoat the effects of drug abuse but showcases them in their harshest, most unapologetic form. However, that's also what makes it a remarkable and influential film in the realm of addiction narratives.In summary, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a hauntingly powerful exploration of addiction and desperation. With its superb performances, innovative direction, and an unforgettable score, it leaves a lasting, albeit disturbing impression. It's a film that's challenging to watch, and even more challenging to forget. This is not just a movie; it's an experience - a dark, harrowing journey into the human psyche that's well worth the emotional toll it demands.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) - A Harrowing Descent into Addiction","Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) is a devastating exploration of addiction and its catastrophic effects on the human spirit. The film, based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., is a raw and unflinching portrayal of how four interconnected lives spiral out of control due to their dependence on drugs. With its powerful performances, innovative direction, and haunting score, ""Requiem for a Dream"" leaves a lasting impact, making it one of the most memorable films of its era.The film follows the stories of four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn). Each of them harbors dreams and aspirations, but their addictions lead them down a path of self-destruction. Harry, Marion, and Tyrone become ensnared in the world of heroin addiction, while Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in her desperate attempt to lose weight and achieve the fantasy of appearing on her favorite television show.Aronofsky's direction is both visually striking and deeply unsettling. The film employs rapid-cut montages, split screens, and a variety of camera techniques to create a sense of disorientation and mania, mirroring the characters' mental and physical deterioration. These stylistic choices, combined with Matthew Libatique's stark cinematography, give the film a frantic, almost nightmarish quality that effectively conveys the horrors of addiction.Ellen Burstyn delivers a tour de force performance as Sara Goldfarb, earning an Academy Award nomination for her role. Her portrayal of Sara's descent into madness is both heartbreaking and terrifying, capturing the desperation and loneliness that drive her addiction. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans also give powerful performances, each embodying the tragic trajectory of their characters with a raw and unguarded intensity.One of the film's most memorable aspects is its score, composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet. The haunting theme, ""Lux Aeterna,"" has become iconic in its own right, perfectly complementing the film's relentless pacing and emotional weight. The music underscores the growing tension and inevitable downfall of the characters, making the film's climax all the more impactful.""Requiem for a Dream"" is not an easy film to watch. It is relentless in its portrayal of the destructive power of addiction, offering no hope or redemption for its characters. The film's final act is particularly brutal, as each character reaches the nadir of their journey, culminating in a series of scenes that are as shocking as they are tragic.While some may find the film's intensity overwhelming, it is this very quality that makes ""Requiem for a Dream"" so effective. Aronofsky doesn't shy away from showing the darkest aspects of addiction, making it a visceral experience that forces viewers to confront the harsh realities of substance abuse.Overall, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a masterpiece of modern cinema, a film that is as haunting as it is unforgettable. With its powerful performances, innovative direction, and unforgettable score, it stands as a harrowing portrayal of the human condition, offering a stark warning about the devastating consequences of addiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The climax of this movie is one that people will never forget, not only because it completely blows one's mind away, but because it is in fact impossible to do so. I strongly advise that anyone who watches this movie must be mature enough to do so, because the cruel reality of drugs and its effects on the lives of people in this film were something that even I ,an adult, was not fully prepared for. Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Ellen Burstyn put on amazing performances that in my opinion are almost impossible for them to top. The cinematography, screenplay, and the portrayal of what life is like when one depends on drugs could not have been done better.

A true ode to human pain,as I mention in the title,with very vivid examples of life with those ups and downs that very few other movies I've watched captured that well. Im a huge fan of that old school way of shooting and I liked the colors of this movie from the very first second. Although Jared Leto is not one of my favorites,he performed amazing and what can I say about Ellen Burstyn who at first sight I didn't realize she was gonna be one of the protagonists,possibly the strongest one.

The acting, we have Ellen Byrnstein, one of the finest actresses, you might remember her from The Exorcist.

Not simply because he made this great film, a huge undertaking compared to previous success ""Pi"". But he pushed the limits of expectations, just as he continues to do today (2014).

Mesmerizing,"Directed by Darren Aronofsky, who made a name for himself in 1998 with his art house success Pi, Requiem for a Dream is virtually a continual montage which apparently has more single cuts than any mainstream feature ever made.Comparable to a cinematic fireworks show (with a grand finale included), it is distinguished by an unexpectedly poignant center, the hopes and dreams of a pitiable group of drug addicts longing for a better life. Ellen Burstyn, who's been erroneously ignored by Hollywood lately, is heartbreaking as a bleary-eyed Brooklynite who, in the movie's only tranquil scene, sobs about her fruitless quest for happiness.Yet even she is at the mercy of the film's visual style, a clobbering assault on the senses that makes the experience of watching it nearly interactive.

"a classic wannabe, an intellectual flop","I went to see this movie after hearing all the noise it did, after hearing some of my friends say it was the best picture ever... and I was truly disapointed.First of all, its photography. Of course, it is great in technical point of view, the shot of the eye dilating is cool, all the visual effects are cool, and technically astonishing. But, it is just that, it is just cool. They do not mean anything, they are put there just to decorate the story, they are useless. And there is too many of them. I went to see a movie, not a parade of technical skills. A movie, not a video clip. What could have been an interesting aspect of the movie becomes boring and excessive.It is the same thing with the story, which I find extremely moralistic. Of course, drugs are bad, of course they can kill you, I don't need to pay ten dollars and suffer during two hours to understand it. My parents told me that many times before. Besides, the way Aronofsky uses to affect his audience is easy, sadly easy. He wants to shock you, and in the hardest way. And he goes for the easy way. It is easy to make you cry and to make you hate a character showing him kick a dog to death. In the same way, he shows you a rotting arm, gore sex and all the disgraces that can happen to a poor junkie or to his mother addicted to pills and TV. He never tries to say things in a subtle way, he things people who see his movie are idiots who can not understand anything unless he shows it, completely. He made a movie for idiots, I must repeat it.He does too much and is redundant in his message and in the way he tells it. I could elaborate, give more arguments and examples, but this movie really do not deserve more of my time. I have wasted enough seeing it. If ""Requiem for a Dream"" is worth something, it is just because of the images effects, because its subject, drugs, is the same a teenager would choose  and what he says about it is not much more mature. Drugs are not so interesting and this movie does not tell me anything I did not know before about them.

requiem for a dream,"Requiem for a dream is a film that is reason that i will never take drugs and from the subject that film is showing i will say that aronofsky was very sucesful in making it and putting it on screen,while trainspotting has more goofy vibe and comedic situations,requiem for a dream has none of that,and i say it is like that for the better of final product,it was really hard to watch how all characters are ruining their lives becase their addictions to drugs and also tv,mostly becase it was made in such realistic way that it put me through some nasty scenes,but that just give bigger impact to message,requiem for a dream is a very effective film drugs and how addictions towards them can easily destroy lifes",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"dream of a movie about a nightmare, for a world that needed such a wake up call","This is one of my favorite movies and I always suggest it.  The response I frequently get is how they didn't like it to which, after asking why they didn't, they respond, because it was horryfing or depressing, shocking, or something of the sort.  I think that is exactly what is so wonderful about it.  Aronofsky's Requiem shows to mercy to three kids who mind as well be faceless.  We live in a time of addiction and abuse to drugs and finally there is a film which sugar coats nothing.  What is most impressive about Selby's writing is how he's not just examined teenage drug use but adult drug use as well and in as much, knowing the problem is universal is all the more terrifying- no one is free from the clutches of addiction and uneccessary need and no one, at least should say, I can do it, I have a resistance, I can take just a little bit more.  Its about pushing lines and being stuck on the other side of them.  With special effects sequences which for once, don't take away from the movie but greatly add to its objective. Aronofsky throws life in our face, and we catch--in an almost welcomed discomfort--a problem, so real you feel your heart breaking for these characters everytime you watch. Leto, Wayans, the beautiful Connelly, and the wonderful Burstyn make the cast--cast rather well--and act circles around circles- wonderful performences, along with movie all unappreciated. Philip Glass provides the empowering tear-jerking requiem for a dream of a movie about a nightmare, for a world that needed such a wake up call. Definate A.",,Anonymous,Drama
A better-than-words sensory explosion.,"This is not a movie, it is an experience. From the beginning to the end, every element of this movie will touch you, thrill you, scare you, disgust you, and change you forever. It goes deeper into the subject of drug addiction than any other movie ever has. It also doesn't just focus on run-of-the-mill ""drugs"" (ie heroin or marijuana), it shows the viewer that we use drugs on a normal everyday basis (ie pills, coffee, and the worst of all, television). Requiem is the story of four people whose lives are totally different, yet totally the same. I apologize if you haven't seen this movie yet, I cannot possibly tell you here how amazing this movie is. My words are dulling it down and making it so much less than it really is. I want to sound smart and analyze every part of this movie but it just isn't possible. There is too much.

The splitted camera just does not work and mostly the entire film is made of foregrounds which makes it visually uninteresting.

Awesome film and teaches you a good lesson,Darren Aronofsky bravo for starters!! Of all the films I've watched of his this has to be the most depressing but downright phenomenal direction of a piece of art. Not only are the cast amazing the sheer brilliance of storytelling is pure class. Everyone has an addiction to something and this just hits that home it doesn't necessarily mean it's completely as bad as others. People deal with it differently. The music for me is what makes this a powerhouse - The Kronos Quartet drives the emotional impact of this film with each season that it descends on.

Style over substance,"Let me start by saying that I generally like ""feel-bad movies"" and I liked ""Pi"". This movie, however, completely failed to work for me.I think the main problem is that this movie tries too hard. It tries too hard to carry a serious message across and it tries to hard to be really artistic. In my opinion, the director loses himself in one gimmick (splitscreen, fast forward, curious editing) after another, and that really hurts the story and character development. All the fancy editing was probably done to create a surreal atmosphere similar to a drug trip, and it partly works, but a bit more restraint would have been welcome.The first hour of this movie is a fairly boring. Sure, it looks great, but it's really going nowhere. We get to meet the characters, but we don't really get to know them. The things they do are fairly predictable and mundane, and the pace is rather slow. After the first hour, terrible things start happening to the main characters, but I had a hard time caring about any of them since they're so poorly fleshed out, and the things that happen to them are so extreme that it's hard to take them seriously. Ellen Burstyn does a wonderful job, but the other actors' performances are really not that special.I admire the people who made this movie for making such a direct and tragic movie about a heavy subject, but this eventually I think this movie goes way overboard. With more focus on substance (characters and story) instead of style (flashy visuals) and a more subtle approach this movie might have worked. As it is now, it's still an interesting movie to watch, but definitely not a good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"captivating cinematography, boring motif","applause...The most outstanding thing about Requiem for a Dream is not the plot or characters. What is exceptional is the cinematography. Aronofsky does an excellent job of producing the feeling of simulacrum. You almost feel as though you as a viewer are doing the drugs and living the dream.The sheer intensity of this film caused myself and coharts to spiral into heart palpatations. I found myself so unsettled that I could hardly sit still.Ellen Burstyn phenomenal acting left me with a lasting impression of true feministic crisis of Talmudic proportion (i.e. Eve and the cynic apple).disappointment...Though I understand stories and movies alike only have so many motifs in which to work with, I am truly bored with movies diverging into the drug world.Four dreams seem to be highlighted to me...television star/the beauty incarnate of the American woman(i.e. low fat)...the marriage crisis of nuclear families...the need for sedation to be a coplacent citizen...and the necessity of wealth. All of these dreams seem to be bent on stereotypical necessities. These necessities of course being strictly or seemingly created by American ideology.So I am fascinated that the idea that narcotics are a key (although obviously presented as the wrong key) to the satiation of the American dream. Rather droll to me...I wonder did Aronofsky work with DEA on the production of this film. Some balance would be encouraging to me (although one could argue that the girlfriend who was satiated at the sacrifice of her body could be interpreted as positive...perhaps a pan sexual entity such as Walt Whitman might view it as so romantic).conclusion...All in all I though this movie was a masterpiece. I simply have questions about the validity of the overall impression that the movie leaves you with. I am not blind however and understand that this opinion is subjective.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Dreamy Trip Through the Hell of Addiction,"One of my favorite moments in cinema occurred when Cocteau's hero in Blood of the Poet desperately tries to rub off a pair of lips from the palm of one of his hands. Having rubbed the lips from the a portrait he has painted, the artist is told by the living statue in his studio that a scar like that is not that easy to remove. From there, the hero is thrust into a Kafkaesque dreamscape where he realizes that `sleeping or dreaming, the dreamer must accept his dreams.' There is such a sensibility in the new Aronofsky film, as characters seem to float between a harsh realities and dreamscapes.If Darren Aronofsky is remembered for anything in the annals of filmmaking it will be for staging the definitive `drug movie.' It is a masterwork of cinema that manages to stage the act of drug use as a cacophonous act of self-destruction where the individual will scale the ends of a their seemingly shallow existence in order to further dissociate themselves from their self-imposed, pathetic lives.Aronofsky goes for the jugular as he bombards the viewer with a dirty, lyrical pathos that is instantly reminiscent of the seemingly masochistic fashion that Paul Thomas Anderson greets his characters in the climax of both Magnolia and Boogie Nights. Take the final image of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark and stretch that for nearly two hours and you have the gut-wrenching and harrowing effect of this film.Manipulation is a word that is too easily thrown around when talking about films like this. Those who have suffered or have seen others suffer from the effects of addiction will no doubt find a very confrontational truth to this film. Aronofsky, whether personally familiar with the chaos of drug use, knows the desperation of the addict who seeks out the next fix like a vulture scavenging on a rotting corpse.Eugene O'Neill's maternal figure in `Long Days Journey Into Night' was a sad, pill-popping woman who was hopelessly stuck in the past. Her only link to her drug-free past was a wedding dress lying quietly in her closet. Ellen Burstyn is that woman. Slowly wilting away in her Brooklyn apartment, her husband in his grave and her son catering to his growing heroine addiction, Sara Goldfarb finds herself compelled by the simple pleasures provided by a TV game show that promises self-actualization to its viewers in the form of fortune-cookie wisdom. One phone call later and the promise of being on the TV show has Sara shockingly falling into a vortex of self-imposed hatred as she desperately tries to fit into the red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation.This is no dream that is being lived, but a self-imposed reality, and Aronofsky stages the descent into hell as an act of mourning. Clint Mansell, who orchestrated a phenomenal music for Aronofsky's Pi, creates some of the more dramatically effective crescendos imaginable; beautifully complimenting the journey these characters take into nothingness.The final images of the film, focusing on the winter of the characters' lives, is admittedly extreme, but only in the sense that it spares the viewer nothing in showing them the degrading lengths people will go to, and the degrading end results that welcome them, at the hands of addiction. And when teachers instruct their students as to how to master the fine art of drama, let it be known that Ellen Burstyn will be remembered for having given one of the finest and most revelatory performances to have ever graced an image of celluloid.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
This is one of the greatest addiction movies ever created,"Requiem for a Dream (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows some friends in Coney Island who have addictions to crack.

"All I can say is, wow.","""Harry...can you come today?""I think Darren Aronofsky is such a brilliant director, because every movie that he's done makes you feel something. Requiem for a Dream made me feel uncomfortable, depressed, and a little sick on the inside, and it's an amazing movie for achieving those things.This is a movie about addictions, appropriately divided into sections entitled Summer, Fall, and Winter. An interconnected group of people take parallel journeys as a result of their habits, and the viewer comes along for the painful ride. Requiem isn't really a ""preachy"" movie, if that's what you're expecting. It's a little hard to describe it in a quick review, it's something that needs to be seen and experienced. And it is an experience, for lack of a better description. The same way that Mulholland Drive is an experience. It's something that goes beyond just sitting down for two hours to be entertained.I have to make special mention of the way camera techniques are used to augment the story. The camera angles and various film styles employed here are just brilliant, and greatly helped draw me into the story. The score was great, as well.Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece, but it would be inaccurate for me to say I enjoyed it.

Ugh.,"Glad I saw this film.  Never want to see it again in my life. I'm not sure why Hubert Selby Jr. has taken it upon himself to present us these basically likable people and subject them to such nerve-ripping torture and misery.  Sadism, perhaps? This is not to say that there aren't beautiful elements in the film.  I could go for miles on the ""Summer"" section.  Ellen Burstyn's speech on growing old and being alone is extraordinarily sad, and the friendship between Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans is a true joy.  Wayans' energy is simply wonderful.  And Jennifer Connelly?  Oh, my.  It truly is a shame that there aren't more women out there with her looks and her energy, and confidence and sexuality.  It's even more shameful that the ones who are are all spoken for. But I digress. I can understand the point this film makes:  addiction is bad.  (Boy, never heard THAT before!!)  But it also points out many of the legal addictions that many commentators seem to have forgotten:  chocolate, coffee, television, drink, food...longed-for letters in the mailbox, the desire for money, music, sex, love, hope... It would be nice to have some kind of light of hope to hang on to.  But it seems as thought Aronofsky just wants to subject his viewers to nausea, revulsion(do we really need to see a needle jamming into a festering purple sore?  or a sexual degradation done THAT explicitly?!?), and a depression so intense, you just want to jump out the nearest window. Ugh. Nice vision of ""Summer,"" Darren.  And incredible artistry and editing.  Now, PLEASE, for the rest of us, give your sadism a rest and give us images of real beauty. I'll settle for ninety minutes of staring at Jennifer Connelly in that red dress at the edge of the pier, or just have her staring at me. But keep me away from movies like this one!",,Anonymous,Drama

Sophomoric is the right word,"I loved Aronofksy's visual style in Pi, and was really excited, at least in the beginning parts of Requiem for a Dream, about getting to see that style executed in vivid color.  But the plot of this movie almost seems to be a joke on the most time-worn arthouse cliche, which is that arty films are inevitably depressing.  Requiem for a Dream is so depressing its boring. Paraphrasing the local paper reviewer, not only is there no hope for the characters, there is not even a possibility of hope.  We know from the very first scene in the movie that it can only get worse for these people, and it does, forthwith.  And then it keeps on going for another thirty minutes. And then for another thirty minutes.  On the way out of the theater, my friend wondered aloud why he hadn't walked out halfway through the picture, and had instead chosen to ""sit there and let Aronofosky stab me in the eye with a hot poker for another hour.""  The reason, we eventually decided, was that the voyeuristic experience of this film is essentially pornographic. It may be lacking the visual gore of, say, Hellraiser III, but it is just as Sadistic.  You get to watch these four people writhe in agony for about two hours.   First you're nauseated, then you're numbed, and then you're relieved that it's only a movie and slightly exhilirated because it could never happen to you.  If that sounds like your idea of a aesthetic experience, then Requiem for a Dream may work for you.  It didn't for me.

All you have to do is put an adorable little kitten up on the screen and have some guy wring its neck.""",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Everything that DARE warned you about,"Oh how I loathe this movie! The first thing that came to mind after watching it was the two hours I wasted hoping something would happen. The second thing that came to mind was the line in Trainspotting ""people always focus on the misery, death, and despair around heroin, and that's not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. After all we're not f**king stupid"" This movie does seem to forget the pleasure and just assume that it's stupid charecters are REALLY stupid. I have no pity for any of the charecters who never seem to question their own motives (a quality I quite liked in Renton). The charecter played by Ellen Burstyn is especially nauseating. It took all my mental faculties to prevent myself from fast forwarding through her highly annoying parts. How can anyone feel sorry for a diet crazy, TV addict? And I may not know much about diet pills, but I seriously doubt that you begin to visually hallucinate from them.I guess what I'm really trying to get at is how is this anti-drug propaganda any diffrent from the infamous and laughable drug propaganda of the late 1930's????? I'm reminded of Reefer Madness and The Devil's Harvest. While those movies deal with marajuana which has arguably never harmed anyone, and this movie deals with heroin which has helped ruin or at least sidetrack many people's lives, the blame game in either movie sounds the same. Since human beings have a free will and drugs do not, the shift of blame should fall entirely on the humans and their choices. The unanswerable question for the charecters in this lame movie is this: Drugs or otherwise, if these people were this stupid to have gotten themselves in these situations, how far would they have gone anyways??????????????I'm so disappointed by Darren Aronofsky. I really enjoyed Pi.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Twisted Story from Aronofsky,This simply the stunning and disturbing film but at the same time very interesting to watch...,8.0,Anonymous,Drama
It's campy but in a way; effective.,"Requiem for a Dream-**1/2-See it- Directed by: Darren Aronofsky, written by: Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr., Starring: Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Latcher, Keith David, Sean Gullette.Director Darren Aronofsky teams up with mainstream actors for his newest feature based off the disturbing and jarring novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. The plot covers the story of a New York drug addict (Leto) who finds his world collapsing due to his overuse and perpetual need of drug influence. As he falls into his self-inflicted hell, his elderly mother (very well played by Burstyn) who is obsessed with a television show becomes hooked on prescription diet pills. Connelly plays Leto's girlfriend who gets caught up in the drama of drugs and Wayans plays his dealer who goes into a hell himself.Hallucinatory storytelling with lots of clever dream sequences throughout given the extra boost by a lot of firm acting. Burstyn is incredible in her role and Leto fairs pretty well too. Wayans is not too shabby himself in an uncharacteristic performance in a film that is a change for the comic. Aronofsky is a clever storyteller with firm stylistics and a good eye for hellish fetishes and images. His portrait of contemporary drug addicts is pretty much well-done for all intents and purposes.The question is where did Aronofsky fail? His biggest problem is his insistent use of quick cuts. That is what separates this drug film from Cronenberg's Naked Lunch or Boyle's Trainspotting. He is intent to make this more like an MTV made for television film than anything. If it was not for his talent as a director, it probably would be one of those. This is an addict film made for pop houses, not art houses. That is the weakness of the film as a work of art.If we define films based off clever style, Aronofsky would have made a masterpiece. To the misfortune of the young director, that is not what makes a great film great. The stylistics are the best the crew has to offer, but the actors certainly give it their all. Each actor is in great form and inhabit their roles well. His pop style may be thin as air, but Aronofsky's use of actors is as prevailing as ever. Each actor is used incredibly well and Burstyn is so frighteningly realistic that I have a new image of this old woman. We can use style and we can use great actors, but the writing and the storytelling is still the most important aspect to any film.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

This movie takes you through the drug addictions of 4 characters and how it would affect their lives, and how as soon as you get to the addiction stage of these drugs then you will do whatever you can to keep them up. This is a fantastic movie in my opinion and would recommend it to any and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A powerful but overwrought drama that would have been better for more subtlety and less camera tricks.,"'Requiem' is one of the most overrated movies here on IMDB. To be sure it is an intense, often gripping and very well acted film. Ellyn Burstyn was unlucky not to get best actress for her harrowing role. However the film is badly directed: there are far too many camera tricks used and it feels like an exhibition of 'things I film school'. If it was just when the characters are tripping out on drugs, then the distorted camera views and use of fast-forward, slo-mo and fast editing of images would be effective. But when such things are overused, as they are here, they distance the viewer from the reality that the movie is trying to portray. They come across as showy rather than brilliant and break your suspension of disbelief.Another thing that is rather hard to swallow is the casting of the young drug addicts: they are just a bit too good looking. Jennifer Connelly in particular is so angelically beautiful it is hard to imagine her as a drug user. She is a talented actress but, as in 'A Beautiful Mind' I think they should have cast someone who looked a little more average, who showed more of the wear and tear of life on her face.The movie also thinks that it is smarter than it is - but it lacks the wit or gritty realism of 'Trainspotting' and basically all it has to say is that drugs are bad. It does do a powerful job of showing just how badly they can screw up your life, but really anyone with a brain knows that already.'Requiem for a Dream' is very good, but it seems a little simplistic and loud when compared to truly great (and, significantly, non-American) films like 'Once Were Warriors' or 'Trainspotting' that also deal with drugs and domestic hells.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

when Dreams turn into Dust...,"""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of the most immersive and shocking films of all time and in the end the movie turns into a feeling, an emotion- of unescapable sadness. One can say that it works as a complete drugs-do-bad movie, but the film is far more than that. It is a sad and tragic story of lost dreams and self destruction.At first, the way this is filmed adds so much to the experience. We get sthe same close-ups and fast transitions (it's like Edgar Wright was in the edit room) everytime the characters consume their ""thing"".We also get some split-screne sequences and uring the climax the film enters deeper and deeper into the human mind and a couple of sureal sequences are shown.All these make for an immersive and ""ugly"" experience that is ment to be desturbing. The only stilistic choice that I found too much was the some split screen moments whixh i think do not add a lot to the experience.But afar from the tremendous filming endavour...this film tells so much about the human condition and the black holes that a peron can fall into. In the film, all of the four ""vicitms"" want sometihng, have a strong desire and they all fall in the same pitfall in order to complete their want.
A lonely widow who wants to be ""someone"" and gai happyness by being loved and famousHer son who wants to find a money, make some money and have a girl
His girl who loves modeling and clothes and wants to make her own shop
And the man's firend who believes that by being succesful at a field he will make his mother happy and proud.All these dreams are shattered by their addiction to drugs. They lose their mind, their sanity, their love, their life.And it all eels so tragic and nightmarish.I mostly loved the more sutle scenes , like the conversation between mom and son about their situation. But the sureal sequences during the climax where pretty affecting too.Also, I really do not thing that this film is only about drugs, but cna be seen as a showcase of the consequences of our obsesions and addictions in general. And even the film is centered around drugs, we notice other addictions and obsesions too. Being mad for sex, for money, fame, recognition, love and acceptance, mad for food or for a calm life without worries are all addictions presented in the film and are all dangerous. The film shows that the only one that can destroy us really is our own self and our inability to control our desires which gradually become more and more monsterous.The characters are nicely written, they feel like real people,tohugh i think the young femal character was kind of underdeveloped and lacked a second layer. The performances are all exceptional, somobody give the actress playing theold womn another slice of grapefruit because she truly deserves it!The score is haunting and I liked that the movie used it corretly.You have to see this film and i might wreck you o pieces or make you rethink your small, unimportant existance but in the end eveything will be ok.Just kidding.

But, seeing this movie was an experience unlike ""seeing a movie"" had ever been before in my life. Seeing this movie is more an experience that rivals losing your virginity, attending a parent's funeral, or getting in a car accident. I almost left the theater to throw up not out of disgust (although there were a few disgusting images), but out of anxiety. I've never walked out of a movie, and almost had to leave my first one not because of how bad it was, but because of how good it was.

I-O,"What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls.Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors. Love it or hate it, it's a film that simply can't be ignored, unsparing cinema produced by a most gifted director. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Brutal,I feel like I just got hit in the face with a shovel. What a masterpiece. There is no escape from it. A simple tale of spiraling addiction told with absolute devastating honesty. A warning to all human beings. The music reverberates with that Lux Aeterna strings riff that eventually feels like a terrible line of poetry as the story spirals down into a very dark place indeed. Aronofsky is one of the must interesting directors in the world today. He obviously cares only about making pieces of art and this time he has made one so dark and powerful that it should come with a warning label. I was expecting something along the lines of Drugstore cowboy - but this is much much more powerful stuff and much darker. Just wow.,10.0,Anonymous,Drama

The characters demanded no sympathy and deserved their respective fates. If the movie's aim was to show how bad drugs are, or can be, then it is stating the obvious. If meant as a lesson to prospective drug users, the wrong medium was chosen to send such a message. There was a hint of glamor and excitement when dealing with the decadence that was the characters.

Darren Aronofsky Has Created an Another Artistic Masterpiece.,"Pi has been my favourite film ever since I first saw it in 1998. Everything about it is, in my eyes at least, perfect.  No matter how many times I watch it, I cannot grow tired of it.  I have bought the soundtrack, the screenplay, the video, the dvd, and ever since I first saw it in the theatre, I have been waiting for Darren Aronofsky's second film.  Requiem for a Dream amazed me.  Words cannot begin to describe how intense this film is.  Watching a Darren Aronofsky film, for me, is so much more than watching a movie.  You get drawn into this little world, and you experience everything.  Darren Aronofsky becomes god for ninety minutes, and you are completely under his control.  This film was nearly flawless, and I cannot name a single instance  of this film where I was not uneasy.Although this film is incredibly intense, I don't feel that the measures movie theaters are taking to prevent young people from seeing it are necessary.  Frankly, I think that the reality of the film is enough of a deterrent to drug use, and that the sexuality of the film IS NOT SEXY.  IT IS NOT MEANT TO ENCOURAGE SEXUAL DEVIANCY... IT SHOWS WHAT DRUGS CAN DO TO YOU.Requiem for a Dream is an artistic masterpiece whose full effect on the viewer cannot be described in words.  This film needs to be experienced to be fully understood, and any viewer can benefit from subsequent viewings. It may be gritty and real, but Requiem for a Dream is a truly beautiful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Fantastically Based On Harsh Reality. ♦ 86%,"Music & cast performance are the best things this film can boast about. Other than these, the depressing theme actually is a piece of art.The narrative is gradual & the climax totally pulls it off, giving its viewers the much required food for thought. I am really impressed by the lead four actors' characters & their portrayal. Jennifer Connelly & Ellen Burstyn are brilliant.Now, with the cinematography & editing, it is totally different from most of the movie made. The fast cutting editing totally mesmerized me. In less than 110 minutes, the story of different addictions is totally fathomable. I wonder someone makes a film on the latest addictions.Although, telling a grim story, the second half is duller than first and as it approaches the end, becomes a tad boring. But the music of course keeps you engrossed. Moreover, the message that it has to give is very thinkable & thus, I rate it a good 8.6/10.BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended because of its music, editing & theme.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Requiem For A Dream brings the statement 'The road to Hell is paved with the Best of Intentions' sharply into focus,"There are very few films that exist that leave the audience emotionally devastated as they leave the theatre.... Requiem For A Dream is a condensed reality brought alive throughout the medium of film via Hubert Selby's novel, Darren Aronovsky's exceptionally capable direction, the stunning performances by each of the characters and Clint Mansell's hypnotically beautiful yet sorrowful score. The film's incredible power comes from the sheer beauty and in some cases, naivety of the characters. Their choices, despite being filled with hopeful aspirations, lead each to their own personal hell and self-destruction. The tragic ironies that each character encountered in terms of their past and in terms of there present reality, left Me emotionally pummeled as a viewer. At some points, it was almost unbearable to watch (not that I looked away). If ever there were an anti-drug film to deter future users, this would be it. This film is a must see for every individual, no matter from what walk of life.... even if you are not a film goer. I will not call the film a piece of art outright (although it is certainly that) but rather a piece of brutal reality polished and mirrored in the art form of cinema. I extend My warmest thanks to the creators and distrubutors of this film. It is films like these that give Me the hope that even though the quality of films these days have degenerated somewhat, that something somewhere went right in creating and bringing this work to audiences worldwide. To finish up this review I will borrow the words in agreement from the previous reviewer and state that Requiem For A Dream is incredibly powerful cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

I really hate these kinds of movies,"I have to say, I really hate movies like Requiem For A Dream.From a technical standpoint, Requiem is an excellent movie.  Based off the Selby novel from the late 70's, Requiem follows the lives of four drug addicted New Yorkers.Ellen Burstyn plays Sarah Goldfarb, a lonely widow who spends most of her time watching infomercials and longing for her deceased husband.  After she receives a phone call notifying her that she is in the running to appear on T.V., Sarah becomes ecstatic.  She gets her hair done, and pulls out her favorite red dress to wear to the show.  Sarah finds however, that she can no longer fit in her dress.  After a failed diet, a quack doctor prescribes her ""uppers"" which, though effective for weight-loss, ultimately drive her insane.  Her son, played by Jared Leto is a heroine addict who also deals with his buddy, played by Marlon Waynes.  Leto's girlfriend Mary, played by Jennifer Connelly is also addicted, and dreams to one day open a clothing store.As  I said, technically this film is excellent.  The cinematography, along with the soundtrack and acting all complement each other.  It's just the horribly depressing plot which keeps this movie from being one of my favorites.  There is no comic relief, and the characters keep falling deeper and deeper.Watch it once, and see.  Maybe you can handle it better than I.(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

On the other hand, there were some hard things to look at with some of the other characters that were upsetting, but didn't put me off to the movie.

"very good movie, the first time around. Then . . . . .","The first time I saw this movie I loved it and I would tell so many people about it. It definitely left an impression on me.Then i decided to watch it again. The second time around this movie was seen for what it really is, or at least can be. This movie drips of propaganda and the viewer is left drinking the excesses of the creators viewpoint. One thing they teach you in NA (Narcotics Anonymous) is that drugs lead to one of three places. Jails, Institutions and Death. This movie introduces another destination, slavery, but holds up the credo and teachings of organizations such as NA.Through imagery, conversation, suggestion and the occasional blast of visual information, the creators work very hard to show the viewer the users side of the story as well as the ""outsiders"" views and opinions of the main characters.We hope for the best as Harrys mom makes her decision to use diet pills to lose whatever iota of fat she thinks she has before her television appearance. We are left feeling sad for her though as she begins her decline into delusion only to end up institutionalized.All in all, the characters work together very well and the movie is better than many other creations out there.

Unbearably powerful; ranks as one of the greatest films of all time,"It has been two days since I have watched Darren Aronofsky's second feature, Requiem for a Dream, and I have just now begun to regain some sense of composure.  Aronofsky has created one of those rare films that are so astonishing in emotional power and technical brilliance, and it has had the effect of leaving me staggering for two days following the experience.  This film is an achievement that is easily worthy of mention along side Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now.The content of Requiem for a Dream has been established in most of the comments before mine, and thus I will instead address a few select points. With the addition of Requiem for a Dream to his resume, Darren Aronofsky must now be considered one of the most visually arresting directors currently working in cinema.  I must once again address comments pertaining to Aronofsky's supposed use of ""MTV visuals"", and wonder whether it is the wish of this society to remove all innovation from the use of the film camera.  Those who condemn Aronofsky's style remind me distinctly of the boorish studio executives who took it upon themselves to cut Orson Welles' Touch of Evil because his technique was too revolutionary.In the style of all great visual directors, Aronofsky uses the camera to not simply capture his story, but to convey those emotions and psychological intangibles that an actor is not capable of providing the audience with.  As the characters in Requiem for a Dream spiral further into the tragic abyss of drug addiction, Aronofsky is able to, in every single sequence, provide the perfect shot with which to establish the psychological condition of his actors--a condition that cannot be portrayed in any other way due to the very nature of illicit drugs.Behind Aronofsky's talent is an emotional experience of unbearable power, punctuated by astonishing human performances from all four of the lead characters, most notably Ellen Burstyn in one of the most brilliant performances I have ever witnessed; her loss to Julia Roberts continues to prove that the year 2001 held the most shockingly commercial Academy Awards ceremony in the history of the institution.  The descent of the characters is completed with one of the most brutal, shocking, and emotional sequences in cinema history, a frenetically edited finale which generates such emotion that it cannot be adequately described with mere words.  Finally, Clint Mansell's brilliant soundtrack must be mentioned, as it is as vital to this film as any of its other aspects.In closing, Requiem for a Dream is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and stands as the most important parable of addiction ever captured on film; this film not only should, but must be shown to every child considering illicit drug use.  Much like Malick's aforementioned The Thin Red Line, Requiem for a Dream will be considered truly great in 25 years, when the likes of Gladiator and Shakespeare In Love have long since been forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
perfect,"This movie is brilliant. It captures the lonely, paranoid, and completely out of touch with reality world that drug abusers live in. It uses complex camera angles combined with brilliant music, to make the viewer able to experience the up's and down's of a drug induced euphoria. I myself have been struggling with some drug problems. I didn't think that the feelings could be captured on film. But I was definitely wrong. Every time I watch the film, I am amazed at how accurately it portrays being inside the minds of drug abusers. All of the main characters are excellent in this film. It shows how at first, all drug users start out using the drugs to escape from reality into a ""dream"" world, but how eventually, not being able to let go of that ""dream"" ends up being their downfall. This movie keeps you in suspense the whole time, and by the end of the movie, you feel like you've experienced all of the hell that the characters have been through.

"Flawed, but thrilling film-making","Amazing on a purely cinematic level – assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good (Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along. By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the top, and a bit illogical.Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity.

Addicted self-destruction,"Addiction is more potent than any drug known to man, and it can lead to achievements or despair. Watching addiction occur to a person you know can be impossible to spot and you rarely know which route it leads to. It is therefore important to take notice and pay close attention given that you suspect someone is addicted.Looking at a person who struggles in life, how/where/when can you draw a line in the sand to pinpoint the place and date to where it all started to go wrong. Was it when she broke a leg and got painkillers from a doctor? Was it when he went to the gym and didn't get the progress he wanted? Or was it when your friend suddenly got popular and relevant after not being so for years.Requiem for a dream excellently depicts the stages of addiction and how it slowly ruins life no matter the age. A seemingly all right lady (Ellen Burstyn) who dreams of getting back to life in the past suddenly believes she has won a contest and her life is about to change for the better. With that belief sown in the ground like a seed, she begins to take uppers to try get into shape for her tv- gameshow debut.With equally interesting side stories occurring the synopsis of all their stories are the same. They all have a belief of their life changing for the better, and they therefor risk going into a cycle of despair with the possible glorious outcome in mind.This movie is a hard-hitting gritty masterpiece, and it features some excellently shot scenes. You can tell when you watch this movie that certain scenes must have been a pain to shoot, referring to the many time lapsing scenes where the camera pans sideways. The effort is however much appreciated, and it just gives so much more to each scene. This is a very visually graphic movie, and it is a movie you watch once and remember forever.Before watching this movie, I hadn't seen a Darren Aronofsky film before, but after watching this movie, ill certainly be adding his name and movies to my watchlist.My rating: 90/100.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Very nihilistic drug addiction movie....,"Darren Aronofsky is anything but conventional, and this is another in that line. There have been various excellent movies on the inner workings of drug addiction (e.g. Trainspotting), but there are countless stories to tell and this is another that ranks highly. Centres round a circle of drug addicts who are caught up in a downward spiral, with the mother of one of them finding herself unintentionally mirroring their errors.There are many facets to recommend this movie to any adult. The story is well written, the direction is sharp and intriguing, and the acting is peerless. One of the most surprising parts is that by Ellen Burstyn in a role that just blows everything out of the water in this film as the mother who gets caught up in the drug addiction of her beloved son. She was just wonderful and heart breaking to watch. The rest are also excellent, and Jared Leto is unlikely to ever better this.The film direction is very sharp, with cuts/redirections very quickly to provide an unsettling feel. It works and unsettles you.We are watching the rapid inevitable decline of this circle of people, and it's uncomfortable to watch.

The cinematography really set the pace and it is so close to the real life desperation that comes with the territory that I was riveted to it. It just took me along with it to it's painful end. Burnstyn and Connelly were both brilliant in this. Definitely not a Hollywood feel good vacuous time waster but well worth the cringe factor. There's no room for ""what if."" The story is linear and tragically inevitable. Painfully memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
the danger of drugs,"Thsi movie is about a mother and a son who always use stimulant drugs. It is decided that the mother appears on a TV show, so she decides to lose her weight. When she hears about the medicine losing weight easily, she starts to drink it, but it is a drug. The son always use drugs, and he tries to sell the drug with his friend. This movie shows a lot of realistic scenes. For example, the son amputates his left arm, and blood splatters on his face. Besides, the mother is given electric shocks to treat the addiction to drugs. I think these scenes are effective to show drugs are dangerous and we should not use it, but I cannot forget them because of the shock. I was also impressed with the scene that she has a hallucination. As hallucination escalates, her mental goes collapsed. Her confusion and horror expressions convey the danger and risk of drugs. I do not like this movie because I cannot feel well when I watched it. However, it is important to know drugs make our life break. This movie is a good example to tell it. I will never use drugs, but I was very scared that my friends use it and break their lives. I think this movie is very realistic, so it makes me think so.",,Anonymous,Drama
I have a bit of a hot and cold thing with Aronofsky,"Pi remains one of my favourite films if not my favourite of all time, but then he's made plenty of rubbish too (The Fountain, Noah). Despite the acclaim that Requiem for a Dream gets, I always put it on the cold list, it quite literally left me cold. I thought it was time I gave it another chance though, maybe I'd just caught it at a bad time, perhaps I'd been unfair to it all these years. Mansell's score right away is something to enjoy, it's rich, immersive, ever present and it's superb. Picking right up from where he left Pi. The style that Pi had though is lost a little, but it does have something about it. Simple neatly composed shots, it flows like it's been storyboarded meticulously. The camera kept tight, often abstract. All that. I like. The jump cuts and split screens, spinning overhead shots get tiresome though, it's relentless. BUT that I think is the point, it's a war of attrition, beating the viewer down as the world of all the characters falls apart. There are several shared actors with Pi, in fact I think the entire cast is present, but here the characters portrayed, I simply didn't care about. It's heartless and distressing, packed with (now dated) 90s visual effects, fisheye lenses, speed ramping, audio distortions. If Lynch were in charge it may have worked, but where Lynch carefully crafts this stuff, Aronsofsky goes for the full kitchen sink. Ultimately it's just bleak without the artistry. A damning portrayal. Of drugs. Of society. Of America. Of celebrity. Of television. Of addiction to what people think they need in life. Slaves looking for the high, looking to be accepted. It is utterly depressing and for all its positives, that's the reason I don't like it. That all said I don't think I hate it as much as I once did.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Aronofsky's brilliant depiction of spiraling drug addiction,"There has been lots of buzz about this movie over the last few months, and I dismissed it all until I actually saw the film. Pure genius. We start with the characters which are real and easy to relate with, and move with them as they struggle to cope with their everyday lives, dreams, and addictions. We bond with them, and feel their pain as the go deeper and deeper into the abyss of drug abuse. Absolute brilliance.

Harrowing and (oddly) beautiful,"This is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen, but I can't rightly say that I *enjoyed* it.It's by the director of ""Pi"", which gives you an idea of what you're in for.

Twice as pointless as Magnolia and half as entertaining,"Firstly, as an anti-drugs film this is flawed, because the characters come across as being generally dislikeable regardless. Secondly, instead of pier-pressure or anything like that, these people chose to become drug addicts.Apart from the drug related messages in this film there's nothing of interest, there's no dialogue, no humour, nothing. This film is void of anything remotely intriguing.Whether intentional or not: the TV show kept releasing more information throughout, but never completed itself. This alone made the film fall flat, because too much effort was put into a segment that was left unfinished and pointless. Unless there's some message about life being a TV show and dying early through drugs means you will never get to see the end (yes I'm reaching).My point is this: with this type of anti-entertainment film the only point in watching it is the messages and guidance it may contain within, but this film doesn't contain anything. It's just a crap story about crap characters that the writer decided he wasn't going to end properly.If you want an anti-drugs film that gets the message across far better, and actually is entertaining then check out Trainspotting. I get the impression from this film that this is an attempt at a `cleverer' Americanised remake, obviously the writer of Requiem For a Dream missed the point entirely.Pure rubbish - 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
Simply Breathtaking,"I had heard about this film in late 1999 through word of mouth from some friends. After one of my friends saw this film they simply said, ""Don't do drugs!"". Hearing that comment got me even more interested in seeing this film. He told me it was visually breathtaking, and left you on the floor, lifeless.So, when it came to Duke University in late 2000, I jumped at the chance. I told my girlfriend to come see this movie because I heard it was a magnificent film with a strong message. I was in for a surprise. (And NO....this is NOT a date movie! :) My girlfriend will vouch for that!)Not only is it a magnificent film with a strong message, it is literally the only film I have seen in the past few years that actually scared me. I saw the characters slowly decline throughout film wishing I could do something for them. The impact this film has on people will change the movie industry forever. This was GROTESQUE but not gratuitously. This was extremely shocking images that weren't there for show, but to explain. To help you understand why some things are better left alone and how life is ruined so easily.My overall experience of this film was great and terrible at the same time. Seeing images that are depicted in this movie left me unable to even finish a cigarette afterwards, due to thinking of how bad it was for me.This movie should be in every Health awareness class. It will definitely change your mind about picking up a syringe. 10 out of 10! BRILLIANT!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A well constructed cautionary tale,"This is a harrowing watch in places. But it is also well constructed. Camera angles are distorted, as are the images, to create a sense of the disorientation that comes with drug use. Edits are used to show the repetition of the drug taking itself, as well as the various arrests. And the various stories, none of which end well, are convincingly told, so that the downward spiral they all take - some due to choices to get high, some due to bad choices over dieting pills, are all convincing, if neccesarily going to the worst extreme. The soundtrack also adds to the disjointed ness and disorientation of the film. This is not for the faint hearted, but it is well acted, directed and written, to add up to an excellent piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
As intense as films get ...,"Now this is film making.Like others who have posted comments, I find that only a tiny minority of films have the power to affect me on an emotional level. Films like Schindler's List, Man Bites Dog, Shawshank Redemption, A Clockwork Orange, Hana-bi and even Cannibal Holocaust are some notable movies that have pressed my emotional buttons in the past and have left me thinking long after the end credits have finished. Requiem for a Dream is another to add to the list and is honestly one of the most powerful movies that I've ever seen.Does the fact that a film tugs at your emotions automatically make it good? For me personally the answer is yes, especially as I'd estimate that way less than 1% of all the movies I've ever seen were able to reach me on any sort of real emotional level (be it good or bad). However, this is far from being the only reason I rate this film so highly.Many people find Requiem's ostensibly anti-drug message rather patronising. Some posts here even associate Requiem, unfairly, with crude propaganda films like Reefer Madness. I think this demonstrates an overly simplistic view of a film that is about much more than illegal drugs and I feel it is representative, understandably, of the attitudes of people who are so sick of society's hypocritical moralising about drugs that they have just stopped listening and hence dismiss the movie too lightly. To associate RFAD with Reefer Madness seems to demonstrate precisely the same sort of unthinking intransigence that we routinely associate with anti-drug zealots. However, whilst I sympathise with those who believe Requiem is just more patronising anti-drug propaganda, they are overlooking the incredible damage that the irrational, compulsive and addictive behaviour shown in the film can cause - be it in respect of heroin, caffeine, television, chocolate, shopping, anti-depressants, use of their mobile etc. etc.  Self deception is at the heart of this issue and I think these polarised comments arise from an unwillingness on the part of the viewer to allow the necessary introspection required to get the most from this film.On the other side of the coin, I have also heard comments from people suggesting that this film has added weight to their commitment to never use drugs and that anyone who does must be a fool. This is a somewhat naïve perspective and the same people who condemn drug use are almost certainly reliant on some `drug' of choice, be it coffee, sugar, pain-killers, anti-depressants, Jesus or whatever. I agree with these commentators that RFAD would be far more effective used in schools as a warning against the dangers of drugs than the patronising rubbish that currently passes as `drug education'. However to consider this film useful only as an anti-drug movie to scare kids into compliance is to greatly underestimate the reasons people start using these substances in the first place. After all, some people will always be attracted to drugs precisely BECAUSE of the dangers (and cachet) associated with their use.I also wish that the people who spend their time pointing out, for example, that ECT is normally used only on anaesthetised patients would save their nit-picking for the crass historical revisionism of films like Black Hawk Down or U-571 rather than pointing out inconsistencies irrelevant to the message of a film. Is Ben Hur rendered garbage because of an overlooked wristwatch? I think not.This is a movie that has something to say to EVERYBODY even if it is not on a topic explicitly covered by the on-screen mayhem. This is the sort of wake-up call we all need occasionally and watching with a smug `well, I've never used drugs' attitude is to miss the real point this film is trying to convey - that the obsessive reliance on any crutch, chemical, physical or emotional, in order to achieve the happiness we all crave is destined to end in disaster. This affects everybody on some level.RFAD is ample demonstration of Aronofsky's undoubted talent as a film maker. I greatly enjoyed the director's debut Pi and Aronofsky has taken many of the techniques that he employed in that movie to the next level here. I can understand why some may feel that the film is style over substance. Personally though, I think this is one of the most technically impressive examples of film making and editing that I have seen in a long time.The performances of the four main characters are all magnificent and Burstyn in particular is incredible. I also enjoyed seeing the underrated Keith David provides a wonderfully sleazy performance even if he is limited to only a very minor role.Special mention should also go to Clint Mansell's amazing soundtrack which adds immeasurably to the power of the film. From the sad, haunting main theme to the frenetic techno rumblings and staccato strings, the soundtrack is always a perfect accompaniment to the on screen drama. It is hardly original to ironically juxtapose a haunting and beautiful soundtrack with disturbing imagery in order to heighten the emotions of the viewer (the afore-mentioned Cannibal Holocaust being a perfect, if extreme, example of this) but here the soundtrack is employed to perfection.This is an amazing movie - intense, gripping, disturbing, provocative and gruelling to endure. Despite being so emotionally draining, this is one of the best films I have seen in the past few years and is more than deserving of it's high IMDB ranking. However, this is not for the faint hearted or those who can only enjoy a film if it makes them feel good. For anyone else this is essential viewing.I can't wait to see what Aronofsky comes up with next - let's just hope he doesn't get sucked into the system and turn into the latest Hollywood hack directing the sort of uninspiring, focus-group scripted tripe that the big studios are lamentably so good at churning out these days.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Shocking, amazing, awesome, etc: Requiem For A Dream.","There is something I have been telling my friends & family for a few months now. I have been telling them that there are three directors to watch out for, from America. The first is Harmony Korinne. The second is Paul Thomas Anderson. And the third, is Darren Aronofsky, whom debuted 1999 with the movie Pi, and made this movie; Requiem For A Dream.The first time I saw Pi, I was... Not shocked, but amazed. I thought to myself that Aronofsky never, despite Pi being his first movie, will do anything better than this (Pi). I couldn't be more wrong.The first time I saw Requiem For A Dream, I was shocked. Thrilled. Amazed. F*** Trainspotting, this is how it IS. And Basketball Diaries? C'mon, that's a feel good movie! The direction by Aronofsky is sheer brilliance, (and so is the acting, of course, especially Ellen Burstyn). The photography, is amazing and so is the music.Actually, it's just been a couple of hours since I saw it, and I haven't really landed yet, so to speak.All I can say is that this motion picture probably changed my life, today. 'Cause, you see, I will never, ever, touch a drug in my entire life after this. But the movie isn't only about drugs; it's about addiction, and Aronofsky shows that in a brilliant way.A word I (almost) never use when I describe movies and/or music, is art. But this movie truly is art. Art in the way that you can't get it out of your head, no matter how hard you try.And the last 15 minutes of this film is the most powerful sequences I have ever seen in a movie.Requiem For A Dream is THE best movie of the 30th century, so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Whew, What a Film","Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams ""Don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction.Ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest.Addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now.Requiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end.Ellen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there.This film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else – come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
there is no waking up from this Dream,"Let me be the first to mention exactly how powerful this film is. This film can very well change your life for the better. It is quite possibly the greatest gem in filming to be released since American Beauty. But even though this diamond is huge, it has a few faults. First it seems to lose its seriousness at points, and certain points seem random and err, well quite odd. That being said, this could be the greatest film ever. It has that eerieness that even when something seems so comical you cannot laugh. It is terrible to see what happens to these people, and I could hardly say that this movie will make you feel good once its over. At the end, more than likely you will sit in your seat for a minute just processing what you saw. This movie gives no hope, no beaken of light, and it shows the absolute worst case scenarios. If you think that our world is perfect, then Requiem will wake you up from that dream quickly, and once you wake up, you will only want to go right back to sleep. Definitely a powerful film. 9/10Pros: Characters feel real, it remains dark and bleak, tremendous acting.Cons: Repetition of one scene in particular where drug use is shown, however different the drugs or the process of using it, this scene stays the same. Honestly, thats all I can think of.Go buy this film, or at the very least, rent it and never bring it back to the store.",,Anonymous,Drama

A gentle degeneration.,"It very obviously, a sad story, but it didn't hit as hard as I thought it would. I was looking forward to watching it as it's described as one of the best deterrents to falling for drugs, difficult to watch, leaves you speechless etcetera etcetera but in the end it didn't move me as much as it's reputation led me to believe it would. Maybe it did bring out those reactions at the time of release, but after seeing several movies with similar themes; sure this is one of the better films but I find it difficult to put it at the pedestal it's on.In the end it's a story showing what people are willing to do for drugs and what the consequences of them are. What I did love is that you're left to judge the characters and their decisions on your own, the movie simply shows you their story and motives. You're shown the highs and the lows of their abuse, all searching for a feeling they want.There's little development at the start, mostly just them doing drugs. Later it starts to kick off, more so the consequences of the drugs from the first act, although not dire. Some of the conversations were great, the emotion carried in the dialogue especially by Ellen burstyn. I don't think the other actors had as much to do; going in I thought the story would mainly revolve around Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly's characters'; so it was a little bit of a twist to have her in too. All in all I think they all put in wonderful performances. A little sad/funny only the black guy ends up in jail, of course.A dark movie, both the subject as well as the aesthetics, with eerie soundtrack to match. As unsettling as it was, I wasn't moved until the very end. It's a good movie, I'd only recommend it if you're actually already interested. It's a slow and gentle descent into the abyss for two thirds of the movie but things go downhill real quick in the third act.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

yes,"""Requiem for a Dream"" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it be family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress, that she wore to her sun's graduation, on television. However, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. All of the characters have drugs (the bad kind) affect their lives, which eventually take over their lives. The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at, Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high' - all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast I started to find it hard to keep up, and literally took my breath away as the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that I have not personally experienced when watching any film before.",,Anonymous,Drama
"Skin-Deep screenplay, good directing and acting though.","After reading a few positive reviews and noticing ""Requiem for a Dream"" on several Top Ten lists, I went into the film with high hopes.  Even after a good digestion of the film, I was generally disappointed with the screenplay and skin-deep messages from the film.  Sure, the directing and acting were top notch, but when it comes down to whether or not the whole movie was quality, one cannot avoid the plot.How many times do we need to watch another supposed landmark film about drug addiction?  It's been done over and over again each time pushing the limit on grotesque scenes to make the audience cringe.  Rarely are horror films regarded as break-through for their blood and guts scare tactics, so why should a drama be?  Moreover, Requiem left nothing to the imagination during the film or after the closing credits.  Listen critics, there was nothing there, it's not deep, it's not satirical, it's just a good director, some quality actors, and an unoriginal wannabe screenplay writer adding some decent cinematography to cover-up the awful writing.I can't attack this film too much though because the Aronofsky was able to use his creative genius to warp this film into something worth watching just for his directing.  Without Aronofsky, this film would have been another....oh wait, critics love all movie with mind-twisting drugs involved.  Sure, there is a time and place for tripped out scenes or even films revolved around the subject itself.  Apocalypse Now and Traffic are two of my favorite films.  However, it's not original, it's not visually stimulating, and it's certainly not a breakthrough in film.For the directing and acting,6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Hard to watch and unflinching,"DRAMAPlot less film taken from a book written by Hubert Selby Jr. Who's also credited for along with Darren Aronofsky co-writing the screenplay. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, focuses the movie on four characters hooked on ""specific"" drugs. It seems like crack, uppers and heroin are the focal point upon the lives of 4 people which the viewers get the chance to see from the perspective of the characters point-of-view upon taking these ""specific"" drugs and the extent they would go to keep their doses frequent since not all drugs react the same way- director Darren Aronofsky uses plenty of camera tricks/ angles from every camera trick in the book including close-ups, the use of split screens, blurry visions, hallucinations and fast- forwarding the characters in an attempt so that the audience can see what they're seeing upon taking certain drugs. What several films such as ""Lost Weekend"", ""Barfly"" and ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" is to alcohol is ""Requiem For A Dream"" is to drugs, and while the audience are oblivious about how some of the characters got involved in drugs in the first place, we are wondering as we're watching this whether or not they can ever get out of it, and on what circumstances and to what cost. Courts are never shown here since the sentences are usually the same, and the characters motivations are understandable that is somewhat restrained so that viewers can identify with the characters drug addiction problems easier rather than hating them even more, because in real life, I've seen several crack addicts who steal and kill people to feed their habits and this film doesn't show that because it's not in any of the characters nature, for example- right at the beginning a son (Jared Leno) pawns his moms old TV set when he could've just go to thieving. Anyways, to say anymore would ruin the experience and will say that besides Leno, the film also stars Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar winning performance which garner her a nomination as Best Actress.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
So bad it's offensive,"I decided to finally watch Requiem for a Dream as I had heard it's name mentioned in high regard many times over the years, but boy nothing could have prepared me for how godawful it was.This film is not ""art"", and it's not entertaining either. It's glorified fluff. It's a composite of stories we've all heard a thousand times. We don't get to know any of the characters well enough to really sympathise with or care about what happens to them, aside from perhaps the mother. She was the only character that I could gather some semblance of a deeper understanding about, as at least some background information was given as we see a morsel of her life before the pills.The rest of the film follows vapid youth that fit run-of-the-mill stereotypes of African Americans/young women in addiction in particular (young black man ends up in jail, young woman ends up doing grotesque sexual favours for drugs). I'm not saying that these situations never happen in real life, but Jesus Christ, could they not come up with anything more nuanced than that? Was it written by people whose only knowledge of addiction came from conservative 1980s documentaries? When you hear that overdramatic violin music start to play, you know that you're in for a painfully predictable attempted shock tactic that ultimately falls flat.The film is disjointed and uncomfortable to watch (and not in a thought-provoking way, the only thought it provoked was whether the director was a 14 year old that had just come out of a high school anti-drug lecture) and serves only as a scare tactic for young people. Even then, it's surface-level depiction of addiction does little to scare anyone who isn't wildly sheltered. How people can praise this film as art or some kind of feat of storytelling is absolutely beyond me. Eye-wateringly boring, and no amount of decent shots or camera work could make up for that. 10 minute Vice documentaries shot by weedy teenagers do a better job of portraying addiction.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"An outrageous drug-mania that will shake your mind, brain and body from top to bottom. A Cinematic Masterpiece !","Requiem For A Dream (2000) :
Brief Review -An outrageous drug-mania that will shake your mind, brain and body from top to bottom. A Cinematic Masterpiece ! Requiem For A Dream is such an ordinary story as it depicts four characters affected by drug addiction and how it alters their physical and emotional state but have you ever came across the term called 'Director's Cinema'? It simply means, you give any kind of ordinary story to the director and he will turn it into an Extraordinary film. Well, THIS IS Director's Cinema. An ordinary story of drug addicts is turned into a disturbing Cinematic Masterpiece by director's brilliant mind and skills. The film shook me from inside as well as from outside just by the proper use of display and sound. The footage is drawn as such in the film with an outrageous use of background score that the cumulative result lefts you with Goosebumps. Especially in the last 40 minutes this film is like a Film-making course to everyone who wants to learn about quality cinema. Darren Aronofsky gets a salute from me for his Directorial brilliance. He presented this story with realistic gimmicks, brutality, abusive content and filth so that it shows you real damnifications of drugs. He made Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans go wild, crazy, nasty and abusive but it all worked and thier performances looked so freaking real. Clint Mansell deserves a special mention for his stunning score because without him this experience wouldn't have been the same. I can assure you, once you watch this film then you will never ever dare to touch or even think about drugs. This is an brutal assassination of drug freaks and a lesson to all those who either suffer from it or thier relatives who just endure them. Watch it to learn Cinematic genius and how to make a solid film from a decent content. I am still shivering while writing this review, that's says all i guess.

For its message and for its depiction of drugs it's worth checking out.,"A tragic and horrific showcase of how drugs could devastatingly plunge the lives of people into a state of turmoil. From the ecstatic earlier outcome of taking drugs to becoming an addict (either knowing or unknowingly), the movie does not hold back to show the possible effects of taking drugs and its brutal consequences, which especially was displayed at the climactic ending of the film.While the movie may not have the-best-in-the-class plot, at the end of the day, it delivers its moral message with that punch-in-your-guts feeling quite well, even if it may seem hyperbollic in its ways of portraying drug usage in many cases. The message is DRUGS ARE BAD!!! And the movie really wants you to keep that message in your mind for the rest of your life.#Watched on Oct 29, 2024.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
A rush of blood to the head!,"This is an extremely powerful tale of young couple and a mom. The perfect storyline, the visual effects and the tragic outcome is all together way too much for one to handle. But yet, along the movie- until the very last end an beyond, it gives a strange sense of fulfillment. It makes you wonder about what could have been, if you took a slightly different path in life. It makes you feel fortunate and melancholic. The movie really starts at the end. Because you are way to busy absorbing the all the input during the movie, you can't really reflect on it. But after, for a brief (or not so brief) period of time, you are barely a reflection of your formal self. This movie get to you, it creeps under your skin, through your arteries and into the most remote and hidden parts of your brain. And it makes you want to talk about it. A great movie!

don't believe the hype!,"OK, so its pretty good. Anything based on a book by Selby would have to be worth watching on pedigree alone. But despite what you've read, it's certainly not the best movie ever made. I think that if you watch tons and tons of movies, as most IMDB users undoubtedly do, then of course ""Requiem"" stands out from the usual, mindless dreck. But it's not all that. The performances are good, especially from Burstyn and Connolly, but I've seen this kind of thing done better, especially in ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"", another movie based on a Hubert Selby Jr. novel. You want to talk riveting, check out Jennifer Jason Leigh in that film. Editing's good here, as it was in ""Pi"". Is it just me or is Aronofsky making his reputation more on images rather than content? Pretty to look at, this film. My friend has severe ADD/OCD and she was even able to sit through it. All in all, ""Requiem"" is worth a look or two. Not a masterpiece, but I give it an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Unsettelingly brilliant,"Requiem for a Dream sticks. After watching the whole thing all the way through there wasn't a single scene that I couldn't look back on and think how utterly brilliant it was.While the start sets the scene in an almost cliché drug dealing VS proper morale mood, that all changes when the plot of the movie is observed. Each of the four main characters faces their own trials and tribulations, and each of them their pride before their fall.What strikes me most about Requiem is that although society tells us that we shouldn't be aligning ourselves with any of the characters because of their disgusting addictions I couldn't help feeling more emotionally attached to the cast than any movie I've ever seen. Each character fell prey to similar addictions but entirely different one's all the same. Each character was warped by their method to succeed, and that's what made it so brutishly heart wrenching.The ending was so beautifully crafted I ended up praying it would could keep going - the additions of wonderfully simplistic editing and soundtrack really encapsulated me.If you are looking for permanent emotional damage, and a fantastic narrative that explores the unsettling nature of addiction abuse - watch this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Everybody should see this movie.,"This is a near masterpiece. I have just watched this movie and I can tell you this is the first time i've cried over a movie in a very long time.

Jared Leto gives the performance of his career in my opinion.Don't expect a Martin Scorcese story with a crazy twisting plot with complex back story and side plots because you get none of that. It's quite evident what the movie is about from the get go. It's about the decay of peoples lives because of their drug use.

What is your addiction?,"For some reason I believed I wasn't going to enjoy this movie, but it was so much better than expected. The film depicts two very different kind of drug addictions, but both with the same damaging effects on the individual as they slowly but surely deteriorate.Harry and his girlfriend Marion, and their friend Tyrone, are using hard drugs, which they start selling to make money. Harry's mother received a call claiming she's been selected as a contestant for a TV show. Desperately wanting to wear a dress with sentimental value, she decides to go on a diet to fit in the dress again. These 'prescribed' slimming drugs eventually has a devastating effect on her, both physically and mentally.The film intercuts between the mother and the youngsters, effectively illustrating the demise of these four people. The editing is fantastic and I loved the film's visual style. The photography is excellent in creating the illusion of being in an intoxicated state. The film also has a very good score, good make-up, a good script, and superb performances. Ellen Burstyn, especially, was fantastic as the mother, Sara Goldfarb.I'm happy to say I've never done - or had the urge - to do drugs.

Requiem for a Dream (2000),"Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Keith David, Mark Margolis, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Sean Gullette.Unflinching portrait of addiction focusing on four desperate characters: a widow hooked on amphetamine diet pills (Burstyn), her son (Leto), plus his friend (Wayans) and girlfriend (Connelly), the latter three all heroin junkies. It doesn't take long for director Aronofsky's arresting filmmaking techniques to either electrify or repulse (depending on the viewer's tolerance for his method), using hypnotically rapid-fire editing, symbolic split screens, musical leitmotifs (composed by Clint Mansell), filters, film speed variations, and more to both simulate narrative and character urgency as well as mimic (but absolutely not glorify) the intense kick and all-too-quick dissolution of a drug high. There's no judgment or piety here, just an intense, skin-crawling examination of dependency, of degradation, of lives shattering; an inevitable result, but still painful to witness. No slackers in this cast, but Burstyn is especially good, delusion segueing into hallucination, all recorded in her physical expressions and cracking voice; hers is the most affecting tragic arc since she was the closest to innocence before the talons sunk in. A bit too lurid and cynical at times, with only a few veritable angles on theme/plot to set it apart from a dozen so-called ""drug movies"" before it, but it's the way it's told that sticks with the viewer and makes it a harrowingly unforgettable experience. Originally slapped with an NC-17 rating and then released unrated into theaters; avoid the compromised R-rated home video copies.91/100",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

"If you ever consider using drugs, see this first","Have you ever witnessed an event that not only moves you, but those around you who also witnessed it? You don't know these people, and probably won't see any of them ever again, but in the few minutes you are together and are all feeling exactly the same set of emotions, a bond exists that I couldn't hope to describe.During the closing credits of Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's new picture about 4 people whose lives spiral out of control due to drug addiction, the whole theater all but held hands and promised: ""Let's never, ever touch any of that stuff"".""Requiem"" tells the the story of Sara, a middle-aged woman who becomes addicted to diet pills in her futile attempt to feel needed. Sara's son Harry is involved in drugs, he not only sells but also uses heroin, and as the movie progresses he, his girlfriend Marion and his mate Tyrone become heavily reliant on the drug. Their reliance is artfully relayed by director Aronofsky, through close ups, fast editing and exaggerated sounds of the drugs, the methods of usage, and then the obligatory dilated pupil.The end result of these addictions is disturbing for each character, and although we can see it coming from a long way off, we keep hoping that things will change for these characters. In retrospect however, it is probably for the best that we see the long term effects of drug usage, as this movie will certainly deter you from ever considering drugs.

Burstyn's Picture Show,"Although the director and writers obviously care about the characters, the filmmaking techniques draw too much attention to themselves. The quick edits of popping pills, eyes dilating, and the effects of drug usage in the blood stream were quite effective however. But, I have to ask, is this what it takes to keep audiences involved nowadays?  Ellen Burstyn gives a courageous performance in what had to be a grueling shoot. The most harrowing scene in the film for me was not the climax at the end, but a little earlier on when Mrs. Goldfarb is riding the subway on the way to Madison Avenue to try to get on television. The director left a natural lens on the camera long enough to let Burstyn?s performance come through.   The other actors were also totally committed and the result shows in every scene. It was fun to see Louise Lasser and Marcia Jean Kurtz (memorable in ""Dog Day Afternoon"") as two of Goldfarb's friends.The theme of the piece seems to be the yearning to hide the pain of everyday mundane life--whether it's done by overeating, drugs, or sex. If you buy this and haven't seen this theme dealt with in film too many other times ad nausea--this will appear as an original work.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not For Me.  I'll Stick with Pi,"I enjoyed the previous effort by Requiem's directory Darren Aronofsky, Pi, but this one didn't work for me.  The subject matter is interesting enough (I loved ""Traffic""), but the out-of-control direction and annoying camera angles overwhelmed the plot and the acting.There weren't enough scenes over a few seconds for me to even get a flavor for what was going on within the actors.  Those emotions were supposed to have been communicated through the visual medium rather that dialog, however I found it to be ineffective.  It's a shame.  I am a fan of Jennifer Connelly since seeing her in Once Upon a Time in America.  I think Jared Leto is a fine actor, but again, I couldn't tell from this movie.At age 41, perhaps I just haven't watched enough MTV to follow manic cinematography.I felt the ending was cheesy and pandering, so it didn't carry the emotional power that was intended, either.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
Desire make people blindness. And what is all about of feeling of emptiness.,"It was a film with mystic force that made me stared at from the beginning when I started to watch. The story is a quite simple that two stories are running parallel to go for drug and become addicted. Main characters are four actors: Harry (Jared Leto) & his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone earn their living on the drug and theft and Harry is getting to become addicted to drugs with his girlfriend Marion. I like a scene that Harry and Marion are laying down talking their love, which is a very fantastic scene in this film. Although they are talking drugs, there exists something true and pure sense of love between them; he loves his girlfriend the best in the world and make the most of every minutes with their love. This scene would emphasize the last half that drugs break up their relationship.On the other hand, Harry's mother Sara starts dieting since she got an odd call that she can appear on the TV. She tried to diet as much as possible she can. She starts relying on medicine for a diet before long and she often sundown that she appears on the TV or see the fridge shaking due to extreme diet or starving.The ending is in the depth of without the beacon of the hope. It may be easier to guess in this kind of drug story but still suffer from feeling of emptiness and kind of helpless feeling after watched this film. But I'd say this is a great movie at the same time.Ellen Burstyn, being 70-year-old shows an amazing portrayal who make her life change from a common life to become a drug addict and have to be in a drug rehabilitation. Also Jennifer Connelly's play, become a drug addict, quarrel with his boyfriend Harry, have a sex scene for getting drugs, this her devoting work worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
How far are you willing to go to accomplish your dreams?,"This movie took me by a great surprise, i thought this was just a ordinary drama, and boy was i wrong. Let me just say this, you have to be psychologically prepared to see this movie. I've heard of some people that had to visit the bathroom after the movie (even during).The movie has a ""innocent drug-life start' for Harry (Jared Leto), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly) - where they begin with simple weed-smoking. Something that won't hold for long (without having to say more).Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) who plays the role extremely well, has a dream of being  famous, she has a dream of being _someone _, and begins to go pretty far to accomplish that, in this case by pill-abuse, something that causes hallucinations, angst, paranoia, addiction to the pills.The movie is incredibly well made, it shows the life of normal people and their dreams as well as desires for a better life. During the entire movie the music is emotional, depressive, and in a way discouraging.All i can say is see this movie a few hours after you have eaten. There are some very strong scenes with drug-abuse and sex.In my opinion this is a movie that should be shown to teenagers that wish to experiment with drugs, (on the message board there is a post that says: `should be shown in school' - I quite agree!).Once again, one of the best movies I've ever seen. 10 (++) out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of the best 10 movies of this century,"This is one of the most dramatic and compelling movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. After Aronofsky's PI made a bit of a splash I was really looking forward to what he'd do with some top Hollywood talent and a bigger budget. I was not disappointed! This is not a ""feel good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination. But if that's a requirement for a good movie then this is the wrong film for you to begin with.Arofnosky's direction in this movie is flawless and in some ways even groundbreaking. Jared Leto, Jennifer Conneley and Dayman Wayans all give real solid performances. But Ellen Buryston's acting is just about as good as it gets. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role...how she didn't win it is a black mark on the Academy. In a nutshell the movie at it's most basic level is the story of four people whose lives are very much intertwined. Each of these characters has an addiction problem and in the beginning they anticipate something good to be the long term result of their drug involvement. But just as in real life the ugly head of addiction rears up and grabs each character eventually making their lives a living hell. There is so much more to the movie than that but I'm very hesitant to give anything away because this movie deserves to be seen with an open mind. To give away any more of the plot would be akin to retaining a great artist to paint you a painting and then giving him a canvas that all ready has a pencil sketch laying out the type of painting you are hoping for.If you are interested in movie-making at it's very finest you'd be hard pressed to top REQUIM FOR A DREAM!

Really thoroughly enjoyed but questioned the choices made,"The film in terms of theme did exactly what it was supposed to do. It created a world we as an audience invest in. The effect of drugs needs not to be known to audiences before the film, it is what we learn about more than anything- closest to the first hand account I've seen on many films (especially Sara), and it's the directors choices that we engage in and feel the dream like state ourselves in many ways.However, each character goes on a downwards spiral character arc and each left with a story that goes on from the film that we may never know about. I wouldn't call the end a resolution. The closest character to have a resolution is Harry and so I almost felt let down by the film makers because 3/4 of the way through the film, I realised they were all on a bad arc and it would end bad for all of them, so I expected the end to have a little less prediction. I think if one character managed to struggle out of that spiral, the film would have had more worth.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, the style, the acting and the decisions made in terms of camera angles, fisheye, pov etc. It made me want to write about it, so it did have a big impact on me, but the strengths were that I was immersed in a world that had been created and come to life and the weaknesses were that the story-line was unfortunately (regardless of the amount of unexpected events that happened) predictable in the sense that we were led to believe throughout the film that they weren't going to overcome the addiction and therefore we expected what was coming.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

OMG,"Do not see this movie if you don't want to be haunted by it for the rest of your life.  It really should be called requiem for a nightmare.It involves the nightmare situation of poor people who do drugs.  It is scary beyond belief and just so, so, so, sad.  The whole family (such as it is) gets torn apart.  The men and women in this movie have no power in the world, and their little fling with drugs costs them everything.Also the scene with the mother and doctor is a good example of the current scourge of doctors who just don't give a hoot about their poor patients. The inhumanity of man is pretty obvious in this movie because there is NOONE willing to help any of these people out of their plight, even though in some cases it would be pretty easy for some of these characters to help these people.The way that these people were mistreated in this film is what is the most disturbing of all.  Many of the characters surrounding these characters could have tried to help them, and the characters themselves could have done more to try and help themselves but they weren't strong enough for some reason.  And the cruelty of the police, the ex-boyfriend and the doctor were just appalling.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Over the top, sad drug movie","This is one of the movies which are so depressing that it is not likely to be watched again by most people. The impact is in the over the top approach. I guess the over the top approach may be necessary in order to depict the life of drug addicts. The saddest story here is concerns an old woman. It was almost heartbreaking to watch the transformation from healthy woman to a drug addict.The story is quite simple. The main characters are Harold Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, his friend Tyrone and his mother Sara Goldfarb. The movie spans the four seasons and show the transformation of the characters because of their drug addiction. The sad aspect is that they have dreams like regular people. Harold and Tyrone plan on selling drugs and earn enough to get the perfect drug. This plan ends in bigger problems. Sara goldfarb, on the other hand, takes to drugs for different reasons. She is plagued by loneliness and depression. Out of nowhere, she gets a call from a TV show and she gets excited. She starts eating diet pills in order to reduce her weight. This then causes more problems.Ellen Burstyn's performance is one of the best I have ever seen. The portrayal of a lonely old woman who suddenly feels reenergised due to the drugs is absolutely amazing. I almost was in tears towards the end. It was great to watch the first few scenes where the boring routine of an old woman is portrayed perfectly. Jared Leto as Harold has also done well. He has expressive looks and his character seemed credible. The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly fit the role and her performance was great, yet I feel her character has not been explored much in this movie. Marlon Wayans as Tyrone is also top notch but I also feel his character has not been explored much. The most often mentioned praise about this movie is regarding the music. The background score by Clint Mansell is quite amazing, though I still prefer his score for the Fountain(That was beautiful!). Music is a big reason why this movie works as it is perfect for the tone and emotions in the movie. The last scene had some great music especially which effectively brings out the sadness and hopelessness of the characters. Darren Aronofsy deserves special praise for certain scenes which show the gradual degeneration of Sara Goldfarb. The orgy scene is also effectively done and the emptiness in Marion is shown effectively in these scenes.I can't think of any negatives except for the over the top nature. I know the over the top necessary for drug movies. But I still don't have much of an affection for that style. It seems as if the director tried to force it into people's heads that drugs are harmful. Still it maybe necessary to highlight an evil which has been glorified by certain sections of pop culture.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Flashy, gimmicky, and emotionally empty waste of time.","Being an admirer of Aronofsky's debut 'Pi' and a fan of Hubert Selby Jr's novels 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' and 'The Demon' I was expecting this to be the first GREAT movie of the decade but I was bitterly disappointed! What we have is a gimmicky directed, emotionally UNBELIEVABLE waste of a good idea. The only character who is half way realized is Ellen Burstyn's pitiful Sara Goldfarb. The other main characters are so thinly fleshed out and averagely acted that you end up with absolutely NO interest in their fate. In fact I couldn't even see any reason for Wayan's character to be in this movie at all, unless it was some PC reason to counter-balance Keith David's scummy role. All Wayans does is stare wistfully at his mother's photo and that's about it.I found the direction (unlike 'Pi') to be flashy, irritating and totally unnecessary! One shot of drugs being snorted and a close up of pupil's dilating was fine, but over and over and over?! And the fast motion sequences only reminded me of the chase scenes in 'The Benny Hill Show'.Lastly, what exactly is 'Requiem..' saying that we don't already know? If you take drugs you might get addicted and have to do ""bad"" things?? Is that as profound as it gets? Aren't we all adults here? I fail to see what I'm supposed to think is so outstanding about this movie. And if you find this ""distressing"", ""confrontational"" and ""too difficult to watch"" then all I can say is that you must live in a safe, Disney-fied world! Stick with your Julia Roberts movies...",,Anonymous,Drama
Disturbing movie,"This was an excellent film. If you like propaganda.For your drug education you will learn: ===> Drugs will give a sweet high for a short time ===> You believe you can do anything!!! (on drugs) ===> And you will do ANYTHING -for drugs (yes, even that) ===> Drugs will take (over) your life and destroy your dreams ===> Drugs will leave you writing in pain in the fetal position ===> There are no happy endings for those on drugsI watched this back in 2001 (NC-17 version). Recently I re-watched the last ten minutes (darn youtube). The film making, the quick cuts, the close ups, the integrated stories, the escalating music score, Jennifer Connelly's beauty and Keith David's gaping teeth as living props: this is superior film making. Every trick in the book was used, and it worked without seeming contrived. Aronofsky was a genius at creating that intense trapped drug feeling for the audience. The intense fear I felt was real. I was doomed and I won't/don't do drugs! I hated what I felt at the end of this movie. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again.If the object of this movie was to scare the holy crap out of me- it worked. It also led me to believe that when a close family member was an addict, there was no answer. They would simply be a struggling addict, forever. Not true!!!===> There are happy endings. Don't do drugs or get help.If this is a lie that tells the truth, I want the whole truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Preachy, Pretentious Filth.","If this had been made as an educational video to raise awareness of drugs, it may have succeeded. Although as it stands requiem for a dream is a simple, dull story which glorifies and tries to make us sympathise with some junkies and a woman obsessed with television.Strong themes of addiction run through Requiem for a dream. Namely the drugs. Though this, which is evidently the films main attraction, becomes boring very soon. We are repeatedly treated to scenes of Marlon Wayans smoking some kind of drug and saying ""righteous man, this sh*t is good."" This is basically THE film. Showing addicts taking drugs.What makes it worse is how innovative, although ultimately pretentious and drab the camera work throughout the film is. Some of the drug scenes are just close ups of pupils dilating and the sound of a lighter sparking. This looks kind of cool the first time you see it. Though by the 100th time it gets boring and a little embarrassing. Aronofskys attempt at bringing some sort of art-house chic to this boring story, totally backfires and comes across as pretentious and silly.Aside from the in your face drug addiction, comes the main characters Mother's addiction to a television game show. This for me is the only interesting plot line in the film. Slowly her world is taken over by her preparations to appear on this show that she idolises. The film even manages to strum up some emotion, detailing the Mother's pain, disappointment and desire to be noticed. Though we don't get this story half as much as the boredom of the drug addiction, which fills most of the films running time.I had heard a lot of people saying how shocking and disturbing this movie was. I regret to say that it was not. Its nothing but a dull, repetitive mess with very brief glimpses of quality, added in to try and interest us in a crappy story which runs out of mileage within the first half hour. Don't bother with this. It isn't clever, entertaining or good. Its true bottom of the barrel Hollywood film making, with a shiny gloss of what could be mistaken for a good movie, and a centre of preachy dumb junk. It doesn't inspire sympathy or shock, it just kills you with boredom. Utter drivel.",2.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Shocking, Horrifying and Important.","To view a film like Requiem you must approach it with a different set of goals than you would with most other films. The film takes you through the lives of four addicts who's addictions eradicate exactly that, their lives. An audience must brace themselves when approaching Requiem as the emotions felt at the end of the film are merely sad, distraught and cold, however, the film itself is one that should be viewed by all, for this heartbreaking roller-coaster ride presents unbelievable craftsmanship and acting which is Oscar-worthy from not only Ellen Burstyn, who was in fact nominated, but the other three stars also ; Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans who's abilities as a serious actor were astounding, ( yes, he was Shorty in Scary Movie).Requiem is one of a few stand alone films of the previous decade, who's motive is not to entertain as such, but to demonstrate a universal message that addiction, no matter what it may be, can take control of an individuals life and ultimately destroy it and those around it. To start it provides hope that things can turn out beautiful, but the further in you get, the more you realise that they are inevitably doomed, this film brings you down with the four protagonists to the bottom, a pit of desperation and despair. As the credits rolled it felt like my breath had been held throughout the final climactic twenty minutes. Requiem is different from other horrifying movies due to its' realism, it makes you feel what they feel, it creates a bond between you and the protagonists as they are in fact likable characters who are however immoral, tainted by their addictions.It is a brutal, honest and harrowing masterpiece, delivered through a medium of beautiful cinematography and fine craftsmanship, backed up with some of the most heartfelt and poignant acting I have seen in cinema. Watch Requiem, you won't regret it.... well, you might, but in a good way.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Difficult content - phenomenal film-making,"Far be it from me to add to an already ponderous chorus, but this is utterly outstanding.Darren Aronofsky has had a few ups and downs in his career, with his least well received pictures getting a severely mixed response. At his best, though, Aronofsky has produced some essential, instant modern classics, and 'Requiem for a dream' arguably remains his finest achievement to date.I'm not familiar with Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name, but that he co-wrote the adapted screenplay with Aronofsky speaks well both to his writing otherwise, and to the unity of vision in the film. Everything within is crafted so very carefully, with staggering attention to detail that makes the narrative all the more disturbing and depressing. Consider the exquisite perfection of the title alone: ""requiem for a dream."" A mournful remembrance of the dead - of a dead hope, a most heartfelt desire and wish.The cast is magnificent, all giving what are easily among the very best performances of their careers, if not the superlative. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans have both attracted no small amount of criticism for their other performances and films, both before and after 'Requiem.' Here, though, they emphatically demonstrate that behind sometimes schlocky or self-indulgent veneers lies outstanding capability matching the best of their contemporaries. Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn require no introduction, having excelled in their craft over many years and a wealth of credits too great to count, and even still the forceful portrayals they embrace for this film are mind-blowing. Everyone involved delivers such powerful, devastating depictions of their characters, with a believable, wide, and deteriorating range of emotion and composure, that particularly in the moment I find any comparison difficult. Even supporting cast like Keith David and Christopher McDonald turn in performances that are captivating and unforgettable.The music of the soundtrack is 100% essential to the persistent, inexorable downward spiral that marks the narrative and the tone it strikes. The original score, written by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet, is at once bullish in its potency, and inescapably haunting. The cellos arrive like a freight train after the crushing line that concludes the opening scene, capturing our attention immediately. Mansell's score lingers interminably in our minds well after the feature has concluded, and no matter how frequently the music may have appeared in film trailers in the years since, the psychological ruination it represents in 'Requiem for a dream,' and vividly recalls after the fact, is inevasible.While the cast and the music most immediately catch our attention, Jay Rabinowitz's exquisite film editing is just as important to the overall success of 'Requiem for a dream.' His work is crucial, from the split-screen opening scene to the precise, deliberate shifts between concurrent scenes at the climax that pointedly synchronizes key instants with Mansell's score. Yet nowhere is his hand felt more keenly than in the sharp, rapid-fire visualizations of characters feeding their addictions - preparing the substance, injecting it, the stark dilation of pupils. Scattered throughout the movie, these displays emphasize the readiness, nonchalance, and practiced ease with which the characters indulge, and are such a brilliant, memorable aspect of the feature that they do much to define it. Aronofsky may be the conductor, but Rabinowitz is undoubtedly a prominent soloist.Even the smaller, often less recognized aspects of cinema are astounding in their consideration here. No small part of what makes some scenes so fetching is the lighting employed, or the set decoration. The more complex set pieces used to realize Sara's apartment, especially amidst her spiraling mentality, are fabulous in their craft. Wardrobe and makeup look great, no less critical at varying points. Every element of the production, at every level, is marvelous.None of this is to discount Aronofsky's hand as director. Even aside from the grand vision that ties the film together, 'Requiem for a dream' aptly demonstrates his great capabilities. Once more, from the very start he treats us to some eye-catching camerawork, some of which is altogether beautiful. An early scene in which Harry and Marion lie on the floor, staring at the ceiling, is shot from a bird's-eye view, and paired with the rare, more peaceful chords of the Kronos Quartet's contribution, it's an enchanting image that poignantly belies the downfall to come.And the screenplay conjured by Aronofsky with Selby is fantastic. Characterizations are rich and deep, making Harry, Sara, Marion, and Tyrone believably lifelike and sympathetic; every interaction and bit of dialogue feels very real. However much or little we can relate directly to their experiences - as the director has said, the story isn't just about drugs, but about addictions generally, and the profound, intractable mires we become entrenched in that can lead to further desolation. This is robustly conveyed in the narrative as each character's efforts to gain control of their predicament only hastens and amplifies the ruin. When at last the tragedy reaches its zenith, the resulting calamity - the climax, and the denouement - is so uncompromising and disturbing that it becomes difficult to watch.Even still, no matter how loquacious one's words, to write of 'Requiem for a dream' fails to impart the sheer excellence of the film. From start to finish, in every single way, this is a masterpiece. It's unquestionably difficult to watch, for many reasons, and viewers wary of particular content or overall tone should be very mindful of what they're getting into before deciding to watch. As much as I love this movie, it still requires one to be in a very specific mood to be able to engage with it. But at every step of the way, no matter how harrowing, it's worth it: 'Requiem for a dream' is a monumental treasure, a masterstroke that will be remembered for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Addiction Equals Hell... I Guess,"One complaint that I have with contemporary cinema is the dearth of empathetic characters onscreen.  Far too frequently do characters of depth and humanity appear.  When a film has both empathetic and non-empathetic characters it creates an interesting effect when trying to evaluate the total work.Requiem for a Dream involves both kinds of characters.  I found myself totally involved with Ellen Burstyn's character -- it had substance, meaning and was performed with a skill that far exceeded her co-stars.On the other hand, I could have cared less for the characters portrayed by Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly.  I found the juxtaposition of the Burstyn/Leto & Connelly stories fascinating, but I left the theater wondering what the director was trying to say.Granted, I assumed that we were to feel sorry for all these tragic people as we watched them going into their downward spiral.  Were each of these stories overlapped simply for comparison's sake?  Or, were we supposed to feel equally disturbed by the events in Burstyn's and Leto's?  It seemed to me that Leto chose his path deliberately while Burstyn tragically lost her way.Visually, the film is very striking, even if somewhat self-indulgent. (There came a point about midway through the film when I thought if I saw one more dilating pupil, I would lose my mind.)  And, although effective, the visual devices are not necessarily original, either.  Those who were impressed with the rapid cutting of the final portion of the film should take a look at D. W. Griffith's Intolerance -- a film made in 1916!  So much for ""cutting edge"" (pun intended).All in all, an effective film, with Burstyn's performance a standout.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

A Unique Cinematic Experience,"Well, this movie has style, whether it is the fast cuts, split screens or the fantasy sequences, the director manages to weave it all in despite being a low budget movie. I watched Requiem For a Dream after watching Black Swan, also directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say that this is one of the best psychological movies you will ever see. An elderly woman receives an opportunity to appear on television due to which she decides to lose some weight in order to appear beautiful on air. As dieting fails to deliver results, she decides to go to a ""doctor"" who gives her pills that will magically reduce her weight. What she doesn't realize is that the pills are probably drugs that will not benefit her in the long run. Although the movie is filmed on a meagre budget, it has a brilliant cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen Burstyn gives a truly mesmerizing performance which probably deserved an Oscar. The soundtrack is spectacular and the main theme is one of the most widely used tunes in sports videos.

What shall we use...,"This movie is not about drugs. It is not about addiction. It is about the empty spaces in our pointless and meaningless lives and the things that we use to fill them. You see, our minds do not like emptiness and we are desperately looking for something that might help us to get rid of that emptiness along with the guilt and pain associated with it. Something that gives us the right to say ""I know who I am. My life has a purpose. I am here for a reason"". Whether they realized it or not, the people in the movie chose something to fill those spaces. Something they needed. Something that for a short period of time made their pain go away. Something that gave a meaning to their existence. In the end, they paid a terrible price for it. Sooner or later, we all do. The difference between us and the characters of this movie is that unlike them, we understand the consequences of your actions. At least we convinced ourselves so.  Do you think that your way to achieve happiness (or chemical balance in your brain) is the right one? See this movie. You will regret it though because it will make you face the reality for a moment.

"More A Nightmare than A Dream, 'Requiem for a Dream' is An Addiction In Itself!","'Requiem for a Dream' - What an inappropriately dozy title for such an explosive film! Darren Aronofsky's nerve-corroding adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel depicts drug abuse's annihilative properties using a sobering sensory blitzkrieg. It takes four relatively happy and balanced individuals and it watches almost clinically as each one messes up his existence through addiction.Set in Brooklyn, we first meet the characters when Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) comes round to his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) for his regular habit of pawning her belongings in order to buy drugs. Swiftly afterwards, we meet the other two main characters: Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend Tyrone (a barely recognizable Marlon Wayans). The movie then follows its inspired three-act structure of 'Summer', 'Fall' and 'Winter', as the characters chase their various dreams and obsessions. Harry, Marion and Tyrone are all hooked on drugs and they dream of being 'on Easy Street' – to that end, they conceive a plan to buy, cut and sell heroin, but they soon get a little too fond of their own product. Sara, meanwhile, is also addicted, to her daily routine of coffee and television, specifically a show that is part infomercial, part game-show. So when she gets a routine junk-mail call that appears to promise her a place as a contestant, she starts to obsess about fitting into an old red dress, and becomes hooked on amphetamines as a result. Visions of luxury become inescapable nightmares of insatiable itches — to be thin, rich, applauded, feared. Requiem for a Dream glamorizes nothing en route to a near-nauseating finale. As the absence of 'Spring' in the chapter titles hints, it's a near-operatic descent into hell for all concerned! Darren Aronofsky is a visceral film-maker, and here he pulls out all the stops to create a truly hypnotic experience. He repeatedly shows us the various junkie 'routines' of cooking, shooting up, or of making coffee and popping pills, shot in close-up and edited together rapidly. When added to Clint Mansell's aching, agonizing score that crescendos to audible reckoning, this has the intended effect of conveying the sudden rush the characters are experiencing, as indicated by the repeated shots of dilating eyeballs that end each montage.As his four ill-fated characters, Mr. Aronofsky assembles an unexpectedly strong cast. Both Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans give commendable performances. Jennifer Connelly imbues her character with vulnerability and sexuality even as she stares pale-faced into the bathroom mirror desperate for a fix. As for Ellen Burstyn, she's brutal to watch. You really see her deteriorate before your eyes, going from Mommy dearest to that whacked out old hag raving in the subway. Burstyn gets thin, then thinner, her hair dye gets uglier and uglier, her make-up messier, always more obsessed with her game show and her stupid red dress. The actress manages to trace a frighteningly real portrait of emergent obsession fueled by loneliness, sadness and vanity.Yes, visually this is an exhilarating, unique film. But it is also a singularly difficult and challenging film to watch. More a nightmare than a dream, Requiem for a Dream becomes an addiction in itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Not overrated, but for the completely wrong reasons.","*Spoilers Ahead*Aside from the chemistry between Harry and Marion; the movie doesn't get good until about 43 minutes in. I.E, you see Marlon Wayans ass naked which is worse than watching execution videos.It really portrays an intimate relationship between two drug addicts very well; something I loathe; because the happiness felt in these types of relationships are never authentic.The drug seeking behavior scenes could have been portrayed much better; a better example would be the basketball diaries. Watching a person drug seek (especially for things like speed) is absolutely repulsive and pathetic.Another thing I like about the movie, though it had no place in the movie itself as it seemed off key; was the fact that they put speeders on par with the ""harder drugs"" which is so true; but yet people are eluded from the truth of this; the power of a drug resides solely on the person and not the drug itself; think about it, it makes perfect sense doesn't it? In a culture ran by fear is it any wonder why Benzos are slowly but surely earning the reputation as the most nightmarish withdrawal of them all? As much as I hate to use the word corporate elite; it's somewhat true in respect to drugs and their power. But when you free yourself from this retardation of fear and drown yourself in the truth you soon come to realize that it's YOU who dictates the power of a drug, and as outlandish as this may sound; I would wager that caffeine can be a more powerful drug than ice if the circumstances are correct. Smiley TL;DR, You choose your own poison, and you suffer the consequence of it, this movie portrays this well.The reason I believe this movie deserves it's reputation is because it was made in 2000, in an age where a lot of people were blinded and eluded from these things; sad thing is; they learned about them in the completely WRONG way. Which is even worse.The music is very good but very terrible at the same time; It doesn't fit the movie well at all. The music represents how an audience would view drug addicts and not the actual struggle itself. It's completely off touch. It literally sounds like music that would be played during some grotesque war between good and evil.Like every other movie that takes itself to seriously, this is just a movie and it is far from reality; if there were a movie that truly represented the spiraling life of drug addicts it would not be something people would want to see. Because in the end people don't want to see bad things; they want to see things that make them feel better about themselves by comparing themselves to exaggerations and false representations of real life things.Only a fool would be touched by a film like this; saying words like ""powerful."" when they should be saying things like ""I don't think i want to do drugs anymore.""Besides; after about 1:20 mark the movie just becomes pointless like I previous mention; completely treads from the true reality.The main problem I have with this movie; is that it doesn't seem to have a down hill snowball effect to it; these kids seem to start off at rock bottom and stay there.The Basketball diaries is MUCH closer to the TRUTH.In conclusion - Overrated fantasy with a bad taste of directing gimmicks and unfitting music. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

She persists in exploring the issue of sexuality, memorably having sex against a wall in 'Heart Of Justice' with Eric Stoltz. Well, memorable because she wasn't wearing a t-shirt at the time.  Seizing the chance for yet another t-shirt movie (who can forget 'Career opportunities'? It was white) and dutifully losing the odd pound for the sake of authenticity, Jennifer gives us a butchers at a nice purple t-shirt and then extends her range with some lurid sex scenes. In fact, we get to see more of Jennifer than ever before, so enamoured is she of her t-shirt that she becomes forgetful about the rest of her ensemble. But back to the sex, we get a hilarious scene where Jennifer performs a sexual act which, to the un-initiated, should be excrutiating.  Instead, Jennifer's face suggests the mild irritation of having to deal with a poorly adjusted panty hose. Later, she vomits at the camera perhaps making courting couples in the theatre nostalgic over their first date.  The trouble is, despite all her sterling efforts to explore her dark side and become one of those 'real' actresses, as opposed to a t-shirt actress; decadence does not, and arguably never has, suited our Jenny.  She seems curiously out of place in all her films, in a way I can't quite put my finger on, but here it's easy to spot.  She's way too old for the part.Still, this is as nothing compared to the indignities heaped upon poor Ellen Burstyn's head.  ""You should stand back and let it happen"" states director Aronofsky, clearly in awe of history.  No, a hands off approach is the last thing you want in regards to the old school who will chew the scenery with the best of them, going so far over the top that they need a parachute to get down the other side.  With gravity defying hair not seen since 'The Bride Of Frankenstein', Ellen is put through some ridiculously silly scenes, my favourite being a laboriously scripted lament at a kitchen table.  You half expect that flashing arrow with 'author's message' from the Woody Allen scripted 'What's New Pussycat?' To come down and point at her head.  If Aronofsky had thought of it he would have settled for no less than Burstyn flying around the room on the arrow in a grotesque parody of the title sequence of 'Bewitched' before no doubt flying into a carnivorous dish washer.  Besides, doesn't all this trendy Quentin Tarantino-esque benevolence strike one as patronising and a sort of un-earned vanity?Still, the rum goings on in this preposterous picture seem to have afforded it 'classic' status amongst the undiscriminating and easily impressed, that is, young people.  Have you met them, the young? They get into all kinds of scrapes but are mostly armless.  They pull our legs with great earnestness declaring that 'they've been there' while in reality they are more likely to have sustained no more than a grazed knee taking this film back to the rental shop.  Personally, I blame the parents, as does Mr Aronofsky by the looks of this film.  He doesn't so much wear his influences on his sleave as put up a giant billboard.  You can pick any two films but 'Liquid Sky' springs to mind, coupled with any Tex Avary cartoon.  He even manages to crib 'La Jetee', the ultimate film student cliche, probably appropriate as this is really one of those ten minute 'let's pretend grown ups' graduation films extended to nearly two hours. I think the whole thing smacks of desperation and laziness as film makers have less time (if any at all) to make their names in a fiercely competitive market that spits people into TV land if they don't make a big noise as quickly as possible. This is puerile stuff from a 32 year old. To say this bogus 'alternative' film making has more integrity than so called 'mainstream cinema' is a bit naughty.It's a good t-shirt movie but little else.",,Anonymous,Drama

"Drugs are bad, mmmkay?","Requiem for a Dream must be one of the most unnecessarily overhyped films of the last few decades. By no means it's a bad film butis it really worth all the praising it gets and the commotion it caused? After all, Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious Drugs are bad and they will, eventually, lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life. When talking about the screenplay, Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer. We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people. Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs. Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) so she can open her very own fashion store, selling her proper designs. Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show.I repeat, Requiem for a Dream certainly isn't a bad film. It even is a very well elaborated story with fascinating acting. But the main problem, I think, is that Arranofski too easily thinks that he created a controversial shocker. And that's not the caseIt might look like he directed the perfect ""Anti-Drug-Therapy"" movie to him, but he's about 10 years too late for that. Fans of art-house cinema will merely look at it as `been there, seen that'. The visual experiments often annoy and the characters are a bit too shallow to feel any compassion for. The musical score, however, is simply brilliant and probably even the most powerful aspect about the entire film. Although I haven't been able to find it yet, I'm expecting a lot more from `Last Exit to Brooklyn', which was also adapted from a Herbert Selby novel. Requiem for a Dream is recommendedbut please don't rate it 10 out of 10 here on this site. It's already ranked way too high in the IMDb top 250.",5.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful anti-drug movie is a masterpiece,"Many of the techniques used in this movie (a lot!) would now be very familiar to watchers of music videos and horror, whilst others would be similarly familiar from other sources. However given this movie is now over 17 years old one has to wonder at the genius who created it. The techniques never throw the overall continuity or conformity to style out of whack, and strangely, despite the radical nature of the techniques, the movie never really descends into farce or comedy, attaining a satirical line above that perhaps, especially because we sympathise with the lead characters all of whom are basically good, but more than that, telling its story with heart, sincerity and determination. It's almost operatic toward the superb end. The important message comes across thanks to the casting characters and their very honest performances, from normal to disintegration. It's an eccentric movie, a joy to be swept away in. It's also seriously disturbing by its end and not suitable for children of any age. It's a timely swipe at the times it represents as well, the dangers of suburban isolation and loneliness in New York in 2000, and has a profound cultural importance. For movie buffs this is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A horrifying but honest look at drug use,"I found Requiem For a Dream to be much more scarier than most modern horror movies nowadays. It is probably one of the most horrifying horror movies created. This movie details how 4 people have their lives ruined as a result of repeated drug use. The film shows how their actions affect their lives. This is a movie where you can't watch it a second time. It has nothing to do with its quality but the reason is because you don't know if you can put yourself through another viewing of it. What makes this film so horrifying is that the events that are detailed can actually happen and they have happened before. The first 2/3 of this are bearable but near the end, it gets highly frightening as it shows how their actions effected them. The acting is magnificent. All main characters give strong performances which allow us to get more immersed in certain parts of it. Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely did amazing performances and Marlon Waynes was a shocker in such a serious role. Sara (played by Ellyn Burnstyn) is the saddest character who we feel sorry for the most. She plays someone who gets addicted to diet pills her doctor prescribes. I felt sorry for the rest of the characters but I felt sorry for Sara much more. This film must be watched by everyone. Not just for its frightening imagery but for its educational value. In school, we've been told ""don't do drugs"" several times in but in order to know how truly frightening the consequences of drug use can be, you need to watch this film. It's hard to watch but it will stick with you long after viewing it. This is by far the most powerful anti-drug film ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Requiem for a dream... A must see for everyone.,"I came to watch this movie after hearing about it from so many people. And reading about it everywhere on internet. After seeing it i had to sit back for a while to come back to the real world again. I am truly convinced that everyone should watch this movie. Not just because the performance of the actors and the brutality of the story, but the fact that you will think twice before making a run for drugs, or any other addiction for that matter. It really is a educational story on a hard and chilling way but nobody will deny that its the real truth, and thats what makes this movie so wonderful. The performance of Ellyn Burnstyn and the role which she plays really makes the movie complete. Also the choice of music in the most critical scenes will give you goosebumps everywhere. By my opinion this movie belongs to one of the best movies ever made and thats why i give this movie a 10+. I can not say enough that this movie must be seen by everyone (if your above 18 that is). And it will never start to bore you no matter how many times you see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Emotionally Draining Eye Opener,"The movie industry has always had an obscure relationship with drugs. Originally being completely taboo, they are now a staple in many modern horrors and comedies. Where some films glamourise them such as the 'Stoner-Comedy' sub-genre, there are other films that really show the grittier, downward spiral that narcotics can easily take people down such as 'Less Than Zero' or 'Spun'.Having seen Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' before, I knew what film I was going to be sitting through. There would be no settling down, and no entertainment. This isn't to say that it is not a great film but you really do feel emotionally drained after the viewing. It isn't a movie you watch prior to settling down to sleep but one that will haunt you for a time after the credits have rolled. The surreal parts emphasise occurrences superbly, going from a very limited dark colour palette in reality to vibrant, energetic colours in their hallucinogenic, vegetated state that enables you to see things from their perspective without making drugs seem alluring. Far from it. This is potentially one of the greats of anti-drug cinema.There is no way to really prepare yourself for such an experience. It is bleak straight from the opening scenes where Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is introduced. Entering his own mother, Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) home, he takes her television to acquire money for a fix. All the while the cinematography really gives you a deeper insight into their tarnished relationship as there is a literal line drawn between the two characters, showing their actions and reactions.Harry plans on becoming a dealer of high quality drugs with Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) whilst Goldfarb slowly drags his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connely) into the fire with him, promising her their dirty money would go towards her own store where she can sell her fashion designs but, with her history of drug-usage. She soon finds herself back in a predicament.The film takes place over three seasons; Summer, Autumn and Winter and each play out as an act, showing the escalating desperation as the four main individuals sink deeper into their troubles. Throughout Harry's ordeal with the heroin his mother is dealing with another form of addiction. After the loss of her husband she has become lonely and food and television have become her substitute for love. After a phone-call from a television station she is filled with false hope, entertaining the idea of her 15 minutes of fame. Determined to wear her once beloved red dress for her small-screen appearance, unknowingly, she turns to amphetamine and becomes increasingly reliant on it's effects.Much like seasons in reality, each act becomes darker earlier, cold in it's outlook. Frosty in it's reception. Each of the characters push past the point of no return, sacrificing love, health and happiness in their own selfish or vulnerable haze.It isn't just the acting or the content of the movie that pushes it above and beyond, it's the orchestral pieces by Clint Mansell that really capture the despair. I am unable to listen to his pieces, full of sorrow and foreboding. It has a confounding effect on the soul emphasising all that is occurring on screen. Without a doubt it is one of the most effective and provocative soundtracks I have experienced on film. As much as it is an essential watch. It's too taxing to watch regularly. However, it deserves pride of place in any DVD collection and I would implore everyone to give it at least one viewing in their life-time. A powerful and eye-opening view into an underworld that most people avoid in their life-times. It really is a challenging view.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
One of a kind.,"So many drug-related films (Traffic, Blow) have come out in the past year that I've started to get them confused. But this one tops them all. Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely mind-boggling. The scene where she dances around in the clown makeup and the red dress is chilling. I can't imagine the depths of her soul that she had to reach to get this performance, and it is an absolute travesty that she didn't win the Best Actress for it. Jennifer Connolley does a great job as well- this woman is seriously underrated. The scene where she tears apart the apartment looking for a fix conveys desperation like you rarely see on screen. I love how Aronofsky makes you get close to the characters, but not *too* close...and how his directing and editing mimics the descent into hell. This is a depressing film- the characters are sad, desperate, and pathetic, yet we still have empathy for them, no matter how despicable or disgraceful their behavior becomes. A truly unique film experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Powerful, depressing, moving, a memorable experience","After seeing ""Requiem for a dream"" by mastermind Darren Aronofsky, it only sickens me more over the academy's choice to crown Julia Roberts with best actress at the oscars this year.  Not only was Julia's role a sterotypical one (one woman against ""the world"") it also couldn't hold a candle to Ellen Burstyn's role as a diet pill addicted woman in Requiem.  Really, the only drug movie that has ever really disturbed me emotionally and scared me (and I saw the rated version).  However, the elements of fright are used well to weave a tale of four separate people dealing with their own drug problems. Much better than the overpolished, cliched ""Traffic"", ""Requiem for a Dream"" seems more realistic and really shows almost the worst case scenario among people using drugs for recreational use. A good movie for high schoolers and up to see who are contemplating using drugs because this shows what it can do to any person's life.  Hopefully Aronofsky's upcoming take on Batman, Batman:Year One, will be even half as good as this movie is.  10/10 Superb.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

"Not tragic, dark enough --you'll see why","After having read so many positive reviews about this movie, especially James Berardinelli's, I decided to take on this. The feeling afterwards is somewhat mixed and weird. As others have pointed out, I don't like so many seemingly funny gimmicks like fast forward and flashy editing. They diluted the tragical atmosphere.Moreover, the character personality development along with addiction is poorly done. We only saw drug effects physically upon all of them, or at most a little more emotionally on the relationship between Harry and Marion, no more. Harry and Sara are in need of that kind of medications, no matter how director tried to exhibit them in a horrible way; Tyrone is basically OK except without freedom; Only from Marion the degradation of self-respect is appropriately depicted (but one could've done it more impressively). Tragedy is about interactive outcomes of personalities and drug addiction is sure to change one's personality. However, this movie only made the tragedy of drug addiction, but not that of personalities twisted by drug addiction, which is the biggest failure from my view.I agree the director is good at filming and editing, which can't offset the paleness of plot and characters. Music is the most entertaining element of this movie. All in all, this movie could've been darker, more impressive, more thought-provoking, standing out as a tragic masterpiece in the real sense of personality tragedy, all of which haven't bee accomplished by this one. Do you want to see how addiction changes your LIFE? see this one. Do you want to see how addiction changes your PERSONALITY? The answer is not in.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama

Depending on your experience, this movie is either a warning or biography. I give the producers and director all the credit in the world for going ahead with this film. It couldn't have been easy. The criminal world of Hip Hop alone and the Mafiosa record moguls could've done a lot to stop it. I'm surprised it got made. The actors are flawless.

Also, the cinematography is uncanny and original, completing this piece.  The only criticism I have is Jennifer Connelly.

No exception in the year of bad movies,"I can name five things worse than having to sit through a film like ""Requiem for a Dream"". What exactly is this director trying to prove? That doing drugs gets you nowhere in life? Well I might have been impacted by that message if I knew what was going on half the time. I managed to put the whole mess together by the end of the picture (unfortunately) and the result was a headache. Why do people believe that if a film has a tremendously high amount of cuts that it's good editing? I don't know, probably because they think that it was difficult to do or something. No. Good editing is not seeing how many cuts you can fit into one picture (watch any Oliver Stone film after the 1980's). Good editing makes a film an interesting experience, a unique format, it does not necessarily have to flow well, but if you want good editing, see a movie like ""Barry Lyndon"", which probably has a quarter of the amount of cuts than this film, despite being double the length. If this is the future of film making, I don't want to be there to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
The most disturbing and depressing movie I've ever seen.,"FYI: I watched the original, NC-17 version.There's no doubt this movie has been reviewed by thousands of other people here on IMDb so it seems rather pointless to add another but I still feel inclined to share my thoughts and feelings of this fantastic movie.I didn't know what to expect going in. I hardly had a clue what it really was about other than that it involved drugs and, one of my favorite actors, Jared Leto. While it is quite possibly the hardest movie I've watched, it is also one of the best directed, acted, and edited.The first half of the movie is more interesting than anything else. The characters and their motivations are unfolded slowly and the quick and clean editing and cinematography keeps the audience completely engaged. There are some really neat camera tricks that are actually quite creative and bring the character's perspectives closer to you.The second half of the movie is where things start to unravel more quickly and violently. Characters become more desperate and are willing to go to any lengths to get what they want, and, in effect, the on screen images slowly become more disturbing and gut-wrenching to watch. There were multiple times when I was unknowingly squirming in my chair in disgust at the horrors on screen.The real reasons these images are so intensely horrifying are because of the motivations the characters have. It all comes down to the basic idea of what is happening. The thematic elements are just as frightening as the visual elements. Maybe not everyone will be affected in such an intense way; it depends on how much you can stomach.But maybe perhaps the reason both the thematic and the visual elements worked so blissfully together was because of the incredible acting from the entire cast. Ellen Burstyn delivers a phenomenal performance as the challenged mother of Harry (Leto) and depicts insanity that is so believable you forget she's acting. She totally deserved her Oscar nomination. Jared Leto was his usual self, putting everything he had into the performance and pouring emotion onto the screen everywhere. Jennifer Connelly also gives an excellent performance as Harry's psychologically tortured love interest. Again, it was very easy to forget that you were watching actors and actresses act and think you're actually seeing these deeply troubled people through the eyes of a camera.Then, of course, there's the soundtrack. Oh, boy...has it become popular fourteen years later. It's an odd soundtrack for this type of movie. It's more ""epic"" sounding and inspiring if heard by itself but when it's put into the movie it becomes something else entirely. it's eerie, it's scary, and most of all, it adds to the intensity of what's happening on screen in a strange but subtle way. Clint Mansell did an excellent job making this possible.I really never thought a movie about drugs could possibly be so fascinating and interesting. Darren Aronofsky directs in such a way that everything is personal between the characters and the audience. You care for these people; you feel like you know them. You want them to overcome their troubles. The camera merely serves as a window into their world. You feel a part of it all.Would I recommend this movie? Well, it would depend on the person. There haven't been many movies that have moved me in a way this one did. It wasn't the typical emotional experience but rather a truly gut-wrenching one. There is no hope, no savior, no happiness. By the time the credits roll you should feel dead inside. This is one of those movies that everyone should watch at some point during their lives, preferably when they're younger. But for that very reason, it doesn't make it a film for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

Requiem for a dream outlines the life of four Coney Island residents and their addiction to drugs.,"Requiem for a dream- ""A tragically beautiful piece of music mourning the loss of an unrealized dream."" Of course its all conjecture, but if I were to guess this would be my interpretation of the title.The movie opens with an introduction to Harry and Sara Goldfarb, an overindulged young man whose only concern is his next fix and a doting single mother who yearns for her son's well-being. Sara's only escape from the drudgery of her routine suburban life is her daily escape through television, in particular a weight loss show called 'Juice by Tappy'.The carefree, drug fueled existence of Harry, his gorgeous girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone sets up a sharp contrast to the lonely, ordinariness of Sara's life, her obsession with television, and her diet fads. We are seduced by a life of excitement, danger, rule breaking, youthful dreams with endless possibilities, drugs and sex. The glamour of these drug- induced utopias make Harry and Tyrone's schemes seem like a means to beautiful possibilities. This constantly switches between the manic lifestyle that Sara's desperation to lose weight has led her to. Her depression and loneliness is alleviated by an unexpected invitation into a world of glamour, however this soon gives way to an anxiety that she no longer fits in. In her desperation we see her becoming completely reliant on 'diet pills'. Morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night. She spirals further and further down the rabbit hole of addiction, tragically unaware, she seems to think its a harmless quick fix. As her body wastes away she is plagued by paranoid delusions. Even through this, she remains oblivious. A true success story in her mind. Alternately, the youngsters are constantly on the prowl for their next fix. The failure of their schemes, leaves them desperate.The movie is a work of art. Each scene is carefully choreographed visually and the soundtrack and sound effects and meticulously planned. The intensity of the mood created because of these visual and musical elements is quite magical. Reminiscent of the drama of a Scorcece film and the lurid quality of a Fincher film, it comes together in a remarkably artful way.The characters are rich and complex and each of the performances are arresting. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable, genuine and surprisingly endearing. Jennifer Connely is BEAUTIFUL, fragile and feminine. But Ellen Burstyn steals the show! Her performance is lurid, and gut wrenching. A startling and touching portrayal of a woman without love or companionship, a life of longing and complete neglect.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

The last 10-15mins where the 4 leads finally pay for their addictions is probably the most gripping, intense finale I have ever seen. The music is amazing.

Addiction hurts,"The problem that anti-drug films face is the difficult balance between sensationalizing their subject and ethically engaging the audience. This was a beautiful horror film, but the characters didn't engage me. I knew that doom awaited all them, and I wanted them to find a way out, but I didn't really care. The visuals were shocking and provocative. A husband and wife sitting behind us left when they showed the arm. But they wouldn't have left if they had cared what happened. I understand that Aronofsky is showing the inevitable emptiness that results from long term drug addiction, but why make a movie that's only purpose is to show that drugs are bad? The first half of the film was much more playful, with the charcters imaginings, with Sara's hope of making it on TV, but as soon as I knew there was no hope, that nothing new and creative was going to happen, I lost interest. It creates martyrs out of its characters, which coupled with Jared Leto, Marlon Wayons, and Jennifer Connelly's aesthetic beauty - sensationalizes drug use.

Don't just go for the easiest, bluntest, most transparent and hollow option! 'Cause the only emotion I felt when the credits came up in Requiem for a Dream was a slight anger for paying to see it and then laughter when I saw tears in the eyes of the person next to me. Because since the 'emotion-squeezing' didn't work on me, I was pretty bored throughout the film as there was little else to it.4/10. See PI instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama

NOT recommended for NOT movie fans!,"ALERT: If you're only looking for an entertaining move, RUNAWAY! This is not a movie for a gross thing called entertainment; this film is a learning a session for you.To begin with, the script couldn't be more though-provoking. The emotional gamut we are subjected to is literally whiplash inducing. Seldom have I seen anyone not to be drown in their ocean of thoughts after watching this masterpiece. And I think most of the praises for it should be directed to its top notch plot. As a great advantage of it is to say how honest it was in portraying our problems, especially about addictions, which is a rarity with films nowadays that every director is thinking of ways for not only avoid offending anyone from black to white, but also make it for all the people, not for movie lovers anymore.Secondly, the performances are really sensational. Jared Leto's astonishing performance was really stunning for me that I had never seen such performance from him before. Plus, Ellen Burstyn offered a memorable portrayal of an obsessed mother, who besides the annoyance she causes to his son, she is doing everything to make him proud of herself. Simply put, all the cast were beyond belief.Aside from the perfect plot and characters, it all meant nothing if it wasn't for Aronofsky. With the mind-blowing direction he brought up, he made an untouchable movie that would be influential for next generations of movie makers. Darren and his talented team did a great job in utilizing this picture in every aspect of it, from cinematography to music.All in all, the movie is just a total masterpiece with phenomenal descriptions about the way our world is dealing with addiction and its deadly consequences. A must see for sure, but be careful, it's not to be watched for FUN!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Powerful.,"Requiem For a Dream is a dark and often disturbing film. It follows the lives in the of four people of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly, and Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans); and how drugs affect them,Okay I'll start with this – this film is incredible, and should be considered a modern masterpiece. The direction by Darren Aronofsky is perfect, claustrophobic, emotional and original. Quote from Wikipedia: ""Aronofsky uses montages of extremely short shots throughout the film (sometimes termed a hip hop montage) While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts, RFAD features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots (including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam) and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices."" The use of these stylistic features produces an enthralling perspective of drug use, and really gets you into the mind of the characters.The acting is superb. Ellen Burstyn shows a frail old woman to a drug-crazed maniac, which sounds ridiculous but it's true. She is electrifying. Her most famous line 'I'm gonna be on television' is heartbreaking. The supporting cast are equally award-worthy, yet received none as of the type of film it is.I was deeply moved by this, I have never been so emotionally affected by a film. When it finished I just could not even move or do anything, I just watched the credits roll.This is a must-see for a masterclass in direction, and the bleak imagery.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

In the leading roles you'll find Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans.They all delivers the best performances of their career.Especially Ellen Burstyn who does one of the best roles ever in movie history.The director of the movie is Darren Aronofsky who is unknown for most people,but has made great movies before. This movie has one of the best soundtracks ever,and I got chills every time I heard Summer overture true out the movie. The movie is great edited and use new spesial fx,as a way to explain drug abuse.Visually this movie is great.The story is also very powerful and touches everyone who sees it. The movie starts out slowly and builds up to a climax at the end,the last 15 minutes of the movie is so intense and dramatic and will touch you deep inside.It is sad to see what drugs can do with people and in this movie you see how bad it can turn out.The ending is one of the sadest endings I have ever seen.I didnt move a finger before after the end credits.And then I couldn't believe what I had seen,this is the movie that you cant get out of your mind in several days.A movie that will move even the toughest people. 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,Drama

Everyone has problems; its how we choose to deal with them that make us different.The agony of food addiction can be just as bad as any heroin addiction; just take a gander at the great film, The Whale. Ellen Burstyn is nowhere nearly in trouble as the whale was, but she is trouble enough, as horrifically depicted by the talented director, Darren Aronofsky. His use of cuts and close-ups is chilling.Marlon Wayans does a very good job as well, as Leto's drug friend. There is a bit of Midnight Cowboy feeling to the Miami travel scene.

Films like ""Nosferatu"", ""Psycho"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Platoon"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". Films that will be remembered in 20 or 30 years. And ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of them.Shocking? Yes. Dark? Yes. Risky? Yes. ""Requiem..."" is all that and more. It has an almost perfect direction and outstanding performances. All the actors were pushed to their limits, doing their very best. And Ellen Burnstyn, shows that she was cheated-out in almost every acting award in 2000.This film is ""A Clockwork Orange"" for our generation. It shows things that hardly anyone had the guts to show before (in so crude way, anyway). And just like the author of ""A Clockwork..."" could be seen as a genius after ""A Clockwork..."",""Requiem..."" talks more about Darren Aronofsky, than drug itself. It talks about a risky and creative director(probably the best of his generation), who could break cinema rules, and expand them in the future.Why did the Academy praise ""A Clockwork Orange"", and almost ignore ""Requiem..."", if they are both very controversial? Well, ""A Clockwork..."" is set in a distant future, in England. And ""Requiem.."" is set in the US, right here and right now. It shatters the American Dream. But unlike ""American Beauty"" there's no hope for ANYONE here.

hypnotic tale of desperation,"Requiem for a dream is a hypnotic story about four people desperately pursuing their vision of happiness. It links the lives of a lonely widowed mother, her son Harry, his girlfriend Marion, and his best friend Tyrone. Each one of them begin to fall apart largely due to drug addiction. Each one of them is on a dangerous free-fall but none of the stubborn addicts can change their habits. Shot in Coney Island, Brooklyn with a unique style and flair, Darren Aronofsky directs a very effective film. Although lead actors Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are good in the movie, it is Ellen Burstyn as the widowed mother who steals the show with a powerful performance. Director of photography, Matthew Libatique is on top of his game with his imagery and the musical score works perfectly with the film. Good Stuff!",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
Tries too hard.,"Slow motion, fast motion, slow motion with fast motion, spins, split screens.  How many trick camera shots can a director fit into a feature film?  If your Darren Aronofsky, you can fit in about 17 million.  At least that is how many I thought I saw in Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream.I was excited to see Requiem for a Dream.  I somewhat enjoyed Aronofsky's previous film Pi.  I thought that if the guy that made Pi had more money he might really be able to do something. Requiem is something all right.Requiem for a Dream has two main story lines.  One follows Sara (Ellen Burstyn), a loving mother of a bum son, through her quest to loose weight so she can fit into a special red dress to live out her dream to be on television.  The other follows her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) on their quest to live out their dream of making a really big drug score.Both stories are dark.  All of the characters, including the Sara, the loving mother, take the pathetic, downward spiraling road of drug addiction.  The film follows their stories to the absolute bottom, and then leaves it there.  There is no redemption.  There is no hope.Requiem tries too hard.  It wears ""artsy-fartsy"" as a badge.  Just because a movie is really dark, doesn't mean it is relevant.  Just because something has a very distinctive style, doesn't mean it is a good style. I didn't hate Requiem.  Burstyn's performance was amazing.  Leto wasn't bad either.  I wanted to like it.  I wanted to be in the group of people that ""get"" this sort of film.  I don't want to be some bumpkin. I don't want it to be over my head.I didn't like it though, and I don't think that I'm being a bumpkin.  I ""got"" this movie, more like a disease than an understanding.

We've got a winner!,"Like ""Black Swan"", another compelling masterpiece by Darren, ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a descent into madness. Only this is even more depressing, as the characters begin on a high (no pun intended) with there dreams seemingly close to their grasp and feeling great but end up plummeting down to the bottom thanks to addiction, with their dreams coming right down with them. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is a masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, it combines everything often overlooked by other film-makers (visuals, sound etc.) to make an unforgettable film that punches you right in the stomach and eventually pushes through right after the credits roll.So what makes ""Requiem For A Dream"" so great? Well, firstly, it comes down to Darren's flawless direction. Just like ""Black Swan"" you feel as if you are going on a harrowing journey with the characters. Instead of just limply watching them, you feel almost as you're there with them. It is startlingly involving. Some of the visuals are very intense, the last half hour is dizzying in its intensity thanks to Darren's manic quick-cutting and Clint Mansell's incredible score. Darren also shows that he has balls by taking risks, the scene in which Ellen Burstyn goes crazy is incredibly well done and was quite risky in the way it was executed. Some might say the scene seemed daft or even quite funny, which is probably intentional, drugs may seem fun at first but they soon consume you like the fridge. Darren also makes clever use of split-screen which brings you even closer to the characters mental-state.Sound is a medium film-makers often over look, whether it be diegetic or not, Darren uses both to absorbing effect. Clint's score is a staggering masterpiece in itself, it's haunting and always gives me chills (though it doesn't when they use it on ""Britains Got Talent""). In fact, music is almost always played over each scene which adds to the hypnotic nature of the film. Sometimes the music will change quite suddenly to give the effect of disorientation, making us as an audience dizzy and slightly insane (I am already). Darren uses diegetic sounds inventively as well, by often using them as a sting over quick cuts, like when the camera slowly zooms in to Ellen Burstyn and randomly cuts quickly off to her popping pills. Darren's inventive style really adds to the intensity of the film. It is edited perfection.Darren also shows off his writing skills along with the other man who wrote the novel. It perfectly demonstrates each characters descent into complete and utter madness to the point where the emotional barrel is over-flowing. The final scene made me nearly well-up and leaves you in complete awe as the credits roll up. Each character is written in detail as well, it's in-depth which is also why the whole film is so compelling and absorbing.Ellen Burstyn's performance is also incredible. She deserved that Oscar which Julia Roberts (looks like Coops :) robbed off Ellen. What i don't like about the Oscars is the way they don't go on performance but on nationality or if you've won one already. I'm guessing because Ellen had already won one, they weren't giving her another. I'm sorry but Ellen completely deserved it, her performance is so compelling and realistic. It's obvious that she put a lot of work into her character. In fact everyone puts on an excellent performance which is always great to see.Some people complain that ""Requiem For A Dream"" is far too depressing and leaves you feeling ""bad"". I can guess that most of these people are American wanting a Hollywood happy ending. The sad truth is there is no happy ending to drug addiction, which is why ""Requiem For A Dream"" is frighteningly honest and truthful. Would it really be realistic if everyone recovered and all there dreams came true? No. If you want to stop, don't start. Although it has an 18 certificate for it's graphic use of drug-taking, shocking images, and sexually explicit images, I honestly think this film should be a 12. Those images are deliberately put there to shock people into not taking drugs, all minors should see this film.I always know if a film is good if I get chills at the end and I just awingly stare as the credits roll. I defy anyone to come out of ""Requiem For A Dream"" without feeling any emotion at all. ""Requiem For A Dream"" is simply a rare masterpiece. It's directing is flawless, with awe-inspiring music and visuals. It's painfully honest and truthful and a harrowing masterpiece. Films like this don't come around very often so make the most of it.

"Where's my gun, noose, and arsenic??","Yeah, this movie made me want to kill myself.  It was VERY effective in gaining my empathic support such that suicide seemed like the only viable option for most of the characters by the end of the movie.  There was no glimmer of hope for any of the characters by movie's end except for the sweet escape of death.  This movie certainly would put the brakes on any would-be drug abuser, still young and impressionable.  That, especially if you gently fibbed that the movie was based on true events.  I think they'd stop their drug use with a dead halt (along with considerable counseling and support, of course).  Anyway, off my soapbox on that point I must say I'd not rate this movie very highly.  I'm torn, on the one hand it should be seen by *some* people, on the other it shouldn't be seen at all.  So if you're a burnt out highschool student looking to drugs for support, I'd give it a 9/10.

There is so much truth in it and the acting (especially Ellen Byrstyn) made it impossible to doubt. And with an amazing ending to finish it off I cannot say this movie was flawed.

Beautiful and Depressing,"I had only a vague idea of what this movie was about. I heard it was good and so DVR'd it off IFC. I was not in any way prepared for what I was to see. From the opening scene to the end the movie is a tour de force. Where to begin? First,the film has incredible energy. Given the subject matter, i.e. the story of 4 characters lives bottoming out, and the themes of addiction, depression and emptiness the movie could easily have been turgid, didactic and boring. Instead, what you get is a very stylized, yet moving and dare I say profound depiction of what life can do to people.The actors all gave amazing performances.The movie is filled with powerful images and gradually builds momentum to its crushing ending. No tidy little salvation here. Toward the end, there is a scene with Jennifer Connely's character lying in a fetal position, clutching a bag of drugs she received for sexually degrading herself, with this serene, sad smile on her face, that is as haunting as anything you'll see on film. The soundtrack is extraordinary too.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
The ultimate all-time-favorite,"Just amazing and perfect! The acting, directing, scenography, costumes, music, everything! The story of a dangerous path people take for love, attention and success. The story of fragile self-control, insecurities and ambition. The impact it has on the viewer is just stunning! One of those movies that grabs you to take a ride with it, one of those movies that makes you question your habits! I remember that I didn't smoke for a long time after watching this movie. Hands down to Darren Aronofsky, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Bursty, Marlon Wayns and, above all, Clint Mansell! Should definitely have a special place in the history of cinematography!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
bold but bland,This movie is easily one of the most confronting and disturbing movies i have ever seen editing styles and shots are used uniquely to make the audience feel uncomfortable. But the movie suffers from a linear story that doesn't invest you nor characters that you relate to but i do think it is impossible for a movie like this to achieve that.,7.0,Anonymous,Drama
It will open your eyes to your addiction whichever it is,"It's one of the movies that shows you how disgusting life is. And where so many movies try to show addiction for drugs as the only kind of addiction that should be feared, this movie exhibits other kinds of addictions that can be as dangerous as drugs i.e. TV, sex and show-off.It is true that the movie focuses on probably four or five types of addictions but it rings a bell and makes you think that surely each one of us has his/her own addiction and if it was not controlled wisely, it will lead to undesirable consequences.Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and specifically Marlon Wayans are extremely geniuses in their roles with once-in-a-lifetime performance from Ellen Burstyn. I find it so strange that those who didn't love the movie, at least admit the fine acting of the main roles! Darren Aronofsky is a director that deserves a careful study of his masterwork... this director, if you have seen so many movies, you will notice that he has come with something new of his own and he is worth of same credits given to directors like Tarantino, Spielberg, and my favorite De Palma.Music is so beautiful which also gives a star to Clint Mansell.This movie as you can evidently see has so many strong elements and therefore is a must-watch movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Lou Reed copied well,"This movie (and book) plays like a Lou Reed song (see ""Street Hassle""). Aronofsky develops his striking style as seen in ""Pi,"" and benefits greatly from a bigger budget.  A brilliant film all-around.  So note that the topics of this film have been well-explored in the arts for decades.  The cinema finally takes their crack at it, and really there is no one better than Aronofsky to handle the task.  He seems to have less sympathy for the characters towards the end.  Though ""predictable"" is hardly a word for this film, among independent music at least the story is at times cliched.  The cast is what makes this film most memorable.  Highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Truly Unpleasant,"I was pretty enthusiastic about both Pi and its soundtrack, and was pleased to see another movie from the same fellow.However, whereas Pi had an interesting plot and occasional moments of brightness, this movie was almost exclusively about suffering, and the last half of the movie almost gratuitously dwelt on that.  My biggest beef was with the plot, which became a contrivance to abuse the characters, again in the last half.  Whenever chance would have it that the protagonists could have several possible futures ranging from fortunate to dismal, the plot always chose the worst possible future.  After a while, the suffering was completely artificial, loaded with graphic, ugly images; high-strung and irritating music, and a disregard for reality that had hitherto remained intact.The acting was well-done, the direction had style, the music, save for the grating violins when things were really getting bad (which I suppose were meant to invoke pathos), was interesting and well-suited, but I have to ask myself -- why did I watch the movie if it was completely unpleasant, if I didn't learn anything save for the depths of pain and disgust to which a movie can go?  I am all for intelligent independent movies, but there has to be some spark of enjoyment in it instead of a kaleidoscopic barrage of suffering.  I regret watching this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Drama
the definitive film experience,"I have just read over this and realised it is hard going to understand the film, but I am not trying to help you understand the film, I am trying to put down my feelings on this film. So I think I succeeded.  It may not make sense but it is hard to make sense of my thoughts on this film. Enjoy.Ok, I am sitting here listening to my copy of the requiem for a dream soundtrack. Supermarket sweeps, oh boy, this is the point of no return and it is about to get messy. I listened to the soundtrack before I see the film, and...well I really wanted to see the film after listening to this music. The last three songs, well they were hard. They were hard to sit through. My hairs were standing on end and I felt, well I can't honestly say how I felt but it was not a happy feeling. It was a feeling of knowing something bad was going to happen but not knowing what. Now this music is among the most moving, beautiful music I have ever heard, but it is hard. So this leads us onto the movie. I fortunately got to see it for the first time last night, on my friend's dvd player. Now, if you do plan on watching this, try really hard to find it in widescreen anything else is just not good enough to handle this experience.I shall only give you a rough run down on what the film is about and I shall do it quick. 4 main characters, Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Harry (Jared Leto), Marion (Jennifer Connely) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). Sara is Harry's mother, she is old, she is alone, her husband has died and the only time she sees her son is when he comes round to pawn the television for crack. The only thing in her life is food and TV. One day she gets a call telling her she is going to be on TV, yay, this is great, she is so happy. So she goes and gets her best dress out, her red dress, and she tries to get into it but she has put on too much weight, she is fat. Her neighbours give her tips on how to lose weight but eventually she settles for pills. One blue in the morning, one white at lunch, orange in the afternoon, and green in the evening.Then we have her son Harry, a nice boy, wouldn't really hurt anyone on purpose. He can't help it that his mother reacts so badly to him `borrowing' the TV. He tries his best to be good, but that crack is just soo good. He has a wonderful girlfriend who he loves more than anything, Marion. She wants to become a fashion designer, and she too is on crack. Harry's best friend Tyrone is the cool man, he is the man who knows people, he can get the crack real easy. So Harry and Tyrone set up a business, buying a little crack and resell it, buy a bit more sell a little more. Things are starting to really look up, they have a nice pile of money and things are going good. Summer, last summer. Then crack runs out, the fall. Only a few people have any and they are selling for double the price. So Harry and Tyrone have a good idea, if they go out to Florida and buy some there, then bring it back, they can sell it for twice the price and become rich. The beginning of the end.This is the most intense, violent film I have ever seen. It is not an action violent film it is an emotionally violent film. There is actually only one scene of violence in the film, it is sudden and largely hidden, but it is shocking. Much like the rest of the film. A lot of the more horrifying scenes are hidden or not shown. What is shown is horrifying but what isn't shown is even more horrifying. The film will not attack you with a gun and explosions, it will not attack you with coarse language (nearly no swear words). But it will attack you, it will squeeze your heart until you can't breathe anymore and your body shakes and quivers. And it all happens so quickly that one cannot prepare for it. There is plenty of warning that it will not all go well, but until the moment before it does the viewer has no idea it will be that bad. Ok, selling and doing drugs is a bad idea, everyone knows that, it isn't much of a warning that something bad well happen. Everything is so nice and normal throughout the entire film, there isn't any warning. And then suddenly you are in the very pits of hell. I've seen many shocking films, horrible films, films that have been banned in half the world. But from now on I will always think of those films as Julia Roberts films. They are fluffy, they are nice. Fight club is weak and fluffy, bad lieutenant if a nice stroll in the park. there has never, and most likely never will be a film as...there isn't a good enough word to describe it. there will never be a film as uncompromised and sick and disgusting and horrifying and REAL AND BEAUTIFUL and everything. It is hard to write a review of this film. It is hard not to feel emotional and sad when writing about this film. I knew that the end was shocking, that life turned bad, but, I never ever could've imagined it would be like this: I don't want to tell you, I want you to see it one day, when you are ready, and I want you to feel lost, I want you to feel sick, I want you to feel afraid and small and pathetic. This film won't let you get out in one piece. I feel like I need to hold onto it in my head forever and if I ever forget I will have lost something I needed to know. anybody who sees this film and feels nothing should be locked up, there is something seriously wrong with a person who feels nothing when they gaze upon this film.But, I don't feel dirty. Sometimes there are films that show a dark horrifying side of life in such a way that they make the viewer feel dirty, but this, no, no it doesn't feel like a snuff film or a piece of porn, it doesn't feel dirty, it feels real, it feels sad. The thing which makes this film work so amazingly well is the characters and the actors who portray them. We are not forced into liking them, they are not incredibly special and wonderful and we feel incredibly sorry for them. But we do feel for them, we don't hate them, we care about them and we like them, but not so much that the caring totally about them gets in the way of viewing this film. It is hard to explain. The viewer feels for the characters, they are likable, but not to the point where we just collapse emotionally at the thought of what is happening to them. The viewer is kept alive and in touch with every tiny thing that happens on the screen, and this is what makes them such an incredible experience. The first thing I said after watching this `That was the finest piece of film making I have ever seen, absolutely. But it is the worst piece of entertainment I have ever seen.' I do love this film, I will own it one day, and I will see it again. I love it because it does not lie to me, it doesn't pull any punches and pretend to make things better or worse. It is real, it is completely uncompromised.Ok, I have ranted and raved about the emotional aspects enough. How about the actors? Well let's start with the Oscars. Every single award ceremony in existence means nothing anymore. That Julia Roberts won all the major awards and Ellen Burstyn only got a couple of awards from awards ceremonies no one has ever heard of is an outrage.  It is impossible to describe her performance in more words than one. Perfect. It is gut wrenchingly real, the grinding of the teeth, the hyper-tension. And that fridge!!! That f***ing fridge!! Never in my life have I been more scared by something in a movie. And it is all brought to life so well. As for Jared Leto, he is excellent. He should go on to become a very fine actor. His performance here is also wonderful, everybody is wonderful. The direction is startling. I have heard a lot of people complain and say it is just another stupid cut cut MTV directional style but it isn't. The incredible amount of work that was poured into the film is amazing. Watching the making of and listening to the audio commentary, it is amazing, why they choose to do this and how much trouble they had to get this just right. And if it had been done any other way it would've lost the impact. Amazing, amazing describes it all.This film is important. It is more important than fight club, it is more important than any single film made in the last twenty years. This is a film which should change the art of film making, it should help change the censorship system and should change the way people view films like this. But it won't. it made less than $4 million American dollars over a period of 9 months in America. Compare this to the mummy returns which is already up to $140 million in 2 weeks. It is so sad. This film should be shown in high schools. It should be a class all by itself. If the governments want to deter kids, hell, anybody from taking drugs, from getting into prostitution, if they are really serious about showing how bad it can all be, then this is the film to show them. When I have kids, the day that I think they are ready to handle it, I will show them this film. It will do more to help them keep away from this scene than I could ever do in talking to them, more than any stupid government campaign could ever do. I will never take diet pills. I will never do any kind of drug. I will never ever have anything to do with the sex industry. Not totally because of this film but it has certainly made me resolution rock solid, more than anyone or anything else could ever have done.This film will open your eyes, for better or worse you will have learned something. And the most horrifying part of all: the acceptance. As they curl up into a fetal position they accept what has happened to them. They accept that they will be raped and tortured and will never again do a single beautiful enjoyable thing with their lives. They accept it and it is real.So, should you see this? Yes, no maybe, I don't know. if you feel that you really cannot cope with it then don't. we do not want anyone freaking out and mentally collapsing. But, if you think you can, if you want to see something different, something unique and real, then this is the film. But just remember, it will not be easy. This is the hardest film I ever watched. And it is also the most rewarding.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

Stunning.  Punishing.  Beautiful.  Unforgettable.,"These are just some of the many adjectives that come to mind to describe this wonderful film.  It is one of the most harrowing films I have ever seen.  Never has a decent into the deepest layers of hell been so strikingly filmed.  My only complaint is that the script itself is lacking in areas. The characters are given just enough to do before the slide begins (don't worry, that's no spoiler ... just look at the title of the movie), but while I appreciate when a director doesn't waste time, more time spent with these particular characters would have been appreciated even more.  However, that's my only complaint.  Visually, this is one of the most exciting films I've seen in years.  The performances are sound, with Ellen Burstyn giving us an Oscar-worthy turn.  The editing is especially incredible and should also be nominated (if the Academy has 1/4 of a brain between them all). But for as good as this film was, if Aronofsky gets his hands on a Godfather-quality script, I seriously don't think the film world would be prepared...9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Hurts so good.,"Requiem for a Dream is a predator.  It finds a place inside of you and burrows deep down inside until you hurt.  It knows what you are thinking and what you fear.  After seeing this movie I felt so sad and so alone that I was immediately in love.Requiem for a Dream, directed by Pi's Darren Aronofsky, stars Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans...yes, I said Marlon Wayans. Ellen Burstyn plays a Jewish widow, living in New York, named Sara Goldfarb.  Leto plays her son, Harry.  Jennifer Connelly plays Harry's girlfriend, Marion, and Marlon Wayans plays Harry's best friend Tyrone C. Love.  One day Sara gets a call from a man, telling her that she is going to be on a tv show.  Sara, who worships the television, gets extremely excited but finds that she can't fit into her favorite red dress.  Her friend tells her about some diet pills she knows about.  Meanwhile, her son Harry spends the majority of his time getting high on heroin with Marion and Tyrone while dreaming about scoring an uncut pound of heroin to sell.  Sara starts taking diet pills and starts to get addicted to the dangerous uppers.  Form here each character starts spiraling on the their own road to ruin.  The movie soars through every drug-induced emotion with an amazing visual ecstasy. Requiem for a Dream is not only a powerful story but is also a stunning visual masterpiece.I hope the Gods are honoring Ellen Burstyn right now because she has done an utterly amazing job in Requiem for a Dream.  Never have I seen such ""no holds barred"", totally open acting.  She has a true talent.  Jared Leto does a great job as well, transcending the majority of immature stuff he has done so far.  Jennifer Connelly is a great actress that I think should be in more movies.  She is much more interesting than the majority of air-brushed actresses these days.  And we can't forget about Marlon.  Oh Marlon... WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKING MOVIES LIKE SCARY MOVIE!!?!?!?!?!  Marlon, you have such a breakthrough performance in this movie!  Leave that lame comedy crap behind!  You can act...well!Anyway, Requiem for a Dream is a must-see for anyone that does drugs, has done drugs or is thinking of doing drugs because this movie will hit you where it hurts.

Life changing movie that takes the glamor and glory out of drugs,"This is one of the only movies, involving drugs, that doesn't send a message that drugs are ""cool"". It sounds stupid to say but after becoming a drug addict and then becoming clean, I realized how much society, movies, music, etc. can glorify drugs into something their not. Every time I watch this movie(and i've seen it at least 20 times) I cant take my eyes off the screen. It takes you so far into the emotions and stressful lives of addicts that by the end of the movie, and even the next day or the next week for some, you are so thankful you are not in their position. Also the contrast between the addictions of someone who's chosen the path(Jared Leto and friends) and someone who was led blindly into the trap is what, for me, makes it so amazing. I've seen other movies based on addictions, and I'm sure you have too, but none that show the helpless side of someone being blindly led down that path. Ellen Burstyn's character is so deep and crafted so well by the writers and the actress herself that you really feel for her. I'm not one to say drugs are bad and what not, but its true, some of our society paints them to be something there not. But this movie shows what can happen to anybody. A great movie, but I will say I don't recommend it to the faint of heart or someone looking for a feel good movie.",,Anonymous,Drama

Yet I had never seen it until yesterday, since so many people have recommended it. But I am still unsure that I enjoyed the film. I am a fan of films with styles like Spun, but maybe this film takes it a bit too far for my personal enjoyment.

The heir of transpoitting,"In the same line as ""transpoitting"", requiem for a dream brings us a story of different lives absurdly spend by the influence of drugs. At first we meet the characters: three friends that, as they had nothing more to do, they take drugs to forget how bad is their life. Meanwhile, we know the mother of one of them, who lives alone and has no More company than TV and auto-help preachers. We can see how they fell in the depht of addiction, how things seem good at first and, of course, then, the cruel reality of being addicted. With very good playing, it is the real than the actors seem, the greatest point of the film. A very good and touching story, full of feelings and moments of cruel and unholy reality. Brutal, conscious and explicit, a really good movie about drugs. Unluckily, the idea of the director of filming it like a music clip (rapid changes of camera and lots of turnings of the image, to represent that they are in the influence of drugs), mess a little the result, with a better image directing, it could have been better indeed.

Dark & unforgettable...,"I wasn't ready.The first time I watched this movie I was completely transfixed. When it was finally over the whole theatre was blown away. Only after a short time after the credits was everyone ready to get up and walk out. That was 4 years ago - and since then I have not been able to forget this film, and probably never will.It is truly the most heartbreaking film I have ever had the pain to witness.I am glad I watched this movie, though it will leave an impression on you for a long time. Never has a film so deeply, so painfully, and penetratingly etched itself into my memory.The music is what really makes this movie go over the top - it shines. The theme is perfect for the plot. It made me feel sad, longing, horrified, wistful...the music and direction is the simply the best I have ever seen.Ellen Burstyn gives a performance that shook me for a long time - her acting is outstanding, her portrayal of an insecure, lonely, aging mother is the best in the film. I was on a precipice between wanting to empathsize with her, to being disgusted with her and her own and/or drug-induced delusions.

As bleak as it gets,"I do like to watch a good depressing film and I'd wanted to watch this ever since it topped a list of the most depressing films ever. I wasn't disappointed. This film left a deep impression on me and is indeed the most depressing film I've seen.The story follows four people as their addiction to drugs grows. As well as the usual young persons drug abuse it also features an elderly woman who is addicted to weight loss pills. The film portrays all the drug users sympathetically and treats them as decent people who just happen to have a terrible addiction which makes the results even more sad.The spiral into darkness starts slowly as you get to know the characters but once it starts it really does spiral fast leading to an unforgettably bleak final reel. This film thankfully in no way glamourizes drugs but shows graphically how they can take an iron grip on anyone.The acting is of the highest order from all involved but especially from Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connolly who are tremendous.This is an excellent and must see film with a brilliant script, great acting and an ending that will live with you.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This is your brain on ""Requiem""","There have been tons of films that depict addictive drug abuse, but no film does it quite like Darren Aronofsky does in ""Requiem for a Dream,"" using camera techniques to mess with your mind and visually drive you insane, much like the characters of the film spiral into drug-induced oblivion. The film is not particularly insightful--it is an independent film-- whose goal is clearly to make a film that shows drug abuse in a way never done before.""Requiem"" follows essentially four characters whose lives go south because of drugs. There is Harry (Leto) and Tyrone (Wayans), two junkies who turn to selling dope to make a living, Marion (Connelly), Harry's girlfriend who will do anything for cocaine, and Sara, Harry's mother, an older, widowed woman who gets selected to be on TV and begins to take pills to suppress her appetite so that she can wear her favorite dress on air. Sara's story is the most jarring and unique to movie plots and therefore feels distanced from the others, but the technique is what matters in ""Requiem"" more so than the story itself.This is Aronofsky's film from beginning to end. Numerous camera techniques are employed, particularly rapid sequences of close-ups when the characters are doing their drugs of choice. In addition, Aronofsky uses camera mounts on characters at times and even security cameras to capture some scenes in Sara's storyline. Aronofsky also does various slow downs and speed ups, white fades and more in the editing process that continue to inject director presence into the material. He really experiments with everything with varying degrees of success.What makes Aronofsky's work so great, however, is not the techniques themselves, but how they are allegorical for drug addiction. He feeds them to us in steady and unobtrusive doses at first with the rapid close-ups for the first hour of the film, then as things start to go out of control in the plot, we get more and more abrupt changes in our viewing of the film from camera angles to the edits. It's brilliant because you can easily enjoy the beginning of the film, but by the end you feel really disturbed by everything and it all happens so quickly. Aronofsky actually psychologically messes with you, successfully.Other praise for this film goes mostly to Ellen Burstyn as Sara. She's hauntingly brilliant in showing the gradual turn to insanity. A much deserved Oscar nomination. Leto and Connelly are also good, but this movie is more about how Aronofsky makes them appear rather than how they act.""Requiem"" is really an art film, not a Hollywood-friendly drug movie about the dangers of drugs, but an experiment with the human mind and its ability to be altered by fine director craftsmanship. While there's no true catharsis in the film, it's a movie-watching experience in its own little category by itself and worthy of a try if you're in the mood for something radical. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
A great motion picture.,"Frequently cited as an anti-drug movie, ""Requiem"" is really a movie about the dark side of the American Dream. All four leads want to attain something in life; appearing on a game show, opening a boutique, stop ""scuffling"", etc. The common thread is that none of them has any commitment to doing the hard work that most of us associate with the attainment of life's goals. This theme is introduced and repeated in the film's central metaphor, the juice commercial. Ironically, we are introduced to the commercial as the mother, addicted to her TV, watches over and over. While the infomercial promises that all can be accomplished in three easy steps (i.e, the shortcut which is central to all the mistakes that all the characters make), in telling fashion, we never learn the third step, which, of course, does not exist, just as success is not a 1, 2, 3 process. Lacking any commitment that would help them attain their goals, all the characters start to (or continue) using and/or dealing drugs to get them to their goals as quickly as possible. Eventually, they all wind up destroying their lives through a series of bad decisions which stem from drug use but are BASED on a total lack of commitment by the characters to do what is necessary instead of expedient. Ultimately, all wind up institutionalized except Jennifer Connelly, who self-destructs so far that she winds up performing degenerate sex acts to stay high. In the film's cruelest irony, she becomes the greatest ""prisoner"" of all. This is a brilliant movie at every level. The acting is superb, the direction is great as is the screenplay and other cinematic elements. This was really the best movie of 2000 but the subject matter was too tough for the voters. Do not underestimate how complex this movie is. I'm still talking about it 4 years later.",,Anonymous,Drama
"REALISTIC, BLEAK ART FILM 7/10","This film is an uncompromising look at addiction and the price one eventually pays down the road. Director Darren Aronofsky is masterful in the way he uses editing and sound to emphasize his camera images. He has a fresh, unique style that is completely his own. Ellen Burstyn is a wonderful actress and disappears into her character. It's a remarkable performance. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also excel as two addicted users drawn to each other for their own selfish reasons. Connelly is a risk taking actress and allows herself to be shown in 2 or 3 degrading scenes. But they are essential to her character and the film. ""Requiem For a Dream"" is not a fun, entertaining picture. That's not the intent or the point. It takes you to a place and shows you the way these people live. It's real, bleak and does not pull punches. Aronofsky's got one overwhelming message. DON'T DO DRUGS!!!Overall Rating  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
We're all nervous bundles of addictions and vices,"Darren Aronofsky is a problematic director for me to categorize. I can honestly say that I've liked all the films I've seen from him, but none of them are something I'd casually recommend to a friend. Some are even such that I doubt I'll ever rewatch them.Partly that's Aronofsky's scale. His films range from a deeply symbolic examination of time, love and pattern, where a man flies in space on a literal flying tree, to a pseudo-realistic portrayal of ballerina's struggles with her life. With Requiem for a Dream landing somewhere between these two extremes.The easiest theme to find in this film is that of addiction. The film follows four Coney Island people, three of them heavily addicted to heroin. But it's the fourth, the character of Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), that provides the echo wall for this obvious addiction. The word addict immediately brings to mind mind-altering substances, but is someone so bound by media that she cannot live without it truly any different. And if she isn't, what does that say about the rest of us. We all have our vices, our favourite things. And those addictions can run deep, to places we don't care talk about.It's an unpleasant film to watch. Not in a way such as Trainspotting, which is mainly just filthy and unclean, though this film has heavy shades of that as well, but because Aronofsky focuses on the weirdness side of drug use. How taking heroin or other pills shatters the dream-reality barrier and shatters it in such a way that's scary beyond belief. It's dream, but in a way that lurks just behind the corner of your eyes, waiting.The best films are those that make you think. The ones you keep returning to in your thoughts. And this clearly belongs in that elusive category.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
"Best reality-punch film I have seen, probably ever","This movie simply has turned my perspective on how, why, and what reasons lie behind making a movie.  The brutal honesty of this movie, I cannot remember having seen before.  And even though one could argue over the point of the movie and the plot details, I believe most all would have to say that it hides nothing from the audience in the way of all the good things humans have to offer, all that they want in their life and the lives of others, and how either gradually over time or in the blink of an eye, it can all be swept away...and the brutal honesty and reality that is their own lives surfaces and shines through.  Everyone thinks that if they just ARE good people and live life and BE good people that they SHOULD and WILL get what they and others feel they deserve.  But as anyone who has ran across their own failures and fallibilities in their own lives can tell you, that is not always the case, and the story doesn't always have a happy ending, even if there are not any bad guys to readily blame or condemn for the tragedies that befall even the most unassuming of people.  Thus my claim for reality-punch....this movie acted as a reality punch for myself and I'm sure it would, or could I should say for anybody else who were to watch this movie, uninterrupted, from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
I just couldn't buy into the feel of this film,"The examination of drug addiction as illustrated in this film is a worthy topic to explore. However I felt it was just too disjointed and inconsistent to help me as a viewer understand what the storytellers were really trying to convey. It certainly had some interesting situations to examine, particularly the issues involved with weight loss and the typical unfulfilled expectations associated with such endeavors. However, I felt the film's ""story question"" was not ""well-formed"".Stylistically, this disjointed feel may have been the intent of the filmmaker, yet I don't feel it belongs in the same company as say films like Memento, City of God and Taxi Driver.",4.0,Anonymous,Drama
A Powerful Experience,"To start this off, I have two things to say about Requiem for a Dream. Firstly, this is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. Secondly, it is one of the best ever made. The film is shot beautifully utilizing very unique shots including the split screen shot which allows you to see multiple perspectives of what is happening at the same time whether in the same room or across the country. Another technique is the usage of drug use montages such as the very famous montage of preparing and taking heroin. Never before has a film's style and angle made you think so hard about what is trying to be portrayed.Requiem for a Dream is extremely intense and very hard to watch. It is horribly depressing and really takes the energy out in a very powerful way. It makes you rethink your ideas about drug use and the struggles of many people that use them. The film seems very realistic and the characters are acted to perfection. How these actors haven't gone on to do more contemporary movies is beyond me.For those that find grotesque movies such as this hard to stomach, I think that the movie is similar to A Clockwork Orange. It is very disturbing and upsetting to watch, but it is something so powerful that everyone should experience it. I am generally hesitant to call any piece of art ""life-changing"", but Requiem for a Dream could easily change the way one views the society around them. This is a masterpiece of film and should be experienced by all.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
masterpiece for who can resist,"In the counter perspective, the reason why this movie is not considered amongst the bests is that it delivers disturbance violently, disturbance for who can not incur such intensity, alongside no hope and happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
A must see tragic masterpiece,"Since the first time i watched ""Requiem for a Dream"" ,i couldn't stop watching it over and over despite it is an extremely hard-to-watch film alongside A Clockwork Orange.
From the first shot until its powerful ,electric tragic end, this movie teaches you just how to look at the world and how to know about the ultimate destructive consequences of the drugs.
Jennifer Connelly here is powerful and magically beautiful ,Jared Leto is real true tragedy and so is Marlon Wayans whose known for being comedic as hell. 
The real star here is Sara which steals the show.

Ignoring the fact that it's imaculately acted and made I give it ten stars purely for the impact it had on me as a person, how it made me 'feel' and the intensity of those feelings and how they have lasted with me for literally EVER!

Loved it,"The plot for this film ""Requiem for a Dream"", is about four people Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Sara, Harry, Tyrone and Marion are all dealing with personal issues, and battling addiction with drugs, and being accepted by others and finding their place life.Sara is a widow who is trying to get back to her past self when she was thinner, happy and when people needed her. Sara becomes fixated on getting back into this red dress, with the gold heels, and her red hair. Sara thinks by taking diet pills, and watching infomercials that she will become a contestant on a show and everyone will accept her and she will be needed. Harry is a dope fiend who is trying to find his place in the world but falls short due to his drug habits. Tyrone is also fighting a battle that has to do with his childhood and being accepted by his mother, he wants to be accepted and loved and turns to drugs also, which in the end leaves him alone. Marion is a drug addict as well and has plans of opening a store and becoming a designer but due to lack of money she has to have sex with people to get money to feed her drug habit. The theme for, Requiem for a Dream, in my opinion is a movie dealing with drug addiction, loneliness, depression, finding acceptance, and dealing with personal life issues. Sara, Harry, Marion, and Tyrone are all chasing a dream, to be wealthy, happy, loved and accepted by others. Sara's addiction is diet pills. Harry, Tyrone, and Marion's drugs are heroine, and cocaine. These drugs are the reason that Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion suffer, become an addict, and the reason their lives spiral out of control. For some people being accepted by their peers is everything in life. That's why some people like to have money, and be flashy when it comes to their clothes, and hanging out with their peers. For example, when Sara was in her kitchen talking to Harry he who is an addict himself was trying to persuade his mother to stop taking those diet pills. However, she wasn't hearing anything he was saying to her. All Sara kept talking about was that red dress, and how when she was sitting outside she was the center of attention, how she had the best seat and how everyone cared and listened to her and was interested in her life. That was the satisfaction she was looking for and wanted and getting on that show is what mattered and she was willing to do whatever it took to get that fix she was chasing, even if that meant becoming addicted to diet pills. In my opinion I think that Basketball Diaries has the same theme as Requiem for a Dream, drugs addiction, prostitution, and robbing people to get his drugs. This movie is about a basketball player who had everything going for him was on a good basketball team, went to a good school, but then a change in his life came and it turned him to a life of crime because he got hooked on drugs and he was chasing and trying to feed his addiction. I think that the reoccurring motif in this film is addiction, and satisfaction from other people. All four characters had an addiction that needed to be feed and wanted satisfaction from their peers. That's why they all did the things they did, from Sara getting on the diet pills, dying her hair red, watching the infomercials and stalking the mailman every day. To Harry wanting to sell drugs so he can make a better life, have money, and not have to steal from his mother anymore. Lighting and angles of the movie Requiem for a Dream in my opinion fit the movie. The angles that were shot in different scenes showed what everyone individually was doing or going through. The lighting was natural in some scenes but was dark in others for example in the beginning of the movie when the screen was split and Sara was on one side locked in the room and Harry was on the other side arguing with her about her television. The audience could tell that there was something going on and it was wrong. I knew within the first few seconds of the film that Harry was on drugs when I heard them arguing over her television set. In my opinion Requiem for a Dream was a very good movie it showed how being overly obsessed with what people think about you can ruin your life. These four individuals Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion let drugs and their unhappiness for the way their lives where going consume them. This movie just showed how chasing the ""American Dream"" can kill you.",8.0,Anonymous,Drama
The Most Traumatizing A Movie Can Possibly Get,"Requiem for a Dream is the most psychologically brain-damaging drama of all-time. The finale of this film is like watching your soul get squeezed, as your heart slowly shatters, and once it's all finally stopped, you're left only with a gutless and empty feeling inside. Now this is why Aronofsky wins. Say whatever you want about the guy glorifying everything in his films, but at least he does it with a passion that can not be matched by any other director. He will get his message out no matter the odds-in this case, the odds being his choice to insert some of the most stressful sequences ever put to film. The first time I saw this film was somewhere around my mid-High-School experience, and it's frightened me away from ever even remotely thinking about doing hardcore drugs, ever since. FYI, to teachers who are trying to teach kids not to do drugs, don't show your lame-ass, cheesy, cheaply made, 90s-released, ""Drugs Aren't Cool!"" documentary videos, just show them Requiem for a Dream, and I guarantee every single human being who sees it will be scared of doing drugs for a solid and long amount of time. The fact that this movie didn't even get nominated at the Academy Awards for best editing is an absolute sin, cause the editing in this is some of the most effectively creative but also stressfully poignant, quick-cut mastery ever achieved. And when you add the impeccably dreamy cinematography and EPIC original score by Clint Mansell with the editing, voilà, you have yourself a technical masterpiece. It's no surprise that Ellen Burstyn got nominated for an Oscar for this movie, she brings home a marvelous performance, and so does Leto, Connelly, and quite surprisingly Wayans. Whenever someone asks me-and this is rhetorical, nobody really has asked me this-""What's the most screwed up, repulsive, nerve-racking, and unorthodox movie you've ever seen?"" Typically I answer with Requiem for a Dream (or mother!, but that's for a whole other review/discussion). But trust me, when I say this, I mean that as the upmost apical, and positive compliment. If there was such thing as an A double or even triple plus, I'd reward this movie with it, but since that doesn't exist, I guess we're going to have to rate this the proper way: (Verdict: A+)",10.0,Anonymous,Drama

bleak to say the least,"i can't say i ENJOYED this film - it isn't the kind of film you can really have a good time at..  it is depressing and bleak and leaves you feeling drained.i thought the performances were good, some of the camera work was beautiful and the colours were amazing, and the editting was very good.but i got bored of the repetition.  i get that it was possibly reflecting the repetition in the characters lives, but i just found it a little too much after a while.  and i also found the freakish hallucinations by the mother with regard to the tv show late in the film a little too much for me. it didn't mesh with the rest of the film as far as i was concerned.but i thought the parallel between the mother and the son's habits was very interesting and the gradual deterioration of all of their lives (although they didn't seem to have much to deteriorate from) was well done.overall it isn't exactly an easy film, but well worth checking out if you don't mind a bit of work.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Overrated,"Aside from Ellen Burstyn's brave performance, I found nothing original or striking about Aronofsky's drug epic.For months, I've read about how this movie will grab you by the throat, punch you in the gut, and pummel you with its depiction of drug hell.  I was all set for the ultimate visceral, heavy metal, hardcore, ultra NC-17 experience.Boy, what a letdown.  What is actually there isn't very groundbreaking. Nothing in Darren's movie hasn't been already shown vividly in movies like ""LESS THAN ZERO""  and the much, much, better film, ""TRAINSPOTTING.""Aronofsky does have some clever camera moves, and his rapid fire closeup images of getting high, accompanied by weird sound fx, are OK.....for about 5 minutes.  But then Darren's bag of cinematic tricks wears out its welcome, and things get repetitive..... very repetitive -Yeah, I know, they're addicts and that's all they do, but the thing is, the piled-on images ultimately have an opposite effect.  Instead of immersing me deeper into the hell of addiction.....it actually distanced me - left me thinking how much this movie plays like an MTV video. So ""nightmarish"" scenes of attacking refrigerators, infected arms, electro shock therapy, and TV diet gurus have no impact or payoff.Finally, why was this movie rated NC-17???  Alot of R-rated movies are far more graphic.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

"A beautiful, haunting film","When I first began watching this I thought it was really strange and hard to follow. To be honest, it's like that for the entire movie. The filming was artistic and new, yet disturbing and unsettling. Overall, this movie is extremely dark. It's definitely not for an immature audience, nor is it for those who dislike sad stories. Oddly, I was painfully satisfied with the end--though I will not share the conclusion. The content is very explicit throughout, from sex scenes to brutality, but I didn't find any of it to be excessively unnecessary. Jared Leto does a fantastic job, along with Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, and Marlon Wayans. (It was really weird to see a Wayans brother in such a dramatic film! Nonetheless, he did very well.)

A downward spiral to destruction with no reason or warning,"There's a scene in Kurosawa's High and Low that depicts a sick drug addict at night in a Tokyo slum.  To make us feel the agony of this poor woman, Kurosawa has her scraping her fingernails on corrugated metal.  It's torture to the audience to listen to.  I've never seen a more effective way to make an audience feel a characters pain than that.Aronofsky comes very close.  His method is to alter time.  What's so effective and scary about this film is that there is no comfortable turning point in the script that triggers the descent into destruction.  It just happens.  And when the audience realizes that they're are being dragged down into hell along with the characters without any warning, it could result in a number of reactions and emotions.  There was one point when I realized that my fist was clenched.I can highly recommend this film to most anyone.  It should be seen by every junior and high school student.  The party/sex scene should be cut for that though. But if it can scare kids away from drugs, I would label it as an IMPORTANT film.Lastly, I wish to address the controversy concerning Ellen Burstyn's performance being head and shoulders above Julia's Robert's in Erin Brockovich.  Well,........it is.  However, anyone with a brain in their head can see that this is not a film that the AMPAS can give their blessing to. Jeremy Irons didn't impress them with his role as a drug addict in Dead Ringers either.  Just be grateful that we have this wonderful performance on DVD to watch as often as we want.  We intelligent movie lovers who demand stronger stuff in our entertainment can fully and emotionally embrace this courageous woman for literally altering her physical appearance to play this pathetic character.  It will only be with the passing of time, that she will be revered and recongnized for giving the best performance by an actress in 2000.  Remember in 1941, the Best Picture Oscar went to How Green Was My Valley and the curiosity piece was a strange little film called Citizen Kane.",,Anonymous,Drama

The Director Goes for the Shock of Addiction,"Requiem for a Dream""- I've been hearing about this film for sometime now. Mostly from my sons who are in their early to mid twenties & their friends. I've also seen it was listed in the top 250 films on IMDb, so I decided I'd better check it out. Was it worth all the hype......well?Requiem for a Dream,"" is definitely a film about addictive personalities addicted to drugs, as a matter of fact that is about all it descibes & leaves little room for anything else. The creators of this film want you to know the harrowing consequences & hell of drug addiction. That for all ages, sex, race, addiction is the same, just they go different ways about maintaining their habits. The mother gets hers from the Doctor, portrayed as a insensitive quack who only writes prescription & does not look at the patient (the mother) once during her visits. The girlfriend gets it from her boyfriend & when he can't produce, she sells her body for it. The boyfriend & his buddy, who deal so they can become rich, but end up not even being able to support their habit. Yes, the horror of drug addiction portrayed truthfully, well? Yes mostly, but no also. Sure, all these things can happen as worse case scenario, don't get me wrong here, I'm not advocating drug use for anyone......but. The creators of this film go out of their way to shock the audience, & when it comes down to showing real drug use they cop out. All we get is the same snippet editing over & over again, showing the aftermath, but no actual act of getting high. This film also cops out in dealing with the real problems of buying drugs & dealing, it touches on this subject very lightly. We again get those fast edited snippets when they're dealing. No in-depth showing of our characters dealing with others in real transactions, dodging the police, dodging would be rip off artists, narcs, putting up with all the idiots that come with the territory, nothing. We get a scene where our characters are trying to score on the dock of a grocery store. I had to kind of smile here. The average Joe Junkie, does not go to Super Walmart, on the dock to score his drugs from a Florida Orange truck. Another direct act of sensationalism from the creators of this film. I really believe that the director had in mind to make the Boggey Man portrait of drug addiction with this film, so all you would be drug users & Ice Cream habit users would get scared away from the subject, or just say....cool dude, did you watch that!Really, if you want to watch films on the subject, there are much better ones out there, that deal with all the aspects of drug use deeply. Some are, ""Panic in Needle Park,"" ""Cisco Pike,"" ""Less Than Zero,"" ""The Bad Lieutenant,"" ""Fresh,"" ""Clockers,"" & the black comedy of ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas."" See these films if you really want to see what ""THE LIFE,"" is about.""Requiem for a Dream,"" does manage to shock some, no doubt about it, but then again, thats really what it is intended for & not much else.(room temp)",6.0,Anonymous,Drama

Four intertwined lives spiral downward as they surrender to their addiction..,"Tired of happy endings?.. This is that masterpiece of a film!.. It will torment you, distress you, make you vomit if you will, it'll drain you emotionally and psychologically.. It will haunt you long after the end credits roll.. Let me just say that I'm putting this up on my 'MOVIES to WATCH BEFORE YOU DIE' list.. Everyone has to at least watch one such bleak and harrowing film in his/her lifetime.. If you really are tired of happy Hollywood endings, then go look for this movie and just have a great depressing time!..We meet Harry and Marion who are a couple in Brooklyn with dreams of building a small business for themselves. Both are compulsive heroin addicts. Tyrone, Harry's best friend, a heroin addict himself is a street-smart hustler who with Harry, decide on risking their chances in the realm of the drug business. Sarah Goldfarb is Harry's mom. She lives all alone in her apartment and couches the whole day in front of the TV set. It is too boring and lonely. One day she receives a call from her most loved show and gets a chance of a lifetime to appear on television. When her beloved red dress can't seem to fit her, she goes through the usual slimming methods until she winds up using diet pills (uppers).Four intertwined lives. Four desperate dreams. Each with a down-spiraling path laid in front of them. All we can do is witness and experience the horror.This film is SUBSTANCE and STYLE. Substance, well.. first of all, it's about substance abuse but moreover, one measure I use to assess whether a film is good or not is if I actually care about its characters. All throughout, I felt their desperation and wished that things have gone differently for them. And talk about performances! Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are electric. Marlon Wayans who's known for his comic persona in the Scary Movie films and White Chicks shows us that he can put his A-game on the table. But you won't soon forget the courageous Ellen Burstyn. Daring and bold, she pulled off one of the best screen acting I have ever seen. Charlize Theron in Monster was something but Burstyn's was on par and very powerful. Heartbreaking is the best word to describe her scenes.Style?.. you couldn't ask for more. I gotta give Darren Aronofsky props for using a variety of camera and editing techniques to subjectify the characters' emotions and mental states. He makes us see what they see, hear what they hear, feel what they feel, and then slams us back into harsh reality! And with such a haunting score to accompany these moments, this film is entirely unforgettable. I can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen.This is a different kind of horror movie. You gotta have the stomach to take it. This is really heavy and intense stuff. Like I said at the beginning, if you're tired of happy endings, this is the movie for you.I'm just glad I watched this on a Sunday morning.

"Intense, dark, deep, moving","Some people don't like films like this.  They call them depressing.  I have to say that I find a lot of happy, jolly, false stuff unbelievable and depressing a lot more than stuff like this.  Admittedly, Requiem is frighteningly intense in places; but this is a quality which is rarely found nowadays; only Magnolia in parts and oddments of Fight Club compare to this in terms of nerve-shattering emotional intensity.  Or perhaps Monkey Trouble.  Only joking :).Ellen Burstyn plays a lonely widow & mother named Sara Goldfarb who becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to make herself presentable for a TV appearance she applies for.  This becomes the focus for her lonely existence.  Aronofsky skilfully compares this with the lives of Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto) and his girlfriend and friend who are all regular Heroin users.  Marlon Wayans in particular is fantastic as Harry's friend Tyrone, but the star is undoubtedly Burstyn who, especially in the second and third parts of the story, had me in almost constant tears.I really can't recommend this enough.

"Unrelenting, affecting and stays with you","After I'd finished watching this movie I had to get some air as I felt truly drained. I had seen a few reviews of this movie beforehand and so was eager to see if this movie could possibly live up to those reviews. I'm not so pleased to say that it did. I say not pleased because this movie hit me hard. I was watching a film about addiction, both physical and emotional with characters I really should not care about, with maybe the exception of Sarah (Ellen Burnstein in excellent form). But we are slowly introduced into their seedy and needy lives but once we are pulled in we are not let go as slowly all the main characters' lives start to unravel before us and we feel everything. It's ugly, dirty, nasty and seedy and that's just how I felt as the credits rolled and it was all done without the need (in general anyway) for gratuitous scenes of drug taking, sex or violence (Okay there is a particularly graphic scene towards the end involving Jennifer Connelly but it is spliced between scenes of all the other there characters and so lessens the explicitness of it). This works more on an emotional level and it plays with your emotions so much you cannot help but be affected after. This is not a movie to sit with friends over a tub of popcorn. I would even go as far to say it is a movie better watched alone to feel it's full impact. Just don't expect not to be affected afterwards. Don't think my score of 8 out of 10 is not high. It is. 8 represents a great movie for me. A movie would have to be something extra special to get a 9 and total perfection to get a 10 and as far as I'm concerned that doesn't exist yet. This isn't a movie for everyone but if you want to feel moved in some way then this is a movie for you",8.0,Anonymous,Drama

Sticks with you long after the movie is over,"This was my favorite movie in high school and it still remains one of my favorites. Pi set the tone for what was to come with Aronofsky films. Requiem for a Dream absolutely solidified his film making vision. Then you add the collaboration of Clint Mansell with the Kronos Quartet and you have a disturbing masterpiece of cinematic art. That is no easy accomplishment. He has only achieved more since then and continues to use Clint Mansell for his scores, and I would have it no other way. This can be a hard one to watch for most, but I do believe that is the point.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
BRUTAL..REALISTIC..MESMERIZING...pure injustice not giving it any Oscar,"first, i m not going to suggest that this is a must-see film..i don't know how every people will react to this film.this is a heart-breaking.if any one like to be punched hard & mentally tormented then this movie is for them. The max share of credit goes to ARONOFSKY, man what a movie!!!apart from the stunning acting of ELLEN BURSTYN & JENNIFER CONNELLY all belong to the director no doubt..i don't know why no one(in other comments)mentioned the musical effect of this movie...the theme music & background score give it a high no doubt..after schindler's list this movie make me feel bad,make me cry.. finally i ll say another thing: the title & specially the word REQUIEM..literally it means prayer for the one who is dead..how our addiction can make us dead during our life-span is the concept of this awesome movie",,Anonymous,Drama
Its okay,This movie isn't one of the greatest films you will see or one with the deepest message. Its an okay movie following some druggies and one of the mother of one of them and the effects drugs they take for certain purposes or recreation effect them. The effects end up bad and their lives are ruined. The move didn't make me tear up at all because I couldn't just connect with the characters they're just druggies. The mother's effect was partially sad and thats about it. Okay movie 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Drama
Not for the weak and stupid,"I saw this movie after a long time again and was again completely destoyed by it. I'm sure there are just a few movies in the world in that music, acting, narrating and photographing is so well composed and coordinated that all together is just one big intense masterpiece.
It's hard to watch when things escalate in the end of the film but you don't even want to blink your eyes because you're so enamored and not able to escape the pure horror when the lives of the four protagonists go with increasing spead down the drain. The music gets faster, the narrating gets faster, the cuts get faster, the reality and sound blur faster but never too much to let zhe viewer get lost in the story. The downfall can't be stopped anymore. In the end the protagonists are just helpless and so is the audience. It's a knightmare that became a movie and has the same effect too. You're shocked and scared. That's what I call an intense movie! This is nothing you forget hours after watching. From a certain level of inteligence on you will be moved by this picture. So much for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
"a pain to the eyes, but...","an interesting form of filming. In my time, watching many drug films, I've found they either show self destruction (The Basketball Diaries, Trainspotting) or just trippy experiences (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.) This film shows both. The film moves at a rather fast pace to emphasise how quickly the effects of drugs take a hold on people. Each story is separated by a short scene, which show essentially what they are addicted to, be it pills, shooting up or money. The films generally dark nature shows each person spiraling into oblivion and although conflicts seem to be resolved, the scenario left to us is not one of hope, but defeat, that although they have survived the worst, nothing will be the same, and it never gets better. If you have never seen a drug film before, make this one your first.",6.0,Anonymous,Drama
A movie to scare teenagers away from drugs.,"Honestly, I hated the movie. Yes, it was very shocking and unforgettable, but it was also very grimy and pessimistic. It's just not the type of movie that will leave you deep in thought or searching for a meaning. It was very visual and had great actors, but the story itself was awful. After it finished, I felt very sick and disappointed of the world. It is disgusting and the only way I will ever watch it again is when I scare my children away from drugs.Overall, if you're into films with degrading characters that gives you no hope into the future, this movie is perfect for you. I saw it once and will never watch it again.",1.0,Anonymous,Drama
"This movie is an earthquake, this is like a shotgun against your head and one of the most powerful experiences cinema can give you!!!","Watching this movie is an experience which you will not likely forget! I didn't know the movie, but a friend of mine who occasionally smoked weed before, told me that he had never touched it again after watching the movie. This film had such in impact on him that he swore never to touch it again. I had to see this movie. I knew it would be something controversial, but nothing could prepare me for what I would see.What is so special about it, you probably want to know? Well, first you get to know what seem to be rather normal people. OK, you see the son driving with his mom's TV set on a trolley through the streets, but that's about it. He needs some money and goes to a pawnshop with it. But than it all starts: you follow the different characters as they all get more and more addicted to something.This movie makes you see what happens to people who are addicted to drugs, to pills, ... in such a way that you'll never forget about it. It is so shocking, yet so excellent!!! Even thinking about this movie sends shivers down my spine! The music, the way it was filmed, the acting... it all goes so fast, it sucks all the energy out of you. This movie is an earthquake, this is like a shotgun against your head. This is one of the most powerful experiences cinema can give you. I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
Dare yourself to see this movie,"Typically when I see a movie, I see it once, then never really think about it. If I really like a movie, which is not often, I'll watch it again if the chance is given. Anything past twice, is a rarity. Only a small select list of movies I can stand watching more than twice and never get bored. Requiem for a Dream is now on that list. I saw this movie three times in the theaters, and ended up weeping every time at the end. This is truly one of the best films I have ever sat down to watch. Screw D.A.R.E, give this movie to schools, and watch the drug problem disappear. You feel like when watching this movie that you know these characters. These are your brothers, sisters, mothers, blood relatives. It is one of the most gut wrenching films ever. While people are wonder how some films are able to be R when they should be NC-17. The MPAA did a grave injustice of making this NC-17. This is a must see for anyone who wanders the dark side of drugs. While Traffic, also a good film, covered the broad range of drugs from different views, this took the side of the actual user and showed the cold hard reality.",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
A master piece with disturbing parallel,"This movie was a blast for me and I thought it was very very well done. A must see for sure, although not for general audience (some humor but tough scenes, both on the emotional side and to some extent, some violence coming from the sordid environment). The casting was quite good - from the main characters, in my view Harry and Sara, to the secondary ones (Marion, Tyron), all play with a pretty good dynamic making the movie and storyline believable. I found the idea of making a parallel between street drugs and controlled drugs a very smart base for this story - In one hand, Harry goes down a trail of addiction, business from drug then go onto a swirl down to hell ... while Sara on weight loss pills become addicted and end up hallucinating and being hospitalized. Both and a the characters are in search for happiness, success, recognition ... they never get. This is a MUST see.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama

great direction and editing doesn't make up for flat characters,"i really tried to look fondly back at this film as a ""groundbreaking"" piece of art as so many have called it... but the more i think about requiem... the more i didn't like it...the directing and editing was superb... and i will see his next work based solely on the promise he shows as a very able director... both with pi and requiem...i couldn't relate to the characters... at all... i don't care what film it is... if you want your characters to cause emotional responces from your audience you have to make them connect with the audience... not just shock them with devious sex acts, severe infections, television obsession, and quick editing.and on top of not relating... i didn't like the characters... i thought they were more pathetic than anything... didn't feel sorry for them one bit... maybe sara... because i see my grandmother going through the same thing with just losing her husband... but that was it... not that my grandmothers a junky... just the pain she feels parallels the character.you want me to feel bad for a drug addict... give me sick boy, rent boy, or spud. those were characters that i felt sorry for... granted trainspotting is a different type of movie... but the characters related better to the audience... while still getting the same message across... drugs are bad.i gave it a seven because it tried so hard to be a ten...",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
Aronofsky masterpiece,"Requiem for a Dream Aronofsky's best in my opinion!! 4/4 starsWas time once again to watch this awesome film that was directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say this is one of those movies that i can watch 100 times over and never get sick of it. Tne story of 4 people who are co dependants of different forms...drugs and eating disorders who all find out that after achieving the great highs their is always the crashing lows. Great cast includes the always great Ellen Burstyn (who if you asked me got totally robbed by Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich that year in the Oscars) Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans. Aronofsky never even received a nod for best direction (Which in my opinion is a crime) And this all is backed by an amazing soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet (Another miss at the 73rd Academy Awards).All these things i have mentioned make this film epic and is yet another reason why Darren Aronofsky remains in my top 10 directors of all time list!",10.0,Anonymous,Drama
Very inconsistent,"This may have been the most inconsistent movie I have ever watched. The first 2/3rd of the film is really not that good. Not that much happens with the characters and the story develops very slowly. It seems the director is much too preoccupied with the esthetic's of the movie. It's as if an MTV music video director has gone off. The soundtrack and visuals are actually pretty annoying. They keep showing the same clips over and over. I almost stopped watching the movie.I am glad I didn't. Because the last 1/3rd of the movie is amazing!!! It's like the director sobered up and decided to moved things forward. Maybe his heroin fix wore off. With that it feels a bit like a Scorsese crescendo a la Casino and Goodfellas when things start to happen dramatically and a frenetic pace. And you start to care about, and feel the pain of the characters. The soundtrack is haunting, as is the end. All the acting is terrific, with Jennifer Connelly the star. It feels like two different movies, and two different directors. I would rate the last third a 9, but overall no more than a 7, due to the first 2/3rd.",7.0,Anonymous,Drama
"boring, flat, awful","Started to watch this one, after being recommended by friends and reviews i've read but was not amused. I was really BORED with it (so much that I could not resist to fast-forward, almost never happens). I agree that the plot (and trailer) promises an interesting movie to watch. But: no funny dialogs at all, flat characters, the actors we're not interesting at all. I could really not care for the boy. I could really not care for his mum. How do you show the effect of drug abuse? By showing eyeballs?Wanna see a good, gripping movie about drug abuse? Try Trainspotting,and you'll also laugh your pants off!",1.0,Anonymous,Drama

Intense,"The film takes you on a journey through addiction and its effects on four different characters. The cinematography is intense and the acting is top-notch, especially by Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn. The music is also haunting and fits the film perfectly.This movie is not for the faint of heart, as it can be pretty heavy and intense. But if you're up for it, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a film that you won't forget. It's thought-provoking and emotionally charged, and it does a great job of showing how addiction can completely take over a person's life. If you're in the mood for a movie that'll leave a lasting impression, this is definitely one to check out.",9.0,Anonymous,Drama
