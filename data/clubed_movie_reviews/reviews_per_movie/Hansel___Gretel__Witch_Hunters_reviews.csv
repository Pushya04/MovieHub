Everyone Calm Down!!,"In my opinion this is the type of movie to see if: 1)You love and support Jeremy Renner 2)You're in a mood to see cool but not overly flashy effects 3)Love for dark fairy tales 4)Awesome make up and costumes (the witches were very VERY well put together) 5)Just an all around chill movie with gore violence and cool effectsDon't see it if: 1)you expect high quality acting 2)Over the top graphics and effects 3)Complex plot line 4)Extremely witty scriptBecause Jeremy Renner was in big time movies, people are over analyzing this one. It's suppose to be fun with a hint of dark, and entertaining. I was very entertained. I also loved how it was only 88 minutes versus the 2-3 hour movies that have been coming out. I appreciated the toughness of Gemma in the film and Famke as head witch was genius. Overall it served it's purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mindless fun, for better and for worse","Lately we have seen a lot of these fairy tale remakes, where they take a basic fairy tale plot, add in a lot of CGI, slightly darker atmosphere and some sex and call it a day. I still prefer the Disney version, thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts. That being said, this particular fairy tale movie was a pleasant surprise. For one, it didn't try to retell the same exact story we have grown up with. Rather it took the story of Hansel and Gretel and asked the question: ""What if they grew up?"" I'm totally on board with that question. It's something we've never seen before and frankly it's a fascinating idea. So yeah, colour me interested.The film itself ends up being pretty much what anyone would expect. I hesitate to call it a good film, because it has numerous plot holes, nonsensical twists and its characters are somewhat bland and clichéd. On the other hand, it has a good visual style, its action is very pleasing, if a bit gore-filled (not a bad thing in this case), the two main actors are actually pretty good in their roles, and as a whole it's just plain solid fun. Yeah, it's stupid most of the time, but it's fun kind of stupid. The kind where you're just able to sit back, enjoy the scenery and laugh at the jokes.It also needs to be remembered that this was Tommy Wirkola's first big budget film. And for a debut film, this shows a lot of promise. The style is definitely there, as is the atmosphere. The story-telling and the character development need some work, but even big name directors struggle with those every now and then. I'm looking forward to what this guy will bring us next.And that's this film. Yeah, it's one of those so bad it's good films, but I'd still recommend this. The idea alone is worth checking out.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The movie knows it's stupid and has fun with it,"This is not a quality film and I don't think they even meant it to be good or memorable. If you watched the trailers and *didn't* expect it to be terrible, I'd be very, very surprised. I would never have paid to see this. I only saw it because I got passes to a free advance screening. And it was just as ridiculous as I expected - and I was pretty entertained. We were laughing pretty hard the whole time.The movie wasn't trying to have a good plot or a surprise twist. Clocking in at a little over an hour, it could have been season finale of a B-grade TV series of the same premise. I think movie was just trying to be funny, and I think their jokes worked. Like how Hansel has a ""medical condition"" (not spoiling it here). It doesn't work in a physiological sense - but who cares? It was really funny that they even made that connection!There was an incredible amount of gore in this movie; but I suppose that itself was a joke, given the premise of the movie. Their other jokes relied on anachronisms (weapons, fanboys, crime investigations). But they were careful enough that the anachronisms were funny in the context of the world-building instead of being glaring anomalies.There might be some people complaining about what an inadequate film this was with respect to plot, but that would be missing the point. Don't watch this expecting to take away anything - it's really only just for the lawls.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Entertainment,"The siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are left alone in the woods by their father and captured by a dark witch in a candy house. However they kill the witch and escape from the spot. Years later, the orphans have become famous witch hunters.When eleven children go missing in a small village, the Major summons Hansel and Gretel to rescue them, and they save the red haired Mina (Pihla Viitala) from the local sheriff that wants to burn her accusing Mina of witchcraft. Soon they discover that the Blood Moon will approach in three days and the powerful dark witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) is the responsible for the abduction of children. She intends to use the children together with a secret ingredient in a Sabbath to make the coven of witches protected against the fire. Meanwhile Hansel and Gretel disclose secrets about their parents.""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a great entertainment for ordinary viewers like me that like the genre of fantasy but based on the Metacritic Rating, it is not recommended to intellectuals. The story is very funny and the special effects and make-up are top notch. Gemma Arterton is one of the sexiest actresses and it is good to see her again. If the viewer likes this genre, he or she will certainly enjoy ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"". I do not understand why people that like art movies spend their time watching this type of movie and writing bad reviews.

Witch Hunt,"I can understand the movies poor reception and reviews however its one of those movies which you can't help but enjoy anyway. Its extremely fast, witty and has an unprecedented amount of gore. The action is plenty full and it has a simple storyline that plays on a classic fairytale. Although it has a serious tone it doesn't take itself seriously. Instead we get a fun, gruesome and entertaining action/horror movie. Arterton and Renner are strong in there roles and the witches are imaginative but familiar. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter makes good use of its cast, creates some bloody mess all in a really fantasied and exacerbated 19th century.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Leave the kids at home for this one – this revisionist take on the classic fairy tale is an entertaining blend of horror and humour that is as gory as it is vulgar,"What you may or may not remember about the Brothers Grimm' story is over and done with in the first ten minutes of writer-director Tommy Wirkola's revisionist treatment of the classic tale, which basically imagines what happens after the happily ever after. And so Wirkola fast- forwards the story many years later, where he would like us to believe that Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) have found their calling as witch hunters, travelling around from village to village killing the evil ones who kidnap children and rescuing their abductees in the process.One particular such mission brings them to the town of Augsburg, where a beautiful blonde-haired woman named Mina (Pihla Viitala) is due to be drowned in front of an angry crowd by the shifty Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare). The Mayor (Rainer Bock) is not so fast to pronounce judgment on her for the spate of disappearances, and has hired Hansel and Gretel to get to the bottom of it. Seeing no visible signs of sorcery on her, Hansel and Gretel free her, inadvertently setting themselves on a collision course with the Sheriff.But the bitter Sheriff and his band of hunters are the least of their problems – indeed, their most pressing concern is the Grandmother Witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) and her hench-women, who have been keeping the children they have kidnapped locked up in wait for a much more sinister plot to make them even more powerful. Of course, as narrative dictates, Muriel's plan would have something to do with Hansel and Gretel's own past, as well as their extraordinary ability to be immune from the spells of witches.Savvy viewers will be able to spot the connection once the clues are laid, so don't expect a revelatory surprise at the end. That doesn't mean however that this reimagination is predictable; instead, Wirkola keeps you riveted with a surprisingly effective blend of horror and hilarity often within the very same scene. Case in point? Just before she forces someone to turn a shotgun on himself and splatter his brains onto the wall, Muriel comments how the room they are in looks somehow drab and could do with some colour.That same irreverence pervades the entire movie, which shouldn't come as a surprise if you paid attention to the opening credits and spotted Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers of the movie. Their brand of rude cheeky humour is very much alive in Wirkola's first English-language feature, who had demonstrated through his debut movie lampooning Quentin Tarantino – Kill Buljo – that he is perfectly in tune with their sensibilities. But Wirkola also brings his eye for gore – seen in his sophomore film 'Dead Snow' – to this movie, so be prepared for exploding flesh, crushed skulls and some particularly nasty decapitations that is good reason why this grown-up version of Hansel and Gretel does not carry a kid-friendly rating.Amidst the gore and adult humour, Renner and Arterton unfortunately are left with paper-thin characters. While Renner pretty much looks dour throughout the movie, Arterton seems determined to have fun with her ass-kicking female heroine of a role, and her portrayal of Gretel resembles a Lara Croft for the medieval ages. The scene-stealer however is Janssen, the former Bond villain once again relishing the opportunity to play against type as the villain and putting in a deliciously over- the-top performance as Muriel. Other supporting actors don't make much of an impression – including Thomas Mann, a firm Hansel and Gretel devotee who gets some laughs from his fanboy behaviour and eventually sees his wish come true to be a witch hunter like his heroes.And we suspect, how much you will end up enjoying this new twist to the classic fairy tale will also depend on your expectations. Compared to the recent spate of fairytale-inspired Hollywood movies like 'Red Riding Hood' or 'Snow White and the Huntsman', it veers most far off from its source material to tell an entirely different story. The result of that novelty is something bloody all right, that can also prove to be bloody good fun if you're looking for an adult-oriented blend of action, adventure, fantasy, horror and comedy. It might not sound intuitive, but this fairy tale is best enjoyed without the kids.www.moviexclusive.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some Good Moments But Not Enough Energy,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013)** (out of 4)R-rated, gory horror-adventure has brother and sisters Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretal (Gemma Arterton) called to a small town to try and locate some children that have been kidnapped by some witches. Soon they realize that a Queen witch (Famke Janssen) has bigger plans that could have a major change on the world. HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be but there's no question that the entire film just has an uneasy mix of genres that never fully come together and in the end the film just came off as something that didn't know what it wanted to be or do. At times there's some campy comedy moments but these aren't good enough to save the picture. At other times we're given a fairly interesting look at two people hunting witches but the film doesn't do too much with this. We're also given a picture with some extremely graphic gore that comes out of nowhere. I really liked the fact that they went for a R-rating and didn't hold back for a smaller rating but at the same time if you took this away there really wouldn't be much to the movie. The film manages to be slightly entertaining because of this type of gore but at the same time I can see how it might not sit well with some more sensitive viewers. Another thing I liked was the actual look of the witches. The CGI effects were actually quite believable whenever the witches changed form in their faces. The look of the major witch was also quite nice and benefited from the strong and fun performance by Janssen who managed to bring a certain sexy nature to the role. Both Renner and Arterton are good in their parts but the screenplay really makes both characters quite boring and uninteresting. The supporting players here are usually much better and the movie probably would have benefited having them in it more. This includes an obsessed fan of the duo as well as an evil sheriff. Another problem with the film is that you just never really get involved with anything going on. It looks nice and some of the action scenes are put together nicely but there's just no real energy that brings you into the film.",,Anonymous,Horror
Movie could had been good.,"I'll begin by saying i'm one of those that shuts his brain off when watching movies, that's why i avoid doing reviews, this movie not only pissed me off with something that i wasn't warned about but also because it had so much potential. Yet so many writing decisions ruined it.We start this movie with the idea this could be a van hellsing, hellboy, priest type movie, that's happy in a fantasy world with a bit of sad, but really enjoyable.However that's not the case for this movie, visually it looks happy, but than we have constant deaths many of them unneeded and than a S Assault scene that i wasn't ready for and i'm gratefull it was stoped.Is this a dark movie? Happy fantasy? Sad movie? Violent? Serious? Plz Decide and stick to something.And i am sad the Female lead was a damsel in distress. She deserved so much better tbh.Especially when her brother sometimes lacked emotions and didn't even seem to care when someone that got close to him died.Also if the enemy are witches focus on them, too much time was wasted with things that weren't needed and killed the enjoyment of this movie.Movie was like the letter M - Starts ok> becomes awesome > drops and is boring and horrible to watch > becomes awesome again> drops once more.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A ton of stupid fun,"I seriously enjoyed this film-- it had more gore than Mel Gibson could shake a fist at, some very cute actors, and didn't waste time with excessive back-story and details, and gave me many good laughs.Its not an intellectually stimulating movie... duh. Its made to a hilariously entertaining popcorn flick with over-the-top action and unrealistic weapons that wouldn't have existed given the 'time period' this movie seems to be set in. So you folks out there giving it bad rap for not meeting your standards, calm down. Its clearly not trying to. :).This movie's violence reminded me of the Expendables-- but this film never takes itself too seriously like the other film does... I found this much more fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good straight-forward entertainment packed with action.,"It is a pretty straight-forward action flick. With the short runtime of 1 hour and 28 minutes, you can expect this to move briskly and to be packed with a lot of action.The story: The movie starts with the young Hansel and Gretel losing their parents. They are shortly picked by a witch to be food. They manage to escape and burn the witch alive and that's how they become witch hunter. Cue to the opening credit. The next scene shows them saving an innocent woman whom is accused of being a witch. And from there, the action keeps going. There are some slight twists about the innocent woman and Hansel and Gretel's parents. Other than that, it is purely straight-forward for a good thing. The action scenes are not bad but they are more gritty than fantastical. Music wise is quite alright with Han Zimmer acting as the music supervisor.3D: It is okay. As many of the scenes take place at night, the 3D effect dampens. It becomes more like harder to see. But when it comes to explosions, blood splatters and action, it is gimmicky with objects flying to your face. Other than that, the 3D is not really recommended unless you have some spare money.Overall: It is not bad for the month of January. Sure, there is a great potential that the movie never reach but Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters won't disappoint if you want a good entertainment packed with action. Next fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer in Feb.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Kick-a$$ fairy tale which is sharp, edgy, filled with heroics and dirty deeds","I didn't expect much from this so-called fairy tale story which was first published in 1812. If only the brothers Grimm were alive today to watch this updated story line starring the athletic and attractive Gemma Arterton as Greta, and her tough as nails diabetic brother Hansel played by versatile actor Jeremy Renner, I think they (the brothers Grimm) would be so impressed as to how the writer/director Tommy Wirkola brought their story to life (and death to the many witches).The supporting cast of stars such as Famke Janssen (witch Muriel), Pihla Viitala (good witch Mina), Peter Stormare (Sheriff Berringer), giant and lovable troll Edward (Derek Mears), and novice witch hunter in training Ben (Thomas Mann) were all extremely well played.I loved the darkish firey cinematography, the suspenseful battles between the witch hunters and the witches, and the twists and turns in the storylines and the characters. This was a more than impressive introduction which I hope we will soon be followed up by a sequel also starring Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Derak Mears, and their witch hunter in training Thomas Mann.A pleasantly under appreciated adventure/fantasy/action film worthy of a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"When you start watching a movie titled ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", you probably shouldn't expect all that much in the way of anything too complicated or heavy.What you get from the ninety-odd minutes is Jeremy Renner (Hansel) and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) as the brother and sister from the candy house that you probably remember from the old fairy tales, only in this particular treatment, their childhood experience convinces them to start hunting witches with all manner of weaponry.There are so many cool action scenes, the occasional bit of dark humour and plenty of bloody, violent horror/action as the siblings try to uncover the mystery behind children being abducted from a village, to a soundtrack that at times features rock. Some of the dialogue is decidedly modern, adding to a real melting pot of styles and themes.An entertaining film that definitely doesn't take itself too seriously. Renner and Arterton are great, as is Famke Janssen as Muriel, the head honcho of the bad witch brigade. They're all hamming it up a bit, but it definitely works.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie doesn't know what it is,"The problem with Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is that it doesn't know it's audience. The R-rated content just doesn't seem right for the silly premise and material. Additionally, the gadgets and weapons feel like something out of a futuristic action flick. I like the look of the witches, though, and there are some enjoyable moments. I don't think it's a good movie, but I also didn't hate it as much as I thought I was going to.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Because It's Entertaining,"Overall, the story isn't very great and is pretty predictable, but it's very entertaining. Basically, it's a cool movie that has a lot of cool kills, and weaponry with a no better than decent story. Plus, watching Gemma Arterton (and according to my female friends, Jeremy Renner) make the movie more enjoyable as well . It's quite violent and pretty gory, but if you're like me (a young adult who's pretty sensitive to blood and gore), you'll be fine. There are only a few parts that are cringe-worthy. Has a nice amount of rewatchability to it and is definitely a fun one to watch. If you're looking for a good story, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you're looking for something entertaining and fun to watch, it's a good one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Expected,"I've had this movie on my watch list for a while now and have noticed over time the ratings have gotten better. I recently saw it's worldwide box office at over $300million so I thought I would give it a shot and see if it was indeed worth the wait.It was. Hansel and Gretal was much better than I thought. The CGI was great and the storyline was good as well. My only complaint on the movie was it's short running time, 90mins I think. The movie would have easily been better as a two hour or more movie which would allow the story to expand in some areas and better tell some details that certain scenes needed. While the film itself was great and the story fit the running time, I felt that as I was really getting into the movie there wasn't much movie left. All in all, this movie was much better than I expected. It's worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Hansel & Gretel"" is a pretty dopey movie, and the 3D just makes it dopier","The nicest thing about ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is the casting of its two leads. Jeremy Renner, one of the most worthy of rising stars in Hollywood today, has an uncanny ability to slide into any role thrown his way by doing little more than just playing off his own personality. He's got a rugged quality reminiscent of Steve McQueen. Opposite him is Gemma Arterton, who also has a charismatic, easygoing appeal when placed in front of a motion picture camera, and who seems to have built most of her success by appearing in violent medieval-set movies such as this. Had she been a bigger name fifteen years ago, she would have probably wound up somewhere in Peter Jackson's lavish ""Lord of the Rings"" films, and it's kind of funny she wasn't in last year's ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" And both Mr. Renner and Miss Arterton can, as they demonstrate at one point in the movie, bond on-screen. The highlight of the movie consists of them reuniting in a remote cabin in the woods, embracing each other. They really do seem to love and care about one another.It's a shame that's the only time they are allowed to show any sense of sibling bondage, as they spend the rest of the movie falling out of trees, getting the tar beaten out of them, and being plastered with exploding body parts. ""Hansel & Gretel"" follows in the tradition of many contemporary medieval, blood-soaked epics: it's completely overproduced. The dialogue is overwritten and punctuated with about two dozen too many swear words, a lot of the make-up meant to make blood-thirsty witches look intimidating comes across, by contrast, as rather corny. The witches hiss and grunt like comic-book critters. And the movie is more concerned about making silly jokes (a villager popping like a balloon and plastering a pub with his insides while the local fan-boy remarks, ""That was awesome!"") than creating a sense of adventure. There's a lot of computer-enhanced tweaking to the picture, to make the witches look even uglier, and it too pushes the film's visual presentation overboard. Maybe the filmmakers of the 1970s and 80s medieval pictures would have wallowed in this computer technology if it were available at the time, but their advantage was, oddly enough, not having it in their possession. For it forced them to use their ingenuity and utilize the genuine magic of practical effects such as full-fledged make-up and props. I personally have always been more intimidating by a movie-monster when I realize it's actually there with the actors, not painted in with a computer four months after production ended. The one exception is a big friendly troll named Edward who forms a sort of ""King Kong""-esque friendship with Miss Arterton. What the computer artists do with the character's eyes, in particular, is really effective, and I found myself caring a whole lot more about this ten-foot-tall critter than any of the little kids the witches were planning to devour.Next to the actors, the stuff I liked best consisted of the alternate-reality gadgets. Director Tommy Wirkola has set his story—his first one produced in the United States—in the sort of world that James Whale made popular with ""Frankenstein"" in the 1930s. He combines technology/life styles into a blend between ancient times and today. Hansel and Gretel hunt witches using crossbows as well as every variety of firearm known to modern-day man. Machine guns, included. If they only had an H-bomb on their hands, they would have really had it made. But that was also part of the fun, showing me a blend of two different worlds. At one point in the film, a temporary sidekick picks up one of their gadgets—a sort of old-fashioned taser gun—uses it to subdue a witch, and remarks, ""I like your toys!"" I concur.Even though Hans Zimmer is credited only as the executive producer for the soundtrack and Alti Orvarsson for actually writing the music we hear, one can sense Mr. Zimmer's influence. His scores for Christopher Nolan's three Batman movies can even be heard poking their thump-thumpthump-thump-thump! motifs at certain points. This is not a detractor, as the music, no matter how much it shows its influence, is very good.I would like to see Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton team up in another, better movie with a better sense of adventure. Yes, a ""Hansel & Gretel: Part II"" would be welcomed by me, if it improves upon its source. There are many definitions to a good adventure-movie, but the one I utilize is this: how much disbelief can I suspend? Most of these movies raise lots of logistics questions, but if it works on its own terms, I won't ask those questions until the movie's over. But if my interest becomes lost, those questions will start firing away like a machine gun. And they were firing away during ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters."" If Mr. Renner needs to inject a medicine into his leg every few hours and he spends most of his life in the wilderness, how does he replenish his supply? Does he ever run out? Why does it take one person a few hours to walk between a town and remote spot in the woods, and yet it takes the experienced Hansel and Gretel until nightfall to get to a cabin about halfway? I'm aware these sorts of questions are not welcomed—and I would have preferred not to ask them during the screening—but my attention span was constantly sputtering.And I guess I might as well address the 3D. Not being a fan of the process, this go-around also failed to impress me. Even with globs of blood, fiery debris, and bullets launching from the screen. See the film in 2D, for nothing is really going to seem to be missing. ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a pretty dopey movie, and the 3D just makes it dopier.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
High on the revulsion and stupidity scale,"On the revulsion and stupidity scales, this film is on about a par with ""The Human Centipede"". From the revulsion perspective: I get irritated by people constantly whingeing and complaining about their rights - women's rights, men's rights, children's rights, elderly rights, indigenous rights, disabled rights, whales' rights. The list goes on. But even I have my limits. The violence against women in this film is plain revolting. Whether witches or not, the succession of women being punched, kicked, bashed, stabbed, shot, beheaded, threatened with rape and generally brutalised is just sinister and totally wrong.The film-makers seem to have delighted in extremes. Watching actors pretend to vomit on screen doesn't usually concern me much, but when the young guy throws up towards the end, even that is repulsive.And then there's the stupidity. During the blatantly obvious and pathetic setup for a sequel, the Hansel character says something like ""they will know our powers. And know that we are coming to get them."" Powers? What powers? Hansel and Gretel appear to be the most incompetent, powerless, clueless dorks roaming the landscape, who spend the entire film getting their asses kicked by whoever wants to kick them.And don't even think about the guns.Jeremy Renner was probably the only actor here with some claim to credibility, although ""The Bourne Legacy"" didn't do him any favours in that regard. But with this film, he seems to have set himself on the path to career destruction.I give the film 1 star only because 0 stars doesn't seem to be an option. An excruciatingly bad film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surpassed My Low Expectations!,"Before viewing this movie, I knew it was not going to be a masterpiece. I already had incredibly low expectations for it and I thought I was going to hate it. After viewing it, I can say it's a pretty bad....ass film. It's not a great film, but it's ridiculously entertaining and even really funny. There's lots of gore here, so people who love endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.Tommy Wirkola's film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the Grimm Brothers, Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult lives, where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually get the job done, but then there is this witch who believes she is the most powerful of all.The acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a hard-nosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.Overall, I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen, but I wasn't in the mood for any in-depth story. I just wanted to see witches die, and I think I can say my wish was fulfilled.

If you liked 'Van Helsing' you'll probably enjoy this too,"Mini-Review: Last night we watched 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'. I found it to be a fun movie for the most part. It reminded me very much of the '2004' film 'Van Helsing'. If you liked that, you might like this also. They had the same sort of fantastic weapons as Van Helsing did, seemingly impossible for the time periods depicted. There were more witches in this movie than you can shake a broomstick at . Most were appropriately scary or weird looking. The acting was good and there was plenty of action. There was some gore, not too excessive, enough to earn its R-rating I suppose. Occasionally the language seemed a bit out of place, just like the weapons were, for the time. For instance when under-stress our two heroes liked to use the F word. No big deal, just that it somehow seemed out of place, and too contemporary for the surrounding mood. The ending left the door open for a sequel or two if it was a success at the box-office. I did like the friendship that developed between Gretel and an unlikely character in the story. There was also a love story with Hansel. Both side stories added some ""charm"". I don't want to say more and reveal too much.",,Anonymous,Horror

Guillermo Del Toro is a shoe-in for this sort of films...,"But this film is not quite as good as Hellboy. Of course any child or grown-up knows the classic tale of Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm. It is about a brother and sister(Hansel and Gretel) abandoned deep within the woods by their father who follows every command of their newly acquired evil stepmother. Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles during the trip.After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then they follow the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's horror. Once again provisions become scarce, and the stepmother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there to die. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the doors locked and find it impossible to escape from their parents' house.The following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs to follow home. However, after they are once again abandoned, the children find that birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods.The children try to find a way out, but stumble across a witches hut made out of every sort of sweet things imaginable: cakes, cookies, sugar candy, chocolate, cream etc., etc. The children begin to consume parts of the house when the door to the house opens and out pops an old woman who invites them in and sets before them a scrumptious feast. She is actually an evil witch who uses the house to lure unsuspecting children on whom she feasts.Her plan was to fatten Hansel and then to eat him. So after the children have eaten, she immediately puts Hansel in cage and locks it. She then orders Gretel to do all sorts of chores in the house, of which the most important was to feed Hansel. As the days passed the witch asked Hansel to stick out his finger which she feels to see if he is fat enough to be cooked and eaten. But Hansel cleverly offers a bone he found in the cage (presumably a bone from the witch's previous captive) and the witch feels it, thinking it is his finger. Due to her blindness, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, ""be he fat or lean."" She prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to open the oven and prods her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what she means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the witch into the oven and slams and bolts the door shut, leaving ""The ungodly witch to be burned to ashes"", with the witch screaming in pain until she dies. Gretel frees Hansel from the cage, and the pair discover a vase full of treasure and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water, and at home they find only their father; his wife died from unknown causes. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.Okay on to THIS FILM: After destroying the witch, Hansel and Gretel become famed bounty hunters dedicated to mercilessly eradicating witches, slaying over six hundred of them. Their work is relatively easy because, for an unknown reason, they are immune to spells and curses. Hansel, however, is diabetic as a result of his ordeal and needs to take a regular shot of insulin every few hours.One day, in the town of Augsburg, Hansel and Gretel prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing Mina, a young woman accused of witchcraft. Mayor Englemann has hired the siblings to find and rescue several children abducted by witches.Watch this film to find out what happens next! This film is fasted paced with graphic action scenes and gore and has some nudity. Therefor I wouldn't recommend this film for children under 13 years.Notable Stars: Famke Jannsen(Deep Rising,X-Men Trilogy, Goldeneye, Lord Of Illusions), Peter Stormare(Fargo, 8mm, Lockout) and Jeremy Renner (Dahmer(MUST SEE FILM!)

Plenty of Fun in the Mix of Horror and Action Genres,"Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Atherton) are bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the world. As the fabled Blood Moon approaches, the siblings encounter a new form of evil that might hold a secret to their past.Going into this, I was not expecting a good film or a bad one, but just your typical action film (albeit with a fairy tale twist). And then I noticed it was directed by Tommy Wirkola, the wonderful human being who brought the world ""Dead Snow"". My expectations and hopes went up a notch... and were fulfilled.Apparently the film has mixed reviews from critics but positive reviews from the horror community (despite not necessarily being a horror film). I can see why. What looks like an action film on the surface is just an excuse for some dark humor and endless gallons of blood.My only peeve was the use of CGI, but it was comforting to know that Wirkola fought against the CGI and used practical effects wherever possible. I wish he had gotten a few more traditional methods in there, but I suppose when you have a budget big enough you have to cater to some folks...I enthusiastically liked this film and hope the sequel is able to match its style and tone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No, just, no","Recently, we've become accustomed to seeing two types of fantasy romps – the darker ones such as 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and the less- serious, genre-mashup, particularly Timur Bembakatov's 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. Consequently, it's unsurprisingly that Hansel and Gretel would make it to the big-screen once more, however, with this film, they can't be said to fall into either category, but conversely, both. It's just unfortunate that the movie doesn't really work as either.Diluted down to its basics, the story is something that would intrinsically appeal to a younger audience, due to its fairytale roots, but here it has been given a more 'grown-up' treatment which means brash swearing, nudity and of course, violence. Subsequently, this graphic content is done in too childish a manner to make the film an 'adult' one. At the same time, it attempts to maintain a dark and grim atmosphere to possibly scare viewers, which fails, incidentally. Then, on top of this, there are scenes intended to be ones of genuine emotion to make you empathise with the characters and also scenes that strive to parody the fantasy genre. All of these elements are things that might just work together, but here feel rather disjointed. Also, it's been said that to properly make a parody of something you need to truly love it, but here, such scenes feel quite crass.I'm aware that this movie is not supposed to be a high-brow work of art, it's supposed to be a slice of enjoyable fantasy adventure, and don't get me wrong, I love a good fantasy romp as much as the next man (I even have a soft spot for 2004's 'Van Helsing') and often relish a nice dollop of violent (and somewhat silly) action, having thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's adaptation of '300'. Yet, I'd struggle to relate this film to being anything remotely close to enjoyable; I frequently tried to enjoy this movie, but couldn't find any cause to, with my interest consistently drifting off.The action scenes are remarkably unremarkable, with editing that mightn't be out of place in a Michael Bay actioner and overstuffed with flimsy CGI. The characters themselves are unengaging, with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arteton striding around with American accents that just confounded me, as other players such as Peter Stormare (who can do much better than this) have thick European accents. The creature make-up and design was nothing special and the ogre look unbelievably cheap. If you want to properly do fantasy creatures, just look at someone like Guillermo del Toro. But most significantly, the film was deathly dull, boring, and frankly, forgettable.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Plain Bad,"If someone ever figures out the point of this film, don't bother telling me.In 1812 Germany Hansel and Gretel run around hunting witches with everything from modern revolvers, pump shotguns, belt fed machines guns, and tasers. There's even a appearance by a phonograph. Oh yes, and pumpkins. Plenty of pumpkins around Halloween in Germany.I could forgive all this historic silliness if the film had any entertainment value. It doesn't.There's nothing really to say accept that this film is poorly made and is completely devoid of any plot, characters, or actors.Why such a high rating on IMDb.com? Because as usual the studio's social media advertisers have fully infiltrated the page with fake reviews.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Love This Movie,"It seems critics nowadays just want serious movies that last hours on end, they don't want action or 3D, they just want to listen to dialogue driven movies that frankly don't go anywhere heart pumping or exciting. It's a real shame when critics can't enjoy watching two of the coolest, freshest actors totally ripping the guts out of evil witches in spectacularly gory style. We need more movies like this, films that don't take themselves seriously and just aim for all out entertainment. Fast paced, sharp and ferociously violent, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is hands down the most fun and wildly over the top adventure of 2013, it will be hard to beat. The story is played out fast and loose, just like the 3D and special effects which are insanely brilliant, the action is explosive but the best feature is the acting. Jeremy Renner is very entertaining, his humour is very blunt and deadpan and it's a change from his roles in Avengers, Bourne & Mission Impossible. Gemma Arterton is very cool, she takes a whole lot of punches and she fights back with brute force, and most of the bad-ass one liners come from her, ""Let the girl go, or I'm gonna blow you sheriff brains all over these hillbillies"". It has to be said though, that Famke Janssen is the best, you can tell she is having a blast playing the evil witch Muriel, whenever she comes on screen you can't help but smile, and there's a sense of unpredictability with her character, who knows what she will do next?! It's repeat viewing material and a heck of a blast and there is never a dull moment, just all out action, fun twists and a whole lot of laughter.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hunting Season,"I have to admit, that the movie never felt like it was dragging. The running time seems to be perfect, though I only have watched the theatrical version up to this point. I was a bit surprised that we got a bit of nudity in the movie, because Hollywood Blockbusters tend to avoid that sort of thing. Don't get too excited though (unless the extended cut offers more of that, that is).But the movie does live off the performances. Not only the lead characters, but also the supporting cast. A twist towards the end of the movie is predictable, but still fun to watch. It's sort of roller-coaster ride. Short and fast, some will like it and some will hate it, because they might feel sick afterwords (good effects).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"boring, scriptless, in one word awful","I wasn't expecting anything when I watched this movie in theater. Here is my advice for any person who's looking on IMDb if it is worth to be seen : run run run!!!!!!!!. I know ""Hansel and Gretel"" might not be the worst movie of all time, but it is definitely one of them. The acting is shallow (I suspect the actors weren't convinced themself of the scenario), the medieval contemporary / atmosphere is a mess ( ""Van Helsing"" replica but much worse ), and god all I can remember really about the movie is that tons of of ketchup and strawberry jam spammed at every single minute of the movie, looking to put any sense in this glorious mess ""Hansel and Gretel"" - Witch Hunter...I struggled to not leave during the movie, having some hope for a potential sparkling in the scenario, which will save the day... but really everything is predictable. Even my husband passed out on the first quarter of the movie. You will not see any memorable speech/scene/atmosphere in this popcorn movie. The dark tale of ""Hansel and Gretel"" that I read once when I was young has nothing to do with this thing. I put one star, for the make-up artist of the witches ( can't put 0 anyway ).",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters — Action and magic in the medieval times,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action hero movie set in the dark ages. It's a roller coaster with almost non-stop fighting.The premise of the movie is quite interesting, and well developed. The special effects are top- notch, the sets very immersive, the camera moves just right, and the soundtrack solid.However, the story is weak, the suspense even more so, the dialogs are no more than minimalist, and the characters very shallow, but well acted.All of that being said, it's still excellent entertainment, especially on a large screen.

Renner and Arterton:  Killer Combination!,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the poster for ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters"" because it actually puts together my two favorite current movie stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton! I liked Gothic interpretations of fairy tales like ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". And I also liked the ""supernaturalization"" of historical figures like ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" a lot. This film seems to be a cross of those two types, and so is one film I made sure I would watch this once it opened.Hansel and Gretel starts as we all know them from the fairy tale, children left by their parents in the woods. They were lured by a house made of candy, and was captured by the wicked witch who lived inside. We all know how the tale ends, when Hansel and Gretel push the witch into the oven. But that was just the beginning of the movie, for that was when this brother-sister team launch their career as mercenary witch hunters. When a mysterious series of missing children terrorizes a small town, its mayor hires Hansel and Gretel to look for the witches responsible and kill them.That was one shallow story line I know, but I really enjoyed myself while watching this movie. Yes, the gore factor was really high, but everything appeared to be done with tongue strictly in cheek. The actors Renner and Arteron are unquestionable bad-ass! They fit the titular roles very well. You will meet a new, more interesting ""Edward"" here. The CG and production design were quite good and imaginative. It was fun to spot traditional witch lore in the scenes, even as they took liberties to invent their own lore.As I mentioned, the film does not shy from bloody violence, as the envelope is pushed to graphically show various mechanisms of death, from crushing to exploding - close-up! There was a brief scene of a nude village beauty Mina (Pihla Viitala) as she seduces Hansel. There were even unexpected modern-day swear words during the witch battles. With all of these scenes, I do not really know how it got a PG-13 rating in this country! Anyway, despite and maybe because of all these surprises, I found the whole film a lot of grown-up fun, a very entertaining one and half hours.After the movie, I found out that the director was Tommy Wirkola, the same guy who directed the Norwegian Nazi zombies in the snow movie ""Dead Snow."" So that is why his strange Tarantino-esque sense of humor is all over this film. I am a fan! I will be awaiting his next project. However, for all the fun I had watching this film though, I think they should be happy with what they have now. I think a H&G sequel would already be pushing their luck.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"When in doubt, go for Jeremy Renner","Left in the woods as children, Hansel and Gretel grow up to become infamous witch hunters after encountering one in a house of candy when they were abandoned. They're hired to help find eleven missing children, who were said to be taken by witches. But they find out even more about their past, and learn more about themselves than they choose to know.This was a sweet take on Hansel and Gretel, a beloved grimm fairy tale we all knew as kids. You know the story, two kids were abandoned by their father in the woods. They come upon a house of candy, and a witch lives inside. The witch makes Gretel fatten Hansel up so he could be eaten, but they kill the witch and escape.But in Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, the story doesn't end there. In fact, the story continues on to say that they become infamous witch hunters, known all across the land for hunting terrible witches and other dark magic. When a mayor of a little town hires them to take control of the search for eleven missing children (said to be taken by witches), their job doesn't get easier.They kick a lot of ass and take a lot of names, but these are some strong witches. It was one thing I liked about this movie. Hansel and Gretel weren't technical invincible, so they didn't always win. And the witches? They were creepy! The design of these witches was very creative, and I'm sure it was definitely creepy to see in 3D.I really liked the original take of this classic fairy tale. Renner and Arterton had very good chemistry together on screen. Both characters were very well developed and played out. The script was great as well, the dialogue flowed well and the humor was spot on. Case in point, if you liked movies like Brothers Grimm and Van Helsing, You'll like Hansel and Gretel. If not, just go for the very fact that Jeremy Renner is in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"It's a little strange why this film wasn't given advanced press previews in the US, and for territories like ours there was a review embargo to comply with, signalling the lack of confidence the filmmakers and distributors have on this film update of the Hansel and Gretel storyline. Perhaps they're taking a leaf out of recent updates to fairy tales such as the two Snow White movies, and Red Riding Hood, that they want to be a bit deaf to criticisms, and to allow audiences to judge instead. But Hansel and Gretel as witch hunters followed the mold of Blade, and proved to be quite the mass market entertainer, with no pretences in wanting to be more.Written and directed by Norwegian Tommy Wirkola, this story had all the right ingredients for the kind of film it wanted to be, taking the familiar folk lore, and putting a creative, not necessarily new, spin on it. We see how the two kids get brought out to the woods, only this time there isn't a trail of crumbs to follow home. The iconic house of bread and sweets, and the wicked witch who wants to fatten Hansel as food later on are all included, as do their defeat of the witch by burning her alive in the stove. This forms the prologue, and the What If scenario that Hansel and Gretel were to build on their initial success, and form a career out of hunting, and destroying witches anywhere, bounty hunter style.As you would already have seen in the trailer, this is but one of their adventures shown in helping a village deal with the menace of the witch Muriel (Famke Janssen), who together with her posse of like-minded witches have kidnapped children in preparation of a ritual to be performed under the blood moon. And there's no other better for the job than for Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), engaged by the mayor thanks to the widespread news of their successful witch hunting exploits played over the opening credits. The rest of the story is nothing but set action piece after set action piece, paced frantically without any pause longer than necessary, with a story that ties it all in to their origins, and going full circle.clocking in at just under 90 minutes, the movie has two surprise acts and characters best kept under wraps, one to reverse the mantra that the witch hunters adopt to their methods, and the other a fine character introduced that shed clues to their origin story. Jeremy Renner continues in his sharing of the limelight in roles he had chosen of late, preferring to be the team player from the Impossible Mission Force to the Avengers, and continues as one half of the brother-sister team. Gemma Arterton is perhaps best known for her role as the Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, with her dramatic roles having never made it here. And having another Bond girl in Famke Janssen in yet another villainous role also helped, although every character in this film is pretty one dimensional.But this is an action-adventure taking a well known fairy tale and giving it a license to thrill with blood and gore. While most of the effects are CG laden, it doesn't flinch from wanting to showcase burning at the stakes and various forms of dismemberment and beheadings that increases its body count in very gory terms. It's a story about witch hunting in a fantasy setting, and it exploits this setting perfectly. A definite recommend for any action junkie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Steampunk Bros Grimm,"This is additional to the story we all know from our childhood. Only instead of the traditional ending we witness Hansel and Gretel become steampunk mercenaries. For those who don't know, steampunk is genre of fantasy that features steam-powered machinery or inventions far ahead of their time. At any moment I thought for sure Hansel would whip out a hand powered cell phone and call his sister. This action packed romp is not for the kids, but geared for the adult action junkies. The acting is over the top, but that is part of its charm. Not my top pick for a movie but this could have been done a lot worse. Definitively a ""guy film"" with naked babes, tight leather, explosions, and dismemberment. There wasn't any surprises or big reveals, the plot is straight forward. Overall it would have been better to have just developed an original story than linking this to the Hansel and Gretel story. Too many guys aren't going to jump at watching something that sounds like it was meant for children and I can imagine the irate parents who thought this was a scary movie for the family to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of an R rating,"Whenever I manage to predict more than three lines of dialogue right before the characters say it on screen, it's a sign that the movie isn't going too well for me.Still for the better part of the movie, what annoyed me most was how utterly weak and beat up- able the two protagonists were in contrast with their portrayals from the trailer. Gemma Arterton's Gretel has the uncanny yet wonderful covetable ability to take incredible amounts of hits, slaps, punches, elbows, and outright diver-hammer blows--mostly in her face--without sustaining any visible mark that lasted more than two scenes. For a tough, burly witch hunter guy who didn't take prisoners, Jeremy Renner's Hansel has a poorly explained and even more careless paid off medical condition that requires a completely unexplained yet miraculous cure- -the situation and stakes of which he outright explains the to a woman who was inexplicably two thousand times more attractive than her fellow town folks, who later, after Gretel proclaims his inability to swim, finds it incredibly appropriate to take off her clothes and lead him into a neck-high pond. Oh but he saved her life at the beginning of the story, so it all made sense.Which leads to another complaint I wish to make. This is an R-rated movie that markets gore, monster make-up and good cleavage, but except for some exploding human bodies and witches being deconstructed through various ways and means, I found it hard to hook on to more than a couple of minutes' worth of adrenaline rushes. Said rushes, unfortunately, was all I came to see and was willing to spend time on. The witches were definitely not bewitching to look at, and we get a beautiful shot of aforementioned lady's back--best part of the entire movie hands down--but it just kinda ends there.Looking beyond the identity crisis of the two protagonists which seems to sway unpredictably from hero to anti-hero to childhood abuse victims and then to sex symbols (where they belong), the very viewer-friendly plot that allows its audience to gain about 50 minutes' head start 5 minutes into the movie, and the wonderfully anachronistic gadgets they were able to collect along their journey to adulthood, you will find--well basically you will find the ending credits.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A silly, enjoyable run through the woods","I didn't really fancy this movie, it looked a bit silly. Well it is but what it does it does very well.Hansel and Gretel mean business this time and charge around the countryside sticking it to the witches. The action is fast moving and exhilarating, lots of attention has been paid to the setting and scenery.The plot however is very choppy. People stroll into the story then wander out, or pop up in the middle of swamps and spill their hearts out to the characters to move the scene along or plug a gaping plot hole.The reason the plot is so sporadic is the film weighs in under the 90 minute mark which is a massive feat for a modern movie.The women are attractive, the medieval James Bond weaponry is clever, the different breeds of witches exotic and interesting.The violence is gratuitous but not graphic, peoples heads explode into red mist or get there arms torn off but in a very comic book manner. A woman gets punched in the face about every 7 minutes but they are always straight back on their feet with perfect hair and make-up.A bit of a silly, Buffyesque romp, I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entirely unwieldy,"HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an entirely unwieldy comic book-style movie that sees the fairy-tale characters reinvented as VAN HELSING-style ass-kickers who hunt down and kill witches in various gory ways. The film has the same bright, fantastic look as the likes of other recent fare such as RED RIDING HOOD and it proves to be an entirely superficial adventure, and also one that's completely unwieldy.First of all, the story is all over the place. Our heroes are smart asses throughout, happy dishing out one liners but struggling when they're required to provide anything more than that. The sub-plot involving their back story is a non-starter, as is the whole 'witch conspiracy' thing. Attempts to tie the story in to real-life witch cases like the infamous Salem trials are negated by the whole steampunk technology vibe going on; realistic this ain't.So, what does the film have to recommend it? A ton of CGI-heavy action, that's what, which is neither here nor there really. A lot of it is over choreographed and it's occasionally a chore to sit through, particularly in that overlong and repetitive final fight scene. I hated how characters seem to be randomly indestructible, like Jeremy Renner who's stabbed twice in the stomach at one point only never to mention it again! Gemma Arterton is advertised as a tough ass-kicking heroine but turns out to be a mere damsel in distress, requiring rescue over and over again. The less said about Famke Janssen's villain, the better. I don't know who gives the worst performance as a witch in 2013; it's either her or Emma Thompson in BEAUTIFUL CREATURES.The one thing the film has going for it is the bloodshed; this is R-rated produce so we get to see various characters killed in various bloody ways. There seems to be an emphasis on people exploding which is always good fun, and the introduction of a giant troll character into the storyline is an intriguing one. Hints at an incestuous sub-plot between the siblings are interesting even though they eventually go nowhere, and the film ends up petering out completely at the end. HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is a mess, yes, but one that's not totally without merit for those who love their B-movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This film is stupid, stupid, STUPID...  and so much fun! ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is big, loud fun at it's finest that (thankfully) doesn't take itself too seriously.","There's something of a trend going on today in cinema. And that is gritty, violent reboots and re-tellings of old stories, whether they be fictional fairy-tales or real-world figures. Yes, over the past couple of years, audiences have been given odd reboots of old stories. Everything from dark takes on classics like ""Snow White"", to even silly ""What If's?"" featuring the likes of Abraham Lincoln... fighting vampires. (Which ended up producing quite a fun, quirky little action film, but I digress)So I wasn't too surprised to learn that Hollywood was planning on unleashing a new take on the classic fable of ""Hansel & Gretel"", this time telling the story of how after escaping the witch who tried to kill them, the siblings went on a lifelong conquest to hunt other witches for profit. What I was surprised about was how much fun that film is. Yes, it's time to take a look at ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"", a goofy, loud and very stupid action movie that is loaded floor-to-ceiling with rampant entertainment value, thankfully because it never takes itself too seriously.We begin with a brief re-telling of the classic, with some alterations. After a young Hansel and Gretel are lead out to the woods by their father, and survive a struggle against a cruel witch inside of the infamous gingerbread-house, they are unable to find their way home, or figure out what happened to their parents. Now grown up, having assumed the roles of bounty-hunters who kill witches for payment, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) find themselves in the town of Augsburg, which is being terrorized by witches that have been abducting local children. They are hired to figure out what is happening, return the children and slay the witches responsible. However, they soon realize the true threat, a witch named Muriel (Famke Janssen), may be a bigger threat than any they have ever faced, and that their journey may hold the keys to solving the leftover mysteries of their past.The acting is a tad mixed, I will admit. Renner is a lot of fun as Hansel, but is a tad wooden on screen. Almost as if he is unsure what to do with his limited development as a character. Arterton is great, however, giving Gretel a fairy fun, complex personality and enriching her role quite a bit. Janssen is a one-dimensional villain for sure, but she seems to be having a lot of fun hamming it up during her scenes. And supporting roles by the likes of Thomas Mann and Peter Stormare are decently played.The script by writer/director Tommy Wirkola is quite fun, albeit flawed. I cannot tell if it's the fault of the script of over-eager editing, but the film does move way too fast at times. At only 88 minutes, it really feels like the film could have used a bit more footage to give it a more organic flow. Characters are also under- written and the storyline is very predictable. However, there is a lot of fun to be had in the quirky, not-taking-itself-too- seriously tone, and the over-the-top style. (When our heroes casually toss around ""f-bombs"" while lopping off the heads of witches in gloriously gory sequences, you know the film is aiming to entertain first and is not taking itself too serious) There's also a surprising amount of humor here that works quite well, and gave me some good belly-laughs. (Which is somewhat unsurprising upon learning that funny-man Will Ferrell and his frequent collaborator Adam McKay are producers here.)Wirkola's direction is a lot better than his writing, though. The film is dripping with style, giving us some very cool action sequences, a lot of great visual touches and a fantastic eye for design. (This film for me has the most iconic ""Gingerbread House"" I've seen in any adaptation of the story.)And it's mainly that kinetic, stylized, over-the-top style of the film that makes it work so well. Something about this flick just clicks, despite the under-written characters and rushed pace. That fact it doesn't take itself too serious, and is full of such fun direction really makes up for the other faults, and makes this an enjoyable sit for audiences.It's pure dumb-fun fluff at its finest. All style, jokes and action. And I appreciate films like that from time to time.And because it is such a fun time, I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst example of blind purchase,"Unlike the music industry, films and increasingly games are released with very little accurate representation about the product. We buy the product relatively unseen, and as such film and game producers regularly produce tripe and expect us to swallow it, and why not, the old adage 'you'll never go poor pandering to the lowest Lowest common denominator' has never being more true. This is an attempt by the producers to make as much money as possible before word gets out how truly awful it is. I watched the trailer and like most, wasn't expecting anything thought provoking, more like 90 minutes of eye candy, and it is just that. However it is obvious from the first 10 minutes that there was absolutely no care, passion or personal investment in this film by anyone remotely involved in it's creation. I can easily believe that every scene is the first take of every performance the actors gave and the script was likewise unhindered by minor issues like editing and rewrites.When the film came out I read very poor reviews almost immediately. but always try to make my own mind up. This said I wasn't about to pay to see it given the average low scores it was getting, and ended up waiting several months before a watchable copy appeared on the web. Which brings up an interesting point. Films, albums and games that are well made, tend to appear on the net instantly, possibly because the companies making them know that they will sell themselves and continue to make money over time because the product has value and consumers can see that and will invest in it because of that. Where as poor films, games and albums leave a bad taste and we don't feel compelled to reward the work of those involved in its creation, after all if they didn't care why should we. Of course everything is open to personal taste and perspective but more and more the issue of piracy is brought up as the demon of the web, when in fact in certain circumstances, it can help to uncover shady business practises and reveal the true intentions of unscrupulous corporations. So why shouldn't the public get a heads up before paying for something that we might not like. Unlike buying a game or album the cinema experience never suffers from people asking for their money back because the film was so bad, and why not?",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

(basically she was born to play Pinocchio's wooden half sister in a remake involving guns & leather costumes & out of context rude language)This film blows & not in a good way.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
The critics can shove it.,"This is not a word for word retelling of Hansel and Gretal nor is it some historical accurate reproduction of midevil times that never were because those would be silly and downright boring. Instead Tommy Wirkola's storyline is a fantastical rendition of a fairy tale with modern movie making undertones that makes for a fun, dark, funny, adventure/action movie. The dialog is great, the action sequences superb, and all of the actors seem to be perfectly cast. Hansel and Gretel: Which Hunters is exactly as advertised. Anyone that thinks this is supposed to be anything different obviously missed the point.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Enjoyable, If you allow it to be","There are many kinds of movies. Movies are like food. You don't go to a fast food restaurant waiting to get a wonderful, elegant and nutritional meal. Maybe, you just want a hamburger like those they make. That does not mean that you can't enjoy good food, even that you are acknowledged of the art of the best cuisine, but neither that every ""happy meal"" is by definition ""scrap"".This is an entertaining movie: well manufactured, mostly pretty well directed and constructed in a very simple, coherent and ""easy to tell"" story that does not intend to be a classic children's tale, or a state of the art piece of the immortal cinematography.Grimms' tale is just a starting point of a new story, addressed with a lot of fantasy, which keeps you interested as the time goes by, showing a resourcefulness variety of creative fighting scenes, funny situations, and great art and character design, among others worthy to watch things.Indeed, like any ""commercial"" movie, has some weakness in acting, very unintelligent dialogues, and clichés, however, they are just a few.Finally, for those who wrote that there is plenty of ""gore"" in the movie, I have to say that blood is keep within decent parameters, far away from Anime, zombies, Spartans and recent Stallone's features. Certainly, it is not a movie for children under 10, in my opinion.Buy your ticket, grab your popcorn, and open your mind to have some fun.P.D. Hope my English is good enough for you.

Complete Brothers Grimm ripoof with a script from SciFi Channel ... Awful,This was really pathetic ... I only managed half an hour of it ... I hate criticizing any thing with Famke Janssen because she is always so good ... She is quite capable of projecting pure evil without sticking a load of cliché'd cgi witchiness all over her face The fact is that the story of this concerns the blood moon and the kidnapping of 12 children ... Sound Familiar ... Yes ... Exactly the story from The Brothers Grimm ... Done as an action movie ... And not very well ... Visual and story clichés abound Gemma Atherton is as usual the personification of mediocrity ... Why this woman thinks she is an actress is anyones business ... She completely lacks character on screen and would ( just about ) manage to look right behind the makeup counter of Boots rather than on the big screen ... VAPID Jeremy Renner ... Short ... Portly ... Moody little man ... Not very exciting at all Then of course we have Peter Storemeare as the sheriff ... A very similar role as in... Guess What ? ...

A Gritty Twist on a Classic Tale,"""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" takes the well-known fairy tale of two lost children in the woods and transforms it into a dark and action-packed fantasy film. Directed by Tommy Wirkola and released in 2013, this movie combines folklore, action, and horror elements to create a thrilling and entertaining cinematic experience.Set in a medieval-inspired world, the film picks up where the original fairy tale left off. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), having outsmarted the wicked witch in the gingerbread house, are now skilled witch hunters who travel from village to village, ridding the world of these malevolent creatures. The siblings' characters have evolved into tough, resilient, and formidable fighters, with Renner and Arterton delivering commendable performances that showcase their characters' transformation from innocent children to witch-hunting adults.One of the film's strengths lies in its action sequences. The choreography of the fight scenes is exceptional, and the use of modern weaponry mixed with historical elements adds a unique twist to the story. The special effects are also well-executed, creating an immersive world filled with dark forests, creepy lairs, and formidable witches. The movie's stylish visual aesthetics contribute to the overall enjoyment of the film, as does the gritty atmosphere that perfectly complements the story's dark tone.In terms of storytelling, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" doesn't strive to be overly complex. It remains faithful to its purpose of delivering an action-packed, witch-slaying adventure. While the plot might be straightforward, it provides a sense of familiarity and allows the audience to focus on the action and the dynamic between the two protagonists.However, some viewers may find fault with the movie's lack of depth in character development and a somewhat predictable plot. The supporting characters, such as the local townspeople and the villainous witches, are somewhat one-dimensional, leaving a missed opportunity to add layers to the narrative. Nonetheless, this shortcoming can be forgiven, considering that the film is primarily driven by its action and visuals.Overall, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is a fun and thrilling ride that brings a fresh twist to a classic fairy tale. Its mix of action, fantasy, and horror elements keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it successfully delivers on its promise of providing an entertaining and action-packed experience. Fans of dark fantasy and fairy tale adaptations will likely appreciate this film's creative take on the beloved story of Hansel and Gretel.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent medieval fairytale,"What a way to bring one of my favorite German fairy tales to life. It was superbly executed and right from the beginning had my interest with the forest narrative, and its heavy leanings on its German origin, made it that much more authentic. The support staff, mostly from Middle Europe were wonderful, and lent authenticity to the whole story play. The weapons were outrageous for the time period, but possessed enough home-made effect for it to be somewhat believable. The insulin shot taking Hans was a great message to Americans to cut their sugar. Overall the action was spot on, and everything about the movie screamed quality. The actors didn't really stand out in the movie but moved like integral parts and in harmony. No one really stole the show here, but that just allowed the whole movie to be a great experience of harmony. The all German technical production of this movie shines with sweet special effects, and the music gels well with the movie. I'm not sure if it was Hans Zimmer on this movie, as i saw a host of other musicians too listed along with him. I'm sure they coordinated to bring a very seamless music production/ score to arouse our passions at appropriate moments, and it was beautifully done. The setting of a German forest was very appropriate, and I saw this movie in IMAX, and I urge everyone else to do the same. Unforgettable!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"24 Hours Movie: You'll see it, won't get bored, and forget about it the next day","The best thing this movie has is that only runs for 88 minutes so there is no chance to get bored.But this is also its weakness, because if its duration is 88 minutes and those minutes are full of action, there is no way you can go deep on the characters. They are completely flat. Hansel only sees thing black and white, but when life starts showing him the grey areas of things, he don't have any trouble accepting them. Gretel is the one with almost emotions, because she thinks of her mother and father, but there is no big deal about it. And when she learn some truth about their past, she just go with it, no trouble with that either.The problem with character without emotions is that they cannot connect with the audience. And if the audience doesn't connect with your protagonist, they won't care whether they live or die on action. I have no sympathy with any of them so I didn't care if anyone dies.The story isn't so powerful either. They have a life; they kill witches for a living. Why are these witches so important? They are not. This is just another job, one job that will make them learn some truth about themselves, but as I said, they didn't care about that either, so no big deal, just, let's kill some witches.What is really good is the action. All sequences are great and entertaining, which I think is the most important thing. Production values are awesome, the special effects, the settings, make up, everything is cool. And the best thing is the R rating. Is blood everywhere, which makes sense because if you're telling a story about two hunters whom kill their prey by cutting the head and turning them in fire, the less you can do is show some blood and head exploding. That is great, a lot of heads exploding, blood everywhere. It's an action movie and a bloody way to kill the victims so it makes sense that the movie becomes that gory.But what I couldn't stand was the guns. This a medieval or something like it movie. Why the hell there are guns, shotguns and even a machine gun maxim. People lives in huts, ride on horse and use arrows, but when thing get messy they use a shotgun and some 50 caliber bullets. It doesn't make sense and I hate when filmmakers can't adapt themselves to the period they are setting them own story.I would suggest you to wait for the DVD and see it in your sofa with some popcorn. But there are always people who likes going to the movies and see this kind of movie. But I can guarantee that there is nothing special about this one and when you see it you will only remember it for 24 hours.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than Expected,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action packed film. Based on the popular fairy tale, the director (Tommy Wirkola) brought it to life. Starring Jeremy Renner as Hansel, and Gemma Arterton as Gretel. This brother and sister duo goes from innocent little kids to kick-ass bounty hunters. They travel from village to village killing every witch in their path. As easy as that sounds, their biggest mission lies ahead in the village of Augsburg, a town that has ""witch"" written all over it. And just because this is a fairy tale, doesn't mean its for kids, it's actually for a mature audience.

"An enjoyable, action packed movie, not for the kiddies!","Okay, so Hansel and Gretel turned witch hunters ? I wasn't sure. However after getting a free pass to watch this film, I couldn't have turned it down and I'm glad I didn't! After reading many negative reviews about this movie, I was completely surprised after watching 88 action packed minutes, filled with excellently shot fighting scenes.In truth, I'm not a massive fan of 3D. In this movie however, I found it worked brilliantly! and the visual effects were superb. For a film jam packed with high speed fighting scenes, I thought the 3D effects were amazing, not to fast and perfectly used. From arrows flying at you at top speed, right up to seeing Pihla Viitala's (mina) ass up close, the use of 3D in this movie is absolutely brilliant. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the visual effects in this film.However, there are a few negatives about this film. Often times you find yourself watching explosive fighting scenes, which I loved, but it does take away from the plot. I found that the film wasn't explored enough, in other words, 88 minutes wasn't enough time. I felt during some parts of the film that there was missing scenes. Things happened at a rush and it seemed like the movie didn't link up at times. An example of this is how little Hansel and Gretel talk about their pasted and then suddenly we are excelled into a scene where they're at their old house and find out about their pasted, it all happens so quickly and will leave you feeling that the movie was rushed and how it could have been a lot better, even though as it was,it was good.The use of humour in this film worked well at times , but in other places felt over used and also made it difficult to take the character's seriously when we were excelled into a serious, emotion filled scene, 30 seconds after a comical one and once again I was left feeling as if it was rushed and that i missed a 5 minute scene in between. I must admit though, I found the twilight spoof/parody hilarious! calling the lovable Troll ""Edward"", the gentle beast who saves Gretel :PThe actors in this movie gave solid performances and I thought that Renner and Arterton were brilliant together! I could really sense the brother and sisterly love Hansel and Gretel had for each other while they were also very good at delivering comical lines together. The make up artists and costume designers deserve credit also as the witches were terrifying! Its evident that a lot of time went into designing each and every witch.Overall, this isn't anything amazingly special but at the same time I never once found myself bored! As I said the 3D effects were awesome and the fighting scenes really brought the movie to life. All the guys will enjoy Miss Artenton's ass in those leather pants as well ;). I'd definitely say this movie is worth a watch, in fact i'd happily watch it again :) The way in which the movie finishes also makes it clear to all that there will most definitely be a ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch hunters 2"" and hey, I'll be the first in line to see it :)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quite Entertaining 6/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie which is full of action and a decent storyline. All of the actors play there part well and I liked the chemistry between Hansel and Gretel who were a good choice by the director. There is some good CGI throughout the movie and some of the gadgets that are used were impressive. It does seem a bit short so I wouldn't be surprised if there isn't a couple more to come. It isn't a all out classic because there are quite a few witch movies out lately, but it does have something for everyone. I didn't follow all of the hype when the movie first came out, which was why I enjoyed it even more. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Right at this moment, Jeremy Renner should be the biggest thing on the planet because he has played part in some of the biggest franchises. Taking the lead in the Bourne series and starring as Hawkeye in the Avengers franchise, his career seemed very promising, but he is still not a household name. He even starred in the Mission Impossible series but I don't think that he was taken seriously until he starred in the Hurt Locker which was popular in the movie world. The question is, does he have what it takes to become the next Tom Cruise? Directors, obviously think that he does but I am yet to see anything spectacular from him. Gemma Arterton has also been given some top class roles such as the Quatom of Solace and Clash Of The Titans, but she also doesn't really seem to have a big range. Both actors worked well together in this movie, which will make a great franchise if they don't mess it up like Superman.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $226millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there witch hunting movie which are full of action. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I should have gone to the see ""The Hobbit"" down the corridor if I wanted decent fantasy. This could have been a good premise, but the gore and language was a misfire (no pun intended because Hansel and Gretel did some of that, misfiring at the first witch).

"Tried to watch this, but...","basically, it was unwatchable; 45 minutes into it I gave up; admittedly, I could tell after the first 10 minutes (i.e. after the prologue retelling of the original fairy tale) that I wasn't the target demographic or audience but that's no excuse (IMO) for the awful spectacle of ugly old women being gruesomely murdered by a handsome man & largely skin-tight leather-clad (which showcases her generally straddling - and ample - thighs) young woman clearly enjoying their 'job'; it felt to me like watching mediaeval Bonny & Clyde type psychos with serious granny issuesnor was there any excuse for such a poor plot-line and almost complete absence of wit in the script. I'm all in favour of updated 'takes' of traditional tales and spinning out alternative story lines on classics - but creatively; otherwise it's just a disservice to a tale which teaches children about self-empowerment in terrible circumstances (courtesy of the extensive work of Bruno Bettelheim, we have an understanding now of the importance of traditional fairy tales, even those which are traditionally gruesomebut FOR A REASON!) and when they have NO weaponry, with only their wits to defend themwhat a travesty of THAT teaching, this is.the only 'redeeming' aspects are the contributions of the Art Department, otherwise the lowest review I've given any movie, ever, and to which I'll add a resounding UGH!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not-so fairy tale!,"I guess that this is quite a good film. A more sinister 'fairy tale' with plenty blood and gore moments.I do however, have a few issues: I usually quite like Gemma Arteton but the one thing that really lets this down is the appallingly bad American accent; it's quite tiresome.Another thing is the annoying 'yet another witch breaks free only to be caught again' moments, or the real terrible aim of the so-called 'witch hunter!.However, if you can ignore all of this, then the film itself is quite alright.It has some good special effects and is comical in places (not sure if it's meant to if if i just found them bad/funny!).A film to enjoy on an evening when you have nothing better to watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just an average movie,"First of all, the plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda innovative, because it was way different than the classic tale. The storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable (especially, Hansel and Gretel). The opening scene was definitely predictable and it was kinda promising. It was a very intense movie, there were too many action-filled scenes and the fight scenes between Hansel, Gretel and the witches were EPIC. The killcount of the movie was very bloody and unexpectedly gory. The ending scene was definitely expected and the 3rd act was just fine. It wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, however the witches were kinda creepy. Overall, it was an average fantasy/action movie, adventurous, brutal and I would probably recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The language took me by surprise for this kinda film, wasn't expecting it but that's NOT to say it works against it once you know they've decided to go this way.This movie is very much a GUY FRIENDLY movie...Gemma Arterton is someone I liked in ""Prince of Persia"" & ""Clash of the Titans"" & this kind of film seems to suit her very well. The guys get some nice shots of Gemma's Cleavage (they knew what they were doing)Famke Jansen is another beauty who plays the main Evil Witch with some style & gutso.And then we come to one of the most beautiful new actresses I've seen in awhile 'PIHLA VIITALA' make a note of this INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL Finish actress for she is truly AMAZING and features in a lovely revealing scene here that the guys are just gonna love.So yes it's an over-the-top foul mouthed, brutal, gory fairy-tale but there's plenty of fun & action to be found here...I especially liked the ending with the gathering of all the witches at the 'Blood Moon' & it features a truly awesome looking Troll who goes by the name of Edward.It's a FUN Great Looking Popcorn Film...PERFECT for 'Halloween Night' after the kids have gone to bed (and after they have watched the likes of the wonderful ""Hocus Pocus"" or ""The Monster Squad"")I for one am looking forward to these characters teaming up in the proposed sequel (as you get to see them as a group heading towards their next quest) so it should hopefully be fun to see what they come up with next.This is a whole lot of late-night fun that will probably do good business in future Halloween Nights....ENJOY.A Rocketeer Flyer Rating of an up up away 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
More fun than I thought it would be,"Two kids are abandoned by their parents. When they venture into the woods, they end up in a house made of candy. It's the house of a witch and the kids manage to throw her in the oven and burn her.Fast forward some years and a town is plagued by the disappearance of kids. It's thought that witches are responsible. Just as the eager town's Sheriff is about to lynch an accused witch, Hansel & Gretel show up and release the girl after confirming she's not a witch. They've been hired by the mayor to find the witch who's abducting all the kids.And they do find a bunch of witches who aren't related to the abductions. Meanwhile the Sheriff and his gang run into the main evil witch. It takes a while but H&G eventually discover that the witch has to abduct 12 kids for some ritual. She's got only one kid to go. When they confront her, they realize that they are no match for her, she's too powerful. But they eventually figure out how to stop her on the night of the ritual. We also learn more about their past and their parents.At first I wasn't particularly thrilled with Hansel & Gretel. Too much takes place at night, I'm getting tired of tiny, dirty medieval cardboard towns, and their townspeople. But it eventually won me over. It's got a great cast in Renner, Stormare, the beautiful Arterton, and Janssen. The effect are great, the action is fun; and there's plenty of gore. Particularly cool was a giant gnome who works for the evil witch. The plot features nothing new and could have really benefited from some original idea, probably another writer should have been added to help. Wirkola is an excellent director and the whole movie is just so competently done. It could have easily been goofy, silly, if not cheap, but it's the opposite. The only thing missing was a fresher and better story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mildly Entertaining,"'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is a dark re-telling of the popular fairy tale where two siblings are captured by a witch. The twist in this film? Hansel and Gretel are now adults and are professional witch hunters.The original fairy tale is pretty dark as it is, child abandonment, kidnapping, attempted cannibalism, people being burned alive, this film tries to make it darker simply by splashing blood all over the place and that's about it. The fairy tale has been adapted to tie in very cleverly with their latest mission and it isn't that far-fetched; it makes sense, there's some good plot twists and it isn't too stupid. The stupidity comes in other forms; you've got electricity, gramophones, tasers, and oh yeah, insulin! I still don't understand why it was necessary to include the fact that Hansel has diabetes as a result of the infamous witch feeding him too many sweets as a child. Note that in the flashbacks he wasn't really overweight at all. The insulin we see him inject into himself throughout the film appears to have the same effect on him as spinach had to Popeye. Despite this weird addition, the film is fairly entertaining though it is fairly naff. The fight scenes are graphic but interesting and at some points are pretty funny.The acting is okay, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do all that they need to do here but their performances aren't anything memorable. Famke Janssen is probably the best in it but even her performance can be a bit embarrassing at times. Maybe if director Tommy Wirkola sent everyone a memo telling them what accent was necessary it would have been better. There were American accents, English and even German – with Gemma Arterton switching between English and American throughout the film.Overall, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is mildly entertaining but it is pretty forgettable. If you just want to watch a film with absolutely no thinking involved and you just want to relax with some popcorn and have a chuckle at heads being squashed, then this is perfect.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Whoever thought witch hunting could be fun!,"Witches beware because hell hath no fury like a pair of siblings out for some supernatural blood. Now, everyone pretty much knew the story of two kids who escape the wrath of a cannibal witch living in a candy house in the middle of the woods, but what happens after that is revealed in this movie: Hansel and Gretel become witch hunters. Heh, as if Red Riding Hood meeting werewolves wasn't crazy enough.So the plot goes that after years of hunting witches, the title characters come across a town and get hired by the local mayor to take of a strange matter of witches, led by the wicked grand witch Muriel, kidnapping children for a sinister purpose. As Hansel and Gretel soon learn that this is no ordinary case of a witch infestation, can a dark secret from their past prove to be their salvation or their undoing?Right from the start, the two protagonists are likable as well as very tough. They actually do act like brother and sister, having a good time while having the occasional disagreement. The weapons they use are insane and the action scenes are a load of fun, fast-paced and lots if gore and destruction. The music fits very well too, complementing a lot of the action that goes on. The witch Muriel is actually a good villain, enjoying every little evil deed she pulls off and seriously messing with our heroes. Throw in a little humor, a couple of nice twists, and excellent special effects (from the CG to the monstrous design of the witches) and you have one fun fairy tale roller coaster ride.Definitely one of the better reinterpretations of classic fairy tales out there that I have seen and worth a watch, so check it out!

This was just spectacular...,"Now, why was I under the impression that this would be another of those teenage lovefest movies? It couldn't have been further from the truth. Perhaps that impression came from such movies such as ""Twilight"" and ""Red Riding Hood"".But ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" turned out to be somewhat of a bloody and gory action / horror movie. And it was actually a great combination that worked out quite well. A very different and interesting take on a famous fairytale.The story is about young Hansel and Gretel who are left in the woods, where they come upon a house made of candy. They are captured by the witch inside and fed candy to fatten them up. But they end up shoving the witch into the oven and killing her. Right, we all know (or should know) this fairytale. However, this movie deals with the siblings after they grew up and became deadly witch hunters.Right from the very beginning there was adrenaline and action in the movie, and I will say that it actually never slowed down. The movie just kept going on straight ahead like a rampant freight train.What really impressed me in the movie was the effects and the make-up. That was just off the charts. The witches had so many interesting and nice details that the movie should be watched more than once to take it all in. There was just something profoundly dark and ghastly about them, and it worked out so well. It was a thrill and a pleasure to witness the make-up and effects of the movie.However, the movie wasn't all about the effects and make-up. The effort and details in the costumes and props as well was just mind-boggling. The whole village really looked real and seemed like something right out of the middle ages.Well, ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" isn't all just great stuff, there were parts which I didn't really fathom or could fully wrap my head around. First of all, the particular time in which the movie is set, I don't really think that the F-word was around, but oddly enough it was being thrown around quite a lot, and that really brought down the dialogue in the movie a notch. It was inappropriate and quite unnecessary with all that vulgarity and profanity. The usage of the F-word and the MF-word was really inappropriate.Secondly, I was a bit at a loss about the costume worn by Hansel. It seemed a bit out of the age in which the movie was set as well. It was just a bit overdone and seemed like they had found it lying around discarded on a ""Matrix"" set. It did look great though, it just wasn't fully appropriate or matching to the age of the movie.Finally, the weaponry - well, don't get me wrong, because it was interesting and spectacular to look at. But it seemed a little bit too advanced for the age. Yeah, I know, this is a fantasy movie, but still... Why would the weaponry technology have progressed that much, but the rest of the world was still stuck in the middle ages? It was a little bit strange. The weapons were cool to look at and were great in use on the screen, but just a tad out of place.As for the cast in the movie, then I will say that they had put together a good ensemble of people. But it was without a doubt Famke Janssen (playing Muriel) who stole the show and totally carried the movie.""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is an action-packed and adrenaline-filled action / horror movie, and it was a real treat to watch, both story-wise and effects-wise.And on a final note, then this movie confirmed my suspicion, Edward is a troll!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,"This might have done better had they just stuck to a plain old witch-hunting adventure film, rather than embroil us in a rather dull familial back story that really just clutters the whole thing up. If you are familiar with the fairy tale, you will know that ""Hansel"" (Jeremy Renner) and sister ""Gretel"" (Gemma Arterton) were enticed to the house made of sweets by an evil witch. On the menu, luckily they are able to turn the tables on her and it is her who goes into the oven rather than them! Ten years on, and our siblings are legendary and regularly summoned to rid other villages of their menaces. It's on one such mission the they discover that an impending Blood Moon is going to empower an whole coven of witches who have already stolen a dozen innocent children to use as ingredients in a broth. Can they thwart this (actually quite appealing) plan? Well along the way they make some friends and some foes before quite a spectacular, if I felt rather disappointing, denouement. There is an hint of chemistry between Renner and a distinctly underwhelming Arterton, Famke Janssen fares fine as the nasty ""Muriel"" and when it works, it's quite a pacy and enjoyable fantasy. There's way too much dialogue though, and when we start to delve into their past, I started to delve into the Maltesers. It's fine, and actually does look better on a big screen as the cinematography and visual effects are good enough. It's just a missed opportunity to darken this myth and deliver something just a little more evil! Watchable, just not memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just terrible,"There was just nothing good about this at all. Hansel and Gretel grown up and being witch hunters, wearing modern clothes and using modern style weapons. Not real or historically accurate. Judging by the way people look, and the witch trials, you would place it in the 15th or 16th Century, but then there are elements of 19th Century and early 20th Century! This is a mess. It annoys me when people in films like this get everything wrong. The witches are not human but demons with super powers. The combat stuff is ridiculous. And I can't take it seriously. Its a stupid moronic film pretending to be a fairy tale when it isn't. I can't stand all this Rambo style techniques from both Hansel and Gretel! OMG the music is just grating. People who like this are mad.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Surprisingly great, thanks to Tommy Wirkola..","What, there's a new movie about Hansel & Gretel, wow I would like to see that! After about twenty minutes into the movie: what, they are going to hunt witches all the time, this is the movie? Well, yes, the movie is called Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, it stands to reason that they would spend most of the time in the movie hunting down witches (and burning them, mmm crispy). Yet another one of those ""what if"" or ""spin on a classic tale"" movies that has come out in the recent years, but oddly enough I really liked this one. I mean, as much as you can like a movie like this, it's really great for the first viewing and the replay value due to the awesome visual effects is also big, but still, it's missing that key element, that undefinable thing that some movies just have whether it's the mood of the movie, actors, conditions of the shoot or something else that would make this a cult classic. In case you are wondering is there any violence at all in this movie and why should I see it, check out the rant after the summary.You all know the classic tale of Hansel & Gretel, so you are somewhat prepared for the surprise that is coming (well, fully prepared considering the title of the movie). Movie picks up years after they slaughtered the witch, and features Hansel and Gretel all grown up (especially Gretel, yummy), who are now witch hunters. Blessed by some magic, they impervious to witches spells making them the ultimate killing machines, especially with the huge arsenal that they have at their disposal (Gretels shotgun and Hansels cannon :). They are hired by the mayor of the small town of Augsburg to find out who is taking children and are they alive. A suspected usual witchcraft gig will soon turn into something much more serious and threatening and two siblings will have to battle one of the most powerful witches in the world and her many followers...Dismemberment, blood, decapitations, eviscerations and all the other fun acts of violence that you wouldn't expect to see in a ""kiddie"" movie are here. There's even a nude scene, granted it's quite short, but still enough to raise a few eyebrows (or other things). And to all those puritans who are now screaming oh my gosh, that is a children's book, please go online and read the original stories that are filled with murder, mayhem and mutilation, not to mention some sick and perverse ideas. So this is a full blown fun ride with cool ""steampunked"" weapons and phenomenal special effects. This all would be for nothing if the director didn't know what he's doing, but luckily for us he does. Tommy Wirkola is the man! After Dead Snow, also a great movie, he strikes again! Camera work, action sequences, chases and everything else is done very professionally. To me, the style seemed like an homage to the Evil Dead franchise. And the witches are really scary, wet your pants scary, better call Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (if you can afford them of course, maybe they have some sort of payment plan or something, who knows...)

Great 3D effects but....,I don't understand as to why this film wasn't preview so much for its release in January but never mind to that. Hansel&Gretel: witch hunters takes on a modern twist to the Grimm Brothers story. The film starts off to when Hansel and Gretel are taken into a forest late at night by their father who refuses to reveal anything to them under their plea as to what is going on. Lost in the forest the two find a house made of candy and begin to eat off of it before embarking into the house. Little did they know they would meet an evil witch who threatens to kill them. But the two ended up stuffing her in fire for she to die and that typically explains as to why they became witch hunters. For the duration of the film to only last 88 minutes its easily forgettable. The action comes in at the right moments during the film but what really lacked was character development since the movie moved that fast. I felt i didn't get to know the characters all that well so that makes me not care for any of the characters weather they live or die. But i give credit to the 3D effects as it was spot on. It was pretty gory but I handled it well. Overall it was an interesting and entertaining movie... But it's easily forgettable.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The first pleasant surprise of 2013.,"With Oscar season fast approaching and all hopefuls well and truly into their theatrical release all over the world, it's time for the pseudo-intellectuals to step back and let films for the everyman once again take centre stage. Among the first out of the blocks in 2013 is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, following the dark-spin-on-dated-fable footsteps of Red Riding Hood and Snow White and the Huntsman.On paper, the film looks like self-serving garbage, platitudinous in tone and one that may struggle to hold even the attention of its assumedly pre-teen target audience. What it actually is is a veritable goldmine of rip-roaring popcorn entertainment, so outrageous in execution yet so disciplined in pacing that it becomes increasingly easier to immerse oneself with each passing second.The film opens with a minimalist retelling of the classic fairytale, as a young Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) outsmart their first witch, burning her alive and escaping her candied fortress with limbs and brain intact. Fast forward two decades and the pair have become national celebrities, selling their bounty hunting services to concerned civilians.Packed with creative and beautifully choreographed action and with some gleaming profanity scattered in for good measure, Hansel and Gretel is a welcome stray from the labours of 'historically accurate' storytelling, as the sheer audacity of the project permits- if not, encourages- the audience to quickly ignore the siblings' modern American accents and mounds of firepower at a time where light bulbs remain closer to witchery than reality.Excessive amounts of blood and gore punctuate every action sequence, giving the film Tarantino-esque levels of violence, while it takes itself about as seriously as any QT film in the process. The script is banal at best, but it refuses the temptation to drown its audience in cringe-worthy one-liners. Instead, it accommodates the plot neatly; one that is surprisingly well structured, with its fair share of novel twists to boot. At 88 minutes, the film lacks pretension and bloatedness- a nice touch amidst growing studio opinions that 'the longer the better.'Nitpicking a little further reveals some disruptive gaps in editing, but the tangibles definitely play second fiddle to the overriding emphasis on visceral, fleeting fun. Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Trail of Gore and Breadcrumbs,"I hate to say I walked into this the theater showing this film with low expectations. The promotional material made me think of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead but there were few laughs if any in this film and Jeremy Renner is no Ash Williams. Hansel and Gretel's parents are murdered by witches and the duo find themselves at the house made of candy after wandering the Bavarian forest for a time. The owner of the house turns out to be a witch who tries to fatten up Hansel and makes Gretel a slave. They get the better of her and push the witch into an oven, establishing that fire is the greatest weakness of witches. They grow up killing witches in various towns for bounties using explosives, piano wire, firearms, and other violent ways. In the town of Augsburg, they encounter the biggest and baddest of them all, Muriel (Famke Janssen), who has a plan to strengthen the witches' magic against their old weakness through the abduction and sacrifice of a dozen town children.The funniest moment of this movie is the initial encounter between Hansel and Gretel and the imbecilic Sheriff Berringer. Other than that it's all violence and a few lame one liners. Jeremy Rennner doesn't have Bruce Campbell's self-deprecating charisma and Gemma Arterton is a lovely woman but seems trouble showing any emotion beyond surprise. I found myself fighting to stay awake at times. This movie was a chore to watch and the cost of 3d for this kind of movie is a waste.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best movie of the year so far!,"I don't know what people went in expecting. But my expectations were above average and I got more than I had hoped for. it's not a perfect film by any means but delivers on what the title promises. it's a fun, gory, silly fantasy horror flick. The film centers on the classic story of Hansel and Gretel and picks up after that tale as they are now a brother and sister team of bad ass witch hunters. They are hired by a town because children have been taken and come upon a devilish plot that is surprisingly unique. I'm not sure what all the bad buzz is about there is a fare amount of development for a film of this kind. And most of all it's just fun. It's a quick flick at 88 mins. So it doesn't over stay it's welcomes Jeremy Renner and Gemma Armeton (better than she's ever been) have a decent amount of chemistry and deliver raunchy but fun dialogue with a sarcastic pizazz. Famke Janseen hams it up as the grand witch in her best role in a while, The fight scenes are well choreographed and the direction is promising from Tommy Wirkola of the awesomely fun Dead Snow. Sure it could have been a bit more fleshed out and there is a bit too much reliance on the f bomb as a joke but it works. Most of all the film possesses a dark kinetic energy that doesn't shy away from the gooey dark stuff which is really commendable from a major studio considering how much genre films have become annoyingly censored. All in all a great time and leaves it open for sequels of which I hope they will make. 3.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I love black magic stuff and all, but hey, there is a limit to what any person can take.

A movie Quentin Tarantino would be proud of,When you watch Hansel & Gretel:Witch Hunters it's clear that Quentin Tarantino would have been pleased.But it is not in any way shape or form target for Children it is Rated R and it very graphic almost too graphic.To be honest I never wanted to watch this movie for the fact it took a children story and made it a R-Rated film about our protagonists become witch hunters.There are a few things I will say I like about the film. Gemma and Jeremy performances work well for the film they seem to have enjoy working together. Famke Janssen made for a horror style villain. Her performance is evilStunts in this film makes you go that's insane plus the weapons that Hansel and Gretel use are creative as well.It's just the level of gore in this film really hurts it I know some people enjoy them others have them limits. I would advice watch with caution because the gore and violence in this movie take it to the limit often times I had to turn away because I have my limits when it comes to thatMy advice only watch it if you're curious some might like it some will think one watch that's it.I give Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter an 6 out of 10,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'Crossbow-and-sorcery' epic with incredible adventures , spectacular battles and bloody duels.","An eerie adventure set in the dark ages, made in lightweight and old-fashioned style but with lots of blood and gore. It's been 15 years since the brothers were kidnapped by a witch, an event that changed their lives forever, causing them to become relentless witch hunters. Now, as adults, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Atterton) have become fierce and formidably prepared bounty hunters, dedicated exclusively to pursuing and exterminating witches, willing to do anything to get revenge. They're travelling around from town to town, while smacking down the evil ones who abduct children and rescuing them in the process. However, things get worse as the ill-fated Blood Moon approaches, when they have to face a superior evil power, the nasty hag Muriel (Famke Janssen). Hansel and Gretel race against the clock, making several unlikely allies on the way such as a troll (Derek Mears) and a witch hunter fanboy (Thoman Mann). Classic Tale New Twist !. Revenge is sweeter than candy !. What ever became of Hansel and Gretel?Set in a dark age of witch and sorcery, packing noisy action, blood-thirsty battles at every turn, full-blooded adventure, thrills, crude scenes, rip-roaring fights , containing some dumb images and being unintentionally hilarious but amusing. This film is a return to the ""sword and sorcery"" subgenre that had its heyday in the 80s with films like ¨Conan¨, ¨Conan the Destroyer¨, ¨Red Sonja¨, or ¨The Sword and the Sorcerer¨; although this ¨Hansel and Gretel¨rather belongs to the ""Crossbow and Witchcraft"" subgenre, that's why the crossbow is the main weapon used, along with another arsenal that includes sawed-off pistols, shotguns, spears and even a machine gun. This is a lusty and dark epic of revenge and magic of witches, of damsels in distress and desire and of two warriors, Hansel and Gretel, caught between them all. Unrelenting shock-feast laced with brief touches of black humor and tongue-in-cheek, adding action-packed and endless fights between our protagonists against the evil witches. This gory fairy tale is an amusing mix of terror with doses of humour that is as creepy as it is vulgar. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Atterton are in charge of giving life to Hansel, although in this version, now grown up, they have gone from being victims to executioners of witches. Wirkola is in charge of directing and writing this violent and bloody action film that shows the darkest side of the well-known greedy children from the Grimm brothers' tale.It displays a colorful, though sometimes somewhat dark, cinematography by cameraman Atli Örvarsson, shot in Germany: Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Babelsberg, Potsdam, Brandenburgo, ASächsische Schweiz, Saxony. The director creates a special 'Crossbow and witchery' thriller that manages to be both scary and entertaining, being skillfully made by Tommy Wirkola. This Norwegian writer/director has made some acceptable films , such as: ¨What Happened to Monday¨ , ¨Dead Snow¨, ¨Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead¨ , ¨Spermaggedon¨, ¨I onde dager¨ . Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter rating: 5.5/10. The film will appeal to Jeremy Renner and Gemma Atterton fans.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"It lacks a competent director to better define this film, where excessive gore prevents it from being suitable for teenage audiences.","Once again, the Grimm Brothers' tales are the basis of a blockbuster. I am particularly remembering the 2005 movie ""The Brothers Grimm"", because it was a film that came a lot to my mind while watching this movie. I found them very similar, both in tonic and in structure: two brothers who are dedicated, in a way, to the supernatural, and who have to prevent an evil ritual involving a series of children in a city anywhere in the center of Europe.The film's plot hardly needs any introduction, we all know the original tale. The film builds on that base and tells us how Hansel and Gretel grew up to become the most fearsome witch hunters of their time. It also explores the past and the unresolved relationship with their parents, but it doesn't go beyond that. The film was directed by Tommy Wirkola, who I had never heard of, and seems quite amateur in his way of directing. Suffice it to say that the movie doesn't know if it's horror, action or adventure. It could be an action-adventure blockbuster for teens and young adults, but the director abused the gore, the blood and graphic violence. I felt like I was watching a violent video game and not a quality movie, and the violence of the carnage scenes leads me to advise against it for underage teenagers (you, parents, read this well).The cast is led by two young actors, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton. Both seem to be fully up to the challenge put to them, are elegant, attractive and charismatic enough to ensure the leadership. The most palpable problem here is the uninteresting and amorphous material they received, and the absence of a competent director, able to guide them in order to bring out the best in their effort. The result is a duo of actors who look like cowboys, for their attitude. Much more convincing, Famke Janssen presents us with a work loaded with malice and pleasant perversity, which fits with her character and the film in general. I also liked the work of Peter Stormare and Pihla Viitala, two supporting actors who help the film get some life and movement.On a technical level, the film bets everything on quality CGI, realistic enough to look good and give us a visually elegant and credible cinematography, to which are added good sets and visually impressive costumes (particularly Arterton's). Being a fantasy story, there is some room for the use of imagination, and this was reflected in the costumes and also in some props, such as the weapons used, which range from crossbows to what appear to be shotguns and heavy machine guns. The opening credits look very well done and make a good introduction to the film's theme. The soundtrack initially seemed a bit histrionic, but I ended up concluding that it fit satisfactorily into the final set.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

worth watching,"Well worth watching. When I first saw the review of this movie on IMDb I thought why waste our time watching? Looks like a dud. But then I figured well Renner is a quality actor in my books and Will Farrell produced the movie so should have a few laughs as well as a bit of action. Turns out I was right. First for everything. The movie itself has a nice plot twist on Hansel and Gretel enough to keep the viewer's interest and guessing. It deviates from the original story drastically, thx God, to make an adventurous, entertaining humerus movie. Renner has some great lines, but the humor does not overpower the action, the movie strikes a good balance between the two. My wife and I laughed hard in a few spots and maintained our interest throughout. If you are in for a mindless romp into Hollywood action adventure/ humor you'll love this movie. btw some pretty explicit violence in here if you are gunshy or blood squeamish I'd back off and pick another.

Casey's Movie Mania: HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS (2013),"Originally scheduled for March 2012 release, HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS was ultimately delayed for nearly a year. According to an interview, director Tommy Wirkola has stated that the main reason of the delayed release is the studio's (Paramount Pictures) decision to wait on Jeremy Renner to become a bigger name. Back then, he was only known for his breakout role in 2009's THE HURT LOCKER and considered not bankable enough for mainstream audiences in the US. Plus, he was cast in this movie before MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL, THE AVENGERS and THE BOURNE LEGACY. Now that the movie is finally arrived, I was expecting Wirkola's go-for-broke filmmaking style he had once displayed with such enthusiastic flair in 2009's DEAD SNOW. The good news is, Wirkola's US debut in HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is a hard-hitting, R-rated gorefest -- with plenty of hardcore violence, dark humor, goofy undertone and playful energy in a compact 88 minutes. The bad news is, this movie is terribly skimpy and just about everything here is done for the wrong reason.When Hansel (Cedric Eich) and Gretel (Alea Sophia Boudodimos) are just kids, they wander around the deep forest after being left by their father (Thomas Scharff) and eventually ends up at the Gingerbread House. Well, as in this classic fairy tale, you should know how the story ends except that this movie offers a new twist: These two siblings manage to defeat and burn the witch where they are being held captive inside the Gingerbread House. Many years later, they grow up (now played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) and become professional witch hunters ever since.They arrive in the German town of Augsburg, just in time to save the beautiful Mina (Pihla Viitala) from being wrongly executed as a witch by the arrogant Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare). Apparently these siblings are hired by the mayor (Rainer Bock) to hunt down an evil sorceress who has been kidnapping the town's children. They subsequently discovers that the missing children involves a Grand Witch Muriel (Famke Janssen), who is apparently has a bigger agenda of her own.From the surface, it's actually interesting to see Wirkola is game enough to twist a classic fairy tale into a gun-toting gorefest. But his screenplay with D.W. Harper is sadly paper-thin and everything here seems to be executed like a failed TV pilot episode. Even the romantic subplot involving Hansel and Mina feels more like a gratuitous filler (not to mention an excuse to showcase a nude Pihla Vittala). While Wirkola's direction is fast and furious, his penchant to shoot the action scene up close with lots of rapid zooms and harsh editing is rather frustrating to watch for.Despite being blessed with a decent $60 million budget, the movie looks surprisingly cheap. The forest setting looks as if they are executed for a stage production, while all the makeup effects and the costumes are more akin of some elaborate Halloween party. As for the cast, most of them are instantly forgettable.The remaining saving graces here are two energetic performances from Jeremy Renner and especially Gemma Arterton. Wirkola's gleeful excess of over-the-top violence, as well as his F-bomb anachronisms has its certain entertainment values. Too bad that's not nearly enough to warrant this movie as a satisfying guilty-pleasure outing. It's a huge waste of opportunity, and a far cry from what Wirkola has done so well in DEAD SNOW.www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark childhood stories,"Hansel and Gretel are brothers who become professional witch hunters after the past that befell them. Now they are both faced with a big case that happened to children.The story of Hansel and Gretel is described as darker and darker. This film does bring on a different element from the original fairy tale story. The interesting plot of the story looks much louder and wilder. Featuring fun actions to enjoy. The conflict of the story seems simple, but still provides a treat for an exciting witch hunt story. This film provides a lot of action that is a bit brutal and sadistic with a combination of shots that are quite suitable in taking scenes. The wizard look also seems to me quite awful. Hansel & Gretel is an easy and fun film to enjoy even with dark tones. There is not much drama that is long and enough to provide amazing action.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Listen to The Professional Critics! This film is FUN!!,"Despite what the critics say in the IMDB ratings section, this film is actually fun and full of action.The acting is on point and though people will find the CGI effects below the quality they would receive for a Marvel film, that doesn't take away anything from the story.This film is a solid little random gem starting the most randomly put together cast, and it all works!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I'm sorry, but this is a waste of time.","Honestly, just wait until it comes out on DVD. That's all it deserves.The anachronisms are funny at first, but then they become painful. I know that it wasn't the point of the film to be historically accurate. I get it. They wanted to make an action film, but the action was just awful, too.I used to really enjoy Jeremy Renner. I like him when he plays roles where he doesn't let his inner asshole loose. He does that in this movie, and I really don't like it. Gemma Arterton is totally flat. Actually, nobody has any dimension in this garbage flick.Action movies are some of my favorite things to watch when the action is believable and not too over-the-top. The violence is really stupid, and it's kind of surprising that Hansel and Gretel can even kill witches, because it always seems that they are getting their asses handed to them.Just wait until it's at Redbox. Give it a view and return it the next day. Then forget it ever happened.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
surprisingly solid entertainment,"i'll admit, i selected this on a boredom filled night as a time filler. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is exactly what it proclaims to be. it's witty, clever and refreshing. The gore isn't overdone and as i'm not a fan of ""horror"" it fell right into the 'almost comical' category. The right characters get their heads mushed, if you know what i'm saying. i'm confused by the bad reviews. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. The storyline flows, you'll root for the proper characters, it's not going to be nominated for an Oscar but hot damn, i will never regret pushing 'watch now'. It kind of reminded me of 'snow white and the huntsman'. Again, not a blockbuster, but definitely worth the watch. Obviously this isn't a film for children but i actually caught myself muttering a few times ""ha! don't eat the candy"".",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"For fans of ""Snow White And The Huntsman"", ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight""","I've recently watched the Korean ""Hansel and Gretel"" movie which was an incredibly imaginative tale with a haunting atmosphere and stunning kid actors.This Hollywood version rather heads for a public that recently enjoyed movies such as ""The Hunger Games"", ""Snow White And The Huntsman"" or the ""Twilight"" series. This film is addressed to a teenager or young adult public. Younger auditors might find this flick too tough, even though old German fairy tales often head for younger auditors and are generally brutal for education purposes. Older auditors might find the film a little bit lifeless and vapid after all.It features some mild action scenes, several small gore effects, a few witchcraft elements, the usual love story and the predictable good versus evil story. This is nothing new but the movie is quite entertaining without having any lengths and for one of the rare times, the three dimensional technique is well employed in a movie and worth the money you have to spend on it.The acting by the main characters is not that spectacular. Gemma Arterton remains surprisingly faceless while Jeremy Renner who was last involved in ""The Bourne Legacy"" seems quite out of place and especially a little bit too old for this kind of movie by now. A great job is though delivered by the absolutely charming Famke Janssen who delivers a reserved but efficient acting and who looks very stylish in this film.In the end, the good special effects, a few well chosen secondary actors and the fast paced story that never gets boring save this movie and make it watchable for a young but not too young auditory. Anybody who is expecting something more original should absolutely go for the Korean movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Grim Fairy Tale,"""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is yet another failed attempt to convert a child's tale into an adult-oriented action movie. Following in the footsteps of such films as ""Red Riding Hood"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman,"" the movie completely misses the mark.Filled with modern humor and lingo,""Hansel & Gretel"" completely breaks the illusion of taking place in what the environment suggests is the Middle Ages. If this wasn't enough, the two are fully equipment with a high-tech, witch-hunting arsenal (including, of course, a Gatling gun). Overall, Iwould rate the movie as a low F.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Step out of the fairy tale with Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters,"Every year there seems to be a theme in theaters where there are a couple of subjects with numerous filmmakers delivering varying films on the same idea. This year one of those themes seems to be re-imagining of fairy tales. The first one to hit the big screen is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. The trailers looked a bit cheesy, but at the same time looked as though they may have some fun to deliver. With Hawkeye himself Jeremy Renner at the helm alongside Bond girl Gemma Arterton, X-Men alum Famke Janssen and the director of the awesome zombie film Dead Snow Tommy Wirkola could they deliver something that actually works or will it close the book on this story before it ever gets started?Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters follows the now grown Hansel and Gretel who spend their lives as bounty hunters, tracking and killing witches around the world. While their latest job seems like just another hunt, soon turns out to be much more with the Blood Moon approaching, they soon realize they are up against something more powerful than just your average witch. Let's be clear, this movie is way better than it has any right to be. The premise is a bit silly and could have easily fallen in line with a SyFy Channel movie, which did their own version as well. Thanks to the increased star power of Renner, the high quality fun action and director Tommy Wirkola this film turned out to be surprisingly fun. The first half has its fun moments, but limps along a bit before it really finds its footing, but once it does it is a pretty fun ride. The acting is average at best, with Renner being the most entertaining and Janssen eats up the screen playing a great creepy witch. The biggest issue comes with Arterton who handles the action well, but just plays the character way to stiff. What makes this film really work is the execution of the action sequences. They are pretty out there at times, but are shot and executed really well to deliver the fun you would expect. In addition director Wirkola made sure to bring the gore along with him which took the film away from the silly direction it could have gone and into the R rated territory.Believe it or not this film works really well to deliver an R rated fantasy adventure the works. Filled with humor, action, creepy witches, great effects, gore, and Derek Mears as the scene stealing troll Edward this is one of those popcorn films that you are sure to enjoy if you just get in on the joke of it all. It seems to have done well enough and sets itself up nicely to a possible franchise and if they can keep the formula intact is one that is welcomed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly Story + Gemma Arterton = Guilty Pleasure,"I have seen this film many times and despite its numerous flaws, it makes me happy (so there). Of course it's only loosely based on the classic fairy tale (which didn't feature so many weapons and gadgets). Speaking of weapons, did anyone else notice (or care) that there were modern shotguns and even a primitive mini-gun (with modern ammo)? How about the primitive TASER?IIRC, Gemma Arterton was not proud of this film, but I don't care -- she's cute and fun here. And YES, I do find her quite attractive (extra-guilty pleasure). Jeremy Renner does a fine job as well.I give this seven (7) stars for entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brilliant ""Where Are They Now"" of Fairy Tale Characters","There's a recent trend in Hollywood of films that have to do with hunters and slayers, starting with Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter coming out last summer and Jack the Giant Slayer coming out on March 1st. The current addition to this ""killing mythological characters"" craze comes in the form of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.I wanted to see this because Jeremy Renner, who plays Hansel, is a great actor, and I thought it was a cool idea to have a ""where are they now"" of fairy tale characters. I also wanted to see it because I enjoyed Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. They both have over-the-top violence, but Hansel and Gretel makes Abe Lincoln look like one of those lame PG-13 horror remakes that have come out in recent years. The gore is gratuitous and the action is aplenty. In fact, some pussies in the audience were so squeamish that they had to look away during some parts.The film opens with a brief retelling of the classic story, with Hansel and Gretel's father leaving them in the woods, and subsequently they are lured into the witch's candy house, where they shove her into an oven and ultimately burn her alive. Fast forward 15 years later (although it looks more like 25 in the case of 40-year-old Renner), and we find the sibling duo living the life of hunters who slaughter witches and helping rescue children whom the witches abducted. Gretel is played by the gorgeous Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of Jennifer Garner, except even hotter.The witches were very frightening. Children who have parents dumb enough to bring them to see this will be freaked out by the witches, not to mention scarred by the blood and guts. I liked how, aside from the traditional witch in the opening sequence, the rest of the witches were unique-looking, such as one with spiky hair that looked like horns. The towering and beautiful Famke Janssen is perfectly cast as the head witch, Muriel. Having played villains before in films such as Goldeneye, The Faculty, and parts of the X-Men franchise, she exudes the right amount of evil and sexiness.I also loved the contradiction between the modern-day guns and bows and arrows, and fighting sequences, taking place in a setting of 300 years ago. It was even more bizarre hearing fairy tale characters say modern-day swear words. Look out for some witty one liners from Renner.Both Abe Lincoln and Hansel and Gretel involve a mash up of genres. They differ in that the serious tone and more subtle humor found in Abe Lincoln is appropriate for a history/horror film, while more straightforward comedy of Hansel and Gretel suits a fairy tale/horror film. As I previously mentioned in that movie's review, Abe Lincoln would not work as a comedy.As was the case with Abraham Lincoln, Hansel and Gretel received scathing reviews from critics who were expecting it to be something it's not, and what it is, is a B-movie fantasy/action flick whose job is to be bloody ridiculous. They refuse to give it credit for succeeding at what it set out to do. They also don't get the sense of humor. For example, Hansel is a diabetic as a result of eating the candy house as a child, and he has to give himself an insulin injection, centuries before it even existed in real life. Anyone who can't see the humor in that seriously needs to get a life.Some reviewers questioned why a respected actor like Renner would take on a role like this. Sure, he's a two-time Oscar nominee, but there's nothing wrong with him doing a fun film every now and then. His career is currently much more on track than many Oscar winners. Anyone remember Cuba Gooding, Jr.? Exactly. Plus, this movie was originally supposed to come out last March, but the studio pushed back the release date in order to allow time for Renner to film a couple of more blockbusters while he rose to become an A-list star. This was a wise decision, because Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters debuted at number one at the domestic box office, and it's been making a boatload of money around the world. So forget the haters.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very enjoyable!,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, although it had its flaws. It's exactly what you would expect it to be from the trailer. If you're not looking for something in the same category as ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" (or perhaps the first Kill Bill movie) then you probably won't like this movie.In fact, Hansel & Gretel has exactly the vibe that I expected from Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Van Helsing (and which those movies failed to deliver). It's ridiculous, absurd, over the top, and really fun to watch.The biggest flaw was the poor set design in some scenes, as other reviewers have pointed out. I found it to be particularly noticeable in the climactic fight scene, where for a bit it looked like something out of an awful TV show. I'm not sure what they were thinking for that scene (you'll know it when you see it).The script also has some distracting rough spots, but I thought that the actors did an excellent job with it.Overall, if you like the trailer, you'll probably love the movie -- as long as you don't go in expecting Citizen Kane.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not an altogether failure:just a Misstep,"Much has been made of this oft delayed film for the silly reason of determining whether or not Renner's profile would be raised sufficiently enough to give the releasing studio comfort in having him headline their film, then drive that film to profitability. This latest entry on his resume will do little to assuage that perception.While this is not a genre Baz Luhrmann would work in, his sensibility and understanding is sorely missed.Mashups which this purports to be are difficult to do. Anachronistic in approach, tone all over the place, direction labored, style, execution and delivery flat. Derivative describes this best: Its 300, LOTR, Snow White and The Huntsman, Van Helsing and yes even Bourne Legacy. A situation arose and I wanted to shout ""Get that man his chems!"" At 87 minutes Hansel/Gretel does not know what it wants to be. Is it action adventure? Is it a supernatural comedy? Is it a romance with horrific undertones? A few chuckles could be heard but nothing that would merit enjoyment. Lines that should have been delivered with a light touch - would have made the film a guilty pleasure and one would walk about saying them! The cast was nondescript. And what of Renner? His line delivery was tight and he appeared most uncomfortable almost unsure of himself. The romance failed to resonate.Renner seems to be the kind of actor who if comfortable with the director can deliver entertaining performances- where you can see the joy in his face and gratefulness.Perhaps he took the role to try doing something different- he doesn't fail altogether; its simply a misstep.Perhaps his next role will be something to remember.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a whole lot of pointless action,"The movie starts promising and ends disappointing. The movie is meant to be a cross between action, horror and comedy but forget the last two (horror and comedy) because the jokes are just flying over your head and the horror scenes will make you yawn. My main problem with the movie is the cursing (which were few, mind you), before any of the lead characters uses the f-word, there was a pause and the camera focuses on the face and the f-word will be given a grand entrance, as if the word is holy. My final take is that this movie is just a saddle stick for a sequel and it is just borderline crap.The summary of the plot which adds a new spin to the fairy tale has Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton respectively) as bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the place. At a town children are being taken by witches, and the duo is called to investigate. They came across a plot by the witches, a plot which involves the Blood Moon and the siblings face an evil that holds the secret to their past.The movie is written and directed by Tommy Wirkola (a Norwegian) who makes a living making action horror flicks and this crap-piece is his first big budget film, he is noted to have said that he was surprised (and so am I) that the big Hollywood studios went for the movie calling his script a ""rock n' roll script"". The script is rock n' roll alright rolling down to the gutter with a script that made me want to puke, bad continuity from one scene to the other it is just topsy-turvy, with nothing going straight. It seems like you the viewer is left wondering why some things are happening, and forget the twist, the movie is predictable.I have seen better movies in my life and if this was a B-movie it would have been best, I can't imagine the cost the CGI must have taken from the huge 50 million budget of this movie. The CGI and stunts are cool but everything else will make you want to smash the screen.What I advice any movie watcher to do is to not bother seeing this movie, try and watch something else, there is no surprises, no wow moment, no story depth nothing. just a bunch of guys running around feeling cool killing witches.The sad thing I have to say is that, bad guys narrating their entire evil plot to the hero instead of just killing them straight away, is kind of an out dated practice, so I was surprise to see it here. Please don't watch this.www.lagsreviews.com",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"VERY uneasy mix of horror, humor and drama","Siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are witch hunters. They're hired by the mayor of a local town where 12 children have been abducted by witches. It seems an evil powerful witch (Famke Jenssen) has them and is setting up some big ritual that will make her more powerful than any other witch.The story is kind of vague but this was obviously heavily cut before it was released. There are plot loopholes galore and a creature named Edward appears out of nowhere and is never explained. And Hansel is (for no discernible reason) a diabetic! The horror, humor and drama never mesh together comfortably. Still this isn't a disaster. There's plenty of exciting fights and plenty of way over the top gore--but it's too silly to take seriously. There's also excellent special effects and a great score. Renner is just OK as Hansel but Arterton is excellent as Gretel. Jenssen is pretty bad--she's admitted she did it for the money--and it shows. It's not the disaster I heard it was but it's no great shakes either. I give it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What Could've Been,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is about how the two famous orphans become witch hunters after killing the witch that took them as hostages.I've been looking forward to this movie for two reasons: 1 was that it looked like what I wanted in an action comedy, and not just the normal boring Hollywood trash that we usually get with action movies. And 2 was that it was written and directed by the Norwegian guy who made Kill Buljo: The Movie and Dead Snow, Tommy Wirkola.The movie starts off promising and much of what I wanted from it is actually present in the first 20 minutes or so. It's just over-the-top mindless comedy action with overly tough bounty hunters that just own everyone on screen. And then it becomes more of what Hollywood likes.After the 20 first minutes, the characters apparently develop, and they try to make it a bit more serious. No thanks, I just want mindless comedy action for this one right.You know, if I were to direct an action movie, I would've made it over-the-top to the point of insanity. Not make any sense at all, just being hilarious as ****. But in the end, we get a piece of what could've been.It seems like Wirkola was trying to make an action movie that was like the one I described, which shows with the 20 first minutes, but then ran out of silly ideas and started relying on Hollywood clichés. Either that, or the producers demanded him to make it more of a standard movie.Overall, it's fun, but nothing special. Maybe Kill Buljo 2 will be better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' - Not an absurd premise, but an absurd movie","Considering a witch nearly baked them in an oven and ate them, it makes sense that Hansel and Gretel would grow up to be witch hunters. OK, maybe not quite, but it's at least more reasonable than Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter.With that perspective, there's a bit more logic in place backing ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"" but the film might as well be ""Barack Obama: Dragon Slayer"" based on how director and co- writer Tommy Wirkola fails to take advantage of this workable premise.Wirkola, the Norwegian filmmaker who made the Nazi zombie horror film ""Dead Snow,"" tries to utilize the same irreverence and unserious tone that earned that film some critical recognition, but the sheer absurdity of undead Nazis translates better than some ambiguously 19th Century supernatural witch hunt.After their parents abandoned them in the woods as children, Hansel and Gretel escaped the clutches of a witch and presumably (we don't see the epiphany happen) dedicate their lives to being witch-hunting orphans who travel all over the world killing and burning the ugly hags. When they're hired to investigate a series of nearly a dozen child kidnappings, they uncover some secrets about their past.It's hard to tell if Wirkola and co-writer D.W. Harper were trying at all to make ""Hansel & Gretel"" a slick, cool action movie or if they wanted it to play as an exercise in absurdity. Either way, talented stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton look completely out of place in the title roles. It's uncomfortable to see them acting this poorly, to the point where the film might actually have been better if two no-names from one of those straight-to-DVD blockbuster knockoffs had been cast instead.Wirkola clearly strives to make the movie gleefully violent and hilarious, but that tone and approach only works when you can buy into the more fundamental parts of a film and ""Hansel & Gretel"" is a sloppy smorgasbord of action, '80s fantasy, gore and steampunk tied together by the thinnest of story lines.Every element of the plot gets the most basic, glossed-over treatment based on the assumption that the audience will find witch-hunting sufficiently entertaining. The combat sequences themselves have an amusing edge, with Hansel and Gretel chasing after feral witches and using all manner of weaponry to blow them out of the sky, but it purports to be much cooler than it actually is with gratuitous swearing and denigrating one-liners. Hansel and Gretel, for example, make jokes at the expense of other characters, but in actuality they're just as culpable.It starts with how completely one-dimensional our heroes are. Hansel and Gretel possess no qualities other than badass and snide. Hansel is a diabetic thanks to the witch who force-fed him candy as a child, but while that's clever, it doesn't count for character, and neither do Gretel's nightmares about what really happened to them as children. Both amount to insignificant plot devices. There's no exploration of the brother-sister dynamic or any kind of internal or interpersonal conflict. These are not the hallmarks of ""serious"" films, but rather essentials to storytelling, so the movie is not being avante-garde by scrapping them.Famke Janssen plays Muriel, the evil witch with the grand plan. She's supposed be formidable and feisty, which she is in a physical sense, but her character's sole motivation is her plan — to make witches impervious to fire — so Janssen is left with nothing to do except ham it up in every scene. You can imagine that doesn't leave much for veteran Peter Stormare as the town sheriff or Thomas Mann as an obsessed fan of Hansel and Gretel's.Then there's Edward. Edward is an ogre who looks like a cross between and Richard Kind and the dad from the '90s TV show ""Dinosaurs,"" who fits into the story the same exact way Sloth factors into ""Goonies."" He's either embodies the best or the worst the movie, depending on how you feel about the rest of it.""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is carnal, surface filmmaking — a cake made entirely of frosting. Sure, it might be decent frosting, but unless you're a frosting junkie it's essentially inedible. People who like that kind of glitzy display might spoon it up in all its artificiality and appreciate its flippant attitude, but most audiences will be too self-respecting to indulge.Peppered throughout this attempt at carefree supernatural action-adventure are clichés at every level from the dialogue to the use of narration and the score. It's clear the movie is trying to follow a formula and utilize techniques that have proved successful in the past, but you just can't ignore the essentials like ""Hansel & Gretel,"" as doing so completely exposes the film for the action-packed genre film fraud that it is when it attempts to employ those techniques but falls flat.If somehow you can fall under ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'"" spell, you might just be enchanted enough to enjoy the film in its short run time given how it sticks to its guns, but don't count on being so easily beguiled.~Steven CThanks for reading!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Spin of Horrible Child's Tale,"First of all let me say up front that I do not like the tale of Hansel and Gretel, not the Grimm's version or the sugar coated version we were told as children. However I was pleased with thee tale told in this movie. I am a pagan who has done plenty of research of the ""witch burning"" era in time, and found the movie's version to be pretty accurate on the rumors and such spread about. As far the as the makeup goes I wasn't too pleased with the makeup and costuming of the witches, though original and catching, I found the costumes clashing with the witches. Of course they were black, to show evil and darkness, and their makeup (not prosthetic but the actual makeup) was dark. The only witch's looks I liked was the main black witch, the other two ""main"" ones, the ones that are with her in capturing the children, I was not too impressed with. But that's my only real complaint with the movie, I'm a pretty good guesser on how movies are going to turn out - and love to try and tell the ending before the end comes along - and SOME things I just didn't see. I wish I could write more but the ending just made me smile. I'd recommend it, however keep in mind how bloody it is (I was shunned for laughing at some gory scenes by my fellow movie goers) and it has some strong language.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
This isn't so bad it's not worth watching but it isn't particularly good either,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013) is a movie I recently rewatched on Prime. The storyline follows the brother and sister from the legendary Hansel & Gretel storyline after they killed the witch in the candy house as children. The grow up seeking out monster, ghosts and ghouls to clear from the countryside for pay. One day a small town reluctantly asks for their help. As they dig into the haunting they discover the events may be tied to their own past.This movie is directed by Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead) and stars Jeremy Renner (The Town), Gemma Arterton (Clash of the Titans), Peter Stormare (Fargo), Famke Janssen (House on Haunted Hill) and Derek Mears (Predators).This movie actually had a lot going for it - the settings, attire, props and special effects were all polished and looked good. The cast was also way better than it should have been and fun. The weapons were outstanding, especially in the final battle. There's even some random nudity sprinkled in. Unfortunately, the writing was just okay and the plot lacked depth. You really don't care about the characters or what happens to them. The dialogue was also average and I really could have done without the love story subplots.Overall, this is okay in a Van Helsing kind of way. This isn't so bad it's not worth watching but it isn't particularly good either. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A largely dull and unfunny B-grader.,"Some movies are so bad they're good. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It had all the right ingredients to be a B-grade classic - catchy concept, cartoonish violence, top notch actors (Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton) in the tongue-in-cheek lead roles and, most enticingly, the man who made the awesome undead-Nazis horror-comedy Dod Sno calling the shots - yet somewhere along the line it squanders its potential with a messy plot, awful CGI and misfired gags. There's the occasional spot of guilty entertainment on offer, whether it's a troll squashing human heads like tomatoes or a petite lady unleashing hell with a machine gun that wouldn't look out of place on a battleship, however they are far and few between and can't hide the fact this is an under-performer. Director Tommy Wirkola has implied in interviews that the studio bosses made heavy cuts and he's insisted that his version will be much funnier and much gorier, but until we get to see that edition on DVD we're left with a dull and unfunny affair that isn't worth forking out your hard earned cash to see at the cinema.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Wickedly Fun, Gory Great Movie of It's Kind!","I was lucky enough to win double red carpet passes for this movie. it was a chance to see the actors, producer and director before the movie started. I saw trailers and was betting that this should be fun... indeed I was right!The storyline was quite well written and left no plot holes as it was written by the same director, taking the original fairytale of Hansel & Gretel and further expanding it as if they had grew up and became hunters saving the world from witches! A few good twists and surprises are in store throughout but it knows it doesn't take itself too seriously.The acting from Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are great as always, they get a fair amount of screen time together they can show they're action chops and reel in their character into reality. The supporting cast was great as well, but it's Famke Janssen that does a top job as the villain of this story!Visual Fx's are really well presentable and don't look so cheesy at all, the gory moments made me laugh heaps throughout the film. The creative weaponry shown here is really creative, it reminds me something out of Van Helsing world!Overall, it's a solid action / comedy / horror that's made for adults and is a must watch for fans of Army of Darkness, Van Helsing and possibly the Underworld series!

Seriously... what are you expecting?,"I'll be straight with you... if you don't like this movie then it's YOUR fault! What are you expecting from a supernatural monster-hunting film, roughly based on a children's fairytale? It's not Shakespeare. It will never be remembered as a classic. There's no real character development or radical revelations about the deeper meaning of humanity.What there is, is plenty of hideous witches getting blasted off their broomsticks by annoyingly attractive people with weapons that probably didn't exist when this film was probably set.That's it. Shooting. Action. Witches screeching and the two leads posturing as they show how much sexier they are compared to us. Are you into that? Can you handle that? If so, give it a go - it's a daft, silly, splat-fest of a blast.Remove your brain (you don't need it to appreciate this) and just back and enjoy it for all its silliness.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's dreadful.,"There is a lack of Color in this film, and it suffers from that. The set pieces are early 2000's. The Writing doesn't comit to dopey fun, because the actors take it seriously. The last lingering taste is ugly, and uninspired from its original source material. This is a film to avoid, none of it is entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Over-the-top CGI action AND style..and that's it.,"Mindset before movie: I was invited to see this movie last-minute, during my long commute home from work. I was tired and a little flustered by the rush to get to the theatre on time. Being vaguely familiar with the fairy tale and uncertain about my opinions of either lead cast member, the preview looked cool. Honestly, I was expecting a Resdident Evil/ Underworld kind of movie.Mindset after movie: Pretty much what I expected. Over-the-top, stylish gory action with computer animation sprinkled all over it. Acting was good enough to keep you focused on the plot and it's holes(instead of the terrible acting). The movie was rated 18A(due to the gore, I think), it felt directed towards more of a PG-13 audience. It was full of that cheese that brings out that inner child from the era of Arny and Van Damme and just like when I was a child, I even found myself saying ""Woah! That was cool!"" a couple times out loud. It also had some dark horror undertones with cameos from some familiar monsters and creatures from horror's past. Although the movie had the style of a few fairy tale movies that were recently released, the idea behind the film was a good one; instead of just another Hollywood style fairy tale it's an original Hollywood style sequel to a fairy tale.If you're like me and have an unexplainable addiction for those ridiculous action movies with style and gore where the director's priorities placed making it look cool over good plot line and the physics, this movie delivers. Just remember, it's a movie. If you want something real, don't look at Hollywood.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wait for the DVD and the determine whether or not it was worth the rental.,"Interesting concept, but poor execution. It's another movie where they've taken good actors/actresses and subjected them to a poorly written script and even worse direction (a la Natalie Portman in any of the new Star Wars movies).The good: action sequences, pace of the movie (after the first 10 minutes), costumes, and sets.The bad: script, dialog, acting, excessive oddly placed 'F' bombs, gratuitous gore, no back story in the beginning to set up the action. I could go on, but if you've seen it you know what I mean.Jeremy Renner is a good actor and it's readily apparent that they signed him to what should be a B movie so that he could hopefully garner the producers some respectable box office returns or at least help to break even on the film. However, his acting skills as well as those of others in the film are overshadowed by the poorly written script and the lousy direction. Famke Janssen is another good performer, but as soon as she transforms into a witch her acting seems to transform, as well, and not for the better. Finally, Peter Stormare, who was great in Fargo and in Constantine, really lacks credibility in this movie. It almost seems as if some of the actors' cues are off.The script of this film assumes that everyone knows the back story of Hansel and Gretel. While most people do, a voice-over lead-in at the beginning of the film would have helped the story along greatly and it would have set up the action a lot better. Other problems with the script, possibly plot holes, include whether or not Muriel was the same witch as the one at the beginning of the film (the dialog seems to hint at this) and the question of what happens with the wand that Gretel picks up later in the film. Perhaps some scenes were edited out that would have answered this, but, if so, why not edit out the scenes that raise the questions in the first place? Bottom line: not horrendous but not good either. Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, and Famke Janssen carry this movie, but despite their combined talents it still falls short.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent plot - great effects - well worth watching,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Its a fictional tale that has been amended to result in Hansel and Gretel moving from the traditional fairy tale story to being paid witch hunters.Unsure of the past and their parents demise, their commitment to destroy all witches finally results in the discovery of what happened to their parents and why.The effects and action are superb. There is a reasonable amount of gore and a plot which, although ultimately is predictable, it's just great entertainment.I personally will go back and watch this at the movies again and get on blue ray when it comes out.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stereotype perpetuation for purposes of greed,"This is a horrible idea for a movie. I am condemning it, admittedly sight unseen, because it is a perpetuation of stereotypes that would be better consigned to ""the dustbins of history."" Witches are not evil women that kill and curse, but guardians of the goddess Gaia (Earth herself) and members of an earth-based religion that is as valid as any patriarchal religion. It is time for Hollywood and society as a whole to realize that and make a movie with a witch as (gasp) a hero. Anybody brave enough to do that? It does not matter who the ""stars"" are, what the ""plot"" is, or how much the studio spent on special effects. They are trying to turn back the clock to whip up more frenzy...to what end? The heroes kill ""witches."" Are they going to advocate burning real witches, perhaps as a publicity ploy?",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Army of Darkness FANS will LOVE this Movie,"I just watched this movie and it reminded me of the same type of entertainment and special effects and make up as Army of Darkness from the Evil Dead series. It was comical and truly entertaining and unpredictable at times. Even though, the DVD I rented was not in 3-D as it was released in the theatres, it was just like watching the 3-D version on my flat screen TV. Despite some of the comments in the forums, the casting for this movie was excellent. This movie was some good old fashion entertainment that would normally fall under Cult Classics. It was kind of like Conan the Barbarian (original version) meets Army of Darkness.I sure hope there is a sequel!!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
At least it's only 88 minutes.,"This film is a perfect example of the slow decline of the cinema. I understand that there have always been films that used humour in horror or fantasy, 1939's The Cat and the Canary being an excellent example. But the rot began to get really serious when Stephen Sommers gave us 1999's The Mummy, a well made film indeed, but any real suspense and horror was lost with all the wise cracking and on-screen tomfoolery. Since that time we seem to have been inundated with so call ""Thrillers"" that don't amount to much more than a film filled with lots of fancy special effects,chases and explosions! It's a great pity. This films one saving grace is that runs under 90 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun to watch, but a huge waste of potential","Hansel And Gretel has great potential but suffers from bland and clumsy direction. If the director had been top quality, this could have been a surprise hit and one of the top action movies of the year. Hansel and Gretel is full of fresh ideas and irreverently injects the old tale we all know with blood, comedy and sex. Now we're left with a half-baked fusion of genres that doesn't quite cut it.Sometimes the timing is so bad that the movie almost stops in its tracks. Due to poor shot selection many of the good action scenes are less cool and thrilling.E.g., the cool weapons do not get the screen time and exposure they deserve. Scenes introducing some of the weapons seem to have been cut. So, surprisingly, you may not see enough of the weapon to totally appreciate what it can do. This may seem trivial, but I'd say the weapons account for about one third of the charm of the movie.The same goes for the characters, which are often thrown into a scene that doesn't properly connect to the previous one.The main roles are well cast, which makes up for some of the aforementioned waste of potential. I found Gemma Arterton to be fresh, sexy and fun to watch. Renner is not as good (for which we may also blame the director), but he handles the combination of language, comedy and action well. The entire cast is A movie material and is doing a more than decent job.If you don't mind a new take on fantasy and fairy tale, you'll have fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, I enjoyed it","How many Hansel and Gretel movies are going to be made. Really. It is going to be tough to beat this one. Definitely leave your kids at home for this one. Well, I wouldn't take my kid to any Hansel and Gretel movie, but especially don't let them see this movie. The witches are scary, and what the witches do to kids is just not right for kids to see. Several f words, the b word, and other bad language. Very bloody and gory and action packed. A nude woman is seen getting into a lake. Her behind is seen and a brief breast shot.Definitely an enjoyable movie to watch. Good actors and actresses. There is gore, violence, bad language, nudity, and frightening things.16+",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Faster than a witch jamming a broom stick between her legs.,"This movie needed more story meat on it's plot bones. I sort of appreciated the concept but the film lacks character development and flow... They had the bad-ass that is Peter Stormare but failed us with him. With regard to the other actors: I personally find Renner to be a bore in everything and it was no different this time; at least Gemma ROCKED Gretel and Famke = fantastic. The effects were, overall, well done to me. One thing that irritated me quite a bit was Hansel and Gretel's fan boy, that kid would have been put down for being a legally retarded gooch in those times. All things considered, I'd say I expected less than what I got. I would say this is a matinée at best.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Couple of Surprising Twists Here and There,"After being abandoned in a large forest by their father, two children by the name of ""Hansel"" (Jeremy Renner) and ""Gretel"" (Gemma Arterton) stumble upon a house made of candy. Venturing inside they are captured by a witch who plans to kill them and use their hearts to conjure up a horrific spell. Fortunately, they escape and kill the evil witch in the process. It's at this time that they realize that they have a unique skill and decide to sell their services to villages beset by witchcraft. Some years later they travel to one particular town which has had eleven children recently abducted discover that the local sheriff is about to burn a young woman named ""Mina"" (Pihla Viitala) for being a witch. Although Hansel rescues the comely young maiden he also earns the enmity of the local sheriff as well. But that is the least of his problems. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this turned out to be an enjoyable action movie for the most part with a couple of surprising twists here and there. Likewise, having two attractive actresses like Gemma Arterton and Pihla Viitala certainly didn't hurt either. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hmm. I have seen alot of low ratings and reviews.,"Well, I'm not a happy camper. Me and my family very much enjoyed this movie. So much so that when I see it's in tv I watch it which I just need to go back to the DVD. Since they don't have cut out or changed in the movie. Like they do on TV. I'm very sad to say that I read that they were not moving on to make another movie it looks like. They said it looked like they would in 2016 but that's gone and past. What I have read in the works of if they are making a sequel to the film or not I have read. That they are leaning towards a series, instead of the film which I hope not. Along with I would hope that they would make a second movie along with able to keep the same main actors. That one thing I dislike the most is when they finally make another movie. "" If they do so, I sure as heck would be happy "" That they have the same actor's from the first one.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun, bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods.","In 2005, Terry Gilliam suffered a rare blip in his mesmerising career when he served up The Brothers Grimm. Presumably, what he was aiming for was something along the lines of this loose adaptation-cum-extension of one of the brother's best-loved tales. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters picks up the abandoned siblings' story many years later, far more streetwise (um, forestwise?) and with an insatiable desire for witch obliteration; removal of the head is fun but nothing beats a good burning, apparently.As silly as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and just as much fun, this is a bloodthirsty, ballsy romp through the woods that doesn't pretend to be anything other than disposable, claret-splattering entertainment. It's a fast, violent gore-fest that doesn't take itself remotely seriously but still delivers enough quality punches to be satisfying.Make no mistake, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters has 'franchise' written all over it with Gemma Arterton challenging Kate Beckinsale for the 'vamp with guns' crown from but, whereas Selene pouts and kicks ass with an undercurrent of darkness and the hope we'll take her seriously in the Underworld chronicles, Gretel is just out to have fun and kill as many evil bitches along the way as possible. In a duel, my money would still be on Selene but the new, Gretel-shaped, killing machine in town might just take over at the box office and she's a lot more fun to watch.Gore splattered after the messy demise of another hex victim, Gretel expels an exasperated thought to no one in particular: ""The curse of hunger for crawling things! I f*****g hate that one!"" It's a moment to relish in a delightfully messy film that refuses to shy away from the blood splatter and gore.Thumbs up to writer/director Tommy Wirkola who deals with the awkward backstory (for those who somehow missed out on fairy tales in childhood) pre-titles and brings us up to date via newspaper clippings as the titles are splashed across the screen. This feels like a boyhood dream project of his that's finally come to fruition and is littered with subtle comedic moments as he melds the modern approach with period setting; milk bottles have 'missing child' posters hung around their necks and later Hansel (Jeremy Renner) laments his diabetes, the result of being force fed candy by their childhood witch. Get that: the moralistic side of slaughter! Although this should be a double act vehicle, Renner seems a little lost in the events. Certainly he has his moments in the sun but this feels like Arterton's film with Renner there to make her and arch villainess, Muriel (Famke Janssen) look good. Hansel's awkwardness with the is she/isn't she witch suspect, Mina (Pihla Vitala), is weak and the evolving relationship is stilted and superficial so as to be almost irrelevant.Janssen clearly has a ball chewing scenery and generally being nasty in fancy dress, perhaps doing her damndest to shake off her dreary, constricting character of last year's Taken 2. She succeeds admirably with just the right amount of melodrama to make it amusing without being laughable.The other supporting characters, Sheriff Berringer (Peter Stormare) chief amongst them, are simply there as cannon fodder and the inclusion of Hansel & Gretel's own groupie and a disillusioned troll are plonked in to fill some gaps with a view to filling out their characters in the inevitable sequel. It's not a problem but with a little more attention to the peripheral characters, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters might have been a fuller experience instead of just disposable entertainment.As with Dredd last year, 2D screenings are in short supply and so I was forced to suffer another jarring, juddering display in the third dimension with gimmickry the order of the day instead of depth of field and a more exquisite canvas à la Hugo. It's a horrible experience, it detracts from the fun and it's painful to watch at times, but still the money-grabbing Hollywood execs foist it upon us. Bah! If you can find a 2D print of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, go for it. If you can't, wait for the DVD and watch it on a HUGE TV with a couple of beers and a friend who enjoys splatter and gore as much as you.Don't take it seriously, watch it once, enjoy it, move on.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chix Chat on Film Review: The Hansel and Gretel story continues.,"The movie industry is leaving vampires behind for a while and has started to focus on fairy tales. With two recent takes on Snow White, an upcoming Jack and the Beanstalk tale and now Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. This film is the continuation of their story and how their lives have evolved after their fateful defeat of the witch in the cottage made of candy. From what I had seen in the trailer my expectation was that the special effects would be amazing and in actuality they were. I saw the film in 3D and was satisfied that they met the quota with things flying off screen directly at me, mostly splintered wood but I did flinch a few times. The acting was not bad either, both Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) were portrayed straight and focused on the task at hand, nothing too over the top and the same goes for their primary nemesis Muriel (Famke Janssen). The problem with the story was that there was this major issue with incongruences. The weaponry used to snare witches was too advanced, even if you have to wind up a stun gun, it's still a stun gun. The era was tied to the time that witches were being burned at the stake, which in Salem was the late 1600s and the first gatling gun was not invented until around 1860. Congruence matters, I know this is as I stated originally an updated fairy tale, but I'm just saying. Had the story been truly updated and told during modern times it might have made more sense that they used automatic weaponry, I had less of an issue with the flying around on brooms since that is a witch staple. Then there was the whole Gretel being lost in the woods moment and then magically she is in a cottage. The story wasn't entirely awful, because it did make these familiar characters from a child hood fairy tale richer. It was entertaining and I liked that Gretel was a tough girl, but some things could have been done differently that would have me like it more than I did. This film would not lose anything if viewed on the Syfy channel in the comfort of your own home, in fact it would fit in nicely and be a slight step up because of the special effects. I give it a red light.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
FANTASTIC FANTASY HORROR ACTION FUN,"This Awesome action packed fantasy flick so needs a sequel!!!
I totally enjoyed this ridiculously underrated action romp, a great duo Gemma Arterton & Jeremy Renner are excellent together as they play the badass Witch Hunters with attitude & they're so much fun.
This is a big budget new cool take on the old grim fairy tale of Hansel and Gretal & it's Awesome!!!!I'm a fsn of Jeremy Renner since his Awesome role as Hawkeye from the Avengers films & his excellent addition to the Bourne franchise with the better Bourne Legacy, a better movie than all of Matt Damon's put together & that's because of how good Renner is as an action lead, also loved Renner in the Horror sequel 28 Weeks Later, Renner has done alot of good films & here he's so Cool again as he blasts his way through horrific witches. Gemma (The Girl With All The Gifts) is just as Cool & tough here as his sister & both go around as hired bounty hunters to rid towns of evil witches & that gives us some Beautiful sets of old fashioned towns that are very gothic looking & some Awesome action set pieces of battles with the demonic witches are like vicious beasts, the scariest witches have been in movies.
The beautiful Famke Janssen (Taken, X-Men) is great as the deadly & powerful head witch & has some fantastic fight scenes with our heroes.
The fx are fantastic, the costumes are Awesome especially Runner's outfit, the fight scenes are fast & furious pieces of action that at times reminded me of the quick edits of Sam Raimi with his Evil Dead films.This is such a Cool & fun concept that it definitely should have atleast had a sequel as it was setup with a great ending & new team members but like all the Trilogy good films the critics or movie goers don't seem to like them but i always like what ""they"" don't & i loved this film.

The funniest part is that it is set in middle age times, yet everyone has guns, shotguns, and they talk like current times instead of middle age times.In this story, Hansel and Gretel are left in the woods and come across a witch. In this movie, all the witches look like something out of Evil Dead rather than an old witch with a big nose and hat. They burn the witch and that starts their legend. Jump ahead and Hansel and Gretel have come back to their hometown to solve the disappearance of 12 children. They learn of a plot by the witches to perform a spell of the blood moon that would make them immune to fire. So the rest of the film is battles with witches, the evil sheriff whom doesn't want anyone else to be the hero, and finding out about white witches.FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining action film with good special effects.

Can I have the 1 hour 28 minutes of my life back please!,"I had been looking forward to this film, but unusually I had not read the previous reviews, Big Mistake. I know this story was first written down in the early 1800s, however the story could date as far back as the 1300s. As I wasn't around then I couldn't swear to what language they used but I am pretty sure that 'awesome' wasn't around. I have picked this word as it was the most irritating but the film was full of them. At one point Hansel also appears to use some type of revolver that also appears to be totally out of context with rest of the film, they also seem to have some type of automatic cannon or Gatling gun. I could have ignored all of this if it had been an enjoyable rollick/romp but it wasn't, it was tepid and boring and the writer seemed to believe that he could make up for it's lack of story or dialogue with gore (of which there is plenty).

Amusing fairy tale based flick could have used a bit more fun to make it really click.,"When you go to see a movie called Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters, obviously you don't go in expecting Shakespeare but, I did expect it to have a bit more of the giddy fun that Tommy Wirkola brought to his gory zombie blast, Dead Snow. And while I was amused and entertained by H&G, it actually took itself a little too seriously for a film about fairy tale characters grown up to be vengeful witch hunters. With an outlandish story like this, I can appreciate giving the material some respect and not making a joke out of it but, to really make it work you have to give it a bit more over the top like Wirkola did so well with Dead Snow. H&G has action that is bloody and fast moving but, the film needed a bit more of a sense of humor then a few curse laden quips and breaking the same person's nose, twice. This story of the fairy tale siblings coming up against a very powerful witch (Famke Janssen) with a devious plot to free her kind from the dangers of fire resembles the far more ridiculous Van Helsing to a degree but, could have used a bit of that flick's over the top energy, just not as out of control (though that does make VH a 'so bad it's good' treat). The film is well done and uses a lot more practical effects then expected and the minimal use of CGI was very refreshing. The cast handles their parts very well with Renner and Arterton having a good time as the bad ass witch killers and they played their roles with a serious approach but, not without a quick wink every now and then to let you know they are having a good time. Famke Janssen plays her part as the formidable witch with some over the top relish and that made a nice contrast to her stoic adversaries. Rounding out the cast Peter Stormare isn't given much to do as the town sheriff who is not happy that H&G have come to do his job but, he is more lively here then in The Last Stand. The film looks great. The sets and costumes are really nicely designed as are the various witches and their Troll, Edward (Derek Mears). The cinematography is lush and the locations beautiful. Visually this is a really cool flick. But, as said, Wirkola gives us a fast pace and some nice gory action scenes to entertain us but, he just needed to inject a little more fun in the proceedings to make this a real standout treat. Overall I did enjoy it but, it could have been so much more of a blast if Wirkola wasn't trying a bit too hard to not turn the material into a joke. There is a fine line to making a movie like this and Dead Snow proves he can walk it just fine. So why didn't he? An amusing enough viewing but, kinda forgettable when all is said and done.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Might wish to consider stabbing yourself in the eye instead,"Spoiler alert/train wreck analysis..... Where do I begin. Let's see.... yes. First off in the movie, you see a fast forward news clip montage of everything they have accomplished post child abduction/attempted murder.

They discover a gingerbread house, not knowing that an evil witch lives in it who eats children. The witch catches them and locks them in a cage, but luckily, Gretel can outsmart her, and pushes her in her own oven.

Their latest mission: 11 children have been missing from a village and the mayor wants the siblings to track them down. The two are sure that witches are involved.Review: Like many fantasy movies in 2013 Hansel and Gretel was not as successful as expected. I remember that it was supposed to be released some time in 2012, but it was postponed. My guess is they didn't want to compete with Snow White and The Huntsman and Mirror Mirror. But they should have, because neither of these two movies was as fast- paced, or held as much action as this one. The movie doesn't have much of a story or great dialogues but that's not important, because it has everything else: Great graphics, over-the top gore – which works in this case-, a sexy cast, creepy villains, and lots and lots of action.

Hansel & Gretel race ... to glory!,"I am not gonna lie,since ""Red Riding Hood"" I am a fan of the ""fairy tales twists"" genre and this one is a worthy addition to this list.Gemma ""Hottie"" Arterton and Jeremy Renner prove to be a good match and stand up to their reputation.The plot is well-written although I couldn't help the feeling that the movie was escalating quickly causing minor plot holes and convenient situations on behalf of the 2 main stars.The action was superb and it won't let you down,but as far as romance goes,the few emotionally charged scenes were well...not so emotionally written.Speaking of emotions the family relationship could have a stronger basis but all of that was caught up in the ""race"" of the movie that I mentioned right above.The witch hunting twist was brilliant and as far it concerns me it leaves room for a sequel,even a better one since a strong basis is already built,a sequel that I would gladly watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Proper nasty witches, warts and all.","Really wicked witches have been woefully under-represented in cinema over the years, with only a handful of films genuinely doing the scary old hags justice; Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters sees Norwegian writer/director Tommy Wirkola doing his utmost to raise their profile as movie monsters, offering up more malevolent, wizened, child-eating crones than you can shake a broomstick at.With his focus clearly on the creation of these nasty witches, and their subsequent destruction by Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), Wirkola offers only the slightest of plots off which to hang the gory deaths, comic-book fighting, CGI effects, and numerous sneaky shots of Arterton's heaving bosom. Fortunately, for the majority of the time, Wirkola's handling of the action is slick enough to compensate for the lack of story, the weak writing only becoming really noticeable whenever there is a rare lull in pace.It's lead female star's tightly-corseted cleavage aside, the film's most enjoyable aspect is when it occasionally shifts up a gear to OTT, bats**t crazy violence mode, the most entertaining scenes being Hansel's bonkers battle with Siamese-twin witches and troll Edward's gory head-stomping rampage, both of which have energy and imagination to spare. If this level of enthusiasm for the bizarre and the grotesque had been applied just a little more often, I might even have been declaring a new favourite...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie set out exactly what it wanted to and did it well.,I found this movie great. I went in not expecting a great plot but a simple one. I went in expecting the lines to be kind of cheesy and they were. But I didn't care. I thought it was great for many reasons.Did they accomplish what they set out to do? Yes Did they do it well? Yes Did it have the best dialogue? No. But was the dialogue saved by the delivery of the lines? Yes. Was the ending great? Yes. Does it call for a sequel? No. But that is a good thing. It set out exactly what it was meant to. There is no need for a sequel. It would be extensively repetitious. The movie is 88 min long. That is great. It doesn't drag on and its not too short. It accomplishes what it set out to do. No less no more.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"don't take it seriously, seriously?","I was waiting until this came out because I liked Red Riding Hood (2011) and Snow White and The Huntsman (2012). Both another take on the popular fairy tales. This story looked promising but for me it failed completely. The story was very simple although having some good effects it still wasn't my thing. And even as a horror buff there are some moments to cheer about like smashing heads and bodies being teared apart.It's clearly made for the adult due the sometimes gory shots but it also looked sometimes like a spoof. I didn't had any problems with the acting but it's just a simple story more about witch hunting, in fact, it's popular these days to take popular names and mix them in a horror story, take a look at Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (2012). It do has some funny moments and some things are so predictable that it more looked like a mish mash.Full of one-liners make sit an ideal flick to sit and enjoy with the family but it doesn't deliver toward people searching for something new.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3,5/5 Script 2,5/5 Comedy 0,5/5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hansel and Gretel the witch hunters,I found this movie to be totally lacking in taste. It did not hold my attention and I am glad I rented this film instead of wasting money on it to watch it at the theater. I could have used some buttered popcorn to occupy me as I tried to stay interested in a boring and dumb tale with a plot that went nowhere and where all of the fighting ended up to amount to nothing. The actors and the actresses were not believable and therefore I was very disappointed and would not rate this film anything other than a one which is awful. There are other movies out there if you want to see them involving witch hunts and the like and I suggest you go out there and find something better than this bloody and awfully boring movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fairly Good Popcorn Flick,"I walked into this movie expecting something along the lines of The Brothers Grimm, but perhaps a little bit worse. I knew that they had been sitting on this film for a while, banking on either of the leads inevitable star power. However, the movie did not disappoint at all. It can be campy, especially in its delivery of dialogue, but it's completely aware of that behavior.The movie is intentionally violent and gory. It pulls no punches, but in that seriousness, they are willing to put together some very competent action sequences. Some of the special effects were a little hackneyed, while others hit their mark. The twists were a little predictable as well.As long as you're not aiming to see an Oscar film, there's no reason you shouldn't go to see Hansel and Gretel. It'll be especially enjoyable if you don't mind the American accents and the campy dialogue. This is likely to be one of the better actions movies for the first half of this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quality production, decent acting and plenty of well-directed action that never gets boring. Cool effects, both sound and visual, in fact this movie's soundtrack is excellent. The story is very simple and dialog is sometimes a bit silly, but do you really care in a movie like this?If you don't like over-the-top adventure/fairy-tale/fantasy, you're at the wrong movie, if you do, you'll like this one. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time,"What a joke that movie despite the promising actors. Gory and totally shallow! This movie managed to take out all the magic and courage of a classic children story to make it about blasting heads off, beating women with fists in the face and a display of blood splatter. The story line seems to have been made for kids with almost no exploration of the actors' character and yet with the amount of blood it can only be seen by adults. Was short with generic action scenes, disappointing special effects, no exploration of dark witchcraft despite setting the mood for it(only blue beams of light for telekinetic effect and a few tricks here and there) and really just hideous grimaces from the bad guys.

A Dark Romp with Good Production Values,"This film is not classified in the ""comedy"" genre, but you can consider it a dark comedy. We learn this early on, when we see glass milk bottles with ads for missing children strapped to them. But this is not a film designed for children.Once you decide not to take this film too seriously, you can accept the anachronisms (like shotguns) and just enjoy Hansel and Gretel for what it is--a special effects romp that has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. Look for the references to Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, Assassins Creed, and the entire genre that Underworld's Kate Beckinsale has established.There is not much depth in the story. And no surprises, really. But here is a list of things I liked about this film:*It's production values. Quality all around.*The fact that it was not difficult to follow the action, even during the dimly lit scenes.*The music, which was moody and sometimes drove the action.If you take this film seriously, then you will not be able to get past the fact that the witches have such tremendous powers that their enemies would have no chance against them.The most enjoyable aspect of the film is the troll--a masterpiece of design and invention, an enjoyable character.Sequels are on the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not terrible but nothing to rush and see. Would have been better if they made it funnier. Very over the top. I say C+,"""Me and my sister, we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch but that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood, witch blood and we haven't stopped since."" After escaping and killing a witch as young kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) have become bounty hunters specializing in witch hunting. They are hired by a town mayor to protect them, but the sheriff doesn't trust them. It is up to the brother and sister team to save the town from it's fate. I was a little leery of this going in. After sitting through it I have to say it was about what I expected. A lot of over the top acting and gore strung together with a little story. The movie isn't terrible but I don't think it's worth seeing more then once. The evil witch makeup is a cross between something in Labrynth and Army Of Darkness. To me I think the movie could have been a little better if they made it more of a comedy/horror then just straight horror. That's just my opinion though. I'm sure many people will really like this. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I say C+.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Rock 'em, sock 'em good time!","Every since I saw the trailer for Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters during the previews to the most recent Resident Evil flick, I've been looking forward to it. Jeremy Renner has put out a handful of really great movies in the past few years, while Gemma Arterton is absolutely stunning. Famke Janssen makes a rare appearance as well.From start to finish, my blood was pumping and I couldn't sit still. There was plenty of action (including tons of blood and gore), solid acting, a fun plot, and awesome one-liners.The film, directed by Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow), will never leave you bored.Renner (Hansel) and Arterton (Gretel) are likable characters with a little depth and that's pretty much all you need from this type of film. They work well together. Renner gets plenty of one-liners while playing a stubborn character, while Arterton plays the more emotional sibling. Janssen (Muriel) plays a sadistic but fun evil witch. Pihla Viitala, who plays Mina, is a fun character who you will fall in love with. Ben and Edward are two more characters that will gain the hearts of the audience.If you're looking to have a good time while not having to think too much, this movie is exactly what you're looking for.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,"If you didn't realise from the title, you would have done from the first couple of minutes, this is a fantasy, and therefore not to be taken too seriously. It isn't exactly a modern take on the famous German fairy tale, but there are one or two anachronisms here and there, their weapons in particular.There isn't that much of a plot to it, suffice it to say that a particularly evil and powerful grand witch has some dastardly plans afoot including child sacrifice, but with the help of a white witch, an autograph hunter and a friendly troll, the fearless siblings might just defeat the forces of darkness.This film has some half decent special effects, as well as witches who ride on broomsticks and kick like Bruce Lee.

"predictable, but the troll was good","Saw this movie because my daughter wanted to. I like the two lead characters but from the moment the movie started I knew where it was going. The story is dull and predictable with more profanity than I think would have been the case for the period. Some wisecracking is okay but really, this is modern dialog in a setting of 15th century. Everything in this movie is over the top from the witches to the weapons used by Hansel and Gretel; with a little too modern science thrown in. This movie stole from so many other more successful films that weren't even in the same genre. I guessed most of the story before the ending. All of the actors did the best they could with this mess.

But please do we really need the ""F"" word thrown around so much? Sometimes it seems as if its forced. Does it help the line in any way?

The mayor brings in Hansel & Gretel to battle the witches and save the kids.This is super violent, ultra-unrealistic, banging action movie. It's a blood splattering good time if you're so inclined. Renner and Arterton are mostly playing it for serious. This is possibly the major missing piece. It needs comedy to put it over the top. The action is ridiculous already.

Sibling Assassins,"Greetings again from the darkness. The movie begins with a tip of the cap to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale and then spins off into what would be just another episode of TV's ""Once Upon a Time"", were it a cable rather than a network show.The original fairy tale is a nightmare for most kids (probably explains why it's one of my favorites). Hansel and Gretel are deserted in the forest by their parents, and end up at a scrumptious house of candy owned by a witch who eats children. The movie puts an interesting spin on why the parents got rid of the kids, but mostly this story begins after Hansel and Gretel outsmart the candy house witch. This leads them into a joint career of bounty-hunting for witches.Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, The Avengers) plays Hansel and Gemma Arterton (Tamara Drewe, Bond Girl in Casino Royale) plays Gretel. They have some pretty nifty weapons given that it's the middle ages. Mostly they take turns getting the stuffing kicked out of them by witches and jealous sheriffs.There is a good witch and bad witch element as well as a discovery of their childhood roots. That said, the plot and story are secondary thanks to writer/director Tommy Wickola who seems to find the most joy in exploding witch heads and bodies. The 3D seems pretty sloppy and forced with no added benefit. A couple of humorous additions involve Hansel's struggle with diabetes (thanks to the candy house), the missing kid notices on milk bottles, and the multi-dimensional troll Edward ... he's no Shrek, but it doesn't take much personality to stand out here.Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are listed as producers and that explains the attempts at humor throughout. It's too bad the overkill on gore and profanity prevent this from being an intelligent spin off from one of the best ever fairy tales.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Wenches, Witches & Splatter Deee-Luxe!","OK then, I just finished Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Fun film! Famke Janssen...sheesh! She did a lot of damage in that X-Men flick, but here, she's deliciously wicked and flat-out vicious as hell. I like this film because it doesn't take itself too seriously, the effects are top shelf and the overall pacing is well executed. The action sequences are nothing shy of a maniacal romp, very energetic and engaging. Them broads are hell on a broomstick! Make no mistake about it, this is not a children's movie and for some, the splatter violence may be a little over-the-top, but nonetheless lends very well to the story and those that dig splattery horror will appreciate the wet stuff here. I thought before I saw the film the casting of Jeremy Renner might be somewhat of a quirky choice. I see him as more of a dramatic actor, as anyone who's seen Dahmer or Hurt Locker might testify. He has strength in that area. So hat's off to that guy for a decent Hansel in this film. Derek Mears (Friday the 13th re-boot) has an interesting and mildly dynamic character role. I won't reveal any of the film, but I can tell you this - you will not recognize Mears. This is a target audience, formulated adventure. There is nothing new here. On the same coin, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The title is Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters - and that's exactly what you get. Recommended for a fun, non-serious romp.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not meant to be an Oscar contender or even a summer blockbuster movie; it's a fun parody of an old tale.Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner are pretty great to watch too as they get their butts kicked all over the place, which I really appreciate as most leads only get a few hits and then appear completely fine the next shot. Not so here. When Gretel gets beat, she gets hit hard and bears the wounds for several scenes.So if you want to watch something fun and bloody, this is a great movie to just sit down and have a good time with.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cheesy but fun to watch,"Writer-director Tommy Wirkola hit the nail on the head with this sequel to the original fairytale, armed with some awesome weapons, this violent spin was amusing to watch. 15 years after their ordeal as children where Hansel and Gretal burned the witch in the fire, they have turned into kick-ass witch murderers saving young children from ruthless witches.The film shows us exactly what it promises an absurd horror where many witches are slaughtered, they are burned, punched and shot. Gemma Arterton plays the tempestuous Gretal who's mixture of precision fighting and use of weaponry excites the watcher especially any young men that like watching a fiery young women abolish evil witches. Jeremy Renner plays the distant but alluring Hansel, different from his sister he keeps his distance from people as much as he can. Apart from a scene were he skinny dips with a white witch, this could be classed as a bit of eye candy for any women watching.Besides all the blood and gore there are some heartfelt moments, however I think this is mainly to slow down the accelerated pace of the brawling scenes. The film also has a comic edge to it with its cheesy one liners, I also personally like the first scene were we are properly introduced to Gretal. The sheriff of the town is about to burn an innocent women at the stake accusing her of witchcraft, but when Hansel and Gretal tell him she's not a witch he starts to become brash so Gretal headbutts him.The film also lives up to its creepy classification because the witches are vile and grotesque but brilliant. The main witch played by Famke Janssen is black-hearted, dark and mysterious, she plays the character really well. This film is definitely not like the original fairytale as it's not for children because the witches are scary, their special effects are fantastic.The only criticism I have of the film is that its very predictable, it is obvious what is going to happen but still worth watching. From the end of the film, I get the impression a sequel may arise in the future, so we will see. I will definitely be watching!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Was it that there was really terrible acting, or was the screenplay just too awful for the actors to do anything with it? Even the kitchy make- up was a total face.

"I Wanted This Movie To Be Good, But...","It was a Friday night and rain drenched the entire city, making it a perfect night to snuggle on the couch with wine and popcorn and watch a creepy, fun, witch-hunting kind of movie. If only...Despite a solid cast, the special effects were atrocious. (Hint: You're not supposed to tell they're acting in front of a green screen anymore, are you?) When watching an 80's movie, sure, there is some room for forgiveness; but in 2013, there is simply no excuse. And the giant troll-type thing named Edward, though lovable, looked like he just jumped out of The Labrynth or The Dark Crystal (note: another 80's reference). And I swear there was some strange sexual tension between the brother-sister team of Hansel & Gretel. Not sure if dialogue was to blame, or if Renner and his co-star actually had sexual tension, but either way, it was creepy.On a positive note, Hubby enjoyed this flick a little more than I did.

De-Witched and Bothered,"This film is not recommended.Once upon a time there was a film reviewer who hoped beyond hope that every new movie season would be filled with products that highlighted creativity and had some semblance of class. January would begin and he would hunt everywhere and every week for any film that brought with it a feeling of elation and worth rather than a nagging sensation of despair and dread. But, alas, he would have to wait until September or October before movie theaters would be showing award-worthy efforts. Sadly, there was no happily-ever-after until fall arrived.Which brings us to the first official film of 2013, a small turd of a film stinking up theaters this month entitled Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters.There is no doubt that Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters would be wholeheartedly endorsed by Mr. LaPierre and his rowdy bunch at the NRA. Every villager has a right to bear arms, be they pitchforks, torches, or semiautomatic artillery in this formulaic movie. Most of the film's imagination seems to be aimed at the film's anachronistic state-of-the-art arsenal of weaponry with its super non-loading cross-bows and stylized guns a-blazing. These firearms would rival anything found in today's gun shows and make any proud gun-toter green with envy. It's shoot-em-up time! Let the blood spurt and the body count begin! God bless that Second Amendment!Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters wants moviegoers to believe that it is hip and clever in its revisionist spin of this classic children's tale. ( Okay, granted it's a nice touch with the missing children labels on the milk bottles! ) The look of the film is 13th century chic with its medieval themed village and appropriately dressed town-folk inappropriately mixing with today's gangsta vibe. After all, there are witches everywhere in this small generic Octoberfest of a town. Children have gone missing and the mayor has hired two bounty hunters by the name of Hansel and Gretel to clean-up this mess.Hansel is played by leading man Jeremy Renner, who is slumming here and misusing his talents, and the questionably talented Gemma Arterton, who hasn't made a good film since she played Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace, and that seems like forever, is Gretel. The actors offer bland facsimiles of their strictly cardboard stock characters and do not remotely show any dimensions, but this leather clad brother and sister duo are dressed to kill in style. Renner plays him character with tough guy dim-wittedness and Arterton is a tough cookie with a potty mouth and more cahones that her sibling. Famke Janssen plays the evil witch Muriel and, at least, brings some real menace to her role.With its mercilessly short running time of 88 minutes, director Tommy Wirkola keeps the story moving, but doesn't know how to establish characters or skillfully show off the well staged stunts. The camera remains too close to its actors and the kinetic editing and its onslaught of flash-cuts and CGI upstages all of the action. It's hard to watch all of the witch hunting when you're wondering which is hunting who.Legend has it that there are good witches and bad witches, although the bad usually outnumber the good 666 to 1. Legend also has it that movies of this ilk outnumber the good in about the same ratio whenever the new movie season begins in January. Unfortunately, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters upholds this sorry tradition. GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Words like ""awesome,"" being used by teenagers in a world of ancient theme when blood flashes over their faces is something, no serious movie-goer would appreciate. Yet, the makers rejoice in their own mistakes. The lead sister-brother pair, who never seem to exhaust in stamina or strength, find themselves saving a village's ass from witches. Of course, dim- witted witches.Superhero movies with such vague plots & screenplay are mounting up in mainstream Hollywood. They lack everything to be even considered. Waste of talent (Hans Zimmer) & money & time. I don't want a sequel.Women in here love to wobble their chests and reveal their cleavages (or is it their dresses?), while their men succeed acting brainlessly. With a hard try of bringing emotions into the already worn-down plot they end up referencing King Kong; I rate it a merciless 2.4/10.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended. Even if you are a fan of Gemma Arterton, better Google her photos.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Thank you Mr. Wirkola!,"When I first saw the trailer I thought: Wow, this could be fun. And it was... The movie keeps the promises made by the trailer. There's action, cool lines, a killer-cast and (surprise, surprise) strong violence. This is why it works:1. The cast. 2 strong female leads (Janssen & Arterton) who were totally believable in their roles. Renner as the cutest tough-guy actor Hollywood has to offer at the moment. And Stormare who is always a nice addition to the cast.2. The story. Straightforward, simple and uncompromising. (I don't need clever plot twists all the time. Sometimes I just wanna be entertained.)This movie reminded me of Deep Rising. It was the same kind of ""this-is-our-story-deal-with-it"" movie.3. The Action. I loved that the movie wasn't softened all the way down to PG-13. The action is fierce and absolutely fun to watch.This is it. I've got nothing to criticize about the movie.Just one thing: I find it hilarious when people watch the movie and then complain about the distorted portrayal of witches. (One reviewer seemed to be pretty angry about that.) You people amuse me! That's what trailers are for! The trailer made it absolutely clear, what the movie was going to be like. So, if it's not for you... avoid it. But please don't rant about how bad the movie was when it's your own fault you went to see it in the first place!In other words: You don't like chocolate? Then don't buy the chocolate cake!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Witch Hunters And Entertainment Providers,"If 'Hollywood' is going to insist on repeatedly revisiting the same characters and stories (as they apparently have forgotten how to create something new) then at least add a twist.Thankfully this is what has happened here with Witch Hunters.What would have happened to H & G as adults?

Stunning Gemma Arterton....,"Actually this film deserve about 7, if not for Gemma Arterton. She is fun to watch, not a bad actress too. Beautiful and deadly. For Jeremy Renner, he delivers his usual great performance. The chemistry between the two characters is good but I think it could be explored more. They were convincingly enough to be a great witch hunter. Now about the movie, the storyline is pretty usual. But the approach is quite different. It was darker and more real. Of course there are plot holes but they can be ignored. The witches are frighteningly real. The actions are bloody and fun to watch. I watch this film in 2D Cinema, but I think it will look better in 3D. A lot of scenes were made with 3D in mind. So I recommend to watch this film in 3D. All in all, this film is worth your money.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lacking of entertainment,"Having no knowledge of the original material of Hansel and Gretal, but seeing as this film was quite a box office success, had some expectations. And this film is worse than expected. The story isn't interesting, the action is quite bland and generic and overall the film is quite boring. The acting and visuals are standard but besides that nothing grabbed the attention.It's given an R rating but even so, there is no suspense or tension. Everything is quite silly and far predictable.Do not understand the many 9 and 10 star reviews on IMDB, as Witch Hunters isn't nearly as good as those reviews are claiming.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Rated R Movie for Kids,"It's the classic Hansel & Gretel all grown up and hunting witches, allegedly.The concept could be interesting but nothing comes of it as Hansel & Gretel come off as incompetent in every scenario they're put in, you'd wonder whether they'd ever met a witch before. In the film, there is little intrigue, obvious twists, bland dialogue, and nothing characters BUT there's blood so I guess that makes it good? The only thing going for it is the action but there is little of it and any good gore effects are balanced out by noticeable CGI. There isn't any tension as the main characters never feel in danger, actually coming off as super-human with the amount of injury one of them sustains. I guess it's played for slapstick but it makes the whole movie feel more childish. I think the movie might actually be made for kids who don't have strict parents as it's not particularly violent, with all the death being over-the-top and stylized, and the most explicit content being an implied sexual assault which kids might not pick up on. The less than 90 minute runtime can keep their attention before they get too bored or yours before you lose all patience.Honestly, I would recommend this movie to your kids if you don't mind them seeing some bloody violence and a naked woman for 3 seconds. Or watch it yourself for some okay but sparse gore and a boring take on an entertaining concept.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Apparently it has a bit of a cult status.......,"Fairy tales are never usually this gory and yet also so sickly to look at design wise, it looks like an outdoor set made of well not very nice designs. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fantasy horror movie directed and written by Norwegian Tommy Wirkola who is probably before this best known for Zombie film ""Dead Snow"" but really doesn't do too much at all to make this original, well done or even that fun. I'm sure some people have watched this and felt it to be not serious, just a little escapism, which is fine of course but I just felt personally it was not well written, not very well directed and it just felt too much of a bad movie to be even okay.Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton lead the cast as the two sibling witch hunters whose experience in the beginning of the film leads them to just want to destroy all witches. They play their roles well but to be fair do nothing to save them from being generic characters in a pretty basic story film, It's not really the case with this that the acting hurts it. Oh but wait, maybe it is the acting (not the main two cast members) because some of those witches, I could not stand it, it seriously felt like acting done in some kind of over the top film that even this movie doesn't feel like. I'm not quite sure why Famke Janssen appears in this movie, it is really not her best role to be fair and I just couldn't bare what goes on with her character for much longer in this.Hey I mean this movie is really neither horrific nor reaching the heights of being just an average old film, it's just bad but not in a way where it feels unwatchable. The film tries to weave itself the nicest of crazy stories and does honestly try with the stunts and such, but in the end it just feels too rushed and just not well made enough. As for the violence involved well for me it is used for comedic effect of course, the movie apparently doesn't take itself seriously when blatantly (or by accident) it does. Wirkola creates something that is not quite a gore-fest but leaves a bloody mess at certain times; this one isn't exactly for the kids to be honest. I almost forgot, the script, Wirkola's writing creates this kind of comedic world where I'm supposed to laugh at every f-word the characters use, but seriously the script is not that great and the actual story that Wirkola creates is nothing short of predictable.So really Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a film that should really have been OK, if it had anything original to say that is. It took a bit of a mauling from the critics when it first appeared but since then has gained a cult following, I even watched this thinking ""Maybe I will kind of like this"", I didn't as you can see. It has the right feel to it, even the start of the film I thought to myself maybe this will be some good old fun and 88 minutes where I can experience some decent fighting and a story to boot but really it squanders that opportunity towards its ending where it just doesn't even try and yet again it looks, well yet again not very nice.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bodies, and lots of them, being tossed into and through hard solid objects! Hard objects, and lots of them, shattering, splitting, disintegrating, and generally falling apart when human bodies get thrown through them! Ridiculous make-up effects! Fights! And all of these sights so repetitively done that they stop being interesting as redundant scenery on your train ride to Stupidville. Oh, but you'd still better watch because you'll be rewarded by getting to see a big rubber troll!

This is a greatly unappreciated film. I loved it.,"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. I love to review a film this good and this unappreciated. The mood is very similar to Sleepy Hollow. It's dark and woodsy and beautiful in a scary way. Children are missing and witches are suspected. The film is smart enough to poke fun at itself, but serious enough to scare the hell out of you. The witches are ugly, powerful, intelligent, merciless, and dark. The film is a gem in its cinematography, casting, cast, acting, and story. I was expecting less and got a lot more for my money. Don't believe any negative reviews. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton star in this film that's definitely NOT for children.

Worth seeing it at the theaters just because of the 3D and that is about it,"This is one of those movies that probably should have been a straight to DVD movie but since it has a well known actor or actress with a bit more budget so makes it into theaters. If you seen the trailer you know exactly which direction it's going to go and can predict just about everything that is going to happen. And if your a movie buff that has seen these types of movies before can guess and be right about it. There is few subplot characters that doesn't really add much to the story at all. Except one for one violent scene and the other for a sexy nude scene. But I guess that somewhat adds to something to a movie like this but very very slightly. There is quite a bit of 3D in this movie where things fly at the audiences and stuff which might be the only reason to see this movie in the theaters. Some reviewers and critics seem to compare this to ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" but seemed more like ""Van Helsing"" with Hugh Jackman. It's alright seeing it once but nothing really stands out about this movie including the action. I give it a 4 though since it rips off of one of Terry Gilliam's film ""The Brothers Grimm"" too much.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tedious, Tiresome","Having survived a Witch's prison when they were children, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) become Witch Hunters as adults. In turn, they hire themselves out to towns where children have been abducted by Witches, who need the children to perform a blood-moon ceremony that will ultimately keep Witches safe from fire.There is something wrong with Hollywood when it thinks it knows that we all out here want to see Horror movies with Zombies, Vampires, and now Witches who want to do one thing: kill, kill , kill with blood spurting every which way, heads exploding and being lopped off. Yes, the CGI and special stunts are very good. It's the killings that are becoming tedious, tiresome and, yes: unhealthy. There are just too many of these types of stories and there doesn't seem to be any slowing down of them. They just go on and on and on..When the killing action sequences go on forever, I tend to go to La La Land, sleep for a half hour, wake up and see that the killing action is still going on; and the process repeats when the next killing sequence comes around and they come around rather quickly. So if all you want to see are these killing action scenes, then this is for you. As for me, I am out.So what's next? The Three Little Pigs as Hit men? (3/10)Violence: Yes.

'Hansel & Gretel' is half-baked,"With its sprinkle of Burton and dash of Raimi, 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' could've been dumb fun, only it isn't. That's because the whole film feels like a rough draft. A first rehearsal. The cast are all game, and there are some clever ideas and good decisions—the best being its use of practical F/X. But its all under-thought. Its primary assets are its brevity and the lovely ladies of its cast, but that does not a good film make... unless we're talking about ""Adult"" cinema.With just a bit more effort, 'Hansel & Gretel' might've been a modern day 'Army of Darkness'.

Predictable and cheesy,"I actually only seen some previews a long while ago, and finally decided to watch it (June 2014) because it was on my ""to watch"" list. Oh! Was I disappointed! I actually had to force myself not to turn it off.I imagined a film in some kind of ""Sleepy Hollow"", or ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", or even ""Stardust"". Well, not quite. Instead, it is more like a ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""; the heroes feel out of place, even incoherent with their background, and the witches (there is no spoiler here, it is a witch hunting movie after all) are stereotyped and very much frustrating to watch. If you loved the series ""Heroes"", then you might not understand what I'm talking about. Otherwise, the main characters are like the main characters in ""Heroes; kind of whiny, dull and childish; predictable and shallow.The story does not let the viewer discover any intrigue, instead it lays out so many clues that once the plots are revealed, there is nothing to learn from the movie any more (and this point happens about 45 minutes before the movie actually ends). Worse! Most of the events are so coincidental that it was impossible for me to immerse myself in the story; I never saw any real threat to the main characters. Without revealing any plot, the main idea behind the story is not so much original, too, if you have seen a few movies before this one.As for the acting, imagine living in the 15th century, chasing witches with other farmers and townspeople, to see these punks swearing (i.e. f work) and coming about carrying 20th century weapons. Then, chasing witches a la marvel style; being tossed around in ways that it would kill any normal human beings, or at least injure then very badly, etc.Alright, but I did give it 3 out of 10. Apart from the childish movie intro, this movie is NOT for kids. There is gore and people dying... added some partial nudity and pretty scary faces for children to see. This is not a Disney movie and aims more at teenagers. And, despite my remarks on the main characters, they are not as annoying as all the other movies aimed at teens (i.e. Twilight, The Green Lantern, etc.), as the actors are slightly more mature and, thus, do not act like spoiled teen brats.A movie to watch if nothing else more interesting.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mixed opinions,"I saw this on a Sunday afternoon with a group of mates. To be honest, I was expecting a piece of crap movie. You know the type, full of trite dialogue, bad acting and copious amounts of special effects. In a way, I was right; this was an accurate way of viewing the movie: The acting was quite bad, despite the fact that some B-grade actors of moderate note starred, the dialogue was riddled with awful one-liners and the special effects were incredibly gory. However, in viewing the movie in that way, I have sort of missed the point. This movie was, despite its conventional flaws, was enjoyable. The special effects were very good, and in a way, this film was exactly what I wanted to see on Sunday afternoon; a light, enjoyable movie. If you are a film school student who views every film as a sort of analytical algorithm, then I doubt you will enjoy this film.

"If you are looking for some cool action scenes , you might dare to see otherwise skip at any cost","Adapting a classic fairy tale into action, witch-killing which is gore and bloody is certainly absurd and Hansel&Gretel follows the path.Deserted by their parents in the dark jungle , Hansel & Gretel grew up to become witch-hunters monitor and kill witch all over the world. They face new challenge of an evil who they must kill before blue moon approaches and reveal their past.Directed by Tommy Wirkola and based on popular children fairy tale , Hansel & Gretel:Witch Hunters is a classic example of destroying the essence and theme of story and introducing vulgarism , blood, nudity. It is completely different from what you must have read in your childhood and I would recommend kids to stay away from the film. The new plot is more of using the latest equipment to hunt down the witches and you will see couple of good action scenes choreographed well. The direction is terrible with story going no where and screenplay becomes sluggish at one point. The dialogues are funny. The art direction and cinematography is outstanding. There is no performance to remember in this film. Jeremy Runner , Gemma Atherton and Famke Janseen leads the star cast and are just about OK in this average film.Overall , I did not like Hansel & Gretal: Witch Hunters.

An unnecessary tale to be told,"Before watching 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters', I had already known that this movie got horrible reviews from critics, but I still curious and watched it on DVD few hours ago. To be honest, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' is really that bad, no wonder the movie fails and got extremely nasty reviews. There are a lot of foolish scenes and plot holes like, how could human easily chase witch that using a broom and could run so fast, at early scene it showed how great Muriel (Famke Janssen)was but she suddenly got weak at the end with no reason, doesn't she with her power just disappear and kill Hansel easily? Every time Hansel or Gretel had been on crisis situation, they awkwardly had a back up to help them which is so coincidence.The storyline itself is predictable and boring, the 88 minutes length felt so long and made me wanna finish it as quick as possible. Luckily I didn't see it at cinema when it came out last January. The visual effect is also standard and the make-up for the witch is ridiculous. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton didn't act bad actually, they were just choosing wrong movie this time.

A very nice surprise...,"HANSEL AND GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERSI was fully expecting this to be a disappointment just like Red Riding Hood but I could not have been more surprised. This was such a great film I loved it!Hansel & Gretel kick some serious butt in the movie.The film had such a strong start, that I thought that it was going to be one of those films that has a strong start to get you hooked and then slow down and be a bit dull throughout but it was full on action through most of the movie. And even when it was not fighting scenes and magic, it was a good story too.The characters were amazing I actually grew to like Hansel & Gretel their relationship was so strong as brother and sister that you could see they were there for each other all the way through (mostly).Also, there was a fantastic character named Edward. He was a huge ogre that was being controlled by witches.He was such an awesome character.One of the things I really liked about this movie is it looked like there was not much CGI it felt like a classic old movie because of the effects they used but it was not a bad attempt at the effects. Everything looked great.Edward, for instance, looked like he was made of animatronics.The magic was obviously CGI, but looked really good also.The acting was really good the movie stars Jeremy Renner as Hansel and Gemma Arterton as Gretel.Famke Janssen played the lead witch Muriel.Everyone in the movie did a great job.Hansel & Gretel might be a fairy tale, but whatever you do, don't let your kids watch this.It is really adult orientated. The language is full on there are a lot of obscenities and even some nudity also the violence it gory. There is a lot of blood. I loved the way some of the people died in this film it felt like a great horror film.I will give this film 8 out of 10.A great surprise and I can't wait to see it again.For more movie reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What a mess!,"Before I watched it, reading the title I knew it wasn't going to be a good movie, but hey, I like some b-movies from time to time, particularly on hot summer nights, so I gave it a chance. I have to confess I was under warning, I had watched ""Dead Snow"" and, despite the fact of being a Norwegian film, which it seems to give some points to people for their reviews, I didn't enjoy it. But, as I've already said, B-movies with crazy plot may be welcomeor not.Let's get into the movie. The intro: After a thousand stereotyped production for this kind of works (pseudo-gothic American way adaptation form an European, mostly, tale) I must say it wasn't bad, though it's ruined by the last line which I don't want to remember. Also, seeing MTV as producer it's a very bad sign telling us this won't improve. Plot: Absurd, but I repeat, this is b-movie, no one would search logic here. But makers could have avoid anachronism which could embarrassed even apes. Kung-fu witches, ""Wild Wild West"" style weapons, annoying kid friend, Hansel and Gretel as the center of witchcraft, chosen heroes not by working class (sorry John).Casting: It has bothered me, particularly Stormare's character which is totally out of place. Janssen as karate diva is too weird, doesn't work for me. Renner is too old for being the same age brother of Arterton, hot as hell with her leather catsuit, by the way, there is no chemistry between them, even there is more between Gretel and the Giant, most funny and interesting character of all.In short, the director has gotten a bigger budget to develop all the stupid action set-pieces, for example coven's shooting, something to be ashamed.

This movie outclassed it in every aspect except scenic cinematography.The story line makes sense, there are no look ends hanging, the characters are enjoyable with no sense of being contrived. Events are foreshadowed amazingly well and for once Hollywood has turned out a movie that doesn't feel like they cut chunks out to make the movie shorter.If you like the genre, here is all you need to know. Cool guns, great fights, excellent witches, explosions and of course people getting squished by... Well... You will find out.Go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
WE KILL WITCHES,"2,7
The good thing about this film are: the design of the clothes and weapons, the violence and the gory, and, and ...
Just that
The plot is horrible, it has nothing original or captivating, It looks like a copy of Van Helsing, only worse. The villain in the film has no story, just a cliche motivation just like every villain. It is not possible to differentiate between hansel and gretel if they change bodies, because they are insipid.
This film has no emotion because the characters have no personality, they boil down to this: Bruh I kill witches, Bruh ma sista kill Witche, we kill witches, you still don't understand? WE KILL WITCHES! i, kil, wites, bruh AAAAAAHHH! i just kill witches (crying noises)",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unbeliavable stupid film!,"I watched because I hoped for something at least half way good. Well, you can't always get what you want.Plot twisted, actors bad choice, people likes only because that dude plays Hansel.Bad performance, lack of atmosphere, absolutely nothing together with the original story, just another try to make money from something old and forgotten.Unneeded slaughter and guts all around, still not convincing to make me watch with interest. Cheap decors, too much effects, not enough idea behind all this. But what do I know, today kids are in love with sparkling vampires and stories out of context.

Thoroughly surprised,"I have to admit that this movie shocked me, I was not prepared for some of the graphic scenes that you could tell were made for 3D. My boyfriend and I loved this movie. The make-up and graphics were incredible, I might be biased since I love the TV show Face-off but it truly was neat. Some of the characters they had were inventive. The story was an interesting take and I was actually unable to understand the full plot of the movie until 2/3rds through unlike most movies that come out now-a-days. I am unable to watch 3D movies due to my glasses but I have to say, I still loved the movie. Thank you for great date night and for actually making me jump in my seat!For parents, I am one, I would not bring your child who is under 13 to the movie because there are some graphic scenes. I know my 11 year old would have nightmares for a couple of days and then be okay, but we love scary movies in our home.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just Terrible,"Red Riding Hood was probably one of the worst films ever...and, it was so bad that it was actually fun to make fun of it simply because it was trying to be serious and didn't realize how ridiculous it was. Where this film was just predictable and dumb, attempting to be clever and funny but failing at both, and so utterly unbelievable it became a pointless effort of this film even existing. You truly begin to wonder ""Who actually gave this writer/director money to make this rotten diaper heap?"" It's a completely modern story with the ""look"" of a fairy tale world...and that's it. There is absolutely nothing else to ground it in the fairy tale world other than the costumes, scenery, and the title. Marrying the two worlds is not only ridiculous, off-putting, but a total disaster. Hansel and Gretel might as well be walking around today's streets of New York hunting witches because they talk and act modern, they use weapons that weren't even around for over 100 years later, and Gretel's father...excuse me, I mean brother, is the same age when they're children but when they grow up he's easily 15-20 years older than her. Seriously, you have a man in his 40s running around pretending he's some 25-yr-old guy. Literally, this film will stoop to any level of complete ridiculous and disbelief. And if the director put so little thought or care into creating this world, why should we care? I never thought this movie would be good because even the trailer looked terrible and ridiculous, but since it was free on Netflix I thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt that it might actually be some fun action movie. Wrong. The movie is just as terrible as the trailer except for the fact that it drags out these pointless, predictable scenes that make it even worse than the trailer. This is literally one of those terrible, late night films you see on Sy-Fy channel that somehow managed to get a $50,000,000 budget instead of $3,000,000. You really have to wonder who the director had to sleep with to get Jeremy Renner and a major release for this crap. Red Riding Hood was actually better because at least we had a good time making fun of that movie where I couldn't even sit through more than 20 minutes of this, and even that was pushing it. I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes, but I again, gave it the benefit of the doubt it didn't deserve.Anyone who gave this a 9 or 10 star is making money off of this film in some way (or trying to), 'cause this isn't even good brainless fun, it's just so poorly written there is literally nothing to it other than Jeremy Renner and his ""sister"" attempting to be funny and tough on occasions. And their whole story is their parents put them in the woods one night, left them, and then they stumbled upon the witch, and they never found their parents again? Why? Were they a sacrifice to the witch and the parents left? Obviously, the writer/director didn't know either and just needed to find a way to dump them in the woods and make them orphans. Also, were there actually newspapers back then? I'm pretty sure printing was very limited back then and only for the wealthy. Not to mention, I don't think many people from that time period were even literate. I'm pretty sure if you check the writer/director's IQ it's dangling around 95, 'cause even if he wrote this crap in 3 nights you would think he could still come up with some better explanations for what he did in this script.This film is literally as bad as that crap heap Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Solomon, who is another director you seriously had to wonder what producer was dumb enough to give him a budget. If you want to watch dumb fun, just watch Evil Dead again or find something better. This film is a complete waste of anyone's time.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great and Entertaining mindless action flick,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Hanzel and Gretal. The Special Effects were fantastic, the acting was better than most of the genre, and the story tied together nicely. Yes, a certain amount of disbelief is required to be suspended, and this is not a factual period piece! No, this will never be considered as an Oscar contender, but it was never attempting to be. This is a perfect example of an adult Saturday afternoon popcorn flick, not an cynical introspective on current social issues! If you want to be critical of every aspect of every movie you see, then this one is not for you. But, if you enjoy a good flick for the sake of entertainment value, then this is an excellent choice!!! WARNING: THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

A fun ride!!! 2D version.,"Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters is a campy twist to the children's fairy tale. It is very much like 2004's Van Helsing. Except Hansel and Gretel is more violent, bloody (and nudity) and about a half dozen F-Bombs peppered into the film. The film was very enjoyable for me as I like a good B movie. And that is exactly what this is. The chemistry between Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton was excellent making them believable as a brother and sister looking out for one and other. The big bad was deliciously played by Famke Janssen who has played a villain well in past films (Golden Eye & X-men: Last Stand). The witches' movement and combat will certainly remind you of The Army of Darkness with Bruce Campbell. So, the best way I can sum this up is that this is indeed a popcorn movie with a few ""oh yes!"" moments. Don't take it seriously, because they obviously don't intend you to. This is not a children's movie and I strongly recommend they not see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another ruined fairytale,"""Me and my sister... we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch. But that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood. Witch blood. And we haven't stopped since.""Hansel & Gretel is yet another classic fairytale that has been brought to the big screen in an atrocious manner. This new wave of dark fairy tales have been a complete disappointment for me considering I really didn't like Snow White or the Jack the Giant Slayer films either. Despite consisting of a talented cast and a well known story, these movies seem to lack any character development whatsoever and these well known Hollywood actors can't do anything to save them from being a complete failure. The problem may lie on the screenplay considering they take such classic and familiar stories and present ridiculous twists while trying to be much darker. Even when these films try to be funny, the comedy doesn't work either; and despite having some extremely nice visuals the set pieces aren't enough to draw us in and make us care for the characters. Hansel & Gretel is basically one action sequence after another with lots of blood and without any buildup for us to identify with any of the characters. Despite being such well known actors, these characters failed to attract me, and even the villain in this film (played by Famke Janssen) is poorly developed. The movie is less than 90 minutes long, and the action sequences take up almost the entirety of the film making this just a boring and tedious experiment where we see one character who we never really know get his head blown off. The film is directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola following the success of his 2009 local horror film, Dead Snow, involving Nazi zombie soldiers. He was also responsible for the screenplay as well. There is not much positive things I could say about this film, except that I really like the two lead actors and am a little disappointed they chose to play these characters.The story introduces us to Hansel and Gretel as kids escaping from the candy house after the witch had imprisoned them. Everything from that point on is a reinvention of the fairytale by Wirkola. The two siblings grow up to become witch hunters after their horrific experience. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) travel from town to town collecting bounty fees for killing off the evil witches nearby. At the moment, the Mayor (Rainer Bock) of a small village recruits the siblings' service after 11 children have gone missing. The Sheriff (Peter Stormare) isn't too pleased with the arrival of these two siblings considering they made him look bad in front of the entire town after saving a local village woman named Mina (Pihla Vitala) who he believed to be a witch and wanted to burn her at the stake. The two witch hunters begin to investigate the disappearances of the children and realize that a dangerous witch named Muriel (Famke Janssen) is behind the kidnappings. With the help of a local boy named Ben (Thomas Mann) and Edward the troll (Robin Atkins Downes) they face off against Muriel and her covenant of witches.There is really no need for me to continue on blabbing about how much I disliked this film. There is nothing going on here plot wise. These fairy tales haven't crossed over too well to the big screen and I'm afraid they might be ruining all these childhood stories I enjoyed reading about. Having seen all these classic fairy tales turned into movies I have to admit that Shyamalan's The Lady in the Water is becoming more and more valuable to me. This genre has resulted rather difficult for me to enjoy, but somehow Lady in the Water which plays out like a fairytale worked a lot better than these films. Shyamalan might be criticized by many people, but he knows how to make movies better than your average director. He has failed recently in his last two big film adaptations (After Earth and The Last Airbender), but he has made so many great films in the past and Lady in the Water is turning into a masterpiece if you compare it to these recent fairytale adaptations that have come out. Hansel & Gretel may just be the worst one in this genre and it is a shame because I really like Jeremy Renner and believe he has made some incredible films. I also like Gemma Arterton, who I loved as a James Bond girl, and despite looking very good here, her talent is wasted in this senseless action film. This is one of the worst films of 2013.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

A better TV pilot than Hollywood movie,"It is very hard to like this film but somehow is garners enough good will that I can't dislike it.The Good: The cast are good. Both Jeremy Renner and Gemma Aterton know what this film is and seem to be having fun with it. The tone is fun and frantic not wanting to give you time to think to hard about what is going on or why. The violence is cartoonish and over the top, as the are ridiculous weapons (which do look like left overs from Hugh Jackman's Van Halsing).I would also like draw attention to the marvelous practical effects used for Edward the Troll. These effects are wonderful to see and hark back to some of the best practical effects committed in children's cinema, such as ""The never ending Story"" or ""The Dark Crystal"". more about the effect in the bad section.The bad: This never feels like a film that anyone in charge had any faith in. If you want to pull of a convincing fantasy world on screen I believe that the best way to do it is to go all out. through out the film I couldn't shake the feeling that they had wanted to go further but were being pulled back by the studio.Much of the CGI is used to polish up the practical effects and work well but when the film relies on them, for gore or the magic it looks very cheap.Overall: I would recommend giving this film a go and enjoy the fun and practical effects, but don't expect too much. The film feels more like an expensive TV show pilot than a Hollywood film. The need to expand the universe as a TV series is confirmed by the early closing credits scene.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"They made an R rated fairytale, but they forgot to make it real and thrilling. Bummer.","Okay, fun idea, to make an R-rated fairytale for grownups. BUT....The bad: especially the MANY fighting scenes against the witches are LAUGHABLY STUPID. I mean, perhaps kids could believe in such ridiculous plot turns, but grownups definitely will NOT.The story is about Hansel and Gretel who are witchhunters. THE ENTIRE movie is one long big chase and fight against 3 witches.Beware: STUPIDITY AHEAD! Why? Because EVERY single time Jeremy Renner fights a witch, and when he finally has floored the witch and she is knockout (but not dead yet), he just goes picking his nose or doing something else, like turning his back on the witch.He could have simply killed the witch after he had floored her, but he does NOT. THIS IS LAUGHABLE. The witch (what a surprise!) gets up again and woops Jeremy Renner's butt. And then the witch flees and he has to fight the same witch again, with the exact same stupid fighting spirit of picking his nose when he has floored (but not killed) the witch. Copy. Repeat.I especially mention this example, because the entire movie is about fighting these witches and EVERY fighting scene is not credible, laughable, stupid and plain silly. And this is suppose to be a fairytale for grownups?More bad: there is lots of cheap violence, but the violence is just window dressing, covering up a movie without ANY interesting plot or characters.What a FLOP.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Delivering little to none pleasure, even the guilty one. Okay, maybe the guilty one.","Yes, Jeremy Renner can make crappy movie too. But if you come because Gemma Artenton's cleavage, as in the poster suggests, the movie will keep you quite entertained. The most notable flaw is the uncertain direction it's supposed to take, frankly it's hinged between tasteless horror action or misguided parody like a broom between a witch's crack, and neither is done that well. Also, the concept of gritty version of fairy tale characters as mercenaries is a blatant excuse of luring audiences hooked on fantasy theme, but ultimately ends up delivering little to none pleasure, even the guilty one. Okay, maybe the guilty one.Hansel and Gretel are big kids now, traumatized and vengeful towards witches' prowl. They take arms in spite and exude pain to all the witch they greet. In a twisted of fate they run across a town in need of help, many of the children have been kidnapped. If you've seen the beginning of Van Helsing, you'll get the idea, they share about the same outfit and weapons too.I saw it in 3D and while I knew the commitment this type of movies has for throwing stuff to your face, but I still stunned to see it here, as if the movie goes to a terrible length to hurl splinters, debris, and chunks of meat into the sanctity of your eyes. If there were a category in cinema awards for ""Most Stuff Thrown Effectively to Audience"", this will be a serious contender.The actors do some adequate performance, Jeremy Renner is a solid lead, he's charismatic and brings some humor. Famke Jensen is decent as the villain, Muriel, she has a cold air about her and it fits as a demotion from Phoenix role. However, the whole material is a downright mess. There is plenty of gore, even some dark moments, yet they are passed off as semi jokes, occasionally back-to-back with another black humor. I'm not sure if a witch laughing while driving her broom in reverse before getting punched repeatedly in her face while she screams is meant to be funnyAside from that, it has excessive profanity. I don't really mind, but it has to be done in the right freaking time. The characters just mutter them needlessly, making them awkward, more than anything. Pacing is quite puzzling as well, for most it follows a straight relatively slow pace, only to find some characters appear suddenly for convenience' sake. Few scenes are cut short or sped up in this way.If you, for some reason, want to see Jeremy Renner goes Rambo on old ladies while traumatized innocent children watch in horror, you might as well go for the brief gratuitous shots, for Hansel and Gretel aren't good for much else.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Many flaws but still fun!,I was expecting a bad maybe terrible movie but this wasn't half bad. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters takes place years after the siblings burned the witch that tried to eat them. They go around the world hunting and killing witches to work out their stress when they come across a town who's children have been disappearing for months. This is a one of a kind film where half the population would love it while the other half would hate it. The film itself is filled with spectacular visual effects and I praise the cast for their memorable acting. Yet the plot still doesn't fit together as it probably borrowed a lot of it's material from 2005's The Brothers Grimm. I give the film credit as it tries to make it an original film based off the original Grimm story of Hansel & Gretel but the film still has weak moments that bring it down just a bit.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining Dark Fairy Tale,"Did not expect such a fun dark movie with backstory, that fits in with the original fairy tale. It starts off with a bang and a nod to the origin story of the siblings, which made me revisit the fairy tale (and re-watch the intro after the movie). Not only does it explain why the siblings' parents abandoned them in the woods, but it also explains their subsequent rationale for becoming witch hunters and Gretel's immunity to dark witches' magical powers. It is packed with action scenes that may not make sense, but are fun.

Brain-dead.,"Before I say anything I must admit that it is not easy to impress someone who is a great fan of the fantasy-genre like me with a film like this. I didn't have serious expectations with this one though, I only wanted to have some fun-time after a day of working. I wouldn't have been bothered if the story was a little cheesy and the characters not so well-worked-out. It seems this movie deceeded even my low expectations. The extended story of the Grimm brothers' tale, Gretel and Hansel is an unimaginative, trying-to-be-funny piece of work which was not able to hold my attention for more than half an hour. Some pictures and locations shown in the movie were beautiful and the photography was quite enjoyable. The acting was decent and although I would've expected more from these well-known actors, I can imagine they performed these dull and clichéd characters as good as they could. I won't even tire myself with pointing out the endless number of plot holes in the movie as I neither wish to be spoilery nor I want to bore anybody to death. Going into details about the nowhere near authentic weaponry would also be pointless. I keep saying myself that it was meant to be funny but after a time I found the movie's enforced humour very irritating.I don't recommend this to people who enjoy good fantasy because they will be bitterly disappointed. I don't recommend it to people who enjoy well-thought-out stories with complex characters because this one won't give that to you. Let's see if I have any recommendations. Well, I do.

Really interesting,"I like how recent fairytale adaptations are more darker and violent then we expected, going back to the middle ages. However, there were 2 flaws. 1 is that nothing is really explained to us leaving us to wonder about the whole mythology of witches in their world. Etc if your blood is supposed to be a witch, then you can choose not to be one? Or is it the other way round? 2 is how the movie is too realistic which doesn't feel like fantasy but more like an action movie with a superpowered villain. Other than that, there were great points. 1. Gemma was the perfect Gretel. She was vicious and smart from the beginning, seeing as how she yelled at the witch in the gingerbread house since she was young. She is also kind, seeing as how she cared more about the children's lives than her own, asking Hansel to save them instead. She also cared for Edward despite his ugly appearance. Finally, she was not afraid to get a little dirty during fights. 2. Hansel is more like the shy, quiet brother. He gets distracted easily by women, but at least he fights well with Gemma. 3. I don't see the point of white witches since they can't even protect themselves or others. 4. The witches are ugly, making it easy for you to hate them. Muriel was really powerful and cunning, a worthy opponent. But I am still confused as to what is a grand witch and how to become one? Finally, just watch this movie. It's really exciting, and it trolls Twilight, as in there is literally a troll called Edward and Hansel is like who the **** is Edward?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gretel punctuates this statement with a head butt, and Stormare gets to wear a funny nose patch thingy after that. He sends a grip of dudes out to find the missing kids anyway, but scary-hot witch Famke Janssen is NOT having it and she's like ""This is my turf!!"" and dismembers them all, except one guy who she makes eat a bunch of worms. He brings a message back to the tavern, where Hansel and Gretel are meeting their superfan Benjamin (who has a scrapbook of all their old-tymey notices), and his message is to explode from eating too many worms. Gretel's all like, ""Obviously! The curse of eating too many worms!"" So they kidnap a witch friend of Famke Janssen and figure out that she wants twelve different kids born in each month. (For what? Still no idea.) Jeremy Renner, as Hansel, continues his extended punking of the Academy that gave him not one but TWO Oscar nominations by managing once again to be the place where screen charisma goes to die. He looks consistently bewildered, even when he's boning that hot ginger witch in some random stream (did we catch a glimpse of his underwater naughty bits?). Also, he has a sugar sickness, brought on by the witch making him eat too much candy when he was a kid, and he has to give himself shots every couple of hours. So... diabetes? We were like ""Good joke, ha!"" and then it became a very important plot moment during the climax.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A disrespectful farce without substance,"The romantic theme of the fairy tale is reduced to absurdity in this tasteless and mindless action spectacle that misuses the name 'Hansel and Gretel' as a cheap hook. What the Brothers Grimm once conceived as a timeless tale about courage, solidarity and overcoming evil degenerates here into a meaningless string of violent excesses and platitudinous slogans.The basic idea of showing Hansel and Gretel as grown-up witch hunters could have had potential. But instead of a clever reinterpretation or even a serious exploration of the themes of the original fairy tale, director Tommy Wirkola merely serves up a dull massacre. The characters are as flat as cardboard cut-outs, the dialogue so wooden that one longs for the poetic language of the fairy tale.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mindless fun done the right way,"I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, because it looked like a ridiculous concept used as an excuse for another over-the-top action film. It absolutely was everything I expected, and I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. This movie is fully embracing the silliness of its concept, and doing it in all the right ways. Logic is out the window as the film seems to take place in olden times, but the heroes have an arsenal of modern weapons, a full concept of diabetes and insulin, plus they use some modern slang and profanity. They do nothing to hide this anachronistic feel either, and have so much fun blowing away witches with everything from a shotgun to a modern Gatling-style gun while dropping several F-bombs. The film also fully embraces the existence of witches with dangerous powers, and uses that to make them a formidable threat to our heroes who could seem indestructible. Every aspect of this film is crazy, and I could totally see if someone thought it was dumb, but I loved how writer/director Tommy Wirkola understands where to draw the line between camp and crap. This is the kind of movie that I can justify telling people to ""turn off your brain and enjoy it.""There is a solid plot at the heart of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, that has personal elements for our heroes, which increases the stakes. Most of the plot points are predictable, but this isn't the kind of movie with a complex story that is supposed to puzzle or surprise the viewer. I particularly liked how they handled the reveals of Hansel & Gretel's history, because it was not dragged out too long since we knew what was coming. I think the only story point that was dragged out too much was the way they explored whether all witches were evil. The cast of witches, led by Famke Janssen are delightfully evil in all the stereotypical ways, and the makeup effects on them were perfectly repulsive. Jeremy Renner is basically playing Hansel as another version of Hawkeye, and I didn't mind, because that fits the tone of this film perfectly. I love what Gemma Arterton brings as Gretel, because she is tough and dangerous. I will say, I wish she had spent less time being a damsel in distress and had kicked more butt, particularly in the finale. Otherwise, despite some minor complaints, I found Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters to be a total blast. This is the kind of movie I will watch when I feel like a crazy action spectacle that doesn't require much brainpower to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fairy tale children become foul-mouthed assassins,"With an R-Rating, this movie had been sold to me like an action movie that was gonna have scary moments and some violence. Imagine how surprised I was when I found out that the gore is shown to a great and over the top extent. Not that this was a problem for me, as I think it had a great deal of style to an already showy flick. The performances in the movie fit perfectly with the story and make it a fun ride for the audience. Renner is a badass Hansel who loves to kill witches and party like there's no tomorrow. Gemma Artenton is beautiful as a determined Gretel, who seeks to find the truth about her parents's history. As the villain, Famke Janssen seems to have a great time playing a menacing witch who provokes our heroes in order to succeed in her mission to become basically immortal. Besides the violence, I thought the make-up was terrific as the angry faces of our antagonistic witches not only gave me chills but are enough to make a child have nightmares for weeks. This is strictly an adult movie and any connection to the sweet fairy tale we know is immediately thrown out the window as soon as the heavy violence kicks in. With some entertaining moments, H&G: WH delivers as a good way to pass the time and see kick-ass action.Rating 5,5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Revenge Is Sweeter Than Candy,"A film that is made to entertain the audience and succeeds in doing so.In the film, we follow the brother and sister Hansel and Gretel who are professional witch hunters. They arrive in the small town of Augsburg where strange things are happening.The movie is full of fun and the story moves quickly. The violence is bloody and brutal, and sometimes grotesque to the point of being comical.What adorns this film is excellent direction and excellent casting. Starring as Hansel and Gretel are Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton, who are fun and form the backbone of the film as a dynamic duo.The rest of the cast is equally entertaining, with Peter Stormare as the villainous sheriff and Famke Janssen as Muriel, a powerful witch who wants to destroy people.The film could be described as a brutal action comedy set in medieval times. Blood flows in streams and body parts fly in all directions, the action is non-stop. The film deserves its R rating and it would be a real shame if they opted for another watered down PG-13 film.After watching the Extended version of the movie, I have to say that this version is better, it has more new scenes that are fun, more dialogue and a lot more explicit violence. I'm surprised they didn't go with this version in cinema, because it would have made the movie even more popular.The movie is so much fun that it gets better with each new viewing.I definitely recommend the Unrated Extended Cut, because once you watch it, you won't want to watch the theatrical version again.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
sloppily made to the point of being irrelevant and forgettable,"The movie revolves around two siblings - an insulin-dependent Hansel with big guns, and a foul-mouthed cleavage-showing Gretel armed with a crossbow - abandoned by their parents when they were kids and lured by a house made of candy only to be imprisoned, enslaved, and fattened by an ugly witch.The idea of the classic fairy tale characters as bounty hunters is interesting (as fairy tales nowadays are being turned into something darker or modern, whether in TV or movies), but the movie itself is sloppily made to the point of being irrelevant and forgettable. It has its rare funny moments, and the action and gore, while it is not fantastic, are enough to keep you tuned in (but only because of the movements, which your eyes are forced to follow), and Gemma Arterton as snarky bitch Gretel is fun to watch. But this is one hot mess of a movie with little or thin plot and cartoonish villains with no backstories other than that they are bad, ugly witches who abducts children, and two protagonists that are as developed as a rock, and I wouldn't watch it again even if I see it on cable.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Miscasting Errors,"Unfortunately, this is another film that not only thinks profanity is entertaining, but it is used extensively throughout the film ... making it, basically, a classless endeavor.The action is plentiful, but not overdone ... and the special effects are top drawer. Unfortunately, casting was haphazard to the point that I could not really get into the experience. No matter how good the action and special effects are ... poor casting can ruin a film, and it ruins this film (for me, anyway). Frankly, the only good casting was for the part of Muriel ... Famke Janssen was excellent in the part, and basically saves the film from becoming another cheap addition to a grocery store's $ 4.99 for six horror movies on one DVD, well, for the time being anyway. By the way, I also found that good casting was done with one other actress ... Ingrid Bolsø Berdal's role suited her quite well, and I found her rather delightful.The photography is high quality, as is the lighting, props, and scenery. Couldn't have been better in those departments ... in fact, the movie is worth all the more due to its production quality. I think what I really found disappointing with the film is the casting of Hansel and Gretel ... the teaming is totally off. Their acting is sufficient, but they just don't belong together ... they don't blend at all, and that ruined the film for me. I can't help but wonder how much better the movie might have been if Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had been cast in the title roles?! Of course, they wouldn't have looked like brother and sister either. Oh well ... no classic here!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very entertaining despite the hokey title,"The silly title is what immediately put me off from watching this film, although if I'd been a fan of Gemma Arterton at the time, like I am now, I might have seen it anyway.At first, the title reminded me too much of the kinds of movies I've avoided in the past like ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire hunter"" and ""Cowboys vs. Aliens"". And to me this was, and is, usually not a good thing since films that try to meld historical periods with sci fi or horror genres rarely seem to result in anything worth watching. In this case though, the movie actually works out into something entertaining.The title says it all, and Renner and Arterton make an engaging duo of witch hunters; so along with Famke Jannsen as the heavy, the acting and plot move the story along at a brisk pace fast enough to keep your attention. So, even if unconventional film genres aren't what you normally find entertaining though, this film might be worth a look at the very least.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Largely joyless update of the fairy tale classic,"""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" starts off with a fairly clever premise, but it never comes up with anything particularly interesting to do with it. It would appear that, since stuffing their witch captor into her own oven, the precocious youngsters have grown up to be renowned, Medieval bad-asses, hired by a village to investigate the mysterious disappearances of a number of its children.As the title characters, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton do what they can with woefully underwritten roles, but the movie itself quickly degenerates into a succession of redundant action and fight sequences (inexplicably, with modern firepower) that fail to excite either the imagination or the pulse and that ultimately go nowhere. And the ending feels way too much like the start of a franchise. Well, as they say, forewarned is forearmed.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A film that defies all criticism and the reviewing process,"Does a film titled ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" even need a review to correspond with the finished product? Do the fundamentals and guidelines of film criticism/analysis even apply to such a film? This film defies the medium and all it stands for. It exists in that small little blackhole of cinema, where films that are close to ""unreviewable"" lie. Alongside films like this one are parody films, theatrical stand-up comedy releases, and some obscure others.Is there even a reason to explain the plot of Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters? I might as well. The film takes place in Augsburg, where the Mayor of the town hires the brother and sister duo Hansel and Gretel (Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) to find and kill any witches they may find. Hansel, armed with his trusty shotgun and his syringes for his insulin shots, and Gretel, with her wits and bow-and-arrow, along with this hideous troll monster, they set out to find and eliminate the witches from the forests of the city.One of the first things noticeable about this tepid reworking of the classic fairytale is how grim and dingy the entire event is. I think the problem lies in the fact that the material is taken in a serious manner, rather than being campier and more alive than it should be. The same direction was taken for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a picture that was almost relentless in its bleakness and charmless ways.Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, however, doesn't have two or three good scenes that buoy the entire project like the aforementioned film did. Instead, this is one depressing slog due to the material not being that interesting and the entire setup not being that creative. The set designs are probably the most impressive thing to look at here. They're a cross between Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, with more emphasis on Gothic undertones. It's too bad that the sets aren't used as much but scenic backdrops, and Hansel and Gretel are left mainly with their wits and their artillery. There is little room for improvisation, even when you're being hunted by obscure beasts. There's also little room for personality, as the title characters are nothing more than sulky, faceless characters we root for because we are expected to. They offer nothing in the way of emotion or character; they might as well have cutouts around their face that say ""Insert Face Here."" This is certainly not my kind of film. I think predominately because I see something like this as an obligation on part of the crew rather than a serious movie. Jeremy Renner, who has been on a role with Hollywood films, seemingly needs to keep doing these kinds of films so every once in a while he can take a risk like he did with The Hurt Locker. A few years prior to this film, writer/director Tommy Wirkola made a film about Nazi-zombies called Dead Snow, which was more fun to explain than to actually watch. Regardless, I'd rather see a goofy little surprise like that film more often than one about classic fairytale characters acting like two archetypal action heroes.I'm constantly told that I look at films too deeply and, instead of being cynical and expect a masterpiece every time I see a film, I should look at a film as a piece of entertainment. To much surprise, I actually do. What I find entertaining and worthy of my money and what I look for in a film is drastically different from what a lot of others will look for. Rather than guttural smugness from an action film, I'd appreciate character and excitement. Rather than haphazard plot-developments, I'd prefer explanations and detail. And rather than senseless camaraderie, Id' like clarity and vision.That's about as far as I'll go in my analysis. Was the film good? Does it need to have a star rating? Who knows? I'm giving it two stars, as that's halfway between good and dreadful. You should already know if you're in the target audience to see this kind of a picture. However, there was not much of a justification for seeing the film in theaters, or paying its ludicrous surcharge for the plastic 3D glasses that dim the picture and make the high-quality camera used to shoot the film look like it has dirty plastic wrap over the lens.Starring: Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, Famke Janssen, and Peter Stormare.

"Non-stop fun, just enjoy it (and Gemma Arterton)","Some people have missed the point, I fear.This is nothing more than a superb way to waste 2 hours and let the time pass quickly with plenty of laughs to boot.Arterton is her usual gorgeous sultry self and Jeremy is, well, Jeremy. They're both good in it and the effects are simply stunning.It's not a classic remake or an attempt to be something magical. It's just a good action packed semi-horror. Oh and how Famke Janssen is 47 years old I'll never know, even she manages to look the part on the odd occasion she's not in witch guise.I found myself thoroughly enjoying the film. It doesn't try to be anything other than exciting, bloody thirsty and hero-creating with giggles and funny one liner.It also lived up to the effects of the trailers that were put out, because there was so much more on offer in the film itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"fun to watch, decent 3d effects,","In terms of what I was expecting, I was really impressed. The plot took a familiar fairytale and expanded on it. it was fun to watch.

I was impressed with what they did with it. There could have been a few improvements. But considering what they started with, or a futuristic setting Of Hansel and Gretel, I think they did a great job.

I like it,"It's a very good movie. The movie is a very visually stunning masterpiece that marries breathtaking cinematography with a deeply emotional narrative. Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Sofia Hayes, the movie takes viewers on a journey through time, love, and loss. The story revolves around Nora, a scientist whose groundbreaking discovery allows her to glimpse alternate realities where her late husband is still alive.The performances are stellar, with Clara Jensen delivering a heart-wrenching portrayal of grief and hope as Nora. Her chemistry with co-star Liam Carter is palpable, making their brief yet impactful moments together unforgettable. The supporting cast also shines, adding depth to an already rich script.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in its profound themes of sacrifice and the cost of second chances. Composer Aaron Levy's haunting score perfectly complements the tone, lingering long after the credits roll.While some may find its philosophical undertones heavy-handed, ""Eternal Horizons"" offers a thought-provoking experience that challenges viewers to reflect on their own choices and relationships. It's a cinematic gem that balances science fiction with raw human emotion, solidifying its place as one of the year's best films. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kick axx continuation of the sylvan fairy tale about slaying diabolical witches,"In Medieval Germany, Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton) are now adults and formidable witch slayers, not to mention considered heroes in the community. When numerous children turn-up missing, they trace the problem to an unholy celebration orchestrated by a grand witch (Famke Janssen). Fetching Pihla Viitala plays a redhead villager accused of witchcraft.""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (2013) is a dark fantasy/action/comedy/horror that takes the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm and envisions events about twenty years later. Imagine the excellent ""Season of the Witch"" (2011) meshed with the fantasy elements of the fable and you'd have a good idea of this movie. ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) are good contemporary associations, but ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is noticeably superior.This movie just kicks total axx from beginning to end with Gemma jaw-dropping as the take-no-sheet heroine and Renner rising to the challenge. The witches are ee-vil and worthy of nothing other than immediate slaughter, which is basically the siblings' modus operandi. There's a lot of thrilling action and gore, some of it so over-the-top it's amusing; there's even a terrible troll. And the movie LOOKs great.

Highly enjoyable if slightly flawed take on the story,"Having turned themselves into formidable bounty-hunters, the brother-and-sister duo find themselves summoned to a village beset by child kidnappings and witch activity and uncover the mystical connection between them and the strange activity in town.This one was quite the exciting and enjoyable variant on the story with a lot to like. What turns it on the most is the fact that there's a rather large sampling here of action that proves their worthiness and capabilities at their goal, which sets them up as skilled professionals accomplished at their job rather than being told they're great because that's the way the story is supposed to unfold. Being given access to their kind of weaponry and defensive tactics, from spreading razor-wire between trees most identifiable as escape routes, whips, knives and spells as well as their physical brawling, there's a lot to like here about this which is set through the film's rather fun pace here. This one tends to go through a rather large amount of time here battling the witches and the different helpers along the way, making for the fun of their first forest encounter after being hired where they beat off the lone witch, the spectacular assault on the town where the witches bombard the village and homes with explosive fireballs, the chaos and panic hides the brawling quite well and there's the rescue attempts that come up rather fun as well providing this with a great scene that's really filled with action. There's also the massive forest encounter here, from the lead-up to the mountain-top hideout where they hold the big gathering for the other witches there, the huge gunfight that wipes out most of them and then the big hand-to-hand battles that lead into the forest escape into the final brawl back in the cottage which makes for quite an action-packed time here. All of these are rather enjoyable with lots of spectacle, great make-up for the different witches and their powers that come off rather nicely and plenty of bloody kills here to make for an even better time here with these all combining together to give this one a lot to like. There's not a whole lot here that doesn't really work, as all that does come up seems to be the fact that this one never really pays off much in terms of connecting them to the fairytale beyond the opening sequence in the candy-house which is played off nicely, but seems to be more of an after-thought here in terms of how they're supposed to be the same people. This causes the middle of the film to turn into a rather irritating series of scenes where they're completely at odds with everyone around them constantly worrying about each other if they're out of the others' line-of-sight, keeping these scenes rather clichéd and familiar due to the constant repetition of these scenes. Still, this one was overall quite fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children- in-jeopardy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An interesting idea with a good implementation,"When they were kids, Hansel and Gretel were abandoned by their father in the nearby forest, ending up defeating the witch from the candy cottage. After that event, thanks to their powers, they become witch hunters, swearing to bring every evil witch to justice, no matter where she was hiding. Thus, they are recruited by a town's mayor to investigate a kidnapping spree which seemed without ending. Armed with courage, weapons and a bit of help from some locals, they begin their quest of eliminating the source of evil which lurked without any hitch.It's an enjoyable and funny parody of the famous Hansel & Gretel story which seems determined to do anything to entertain. It manages to do so, mostly, due to its humor, intense action, combat and story. It combines sophisticated guns with a world in which people live in cottages and read printed newspapers...what a mix! As a parody, it doesn't pay attention to details, the characters are very simplistic and it's story is linear, but despite its problems, it is a good movie which provides a good dose of adrenaline and entertainment whenever needed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This film is better suited for older teens due to brutal violence and some scenes that could easily frightening younger kids. So if you're a Jeremy Renner fan, definitely try this film. Its not spectacular, but its worth a watch. Ultimately, what sold me on this viewing was how everyone delivered on the sincerity of a fairly stable premise. Is WITCH HUNTER stupid?Oh, hell yeah! But at least i found it entertainingly, stupid thanks to everyone's natural charm and ability to take lackluster material and put some kind of shine on it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure Guilty Pleasure Entertainment,"I have been a fan of the horror genre since the year 2017 and it has become my favorite genre in media aside from action, science fiction and superheroes. However, the first horror movie I watched in the theater was Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013) and I was only 14 years old. With that being said, I just finished rewatching the movie and while I can't say that the movie is good, this movie is one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies of all time.Positives for Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013):
First off, the movie's title tells you everything about the movie you're watching and it will either make or break your expectations. This movie is just as ridiculous as the title would suggest and I loved every minute of it. This is not a movie where you're supposed to think about stuff, it exists for the sole purpose of entertaining you. The cast is awesome and they are all committed to playing their characters either dead serious or over the top. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are both fantastic as these new ridiculous versions of Hansel and Gretel respectively. Famke Janssen is very over the top as the grand witch Muriel and she is having the time of her life as this character. I even liked Peter Stormare as the cocky Sheriff Berringer and every time he acts like a pink, he gots his ass handed to him. I also liked the allies to our main characters with Thomas Mann and Pihla Viitala as Benjamin Walser and Mina respectively. The movie also has Derek Mears as the troll Edward, Jason Voorhees from the 2009 remake, and he was awesome. The movie is also filled with a lot of gore and kills with fantastic practical effects. The movie has a great pace where it is both fast and slow so that the audience can stay invested in the story from start to finish. And finally, this was one of the first horror movies that took childhood characters and put them in a ridiculous horror movie situation.Overall, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013) is just as ridiculous and stupid as you would expect from a movie with a ridiculous title and I loved every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Awesome Mercenary WtchHunters,"Siblings Hansel & Gretel are just children when their father takes them out into the woods at night and leaves them there all alone.The children come upon a house in the woods... a Gingerbread house! As they enter the house, a witch captures them and chains them, forcing Hansel to eat candy. But Hansel and Gretel manages to get free and they throw the witch into her own oven, burning her alive
Now many years later, having killed hundreds of witches, Hansel and Gretel have become famous mercenary witch hunters for hire.""Me and my sister... we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch. But that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood. Witch blood. And we haven't stopped since."" - HanselSo when the children in the town of Augsburg start to disappear, stolen away by witches, the Mayor hires Hansel and Gretel to find them and bring them back.But these are no typical witch kidnappings. This is a gathering. The gathering of all the witches all over the world to the Blood Moon, and to the most powerful grand dark witch herself, Muriel.Now Hansel & Gretel have only three days before the Blood Moon to save the children from a horrific death.Wow! I have never seen witches like this. This is not the children's fairy tale I grew up with. This is some serious child eating, butt kicking, broom riding, killer witches.

"Danish director Tommy Wirkola, only 34l, capably directs a fairy tale with an inventive twist; Famke Janssen is perfect femme fatale","HANSEL AND GRETEL starts just like the 1812 published fairy tale (Grimm Brothers based it on German legends) -- two young siblings being abandoned by their parents, and encountering a gingerbread house owned by an ugly witch. Inventively, the film inserts newspaper clippings (made to look ancient) chronicling what happens after Hansel and Gretel's shocking feat of that first witch and their being fearless witch-hunters, tracking down every last witch and exterminating them from the world. As Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) enter a new town, they encounter an antagonistic sheriff (Peter Stormare), a hapless mayor who has wisely hired the witch-hunters to help rid the town of the terrorist hags, missing children, more frightful and powerful witches... and even a troll. The town's major crisis is the coming Blood Moon, for which the coven needs the heart of 12 children for unimaginable and unlimited powers. The mystery of why Hansel and Gretel's parents abandoned them unravels, as the troll inexplicably saves Gretel from the dastardly Sheriff Berringer and his henchmen. Hansel is also provided a love interest in the young woman (Pihla Viitala) they earlier rescue from charges of being a witch -- or is she? To reveal more would render me an insufferable spoilsport (I've just outlined the key scenes), but suffice it to say that Renner (fresh from the success of the Manila-shot BOURNE LEGACY) and Arterton (still indelibly imprinted in my mind from her film appearances, nymphlike, from PRINCE OF PERSIA and CLASH OF THE TITANS, both 2010) are up to the task, with terrific martial arts/fight scenes, and Famke Janssen (whom everybody knows as Jean Grey) is deliciously luminous as the would-be queen of witches, Muriel. Janssen (my favorite actress after Rebecca de Mornay) is always a delight to watch, and here she relishes every scene she's in, despite the frightful witch makeup that covers her Danish beauty. Even the ""two ugly sisters"" (of Muriel) are no weak ladies, ready to combat Hansel (or Gretel). Atli Örvarsson's moody music, and the atmospheric set pieces of 1800s Germany, well-photographed by Michael Bonvillain, enhance the flashy, well-choreographed direction of Tommy Wirkola (a 34-year-old Norwegian filmmaker who only has three directorial credits before HANSEL!).",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining and fun,"To be frank, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. Since this is based on a fairy tale, assumed it to be an average action movie. But to my surprise, it was fun to watch. Entertaining at every point and I must say what awesome graphics and effects. The fight sequences, bodies bursting out and blood flying all around, lot of energy has gone into making this one I must say.It kept me glued into my seat till the end.Also I love Gemma, she's one of the best looking actresses around. She's totally into fights, action, beating the hell out of witches in this one. Jeremy on the other hand is tough as in his all other movies and Famke, well she does her part very well.All in all, if you have a slight thought of giving a shot of watching this one, go ahead, I am sure you won't be disappointed.Cheers",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Underestimated and entertaining,"I watched this movie recently and didn't understand the overall negative response to it. Not only is it pure entertainment, there are a few intelligent parts that are never mentioned. Due to the childhood incident with the witch at the beginning of the movie, hansel (played with dryness by Jeremy renner) now has diabetes which is a smart and reasonable aspect that may have resulted by this occurrence. Secondly, there's a delightful and rare use of steampunk (that is basically featuring futuristic aspects in an older more traditional setting). As a lot of people have complained and apparently found plot holes with the new ageism of the guns in this movie as according to the 18th-19th century timeline, they have failed to do their research as this aspect is actually a theme in books and cinema and was used in van helsing and other movies. Gemma arteron and Jeremy renner have a nice chemistry and the supporting cast are solid and do their jobs. I found the film to be utterly entertaining and is a dark but refreshing take to the light and kid friendly fairy tales that people who are giving this film a bad wrap obviously think they're seeing. To conclude, this movie was a smart and creative idea showing a grown up fairytale and features a female just as strong and badass as her male sibling (this fact also seems to be overlooked). As long as you aren't expecting an award winning movie you'll enjoy this turn on a child's fairytale. Don't judge this movie before you see it or understand it, it's a firm 8 for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dark, spooky and funny","This movie was unexpectedly great. Their was some scenes which were sick, but that only added to the uniqueness. It was more on the horror side f the movie scale with a hint of comedic scenes here and their. That's why this movie is one of the best movies of 2013, it was fast paced and straight to the point. It wasn't long and dragging with extended dialogue, that's what made this fantastic movie easy to understand. The graphic sides of things was the icing on the cake, it made the movie stand out. Their was no cheesy cheap syfy type of graphics but a more realistic view. The acting was great, no sloppy b movie type of dialogue and cheesiness.

Action and Fun in Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters!!,"I watched Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, and I really enjoyed it. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of action.

The costumes and the weapons look amazing, like something from a fantasy world.Some parts of the movie are a little bit scary, but not too much. The witches look very creepy, and the special effects are good. I think the actors did a great job, especially the main characters.

"Good action/story, few items out of place.","I enjoyed watching the movie. Overall good story, good action. It all starts with Hansel and Gretel getting lost in the woods, and ends up getting captured by a witch in a house made out of candy. Their is plenty of action, and the story is well-rounded (what is told, and left for mystery throughout the movie, is later revealed towards the end). I'd say there is no loose-ends here, and it is a good thriller/twist on the tale of Hansel and Gretel. However, like most movies or stories, they are not without their imperfections.The tech used to combat the witches, makes a good twist for the time period this story is told in, I'd say, somewhere in beginnings of the gunpowder age. The automatic cross bow, and the rifle are a perfect fit for a movie such as this, however, I think its safe to say that the .270 caliber rounds that were depicted to be used with Hansel's guns, did not quite fit in very well, and I think something akin to the bullet used in the end to bring the evil witch down should have been more of a proper design for a movie of this caliber. Although this is not a huge disappointment or any at all, it will likely stick out like a sore thumb to a firearm fanatic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent action and special effects movie,"This is a movie which you watch for the action and the special effects and pretty much nothing else. As such it is a excellent movie. The original story of Hansel & Gretel is essentially only used to boot this movie. The movie itself plays out when Hansel & Gretel are adult witch hunters.The movie is pretty much action all the way. It is fairly violent and goory action at that. It is not a movie for the kids. To me this is an advantage. I do not think I would have liked it as much if they had dumbed it down to a standard PG-rated Hollywood creation. I really enjoyed the hard-ass Hansel & Gretel duo kicking witch ass in so many way.The special effects are not bad and the medieval yet kind of modern weaponry that Hansel & Gretel swings around are quite cool looking. Not very believable perhaps but then neither are witches so The witches themselves are also fairly cool. Especially the witch-gathering near the end of the movie is indeed a grim (ha ha) collection of freaky creatures.I was not too thrilled about the idiot law keeper. His utter stupidity bugged me throughout the entire movie. I really wished they would have dragged out the end for him a bit more. Well he did meet a suitable end at least.Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you though this was to be ""just"" a Hansel & Gretel movie the you are probably going to be disappointed. I knew more or less what I went for so I was just enjoying myself. I was surprised at the level of gore, exploding heads, troll-squished humans etc but, as I said above, I think it was a good thing that they did let it be done in the way the producer/director obviously intended for it to be made.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great bed time story for adults,"Brave movie truly. I excepted something totally different again.First of all this is the story of Hansel and Gretel hunting witches traveling through good old lands, somehow because of things about their childhood. This is not for very little kids, teenagers might laugh at this 'cause its so stupid or so...Anyway I was mostly surprised by the balance between script, directing, acting, action, comedy and all. There were no boring moments in any moment, it kept me watching interested throughout the movie.There are some funny cowboy scenes and so, it fits pretty fine, not too much humor. Nice to see some makeup in movies nowadays, not all cgi or something. There were elements that made me wonder why do they need actually CGI with this kind of movies.Very enjoyable, not scary at all for adults just funny mostly. Nice atmosphere and everything you want for good night sleep. Really like an adult bed time story.If you want to take a break from too serious movies or such this is brilliant choice.Recommend this totally. Maybe the ""minuses"" are that there were no any totally surprising moments although it kept going really well.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Thoughts,"This has to be one of the better movies out there today because of how the Director did not leave out the violence that was in the ""true"" Hansel and Gretel. The acting in this movie was extremely well and there are some twists that you never could have thought about. The choice o actors was really well thought-out and they had the one guy from Avengers, the bow and arrow guy, I forgot his name but he was a really cool character in this movie and I thought that he did a superb job. The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that some o the CGI, special effects, do seem computer animated and might or might not disappoint you. When I was watching this movie I did notice some other well-know actors. If you are considering watching this movie then I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Whatever you do, don't eat the f***ing candy!""","HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS is an hilariously creative film that completely restored my faith in the whole subgenre of horror-comedy-- it's more of the latter, of course. While obviously nothing to be taken too seriously, this film does have a solid, cohesive plot-line with some nice surprises. The Sabbat scene is particularly worthy of mention. Expert filming and settings, makeup, eclectic soundtrack, and intentionally stupid but nonetheless lively script. Great props too--love the automatic crossbows and blunderbusses. While it could have gone a little farther in such areas, it makes some interesting revelations concerning Hansel and Gretel's familiar past, adding some interesting elaborations to the Grimm Bros' original tale as well as the entire mythos regarding ""medieval"" witches. While this film is mostly its own original self, the borrowings and bits of spoof on WIZARD of OZ, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, KING KONG, RED DAWN, and a score of others really add something to the mix.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A hell of a lot of fun if you're looking for action and good bloody gore!,"'HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another 'hip' modern take on a classic fairy tale 'with a twist'; this one has a grown up Hansel and Gretel as bounty hunters hunting down and exterminating witches around the world. It stars Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner in the two lead roles and was written and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Tommy Wirkola. Wirkola also helmed the cult classic 2009 Norwegian Nazi zombie flick 'DEAD SNOW'. This is his big budget American film debut. It's just a hell of a lot of fun if you're looking for action and good bloody gore. Also is you grew up on these dark and twisted Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and don't mind a little creative liberty taken with them, the movie's a blast as well!As kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) we're abandoned by their father in the woods and kidnapped by a witch living inside a gingerbread house (they went exploring to). Planning to eat the two the witch makes Hansel stuff himself with candy while she forces Gretel to tend to an oven (which she plans to cook them in). The two kids get the better of the witch though and force her into the oven, killing her. They then grow up dedicating themselves to hunting down and killing witches. They have a special gift for this calling due to the fact that they're now immune to the spells and curses of witches (Hansel is a diabetic though, due to the fact he was forced to eat so much candy). As adult bounty hunters they're hired by the Mayor (Rainer Bock) of a town called Augsburg to rescue several children abducted by witches there. They learn that a powerful witch, by the name of Muriel (Famke Janssen), stole the children in order to sacrifice them for the ritual of Blood Moon. It's up to Hansel and Gretel to stop Muriel and her army of witches and rescue the children.As you might have expected the movie is full of dark humor and plays out a little like a spoof but not entirely. The film is actually full of graphic gratuitous gore and is surprisingly action packed. When Hansel and Gretel are kicking witch ass the movie is at it's most fun. The film's sense of humor never gets in the way of it being a very well executed, slick and cool action film and the gore and creature elements of the film will please any die-hard horror fan. The movie did get mostly poor reviews from critics and disappointed at the American box-office (barely making it's budget back) but it made a huge profit overseas and got awesome reviews from horror critics and fans (as well as action lovers). The film has some CGI but also uses classic old school monster movie effects. Derek Mears (of 'Jason Voorhees' and 'Predator' fame, in the latest franchise installments) makes a cool appearance as a troll named Edward, Arterton is gorgeous and makes a cool kick-ass action heroine and Wirkola's directing is extremely stylized and viscerally cool. The movie is just a lot of fun (like I said) and sure to please most die-hard genre fans.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVxCgCFIf8",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's entertaining,"Hansel and Gretel is a beautifully crafted, nostalgic retelling of the classic fairy tale. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film pulls audiences into the heart of the dark forest where the iconic siblings must outwit the sinister witch who lures them with the promise of candy. The film embraces its fairy-tale roots with soft, enchanting visuals, while never shying away from the ominous atmosphere that gives this age-old story its staying power.The set design is particularly stunning, with the gingerbread house glistening like a sugary dream, only to reveal its true, menacing nature. The forest, shrouded in mist and shadow, serves as both a literal and metaphorical maze for Hansel and Gretel to navigate. The subtle use of color from the dark greens and browns of the forest to the sweet pastels of the witch's home creates a contrast that speaks to the innocence lost as the children battle for survival.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I love it!,"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters kinda reminds of The Lone Ranger. Both films were released in 2013 and both got lots of bad reviews. Thankfully plenty of normal people like me enjoyed these two films, so they weren't left unloved. I thought H&G:WH was so great I don't have any problems with it. So here are at least most of the thing I liked about this film.1)On paper the idea of Hansel and Gretel killing sounds awesome.2)Some cool movies like this have a bad story. Thankfully the story here is pretty solid.3)The writing wasn't bad.4)The witches aren't made with CGI, which means they are portrayed by real people. Their makeup is excellent.5)Surprisingly Edward, the troll, isn't an animation. It is a costume.6)Overall great use of practical effects.7)Lots of great action sequences.8)The acting wasn't bad.9)The characters were likable.10)Hansel and Gretel were badass, especially Gretel.

Not at all bad and hands down an entertaining film,"Wouldn't call this movie of the year, but they definitely got charisma and live up to it's title by fitting it with a theme that went along with tye movie. Honestly calling it a bad movie just because they made a uncanny genre of it doesn't make it a bad film. The only drawback from this film was the action. It wasn't weak but it sure wasn't new other than seeing them get beat up by all witches before gaining the upper hand with advantage in numbers.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gemma Arteton was also great and it was surprising to see her acted Gretel the way she did since I've always considered her more of the damsel in distress kind of girlOverall, a great film and well worth the wait after its release disappointingly had to be postponed from from being shown last year but I guess they made the right choice",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Pure entertainment, no bullshit.","Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a slightly over the top fun and light-hearted movie. Now, if you've watched Van Helsing and happened to love it, you're guaranteed to love this one as well as its based on a somewhat similar theme. However, in this case, as the title suggests, its witch-hunting. Whats more, it features the fantastic Jeremy Renner and the famous bond-girl Gemma Arterton.Now, Hansel and Gretel are orphan siblings well-known for their witch-hunting skills and this movie is about them investigating a case of 11 children which went missing from a tiny village. So, obviously there is apt action, which is surprisingly well-directed and the characters seem realistic as they're not taking blow after blow and still kicking the bad guys' asses as if its nothing, like in Die Hard movies. Needless to say, Jeremy and Ms Arterton were fantastic in their roles and do justice to the movie. I kind of expected more action from Hansel's character being played by Jeremy and all, but I'm glad that there wasn't so that the movie could stay true to itself. Gemma was smoking hot (and I don't mean in a bad way) as well as beautiful. This movie was good for a change, for me and I really loved it. My two cents- this movie is recommended. And I think it has proved itself worthy enough to find a permanent place on my low-on-space hard drive.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
nice,"it is its basic virtue. and it is enough because it is not more than link of chain of fairy tale adaptation passion of some directors. it is correct, charming and without great ambition except fun. it is not a sacrilege against original story and it may be almost credible. and sure, it is a ball of make-up, action, scenes of fight, magic lines, medieval - contemporary atmosphere, glorious victories of good guy and his impressive sister, special effects and not so bad characters. a game with some taste of childhood period. and MTV pieces as mark of identification for new generations. not great but it is not waste of time. if the expectations are not great. and, if the joy to play ancient games survives.",,Anonymous,Horror
Monster bash,"Cinema is the art of adopting points of view and this one is unrelentingly poor in that way. Actors walk onto a figurative stage, mouthing off crucial lines about where we are in the plot, everything wooden. The story is trivial anyhow, the characters of the fairytale have grown up to be witch hunters in the vein of the action hero where they sling guns over shoulders and sashay in leather pants.Which means that it's exactly what it looks like it was going to be from the cover, an action movie adopting the skin of dark fantasy, much like Van Helsing, with medieval backdrops and gnarly monsters.Choppy so long as there's a plot where we must pretend that characters are facing odds that have some nailbiting significance, they're not really, even when shot or abducted. All that carries about as much gravity and surprise as watching someone pour cookie dough in a mold, biting our nails about whether or not a baked cookie is going to come out on the other end.On the upside it moves fast and leaves a trail of splatter. When we no longer have to bother with plot, we get a nice showdown up in the woods where a coven of witches is about to perform the climactic ceremony that night. The witches look rotten and ugly and there's a variety of them, the heroes plow and mow through them with guns and knives.",,Anonymous,Horror
good movie but my concern for profanities,"I enjoyed the movie, i thought it was what it should have been, brief with action, not something that goes for hours on end with a complex story line like a lot of other fantasy movies do. The only thing that doesn't make sense, is the contradiction to the script including the swearing. It almost feels the time and date of the events displayed in the movie did not match what was being verbalized when they were to use profanities. When such words were used it made the movie seem a lot more new age as appose to the image it was depicting in that time, with old villages, clothing, and props.Other then that, i really did enjoy it, if you want to watch a movie, and turn the brain off and go with the flow, then this is exactly what you need to see!",,Anonymous,Horror
decent,"it is part of a tend. precise target, technology as tool for recreate a new/modern version of a classic fairy tale, fight scenes and dark secrets, challenges and the link between good heroes. magic and fragments of legends and the original story as pretext. nothing new. or touching. a decent work. impressive for the same details like many other movies from the same genre. seductive for small crumbs. good manner to resurrect myths. and Renner in the right clothes of hero. the victims are the masters of justice and the old witch is so vulnerable behind her tricks. so, a nice film. for teenagers and for the fans of genre.",,Anonymous,Horror
