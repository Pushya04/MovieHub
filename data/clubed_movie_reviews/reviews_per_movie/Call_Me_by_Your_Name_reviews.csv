Absorbing but not a masterpiece,"First, to all the Americans on here outraged about the film ""endorsing"" a criminal act - NEWS FLASH!! Just because the age of consent is 18 in your country, doesn't make it so everywhere else in the world! 18 is comparatively old by global standards. I believe the average age is 16 (as in my country) and in Italy where the film takes place it's actually 14. Whether you agree with it morally or not, no criminal act takes place - US law does not apply!However, I agree with many reviewers that Armie Hammer is miscast in terms of his character's age. He is 31 and looks it, whereas Oliver is meant to be 24. His age is never referred to in the film, so viewers who haven't read the book are left with the impression of a 30-ish man engaging in a relationship with a 17-year-old, which Timothee (20 at the time) does convincingly portray. I can fully understand how that would ring alarm bells for many. If they'd had an actor who actually looked 24 I think that would have created a very different dynamic. Even so, the relationship is hardly of a paedophilic nature. And I don't think most people would regard 17-year-olds as ""children"" physically and emotionally, even if they may be legally.Timothee Chalamet gives an incredible performance fully deserving of all the accolades, but I found Armie's inconsistent at best. He does get better as the film goes along. Maybe it's just that I didn't find his character particularly appealing... to me he comes across as rather abrupt and arrogant, and weirdly passive-aggressive and patronising towards Elio for much of the time. The physical scenes between Oliver and Elio were excruciatingly awkward to watch and didn't ring true to me - but I'm a straight female so what would I know? I haven't had that reaction with the (admittedly few) other gay films I've seen though. Maybe it was supposed to reflect real life, or maybe I am just too accustomed to male-female depictions. Ultimately the relationship seemed to consist of Elio being infatuated and Oliver enjoying being the object of that infatuation, rather than a true love story.Personally the relationship I found most touching in the film was that between Elio and his parents. Although they aren't given much to work with, both the actors playing his parents do beautiful, nuanced work... and the much-lauded scene near the end with his father was stunning and truly moving. It was refreshing to see a such a loving and accepting child-parent relationship, done in a natural and non-affected way. It rang very true to my own experience as an only child and it was nice to see this portrayed on film for once, instead of the tension-filled relationships American films usually depict.Overall I thought the film was absorbing and well-done, but neither the masterpiece or great love story it's being hyped as.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The power of LOVE!,"Call Me By Your Name is one of those films which doesn't feel like a film but rather a journey of self discovery which we witness and feel as if it's happening at that exact moment.Call Me By Your Name is the story of two people, Elio and Oliver, who fall in love over the course of the summer.This movie brings one of the most beautiful relationships ever put to film. The way writer James Ivory and director Luca Guadagnino portrayed this story felt so real and in the moment. Not even for a second does it feel like you're watching actors playing these characters because of how well everyone played their roles and the excellent direction by Gaudagnino.Timothée Chalamet is a force to be reckoned with. This man displayed such raw and tender emotion as Elio that it's impossible to think that Chalamet is acting. He is essentially our main focus since we see him learn more about himself and his sexuality as the film goes on. Elio is a character that you connect with and actually care about. He will make you feel a whole bunch of emotions as his character develops and grows.Let's not forget how terrific Elio's other half, Oliver, played by Armie Hammer was. The chemistry between these two seemed so genuine that you instantly root for both of them being together. The love and sweetness Oliver gives to Elio is something that can't be found or forgotten easily. There's something so sincere and authentic between these two that just makes tears stream down your face like a running tap. If there was one thing that I would've liked more, it would be learning more about the character of Oliver.This movie isn't your typical love story filled with obstacles and conflict. This is one that celebrates the ideology of LOVE and shows it in a touching and emotional way. By the end, there will be nothing else but sniffling and tears throughout the end credits. This film conveys one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful relationships the world has ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A touching romance,"« Call me by your name » is a beautiful movie about first love. The atmosphere is dreamy and I have been taken on an emotional journey for two hours. Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer give remarkable performances. There is a great chemistry between them. The charming landscapes, the good soundtrack and the delicate direction also contribute to this achievement. I like the way homosexuality is portrayed: being gay is normal; there is no drama queen and no pathos. This is a touching story that makes me want to fall in love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits,"Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest.Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it.Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It happens when you least expect it,"Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we're living in, it's like a shock. I wept like I hadn't wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Call Me When It's Over,"Classic example of what can go wrong with a good story and good acting when in the hands of the wrong editor and director. Good editing could have improved this movie a lot. There was zero chemistry between the two leads. I didn't for a moment believe that either of them were obsessed with the other. There was too many redundant shots of bicycle riding to nowhere, and ""let's go swimming"" scenes that really added nothing to the story. However, all of the scenes were beautifully filmed.I put this in a category with ""Ryan's Daughter."" It's overwrought, over worked, and in 20 years, nobody will remember this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The joy and pain of love and desire,"Saw 'Call Me By Your Name' as someone trying to see as many films from 2017 as possible, because same sex love has been portrayed beautifully more than once and because it was one of the best received films of the year with a lot of award attention as we speak.A distinction more than well deserved. 'Call Me By Your Name' is certainly one of my favourites of a pretty hit and miss 2017 (with some great films, bad films and films in between and near but not quite both extremes) and, like another gay love-themed film from 2017 'God's Own Country', one of the films of the year that really touched me. It is much more than just a ""gay movie"" and shouldn't be dismissed as just that, that on the most part it hasn't is a good thing.'Call Me By Your Name' is most striking for its emotional impact. The erotic elements are tasteful and sensual, but it's the relationships that are even more beautifully done. The subject matter is handled with subtlety and surprising wit and the central relationship is tender and compassionate with a little tension. Just as, even more, impressive is the father and son relationship, which was sincere and touching, again with just as much burning intensity, and boasted the film's most powerful scene. The joy and pain of love and desire is portrayed in a way that really touched my soul and comes over as surprisingly relatable.The acting is another big strength, advantaged by that the characters are interesting and not stereotypical with conflicts that are genuine and not predictable. Timothee Chalamet is especially remarkable and has a great future ahead of him if he continues in this direction. Armie Hammer is hardly inferior in perhaps his best performance to date, a very sympathetic performance which helps make the central relationship as powerful as it is. Michael Stuhlbarg also should be highlighted, a very wise and sincere performance and he has never been this poignant.Luca Guadagnino directs beautifully, bringing the best out of his actors and the gorgeous scenery just as gorgeously shot. The sincerity, wisdom, compassion and wit of the source material is ideally captured in the script and as indicated the film looks great. The music has whimsy and understatement which suits the story perfectly, and while the pace is Merchant/Ivory-influenced-like deliberate it never felt dull to me due to being swept up in the emotion and being riveted by the writing and performances.In conclusion, a beautiful film with much more to it than what it can easily be dismissed as. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sensual Italian summer,"This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you feel, by God how you feel.

A piece of perfect cinema,"Now, where to begin... Pretty much everything I feel about this film has been mentioned here before. But boy did it make me FEEL, from the opening credits right through the end credits. It made my heart soar and sink with its colours, scenery, music, and above all else its acting. The phenomenon that is Chalamet was yet unknown to me, and Hammer I'd only seen in a bad chickflick, so it would be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how they performed.
There's so much detail as well, from the inquisitive and knowing looks of a mother, to the picturesqueness of a ladder against the fruittree. Everything about this film draws you in. If I could dream up memories of a hot Italian summer in a rural hamlet, this would be it, I swear I could almost smell and taste this film. Luca Guadagnino made a masterpiece here and I highly doubt it will ever be surpassed in its category.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Strong Film About Love & Being Who You Are!,"'Call Me by Your Name' is a film about LOVE. Its also a film about being who you are. And Writer James Ivory & Director Luca Guadagnino bring us a tale on young romance & living life, with honesty & the emotional impact akin to a sledgehammer. And Timothée Chalamet is the find of the year.'Call Me by Your Name' Synopsis: In Northern Italy in 1983, seventeen year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet), begins a relationship with visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer) , his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape.We've seen love-stories before on Gay people, but not all leave the impact like 'Call Me by Your Name' does. This is an honest love-story about a boy and a man, who can't help but fall in love with each other, despite never coming to the world of their sexuality. And the way Director Luca Guadagnino has shot its leading lovers, is something to watch. There is genuine heartache in its characters & also undeniable love. This is a love-story, that's sad but also heartfelt at times. James Ivory's Screenplay is expertly written, offering a story on love & longing, without ever indulging into melodrama. Luca Guadagnino's Direction is simplistic, but extremely effective. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Cinematography captures the passion of its leading lovers, with gusto. Walter Fasano's Editing is mostly crisp. Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. Sufjan Stevens's Score is superb.Performance-Wise: Timothée Chalamet is truly the find of the year. The youngster delivers a searingly beautiful performance of a young man who comes to realize his sexuality to a much older man. Chalamet brings nuance & innocence to the part & stands out from start to finish. He's truly one actor who deserves strong Oscar buzz for his excellent work here. Armie Hammer also does his best work here. He and Chalamet share a infectious on- screen chemistry, that appears real & affecting. The Wonderful Michael Stuhlbarg is masterful as Chalamet's dad, who understands his son beyond his silences. Watch him in the penultimate moments & you'll know his caliber as a performer. Amira Casar as Chalamet's mom, also is lovely. Esther Garrel as Chalamet's girl, with whom he experiences sexual episodes, is fantastic.On the whole, 'Call Me by Your Name' leaves a strong impression. Make time for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly one of the best.,"It doesn't take a genius to understand nor appreciate this film. It does however, take an open mind to see and feel the beauty this film has to offer.

Chalamet charms but Hammer not,"Somewhere in Northern Italy, the Perlman family is excited about the arrival of Oliver (Armie Hammer). He's a grad student assisting professor Perlman over the summer in the 80's. The girls are all taken with handsome Oliver including the young son Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet). Elio is enticed by Oliver as his friend Marzia also gets closer to him.It's a film about a young gay boy's emotional first love. There are things that do pull me out of the movie. The first problem I had was that I assumed Marzia to be Elio's sister. It's connected to another problem. Marzia should be a bigger character. She's the pawn in their love chess game. She should start much more as a girlfriend leading to a more heated conflict. There may be a deliberate move by the movie to take the dramatic conflict out of this gay love story. It becomes more of an emotional drama for better and for worst. The other problem is that Oliver does not appeal to me. He's the preppy guy from an 80's teen dramedy. It's not the most endearing. Sometimes, that character can gain depth by going darker but that would be creepy in this case. It also threatens to be that older guy seducing a young boy. Don't get me wrong. There are some very touching emotional takes. The father's talk after Oliver's departure is very sincere and the last scene with Elio's tearful closeup is very emotional. I am taken with Timothée Chalamet and his youthful charms. I'm less taken with Armie Hammer. He continues to perplex me as an actor.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunning,"It is not often that films adapted from books capture the true essence, emotion and spirit of the book but for me Call Me By Your Name does just that. Superbly acted by a talented cast the film was a visual an emotional delight. Sensitively directed and beautifully shot with a great sound track what was not to like. For me it was a coming of age love story for Elio and something very special for Oliver. Simply calling it a gay movie does it a disservice. It is much, much more than that. While the whole cast were strong the two leads, Armie, and Timothee just had that magic on screen. And Timothee Chalamet's performance was stunning absolutely stunning. His closing scene will become a cinema classic. Don't be put off by the gay tag this is a beautiful love story, sensitively told that surly anybody can empathise with. Don't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Slow, Pretentious and Emotionally Disconnected","As a producer/director who specializes in gay genre movies, I was eager to see ""Call Me By Your Name"". The positive buzz about it further fueled my anticipation. What a disappointment! Handsome newcomer Timothee Chalamet turned out to be just about the only redeeming feature in an otherwise hollow and artificial waste of time.""Call Me By Your Name"" suffers from numerous fatal flaws: The main characters lack any believable ""chemistry"". Armie Hammer (Oliver) is a horrible actor with as much depth as a cardboard cutout. There is absolutely no effort to explain the attraction Elio has for aloof Oliver and visa versa - it seems to come from nowhere and for no reason. There are hints that each of the two main characters has special talents - intellectual Oliver and musical prodigy Elio - but those scenes seem out of place and contrived with no payoff in the plot. The weird request from which the movie gets it's title is spoken in a scene, but there is no explanation for it. It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere. If anyone said to me, ""Call me by your name"" after we just had sex, I'd say ""Later"" (this will be more amusing to those who have seen the movie). I haven't read the book, but the screenplay lacks any kind of conflict, which makes it BORING.The highlights are the beautiful Italian locations and Timothee Chalamet. I wouldn't bother to see it for any other reason.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Near masterful,"It's hard to put into words exactly the way I felt watching this film. Hours later it's hard to even begin to write my opinion on it. To put as simply as I can, the film perfectly captures its setting and atmosphere in a way few films do. The biggest credit needs to be given to director Luca Guadagnino, who is able to capture the smallest of details. Technically, the film is a marvel and I struggle to think of one flaw. It's beautiful, sensual, luscious in its execution, with absolutely marvelous pacing. In terms of pure directorial achievements, it's definitely one of the best of the year. The performance of Timothée Chalamet is also a pretty perfect portrayal of the character in the novel, and a completely internal performance that is reminiscent of Rooney Mara's wonderful work in Carol. Armie Hammer is also quite strong in the role, although it's a tricky character to get completely right. The novel is told completely through Elio's eyes and so we only imagine and see Oliver from a distance. He's more of an enigmatic figure in the novel than a real, tangible person. So much of that is due to the writing and the way Elio sees him as, so in terms of difficulty, I can imagine how Hammer had quite a task on his hands. Due to the literal nature of film, it's a type of character that always had to lose some of its mystery to its translation from the page, and it's as good one as can be.I have so much I want to say about this but still can't find the right words, but the one thing I will say is that while the story here is pretty simple, the film really does capture, more than any other in recent memory, the feeling of that fleeting force of love and passion that can come to define one's life. It does so in a melancholic, beautiful way that makes it stand out from others of its kind. I can see why some people wouldn't take to it (and in fact the almost-unanimous positive reviews surprise me) because at the end of the day, the technical aspects work to create a film that can only be defined by a feeling that some people will experience watching the film and that others won't. All that sounds incredibly enigmatic, but it's a difficult feeling to pinpoint and considering the film, I think it's fitting.",,Anonymous,Romance
Drags A Lot,"For some reason, I feel the need to review this film because it's not a terrible film but I was kind of let downThis film drags so much. One of the biggest issues is it's pace, it drags and goes on and on without much pay off or anything dramatic happeningA root of this problem is from the fact that there's barely any conflict in this filmThere aren't much challenges or hurdles, but since this is a self discovery film, that's a bit forgivable but the fact that there's not really any conflict at all or the problem that the film doesn't highlight that conflict until the very third act is problematicThe characters are also lacking something. Even though the film spends so much time developing the relationship between the two main characters and establishing their personalities, I never got the sense of knowing the characters or understanding what they were aboutIt's really messy and there's a lack of focus/direction and there are way too many distractionsThere are positives too. The film doesn't rely on exposition that much and the characters do a good job of expressing their emotion without using on the noise dialogue, and that's credit to some really great performances by Timothy Chalamet and Michel StuhlbergThe cinematography is also really good. And the soundtrack is amazing, they chose the right songs for the right scenes.What this film really had it going for itself is that it didn't feel like a film, it felt like a real life experience.But there are issues that made this film dull and kind of unbearable.It's not a bad film, I can appreciate it's positives but it didn't quite click with me, it's my least favorite oscar contender.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An Extraordinary, Extraordinarily Unforgettable Masterwork of Filmmaking","I loved ""A Bigger Splash"" (the previous film by Luca Guadagnino,) and was in awe by the trailer and stunning reviews for this film. Needless to say, my expectations were utterly shattered by this powerful, emotional, and gorgeous drama. It's one of the best films of the decade, and clearly the best film of the year so far.While this isn't the type of film with too many spoilers, I still don't want to give too much away. It's better to go into such a sublime film like this knowing less rather than more. What I will say is that the main plot concerns an adolescent man who is spending a summer in the 1980's with family in Lombardy, Italy. He begins having a relationship with an older man invited as a guest by the family played by Armie Hammer. The film's pacing is superb and lets the viewer genuinely meet these characters, who are bonded by both friendship and physical affection. This is clearly shown throughout the movie, as the chemistry between the two leads is excellent.But what makes ""Call Me By Your Name"" such a phenomenal film is its gripping sense of feeling. Viewers truly feel that they are away from where they are viewing the film, and truly feel like they have been transported to 1980's Italy. Guadagnino is a masterpiece at eliciting senses, and the audience's sense of senses are used to full effect to simulate the true feelings of being in Italy. From luscious depictions of peaches and apricots grown in the countryside, to the streets in gorgeous Italian towns and the steamy espresso, every sight and sound in the film feels truly authentic and impactful on the viewer. I have not seen such an effective use of reflecting on audiences' senses to create a more immersive viewing experience in a film in years. The film's score is exceptional as well. It feels authentically Italian and beautifully emotional, especially when paired with the film's script in many scenes. The writing feels both authentic and intelligent at all times, and the film doesn't even manage to let its guard down in a single scene by failing to grip the viewer with its beautiful script. A late-film monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg is a particular highlight.As one can see from reading this review, this film is truly unforgettable and a brilliant trip to Italy. Its immersion in its setting and characters remind us of the focal point of cinema: to expose the viewer to unique settings and opportunities and to transport them to these opportunities through the language of film. Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are no words to describe it.,"Just finished watching Call Me by Your Name, and yes, I'm a little late. I'm just going to start by saying that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen in my whole life. There are so many factors that play a central role in my final judgment, and of course I'm gonna analyse and talk about them, but being an italian boy who grew up in southern Italy, there are a lot of references that make this movie a masterpiece.As in every movie ever made, detail plays an important role, if not the most important one. I'm not going to talk about every single of them but I want to share the feelings they made me feel and talk about their actual importance. From the languages spoken, the music, the fabulous landscapes, to the interns of the house, the floor, the very old forniture, the books.. all things that bring me back to my childhood and make me smell again the pleasant atmosphere of my grandparents' house. From this point of view, the cinematic representation was completely accurate, and I'm very sure this process was also helped by the director himself, and his italian memories.Let's spend some time talking about the actors' performances. Timothée delivered his best performance so far, no wonder why he was nominated at the Oscars. He really dove into the character, and I can say that if I watch the details of his facial expressions. The details made me feel even more connected to the character, who slowly evolved through the course of the movie.
Everyone was phenomenal in this movie, from Armie Hammer to the fantastic Michael Stuhlbarg.This movie can rapidly become very very personal, and it touches your soul. It did it to me. There are some things and feelings that unfortunately can't be explained. It was an amazing experience. Definitely steals a place in my top 3. I think the movie is perfect.

A sensual love story that inflames the heart.,"""Call Me by Your Name"" is an hypnotically beautiful coming of age drama that surpasses the cliché of the 'queer film' as overwrought naval-gazing depression fantasy full of sleazy sex, instead celebrating the intoxicating passion of youthful love with tender sensuality. Set in 1983, it details the sexual awakening of a precocious teenager named Elio, who is besotted with the arrival of a handsome older student, Oliver, who comes to stay at his family's pastoral Italian villa for the summer.As they both lounge listlessly in the sun-drenched Lombardian countryside, swimming and cycling to coffee shops, the first half of the film dances an artful choreography of stolen glances, innuendo and mixed signals as the pair try to work out where the other's feelings lie. When the two finally realize their desire for one another and become lovers, it is with the bittersweet understanding that they must part ways at summer's end, when Oliver returns to America. This is the only real source of tension in the story. Despite Oliver and Elio's discretion in their affair, there is no obvious homophobic backdrop or bullying influence around them. Indeed Elio's cultured, cosmopolitan parents are both very thoughtful and accepting people, even hinting to Elio quite early on that he can speak to them about anything.So how does a film with no major conflict keep us engaged and invested in the relationship? By making us fall in love with it. Luca Guadagnino's entrancing direction lowers the defenses with a languid pace and indulgent cinematography that soothes and seduces. The atmosphere is heady with the carefree exuberance of youth which we so long to experience again. This is the summer we wished we had. At times it seems almost absurdly idyllic; The cynic in me was ready to scoff at the hyper-sophistication of Elio's wealthy, scholarly, multi-lingual family who spend their time discussing politics, citing poetry and transcribing Bach. Elio's teenage friends seem to be comprised of a posse of French and Italian Lacoste models. You might think who could possibly relate to this? Nonetheless I was gradually swept away by the blissful escapism, almost feeling like I was there at times.The cast are all superb. Armie Hammer, while looking a bit older than his character's 24 years, is such a commanding presence as Oliver, with his statuesque good looks and resonant voice. He gives him that strong, confident worldly charm that is so instantly beguiling to young Elio. Michael Stuhlberg and Amira Casar as Elio's parents are benevolent, nurturing forces. But the true standout here is Timothee Chalamet. With his big soulful eyes he navigates all of the complexity of Elio's emergent feelings, imbuing him with a feline sensuality one minute and naive emotional fragility the next.The scenes of sex are not gratuitous, with the director choosing instead to focus on the erotic build up, the playful kissing and teasing, the tender touches. It all feels so honest and natural, two characters just completely being themselves and loving one another for it. I was completely enthralled by Oliver and Elio's relationship, and found myself sad to not have experienced one just like it. I also couldn't help but be sad as I contemplated the tender transience of youth, for which the peach is a symbol. By the time the heartbreaking final scene rolled out I was sobbing, full of nostalgia for my own teenage years, the time I wasted and chances not taken.Go see this film and allow yourself to feel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Living and breathing young and carefree love.,"Elio (Timothee Chalamet) stays with his parents at their Italian villa, on the northwestern part of the Italian countryside, for the summer break. He meets newcomer Student (Armie Hammer) and they fall in love. In just some weeks they are captivated by one another and go on an adventure of love, laughs and carefree relaxation during an idyllic Italian summer.You, as the viewer, get to feel and see every thing that is the Italian countryside and alongside you also get to feel Elio's desires and fears.Elio's chance encounter with Oliver is ""one in a million"" chance encounters. When two young souls feel the way Oliver and Elio feel, something truly special happens.The way they look and feel for each other moved us all. As their emotions shift from one state to another, so do their actions. From their heartbreaking or hot as hell embraces to their honest talks about things that should not be said, you can't help but feel moved and connected to them.Thus, as they don't want to let go, so do you. That's the beauty of this film. You are connected with them both. In the end you have to let go but you also got to be a part of their adventure and indirectly felt something only a few people have felt. The power of love is the most beautiful as well as the most heart wrenching thing.In addition, the portrayal of gay love without daring to pronounce not even once the word gay isn't needed at all because the director knew very well how to convey it and i believe almost all of the people who have watched the movie, independent of their sexual orientation and beliefs, knew and felt Oliver and Elio's love for one another.This movie united us and let us be a part of what Oliver and Elio felt and experienced with each other. And that's what matters.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What an wonderful love story!,"Call Me by Your Name (2017) was one of my first introductions to Luca Guadagnino and this movie is definitely among one of his best movies to date.Positives for Call Me by Your Name (2017):
The relationship between Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet is the heartbeat of the movie. This is one of the best natural and slow burn relationships I've seen in any movie. It's also worth noting that this movie was my introduction to Timothee Chalamet and now I'm seeing him in these big budget movies like Wonka and the two Dune movies. I also have to give some credit to Armie Hammer for his performance here which is a big shame given that we wouldn't be seeing him in movies again. And finally, this movie does a fantastic job at portraying queer and gay relationships and that's something a lot given my limited experience with these type of movies.Overall, Call Me by Your Name (2017) is a fantastic coming-of-age movie and a wonderful romance movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Based on a second viewing,"The movie like so many people have experienced is great the first time around.

"Yes, Italy is beautiful","I finally saw this Oscar nominee (just one week before the award show!) and I was so disappointed - it was long, slow, and not very romantic. And I don't think a director should get any credit for making Italy look beautiful! Apparently in the book, Oliver is 24, but Armie Hammer is 31, and he looks it, and his age is rather distracting because the relationship borders on inappropriate already, but those extra years make the relationship even less appealing. The men take forever to connect and it's not like you're really rooting for them. Elio is a spoiled brat who spends most of his time glowering at everyone. He even expresses his desultory attitude to Oliver in an early conversation - he clearly has no idea how privileged he is, to lounge around Italy all summer, doing whatever he wants, unaccountable to his indulgent parents. As an audience member, I wasn't very invested in his getting his supposed heart's desire. Nor did the men have much chemistry. Oliver says late in the movie, ""I love the way you say things."" I thought, what? How many conversations did they even have? Mostly they road bikes, and went swimming, and laid in the grass. Elio's father speech, which so many consider a highlight of the film, I found contrived - like what the writer imagined his father would say, or what he wished his father had said - about how pure his love with Oliver was. I have seen many films that I think portray that first love experience in a more compelling way for the audience (I would strongly recommend Beautiful Thing if you're a fan of this genre). I gave it 5 stars for boldness and great performances. The very best movie of the year? Um, no. I was expecting something much more charming and moving.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Summer loving'... had me a blast,"Luca Guadagnino made quite an impression on me as a filmmaker with A Bigger Splash, a film that combined an engaging narrative with some fantastic performances. With his latest film, Call Me by Your Name, Guadagnino certainly has the potential to repeat the trick and deliver more of the same.When Oliver (Armie Hammer), a graduate student, arrives to stay with the family of his professor in northern Italy, he meets Elio (Timothée Chalamet), his professor's son. What follows is a summer full of music, food and romance that will forever change their lives.Rather impressively, Luca Guadagnino follows A Bigger Splash with just as an engaging film however, he shows a much softer hand when dealing with the sensual nature of a film such as Call Me by Your Name. It truly is a beautiful piece of cinema, Guadagnino's direction of the intimate coming-of-age narrative being a real triumph.There's some genuinely fantastic dialogue included in the screenplay written by Guadagnino, James Ivory and Walter Fasano. The subtlety of the comedy is great but it's the poignancy of the words when relationships come into play that will stay with the audience, particularly a moment shared between Elio and his father towards the end of the film. It's silently powerful stuff.Coming to the performances, Call Me by Your Name features two leads in Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer who share such a natural and fitting chemistry. It felt much like that shared between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in Carol, effortless and becoming much more impactful as a result. Chalamet in particular has a very bright future ahead of himself. There's also a fine performance from Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's father to look out for, balancing the comedy and emotion expertly.I expect people to make comparisons between Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight given the nature of their subject matter however, I'd rather not see people try and play them off against one another because they both deserve such high praise. Being in the company of such a film is a major achievement for a film like Call Me by Your Name.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the Most Beautiful Movies Ever Made,"This movie captures every feeling a teenager can possibly feel within the span of two hours and ten minutes. The music plays into the movie so perfectly to the extent that it would take away from the beauty of it all if the music was different. It's been said before but, without spoilers, the end credits are so overwhelming and emotional. If Timothée Chalamet doesn't win an Oscar for his role as Elio then people will be extremely upset for him, myself included. His work here is undoubtedly the most realistic and truthful performance I have ever seen in my life. Oliver, played flawlessly by Armie Hammer, becomes a counterpart of Elio and it is striking to see the two become so close. This movie does take its time, but it is so natural that it doesn't affect the film's impact whatsoever. Elio and Oliver's chemistry feels so palpable and unscripted. Often in romantic films the script is written so that the characters act or speak in a way that directly and forcibly pulls the heartstrings. With Call Me By Your Name, however, it's as if you are watching a beautiful and giddy relationship unfold in front of your eyes. Every emotion felt by Elio is felt by the audience. The last third will completely drain you of emotion, particularly one scene with Michael Stuhlbarg. Along with the emotion felt while viewing the film, it also manifests your thoughts afterwards and hits you harder and harder as time goes on. Rush to see this as soon as you can; it is not only the best movie this year, but one of the best movies ever made and a timeless classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cinema hasn't left me like this in a long time,"It's almost hard to describe, but I find it so rare for a piece of cinema to be so encapsulating and immersive whilst maintaining a subtly and serenity that seems dichotomous. There is an underarching theme, as described in a scene with Oliver and Dr. Perlman analyzing the slides of figures from antiquity, where the figures themselves are formed almost entirely in curves, evoking a sensuality that almost demands desire. Throughout the movie, there is this undertone of sensuality that somehow maintains this innocence and intimacy that feels nearly impossible to capture on screen. The relationship that develops between Elio and Oliver feels both tenuous and inevitable and explores homosexuality in a way that feels natural and emotional.The best way I can describe my feelings about this movie is that there's this feeling of unfamiliar nostalgia, like reading an old book about an ancient civilization in my grandpa's musty library. I can visualize with my senses what that centuries-old villa smells like in the backdrop of the Italian countryside, how the air tastes, how the openness of the day feels. The serene environment provides the backdrop for emotional experiences to take hold and requires the viewer to sit quietly along as Elio's self-discoveries and heartbreak feel as raw as if they were your own. I cannot recommend this movie enough, and I am just disappointed I didn't get around to seeing it sooner.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In this film, all characters appear very real, and they connect with each other and with the viewers. I like the fact that the story is delivered in a understated, or even muted manner. The pacing is slow, which gives time for feelings to develop and sink in with the viewers. The final scene is just super effective, it makes me hold my breath to listen intently on what the father has to say.

Beautiful scenery but romance didn't click,"Sheesh Timothée Chalamet being super horny for 2 hours.Hmm this movie really didn't click for me despite how beautiful it looked. Each scene felt like part of a play that showed day by day of the characters. Unfortunately I felt pretty bored throughout the movie. Chalemet's character was very hormonal and I found it a bit much for my taste.As mentioned, the movie was a pure slice for life with subtle drama. Even though the two main boys were in mad love, they had to be secretive because not a lot of people tolerated the topic in 1983. Since I was pretty bored, I honestly didn't care much about the couple.Even though I didn't like the romance, I loved the music and the look of the town. Watching the beautiful scenery really made me want to live there, where I could enjoy the day with the calm music.Overall, despite how gorgeous the cinematography was, the romance didn't click it for me. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Perfect, sensual, simmering summer romance.","'Call Me by Your Name' is directed by Luca Guadagnino and written by James Ivory based on a novel of the same name by Andre Aciman. It is the story of a sophisticated and cultured seventeen year old named Elio (Timothee Chalamet) whom over the course of a gorgeous northern Italian summer experiences first love, romance and what it feels like to truly find oneself. He is on vacation with his parents at their beautiful 17th century villa spending his time writing and playing music and flirting with his girlfriend. His father Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is an archaeologist who specializes in Greco-Roman culture and his mother Annella (Amira Casar) is a translator. Every summer Mr. Perlman hires an assistant to help him with his work and this particular summer he brings in and American college graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) which completely throws off Elio's easy going behavior. Elio is immediately taken aback by the new arrival. Oliver is a tall, handsome, smart and good-natured young man and Elio's admiration for him begins as soon as they are introduced by Mr. Perlman. He spends as time with him as possible, wherever Oliver goes he goes and he attempts to court with unbeknownst to Oliver until he a certain scene when he subtly reveals his intentions. Eventaully they bond over such things as their friendship, their shared Jewish heritage and of course their summer romance. Subtle is actually one of the many words that describe this film very appropriately. Things are often said without words but simply through the performances of the amazing cast. Particularly Chalamet and Hammer who both give career best performances. Stuhlbarg as also shines in a few standout scenes especially towards the end of the movie.One of the things I like the most about this film is how the writer and director treats a gay romance. There have been countless movies about the victimization of gays and struggles they face which are also important when done correctly. However it is remarkably refreshing to watch a gay romance depicted just like any other. Elio is not persecuted in this movie for his sexuality, which is technically bi-sexual as he does have girlfriend at some points in the movie but nevertheless, he simply learns to deal with his emotions and how to express himself in an honest way. Another major strong achievement of 'Call Me by Your Name' is its ability to create a sense of mood thanks in large part to the cinematography, musical soundtrack and on- location production design. It enjoys a number of original songs which are very much complimentary to the themes present in the movie. They are topped off by 'Mystery of Love' by Sufjan Stevens. The movie moves along with a wonderful simmering pace, not too fast, not too sluggish. Thanks to this you legitimately feel like you are spending a whole summer with these characters and are just a fly on the wall observing their experiences.I honestly do not think that there is a single flaw with this movie and if there is I couldn't find it. It is immaculate from the first scene to the last. 'Call Me by Your Name' might not be the best movie of the year but it may just be the most perfect. It is a knockout and deserves every bit of praise and recognition it gets this awards season. I couldn't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Summer of love,"Luca Guadagnino has made a leisurely paced tender gay love story. It is adapted by James Ivory who touched on gay themes in films such as Maurice that Ivory directed. The village summer holiday setting also reminded me of Before Midnight, people eating alfresco, drinking wine and getting into discussions about art or relationships.Set in the summer of 1983 in Northern Italy. Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) is living in an idyllic house as he researches Greco-Roman artifacts. Each year he invites an intern, this summer Oliver (Arnie Hammer) arrives from America, he is 24 years old, clever, casual was easy going manner charms everyone around him. Both Pearlmans and Oliver are Jews. While Oliver wears a star of David, the Pearlmans are a bit more discrete in Italy. However they are a cultured family.The Pearlman's 17 year old son Elio (Timothee Chalamet) is musically gifted and like the rest of the family speaks several languages. Although Oliver easily finds it easy to get girls, while Elio rather gawkily tries to relate to them, as the summer wears on both become attracted to each other. Maybe rather awkwardly at first but it becomes more passionate.It is a sexual awakening for Elio, sowing of wild oats for Oliver, his last blush of youth. Elio's parents suspect that their is something blossoming between the two and tacitly approve of it. This is not a film that wants to cast eternal damnation to the protagonists, even though for Elio the ending is bittersweet. As the summer ends he knows Oliver will return to America.Call Me by Your Name is a literate film, it is slow, it is awkward, at times sensual.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely beautiful,"Not the kind of movie I would seek out or watch but it generated so much positive buzz and every time I came across something referring to it on YouTube or the interwebz, I would read people gushing praise and hurling adjectives at it.Decided to rent it off iTunes the one night as I had nothing to watch and I wasb't in the mood for reading or playing a game and I was spellbound right up until the end. This was one of the most moving and beautiful pictures I have ever seen. I was skeptical about the praise initially because as often is the case when something is hyped to the heavens, be it a book or a movie or a CD or a game, you are bound to end up being disappointed.Not here. Everything from the wonderfully lazy and meandering way this love story unfolds (just like I expect summer holiday to play out). to the gorgeous Italian landscape, to the outstanding soundtrack (the music is just as much a character in this film and the songs chosen elevate the entire film), to the performances from every single actor. While Chalamet is the breakout star here, and his work is exceptional for such a young actor, what surprised me the most was the depth and vulnerability on display from Armie Hammer, not somebody I would associate with this kind of delicate acting given his poster boy movie looks. I became an instant fan. Don't even get me started on Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue towards the end of the film. It felt like being hit by speeding train. It leaves you shattered.This movie is sublime and is now in my top 5 favorite films of all time.

Not Another Gay Movie!,"***watched for the 2018 oscars
Good god this took forever to get through. I kept pausing it because it just couldn't hold my attention. There was no reason for it to be as long as it was. It just felt like it was dragging on for hours with no real purpose for doing so. In its 132 minute runtime, it manages to be both uneventful and completely empty.Call me By Your Name is nothing other than just another gay movie. It does nothing to separate itself from other gay romance movies in the slightest. How is this any more than the male version of Blue is the Warmest Color?Isn't the entire plot of this borderline pedophilia? Like this kid is 17 having sex with a 24 year old, who by the way looks far older, probably more like 30 (which is how old Hammer was when this was shot). Either way, there is seemingly no chemistry between the lead actors.It's set in the 80's, but there is no noticeable stylization from that decade, or any other obvious reason for it to be set then. 
Much like this, a number of other elements just didn't seem to matter or have any effect on the plot line at all. Why was it set in Italy? Who knows. Why were the characters Jewish? Doesn't matter apparently.Gay porn is probably much more satisfying than this.",,Anonymous,Romance
languid love,"Coming of age film set over a long, lazy Italian summer. It will certainly influence your holiday plans. It builds the 1980s feel and romantic desire neatly. Tiny throwaway incidents (touches, glances) assume great importance. Chalamet is as good as he was in Ladybird.The Sunday supplement travel-brochure approach does start to grate though. Where are the consequences? Is the skin legion a portent of AIDS? The director is happy to show heterosexual oral sex, but pans away during gay lovemaking?As always with this genre, we are always aware that time is passing, that summer will soon end.

Every time I've read about it, Call me by your name has been put on a pedestal but it just didn't click for me. Very little of it felt believable, sure they might have liked each other but the love they felt, felt shallow and somewhat pretentious. The movie tries to make it out to be so much more than it actually was.It also felt so long, yes it's two hours long and slow paced but it felt so much longer. And for something that was that long there isn't as much dialogue, even more so meaningful dialogue that carried any weight. Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet did alright, but Michael Stuhlbarg was the only one who really drew my attention whenever he was on screen; and his conversation with Elio towards the end was the only aspect of the movie that lived up to expectation. The story was decent but felt like it was told surface level. Music was great. I just wanted to feel what the characters felt, the love, the rush, the mopes, the longing... that's what good movies do, yes?It just felt like a beautiful yet hallow film. Reading through what others who hold it in high regard's opinions on the movie makes me feel like either they probed too deeply to find more meaning where there wasn't much, or all the subtleties the film had just went unnoticed to me.

It is surely the Mystery of love 💫,"Call me by your name
...And I'll call you by mine.The words linger longer in your ears than the music ever will, the whole world will come to a quick pause the 130 minutes you sit down for the experience that Luca Guadagnino has created from the masterpiece Andrè Aciman produced in pages, Call me by your name.The story takes place ""somewhere in Northern Italy"". A coming-of-age tale of a 17 year old boy, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), who never knew what love was until his father's annual summer intern, Oliver (Armie Hammer) visits them in the summer of 1983. The initial part of the story is about Elio spending his summer with the locals and flirting with Marzia, his friend, feeling nothing but the impulse of a teenage boy until Oliver starts dancing to the same tune as Marzia. Elio's heart finally beats in rhythms, he feels alive, just like every person who watches this masterpiece would feel!Unravelling the Mystery of love!The love Elio and Oliver feels crawls into us in a way unclear to the mind, that we never get enough of the love they feel. The music by Sufjan Stevens (Mystery of Love, Visions of Gideon, Futile devices) in the movie also creates an ambiguity in the viewers that we will find ourselves craving for more of their love, each and every time we contemplate.Another factor that attracts us to this spectacular adaptation is the connection Elio has to his father and mother, especially his father. To the end of the movie we come across a monologue by Mr.Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) which will stay in our hearts forever knowingly or unknowingly, one which we will keep speculating, wondering why.In this era where 'Pride' is all about being proud about ones sexuality, desires and personality, this movie is a diamond shining in the dark of a homophobic society set in the earliest of times as a proof to the fact that being gay or not living according to the traditional gender norms is not a ""condition to be treated"" or simply a ""choice"".The walls in our hearts begin to fall apart when the walls separating Elio and Oliver start melting into the ocean of their love, unravelling the mystery of their love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Truly Beautiful Piece of Cinema,"This movie is truly beautiful. It is a work of artistic beauty in so many ways and I will enjoy watching it again many times in the future.The movie is slow in pace but this reflects the nature of time in the summer: slow, easy and free- flowing. There is nowhere to be at a specific time, no agenda to meet, just slow summer days and the beauty that comes with being this at ease. I think that is one of the beautiful elements within the film: it reflects this Italian/European lifestyle which perhaps we should all think more seriously about, as what is life when you are constantly rushing to meet this deadline or catch this certain train when you compare it to the life of living out in the rustic countryside, eating fresh fruit and swimming in the local river? I know the film is set in the 80's, but that is not to say people today still do not live like this at least part of the year.Anyway, from someone who has never seen a LGBT based movie before, I felt a bit unprepared and as if I had nothing to compare it to. Although by the end of the film I really didn't feel I needed to as the love story transcends any artificial labels to simply express a pure and innocent tale of first love that is rarely as genuinely portrayed within cinema. I think both Chamalet and Hammer did wonderful jobs in their performances, balancing the innocence and curiosity of Elio with the experience and desire of Oliver. Chamalet in particular, I believe, as a younger actor, brought a great deal of raw emotion into his performance which really enhances the whole film overall.The beautiful landscapes combined with the focus on the Italian lifestyle brings another wonderful element to the film and really helps to complete the story. The symbolism within the film, with the ripe peaches, also builds on the artistic direction of the film that is sure to make it a possible contender for the awards season next year. I certainly hope that the film wins at least for Best Foreign Film, yet I would hope that it would garner wider recognition and very much hope that Chamalet is considered for Best Actor. The speech by Elio's father at the end of the film, played by the talented Mr Micheal Stuhlbarg, is very moving and really has a wonderful message in the end I think that challenges us all to think about how we live our lives and how we judge others.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was really moved by this film,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film as I'd never seen any of the director's previous films, but I have to say I was emotionally blown-away. All of the performances were really solid, in particular the lead character played by Timothy Chalamet was a truly unforgettable performance which will stay with for a very long time, perhaps forever.The story is often over-simplified to one of love/lust between the two male leads but there is so much more to it that that. It's about self-doubt, self-discovery, self-identity and how those are all wrapped up in those around us and how those we care about view us. The setting and world this film creates is like a wonderful, sun-drench postcard come to life in the best way possible. It's a complex story beautifully expressed in this film which I consider necessary viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A boring and overlong erotic film,"""Call me by your name"" should the most overrated and undeserved movie in the year 2017. It is so boring that you just keep wondering when it could end. Besides, there are plenty of sex scenes which essentially make the film an erotic one.",,Anonymous,Romance
Lots of thinly veiled homophobia in here..,"Some of these reviewers think there is a bigger age gap than there actually is. 
At the time of production in 2016 the actors were 21 and 29, and they obviously depict people younger than their actual years, and that is aside from the fact that the age of consent in Italy is 14.From what I can see the people making these remarks seem to be stemming from homophobia, and trying to turn a love story into a predatory horror. They ought travel outside of their own borders once in a while, and realise that their hate stems from nothing but bigotry. No doubt if the age gap were smaller they would find something else to be disgusted with. Thank goodness we don't live in America.That aside, this is a wonderfully beautiful film that draws everyone watching back to their first love, the passion, euphoria and then the pain of the loss as the world just carries on. The production values and direction are excellent, and I would go so far to say that this was easily the most engaging and emotional love story I have ever seen depicted in film by a country mile as not a single viewer will watch it and not think back to their own first love, so the journey the characters go on becomes very personal for the viewer too.Rarely does a film like this come along, perhaps only a handful in a generation, if that. Movie-goers who prefer chick flicks and marvel movies will probably be get bored early on, as the drama and engagement from this movie stems not from outlandish and unbelievable special effects, or shocking twists and turns, but from emotional depth and personal experience. Rarely can a film be so entirely predictable and yet completely mesmerising.I simply can not recommend this film enough, and can tell you right now that it has set a mile marker for future movies, and will be discussed and dissected for decades to come.My only slightly negative comment would be the choice and placement of some of the soundtrack, although that is a matter of taste.10/10 without a doubt.

a e s t h e t i c,"This is a movie that I wish I could live in. And Mr. Guadagnino does a fantastic job at vicariously placing you within the film already through how sensual and real life it feels. That's the most incredible piece of this movie - being able to feel the sun warm the backs of your arms, the sweat developing between your back and the weirdly uncomfortable lawn chair, the smell of an old paperback lying open on the arm, and the sweet nectar of an apricot squirting into and out of your mouth. It's an environment that feels almost palpable, and rarely do settings feel this much as if they are a character. And the organic nature happens to carry through in the camerawork, oftentimes being voyeuristic as you peer into these lives, and the character interactions and decisions. People feel real, although the dialogue may lack a little bit, and really, the impeccable acting by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer and the rest of the cast more than outweigh that gripe. And the use of symbolism throughout this film felt wholly unique (at least to me - I haven't seen some used in this way ever).
The aesthetic qualities of this movie are no doubt astounding and are what truly make this film special, but there were a few pieces to the story that held it back from being something that I completely loved. Probably most notably the fact that the story is a little generic. It won't really spoil the story, but you can already picture how the film will run if I say that it's a gay/lesbian film. Doubt, ""clandestine"" sexual meetings, spilling the beans, I mean it's all here. Beach Rats was another film from 2017 I saw and I loved how it took a refreshing take to a somewhat monotonous genre. Every sort of experience with coming out and becoming who you want to be is different, so I can't help but question why so many films end up having the same framework as Blue is the Warmest Color. Secondly, I felt the transition from the first half to the second was a little jarring and out of left field. They had hints at something bubbling, and maybe some were too subtle for me to catch, and I knew it was coming eventually, but it really took me by surprise because I wasn't expecting it at the time it came. And my last gripe is with the father's monologue at the end where he's telling Chalamet's character about acceptance and whatnot, but my oh my, it honestly would have felt more natural if the father broke the fourth wall and just started talking directly to the audience. It became waaaay too obvious very quickly that the message was meant for everyone in the audience to hear, not just his character. Disguising this better or thinking of a better way to implement the ideas, because they weren't necessarily things I disagreed with, could have given this film a very uplifting ending. So while the structure of this film is not perfect, I think it almost makes up for it enough in the environment department to make this a film I completely love. Regardless, it is still one of the best movies of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful tragedy,"With the range of emotions shown in the closing titles, Timothée Chalamet has made a remarkable statement that he has some flair for acting and that he is as perfect with his experessions as he is with the dialogues and his body language in this film.Call Me by Your Name is the story of the 17 year old kid discovering himself and it has been portrayed successfully. Apart from the obvious relationship this movie was about, the one between the kid and his father was much more beautiful. The ending monologue delivered by Elio's father was one of pure wisdom and near perfect expressions.
The movie is set in Europe so you'd expect the beautiful settings and the movie gets a one hundred score in that. The music throughout the film was Melodious. But where it was slack was the character of Oliver. Maybe mis cast, maybe not clear writing but something about his character is just so unsatisfactory. However, you feel for Elio all the times and you might find yourself shedding a tear or two for him at times.Almost solely due to his performance, Timothée has given life to this movie and made it one of the good coming of age movies out there !",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Masterpiece,"There isn't much of a conventional plot here, but that's what makes this movie stand out. The whole of it feels like a warm-regarded memory of a lazy, sunny holiday in the heavenly Italian countryside. It's a refreshing dip into a different type of culture; one that is rich in history and etymology and music. The cinematography lends itself to the scenery and architecture; everything is so bright, so alive. The fleeting nature of beauty and thirst for life seems to be constant themes in this film. Mr. Perlman says it wonderfully: ""How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it."" Chalamet was nominated for his performance, and he absolutely earned it. He switches seamlessly between three languages - English, French, and Italian- he plays Bach in three, distinct styles, and there are many scenes that are composed of nothing more than him emoting his feelings and woes, but he does so with elegant grace. Hammer does a great job of showing the inner qualms Oliver has about starting a relationship with someone younger- the moral ambiguity here is honestly what makes the film interesting, and Hammer does a great job subtlety and silently wrestling with this. The ever-underappreciated Michael Stuhlbarg is wonderful as Elio's father. I would actually say the best scene in the whole film is between Stuhlbarg and Chalamet (the scene near the end on the couch, for those who have seen it).This film does a wonderful job of showing us an unforgettable summer in Italy; it is a culturally rich masterpiece, one I'd be happy to dive into again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Summer of gay love,"After years of famine this is feast year for gay picture-goers: two gay love stories in two months. Scripted by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture and subtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer at his parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (Arnie Hammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeological research. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who, reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion is bound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.The two leads give deeply felt performances and the spirit of the 1980s – musically and morally – is delicately evoked. Elio's dad (Michael Stuhlbarg, a near double for Robin Williams), supportive and non-judgmental, is the dad any gay teenager would yearn to have.Cinematography and the music score are superb. At two and a quarter hours the movie is a tad too long and slow to take off, but the intensity of this love story exceeds GOD'S OWN COUNTRY and is very much the equal of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The mood reminded me very much of Joseph Losey's THE GO-BETWEEN (1971). A movie not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Moving And Poetic Drama,"Not to single out this particular premise, but films revolving around gay couples have been terrific over the last decade or so. There was a spark when 2005's Brokeback Mountain was released, which eventually brought us to foreign films like Blue Is the Warmest Colour being nominated for a Golden Globe or Moonlight winning best picture at the Oscars. Call Me by Your Name is the latest film to probably receive many nominations in the coming months, and believe me, the praise is not false. Being a fan of 2015's A Bigger Splash, I was looking forward to Luca Guadagnino's follow-up feature film, and I believe this to be an improvement in the best ways. Exploring the hardships of life and what it means to just kick back and relax every now and then, Call Me by Your Name is a film that's been sticking with me since my viewing of it. While it admittedly won't be able to draw in everyone to the theatres, here is why I believe this to be a fantastic, award-worthy picture.Written by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name follows a family that lets Oliver, an older graduate student, live in their home for the summer. While this is a common thing, what's not too common is that Elio, their son, will eventually grow romantic feelings toward this man, convincing him to become his lover for the summer. From the age gap between them and having to hide it from the family, their situation isn't an easy one, nor will it be for some audience members, but it really is a wonderful story. This is easily a story that could've stirred up controversy if it hadn't been done with taste, and because of how it was made, I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. This was made entirely possible by the incredibly devoted performances by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer.Hammer has had his ups and downs through the years, appearing in Oscar-winning films as well as some of the worst films of the year, so his performance here was the most shocking to me. Yes, he's been talent in nearly everything he's been in, but he really gave his all in this performance and I honestly don't think he'll ever be better than he was in Call Me by Your Name. On the other hand, young Chalamet has a very bright future ahead of him. Being a relatively new actor, his chemistry with Hammer was impeccably astounding. Their relationship took a while to grow on me, but once it completely won me over, I found myself wondering if there was anything to really complain about.If I had to complain about anything, it would be in its extreme pressure to try your patience. There are very long sequences of silence, making you relax and take in either a romantic moment or the scenery around them, which I also found poetic at the same time, so I actually have trouble coming up with issues, but I have to admit that I did find the movie slow at times. Yes, it's meant to be slow, which is why that complaint isn't exactly valid, but I just have to be honest.In the end, this is a truly remarkable piece of dramatic filmmaking and there are some very memorable scenes that keep replaying themselves in my head. One scene in particular that involves Elio and his father Mr. Perlman (played magnificently by Michael Stuhlbarg) toward the end had me in tears. From the brilliantly written screenplay, to the poetic cinematography, to the terrifically calm direction, Call Me by Your Name isn't a movie that I would send the average moviegoer out to see, but if you're a hardcore film fan, I think you'll end up loving this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gorgeous movie,"The cinematography is gorgeous, sceneries, nature, aesthetics and everything in between is genuinely exquisite.

An ode to idleness and latent feelings,"This film has lots of strengths and pleasant moments (particularly leading performance, beautiful landscape, capture of mood of the period), but it is too focused on the main character and some scenes just add duration being not inevitably necessary. And again, like in many films with ""controversial"" topic, a minor is depicted by and adult (catchily, but still), and the creators´desire to give the audience various food-for-thought and enchance romantic moments has significantly blurred the motives of the main characters to act as they did.Sorry, but in general nothing really special to me, I can name dozens of more interesting films or series on related topic.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I never review movies but.....,"I completely do not understand how this movie got such good reviews. The characters in this movie did not fit at all. Oliver looked more like 34 not 24 and Elio seemed more than confused. The connection between the characters was unclear and seriously lacked chemistry. I tried really hard to like this film but the girlfriends and the families maid or whatever she was could have been played by wooden props, they lacked so much dimension. Elio's girlfriend was just a sexual prop to develop what story line?? I felt far worse for her than i did him, How humiliating to have sex with a person you really like only for him to be secretly having a sexual affair and not at all interested in your feelings at all. I understand how a story like this could be romantic to some but it also seemed wildly confusing and painful (remember that summer I had sex with that grown man who got married and still calls me?) That seems incredibly painful. Also all the reference to ancient greek art played into this theme of the older man with young boy thing that left a foul taste in my mouth.

Absolutely Baffled By Its Near-Unanimous Praise,"Heading into Call Me By Your Name with high expectations after hearing so many great things about it, I have to admit that I'm quite baffled by the near-unanimous praise it has garnered since its premiere. Tedious, overlong & painfully boring, this coming-of-age romance is one hell of a disappointment.Set in 1980s Italy, the story of Call Me By Your Name follows Elio; a young kid on the cusp of adulthood who's instantly smitten by Oliver, his father's new assistant who will be sending the summer with them. As the two begin spending more time with each other, a beautiful bond blossoms between them.Directed by Luca Guadagnino, this is my first stint with his works and while I do find the simplicity & purity of its tender romance a plus, the lethargic pace at which it all unfolds makes the entire experience a very frustrating sit. Sure it allows more space for the characters to breathe but there's nothing about them that's compelling.Wandering aimlessly for the most part with no sense of direction, it had me wishing for the end around the halfway mark only. The film does find its sure footing during the final act but it takes too long to get there and the interest is already lost by that time. Its soothing camerawork & serene setting do help but even they can't fill the emptiness that lies in between.Performances on the other hand are commendable. The film packs a reliable cast in Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer, Michael Stuhlbarg & others, with Chalamet impressing the most with an emotionally complex input and is at his best during the final frames. Hammer leaves a mark of his own while Stuhlbarg chips in with good support and his final monologue is the only moment that resonated with me.On an overall scale, Call Me By Your Name is a deceptively simple, melancholic & uncontaminated portrait of first love that seems to have won over everyone but left me indifferent for the most part. At least those couple songs by Sufjan Stevens are mesmerising. There's no denying that Timothee Chalamet is a revelation here but if you're not already invested in his character's journey, then Call Me by Your Name is going to be one excruciating cinematic experience.",,Anonymous,Romance

My predictions for Call me By your Name - Full Oscar sweep for 2018 - a fantastic film!,"This is not the first movie of its type for there have been many similarly made gay themed films of this caliber.

Your will want to watch this film several more times after your first time to better digest the beauty of the cinematography, perfect story and acting. It as sweeping movie that you will not soon forget. Expect many Oscar nominations and even a best actor nomination for Armie Hammer. After several days thinking about this film, I remembered another Italian film that I saw that had a very similar premise, albeit a more controversial one called ""The Flavor of Corn"" (Il sapore del grano) Starring Lorenzo Lena as a university student assigned to teach at a remote northern Italian small town. One of his students becomes obsessed with him ""puppy love"". It is controversial and extremely touching at the same time with a heartbreaking ending.

It's not for everyone!! ....this is only my opinion.. WATCH IT PLEASE,"I have rarely seen a film with such high ratings.This 2017 film of the book of the same title by is going to become a Classic, an iconic film of it's time. The book will no doubt be used for English Literature in schools for
A Level within a few years, if it's not already. Such a rare chemistry between the two main actors (it will offend some people, those who are both prudes and priggish).It is a lovely tale..told beautifully and with such sensitivity to the 'subject matter' of the book giving the characters in the film the ability to shine. There is not one bad scene.The scenery itself is as stunning as the acting mostly taking part in Northern Italy in high summer and part in the winter too.There is humour, pathos, happiness and sadness too. One or two scenes will obviously offend even distress those weak and lacking in compassion in our society. But what those unfortunate souls will not realise is that this story took place in the early 1980's not much more than a decade after the subject of male love was altered in law in the late 1960's. One particularly simple scene but stunningly beautiful in its simplicity and delivery between Elio and his father right at the end of the film is worth watching in detail. Acted superlatively by both.It's one of those films that flies under the radar and was missed by most (including myself, I only discovered it by accident when I was trawling through films to watch late into last night instead of worrying and fretting over my wife being post operative in hospital).If you haven't seen it, I would urge you to... just be attentive to detail and open minded .....oh and have a box of tissues with you.P.

An Atmospherc and Beautiful Summer Romance,"A sensual romance about a boy who finds himself through the discovery of another.Luca Guadagnino's third chapter in his desire trilogy, following I am Love (2009) and A Bigger Splash (2015) is Call Me By Your Name, a novel arbitrary love tale between two young men in the shimmering summer of 80s Italy. A romantic drama pealing back the layers of its Romeo and ""Juliet"" in a elementary yet bewildering fashion.In the 80s suburban Italy, 17 year old Elio ( Timothée Chalamet) and his parents unwind for their summer lounge, when Oliver (Armie Hammer) a 24 year old academic arrives at the families home to work along side Elio's father Lyle (Michael Stuhlbarg). While Elio's first impressions of the strapping American are sower, Elio's enchantment with Oliver blossoms a beautiful friendship between the two and then as the drama proceeds a romantic one.Guadiagnio's vision of a summer love affair is one to truly be admired by the way Call Me By Your Name eases you into a conceivable relationship. Instead of your traditional love at first sight films. Call Me By Your Name has the confidence to take its time with the characters to produce a remarkable layered character journey. From this we are given the perspective of Elio's world and his flourishing growth as young man, before his world is truly altered by his contact with Oliver. The film is more a coming age of story of Elio as well as a romance.Obviously the coursing heartbeat of the film is the central characters relationship as it blossoms from the very start to finish, an amazing master work in romantic story telling to say the least. As Elio and Oliver converse over music, philosophy and archaeology, the two's connection is thickened in the company of each other, and of us the audience as well. This is wonderfully transcribed in James Ivory's script beautifully adapted from André Aciman's book. Although Elio is our main window into this romance, both characters are as equal as each other, as the title implies.Real masters giving life to this tale is the cast themselves. A fabulous ensemble performance by all participants in a warm welcoming environment, usually found unfamiliar in this narrative context. From Michael Stuhlbarg's wise Lyle passionate about his love of archaeology that he shares with Oliver, while also being a passionate father to Elio guiding him in his journey as a youth. Armie Hammer's Oliver is scene stealing charming puzzle which along side Elio we are trying to unravel. Hammer brings forth an exceptional performance which is already ringing potential Oscar bells. Although those bells better be ringing louder for the true standout performance of Timothée Chalamet. Chalamet brings a marvellous collection of young but also mature character in Elio trying to decipher his own identity which becomes all the more clear when he meets Oliver. A major break out performance hopefully to set Chalamet on the path of even greater work.What moulds Call Me By Your Name is its glistening flavour is its exotic summer presence in honourable landscape beauty of Italy, tenderly caught by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's cinematography. A strong throwback to the hot summer just gone, as we now enter the cold winter. A lavish film in its own right, seriously a film to really immerse in with its exotic atmosphere while, pouring its heart out in the characters.Call Me By Your Name is the most remarkable drama of the year, if you believe in any love story this year let it be this one, as your swept in a fantastic voyage of discovering love for the first time.

Call Me by Your Name,"Amidst some beautiful Italian rusticity, we are introdcued to the ""Perlman"" family. It's the father (Michael Stuhlbarg) who has employed American ""Oliver"" (Armie Hammer) to help out with some research, and that involves living-in with his family of wife ""Annella"" (Amira Casar) and teenage son ""Elio"" (Timothée Chalamet) at their villa. Initially, they just call him ""later"" as that's his most often used expression as he takes his leave, but gradually they take to this man who appears to have depths that bely his slightly friendly but diffident attitude. It's the young ""Elio"" who seems most smitten. He's only seventeen but has a maturity that seems beyond his years as he uses his own substantial polyglot intellect to engage with their visitor. Though he's flirting like mad with his childhood friend ""Marzia"" (Esther Garrel) it's quite clear that his relationship with ""Oliver"" is passing the infatuation stage and heading into uncharted territory for both men - and the onlooking parents. With the sun shining, the wine flowing and the swimming tempting, Luca Guadagnino now takes us on a beautifully crafted story that is more than a rite of passage, or a typical ""coming of age"" drama - it's a love story that I felt at times was joyous and optimistic and yet, ultimately, somewhat cruel. The outwardly confident ""Elio"" has been raised in a loving and tactile family environment and so finds this emotional exposure he now faces both exhilarating and terrifying, and the sylphlike Chalamet really does deliver that vulnerability - and playfulness - like an experienced hand, whilst Hammer walks a path that I was never quite sure of. Is he just playing games with the young man, does he really care? Is it all just to pass the time during his visit or it it more? The location settings are gorgeous and the combination of a sparing script from James Ivory and some poignantly mixed musical themes ranging from Bach to Giorgio Moroder contribute to an aesthetic that is both ideally sheltering and yet hot-blooded at the same time. This is a film that seems to get better with age, and for just over two hours we are immersed in something that's really quite natural.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the best film,"This film was released in 2017. This is about LGBT, especially homosexual love. Although the film is set in 1980s Italy, I consider its content to be very contemporary. All of the depictions in this work are beautiful and provide a very good look at southern Italy in the summer. The casting is good, and one can observe the Italian landscape and fashion of the time. I feel that my view of LGBT has changed a lot through this film. I can't express it clearly, but if I had to, I would say that it has broadened my horizons. It is one of the best films for me, not only because of the content of the film, but also because it changed my thinking. Although I regret that I was not able to see the film in theaters, I hope that many people will see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lack of chemistry,"Unfortunately, I didn't feel the chemistry between the protagonists. When Elio starts ""confessing his feelings"" (I had to rewatch that scene 3-4 times to understand that this what he was doing) to Oliver, it caught me by complete surprise, because nothing till that point showed that something was going on between them.I liked the second part better, and I absolutely loved the music, the photography and the way the film brought to life my childhood summers, spend indolently reading, sleeping and swimming while eating juicy apricots and peaches in the countryside.All in all, it was a nice enough movie, but far from the mastepiece I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Celebration of Love and Mankind,"Call Me by Your Name is one of the few films I will claim is literally perfect. Not so long time ago, I watched another French gay film called Jonas. If Jonas, taunting in its nature, stands for the danger of love, Call Me by Your Name is then a celebration of love.The first thing I noticed going into the movie was it's color shade. Unlike a lot of the other ""artistic"" films, it is not too warm nor too cold. Basically, what it does is to retain every scenes exactly the way we will see with our bare eyes in real life. The tone is controlled so well throughout the whole movie that you cannot help but to be deeply immersed and fascinated with the place and the characters living in the movie because it is so real (the place itself is utterly beautiful as well).Because the place feels so real, it almost makes the film slice-of-lifeish. Being slice-of-lifeish and the fact that it's quite slow might, as I suppose, make some people feel boring. But in this 2 hours of seemingly simple and dull journey, what hides beneath it are layers and layers of complexity.This film is certainly not just about 2 gays falling in love. What I see is that it's about the ideal form of love. Many characters in this film have ""multiple relationships,"" but there wasn't a single moment of jealousy I sensed when characters found out about their lovers' other relationships. Homosexual relationships feel no special in this film because they are treated the exactly same way as heterosexual relationships.That is the ideal form of love expressed in this movie, unbounded, sharing, and celebratory. The film does not serve monogamy and heterosexuality as ""the doctrine"" of the world and denies the possessiveness in today's love.The sex scenes in the movie stand out a lot as well. The usual type of sex scenes gives you the thrill and and a sense of dangerousness. When you watch this film, however, serenity is the way I will describe it. In fact, you can feel it from start to finish because characters' celebrations of love are shining through the day-to-day event, objects, people, basically, through life itself.It is philosophical and it's not just about the philosophy of love. The ideal form of love in this movie, if interpreted from different perspective, can also be seen as the ideal form of human. The only time when you can sense resentment reeking in this film (about politics and complaining about others), the protagonist's nose started to bleed. In the ending scene as well, specifically, when he turns his crying into smiling.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Made me change the way I thought about love,"(This is my first review, so I hope it's okay)The film is absolutely amazing.While yes, the plot is pretty basic, the writing and acting is amazing. Chalamet and Hammer portray a relationship that is one of the most real i've ever felt watching a movie and while the cinematography is quite different from other movies, it manages to create an extremely real atmosphere that often made me forget I was watching a movie.There are some pretty raunchy scenes, but they feel like a natural part of the movie and help develop the characters.The setting is also absolutely beautiful and is accompanied very well by the cinematography. I now want to live in 1980s Northern Italy.For me, the thing that really makes the movie is how raw it feels. Scenes that would often utilize background music to set the mood, instead gets carried by the amazing acting by Hammer and specifically Chalamet.Now without spoiling the ending, all I can say is that it has changed the way I think about love, and has helped me understand more about what love is to me. The movie will probably stay in the back of my head for a very long time, and for that I'm very grateful.(I apologize in advance for any errors in my writing, in my defense English isn't my main language.)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not too bad,But not too good either. It is the simply sentimental story not too deeply analysed of a love homosexual relationship between a teenager boy and a 24 year old college graduate that came to northern Italy where the boy's family lives to help in cultural historic research by the boy's father. The boy is a bit immature since he also flirts with a girl his age.

Wonderfully shot; well performed albeit very slow in the first half,"The first half of this movie is rather slow and meandering. In terms of the movie however I can see why it was filmed in such a way, as it allowed us to watch the mundane regular things a boy would do during summer in 1980's Italy. The film could've move slightly quicker, but it set the scene well for what was intended. Thankfully the film had some great cinematography. Some of the camera angles were fantastically placed to make the most of the beautiful locations. The excellent score compliments the scenes nicely. Timothee Chalamet was very impressive as Elio. He perfectly portrayed the confusion and angst that a boy in his situation would be feeling. As the second half of the movie develops it becomes clear where Elio's feeling sway; and it leads to the best scene in the film; a speech from Elio's father. Essentially it's about accepting love when it comes along because it's not something everyone is lucky enough to experience. It's a well scripted scene. From a personal perspective there were parts of the film I felt uncomfortable about, including Oliver's interest in Elio, who is technically still a child. There was certainly an element of taking advantage that came across. That said there was a lot to admire about the film. The way it looked and sounded was great; Chalamet gave a fantastic leading performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The scenes are able to show things that dialogue would never even get close to. Elio's emotions are so extremely cute and touching, that it is impossible not to wait with enthusiasm for the time they will finally get together.

Elio and Oliver,"James Ivory's screenplay for Call Me By Your Name brought home Oscar gold for
the film. It's a beautiful gay love story of two young men set and photographed
beautifully in the 80s in Northern Italy. The scenery alone is guaranteed to
bring out any romance in your soul.Professor Michael Stulberg and wife Amiri Cesar have invited a young teaching
assistant Armie Hammer to live with them and work on some excavations of
recent artifacts. Living with them is their most precocious and brilliant 17
year old son Timothee Chalamet who got an Oscar nomination as Best Actor.
The two of them have and do explore the opposite sex, but before the summer
is out they can't deny the physical attraction.Chalamet is as another reviewer said just completely beyond perfection. He's
the ideal twink boy who might have been your first crush. He's fortunate he
comes from educated parents who recognize what he is and let him go his own
way. How insightful they are we find out at the end.The rest of the characters outside of these four are as much background as the
scenery in northern Italy where the story takes place. The story just lasers right in on the family quartet. Watching the family dynamic as the parents
relate to Chalamet you also get sad when you realize how many uneducated
ones who were brought up to hate and fear gay crush the spirit of the Chalamets they bring into this world.The story ends on a sad note, but it also leaves open the plot elements for the
sequel already in the works.Call Me By Your Name also got nominated for Best Picture and for Best Original Song. It certainly has joined the pantheon of great gay cinema. I
hope the sequel is just as good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A love story, sex, or seduction?","There are different kinds of love, and the lowest of them is physical love, i.e. Sex.Unfortunately, our current vocabulary is so poor that we use the same word ""love"" for sex, for a mother's love for her child, and even for faith in our Spiritual God-Father.In the logline for this film, we read ""... romance blossoms between a seventeen-year-old student and an older man..."" But was it really a romance, i.e. Love story, or something else?The plot of the film is constructed in such a way that the viewer at first naively believes that this is a kind of physical love of equal partners. In other words, romance.This illusion lasts until Elio tells Oliver ""God, we wasted so many days! Why you didn't give me a sign?"", meaning that they could have started having sex much sooner.In turn, Oliver's response throws us back to the ground when he replies ""I gave you a hint when I touched you on the 'football' field.""This phrase means that 30+-year-old Oliver deliberately seduced a teenager Elio, who is half the age of his partner. This deliberate physical action and the consequences that follow it, we can not by no means call ""love story, i.e. Romance."" Even according to our undeveloped vocabulary, the real name for this act is SEDUCTION and this seduction is of a naive and underage boy.After all, any physical action of a person, such as a touch, is determined primarily by mental intention. Even a simple casual touch can trigger feelings, but touch with intent has a much more powerful effect on a person.It is the responsibility of the producer and director of the film to convey the message in the logline as accurately as possible, i.e. It's not romance, but a seduction.In general, the film was shot at a high-quality level.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very well made but is it that good?,"I have mixed feelings about this film. The strengths are in the performances, score, and cinematography. I felt like I wasn't watching a movie but actually watching real people being documented which is probably the intention. I haven't read the book but based on the movie alone I felt the story wasn't focused. The screenplay isn't structured and it side steps a lot of the things writers generally have rules about where to put things in a film like the inciting incident or character motivations, and this film basically doesn't aim to play by those rules, but rather make you feel like you're living with these people and experiencing their summer in Italy. Sometimes it's exciting, sometimes there's just quiet moments and it's all very real. This will either make it or break it for you, if you don't mind the slow pace and want to see a nice coming of age story with a backdrop in Italy then I'd say give it a try. You could tell this was crafted by someone with an actual European background and not by an American perspective so I appreciated that. Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer definitely have chemistry and the romance is strong but honestly I felt like it played it a little too safe? I think this movie has a lot of good things and a lot of mixed things. I can see why people love it but it didn't reach that high for me I admire it for its unique direction and style but wasn't as engaged by it as I was with the Shape of Water so far. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A new gay classic,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is a marvelous meditation on first true love on a gay theme. The director, Luca Guadagnino, has created a film that simply refuses to force anything upon the viewer. The film is a masterful study of direction as observation-of letting things be as they are. Timotheé Chalamet is a joy to behold on screen as a coming of age youth in the throws of self-identification and self-legitimization. His late-pubescent struggles with societal constraints and self-inflicted moral dilemmas permeate his nascent feelings for a mid-20s scholar who has come to assist his father at the family's Northern Italy summer retreat. It is an Oscar worthy performance-at once charming, evocative and tender. Armie Hammer's brusque and intelligent performance as the American scholar is also noteworthy. HIs scenes take us by ambush. As hawt as he is to look at, one can't help but be reminded of a rhinoceros charging out of underbrush when his character enters a room. And just like that, a rare new experience unfolds for these tentative lovers who find themselves in an era (the 80s) of overall non-acceptance. One gets the feeling, too, that this experience as it develops will never again be repeated. Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic does not touch this film. In my opinion, a wise decision by the director who transports us to a place of transcendent beauty, as first love ought to be. Love here is remote, fragile, un-worldly, and yet all-knowing, brave, undeniable. It is difficult to create a film so clear and direct in its depiction of life's ambiguities. I didn't want the film to end. A pleasure through and through.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Armie Hammer is great but the movie is carried by Timothée Chalamet, what a talent, his Oscar nomination for this role is well deserved and he should have won even. I hadn´t even heard about him before this film but wow, he is no one trick pony either. I went on to watch his other projects in which he, without exceptions, is phenomenal. Timothée and Armie´s chemistry is magnetic, they are so believable in their roles. Their love and Elio´s sexual awakening and experimentation during this sensual summer is relatable.
Just to top it off all the supporting actors are great, the soundtrack is on point and the costumes/wardrobe is awesome (including Armie´s short shorts).
I would encourage everyone to see this gorgeous and touching movie, even if you are conservative, specially then. How can you disapprove of their beautiful connection?

The usual saddening of the soul,"The first movie, that I have seen from James Ivory. 
I became stuck, after a while intentionally in this melancholia which the film brought onto me. I was able to feel its weight, it was no easy task carrying it but I wanted to carry it even after it was all gone. But that is not true even now, many month from my viewing I still feel that feeling which I would rather not try to write down. I, once awakened from the deep slumber started to collect evidences that would support my argument for the greatness of this movie. I could not find for a while nothing but staggering and a feeling of such peculiarity that I couldn't, not even now explain or write down. So after all this time I cannot argue for why you should watch this movie, as I feel uncapable of giving an advice that would sum up or give a pre-feeling of this movie. I would not do that not only because of my simple uncapability but also I feel it would just take away from this film/feeling. So, my advice is to watch it and, even at risk of your own sanity and health pursue others to watch it and be a part of this feeling. I said the risk because of my, sad understanding of how the world and its ""most capable"" beings work. We, even in the era of second enlightment ( as i usually call it. It is not official) are just not able to think with our brains and still feel with our hearts. To know whats rights is as close to impossible as it gets but, I firmly believe that feeling a sense of rightness in a deed or word is always true and one should act accordingly. But I do not encourege, however the fact that one should just do whatever his appetite pleases. We also have a brain which is a beatifull but at the sam time simple machine that we could use to understand our feelings, which at first glance might look simple but we are never able to understand them. That is the reason we dont follow them. But all this is just a nice story, what im trying to say here is that please just because it shows two lovers from the same sex, please watch it. I know it is against all forms of rules you have known, if you are older than 30 but you have to see and accept that love is everywhere and one should not find logic behind it. So do watch it and try to persuade others into watching it as I feel it just didn't get enough popularity but that might as weel be a good thing. Well thats it, i am giving no rate, it would just ruin the whole thing because you expect something. And once more, for the last time PLEASE WATCH IT. Thank you!P.S.

Possibly this year's 'Moonlight',"Unfortunately when I say possibly this year's 'Moonlight' (last year's Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards) I don't necessarily mean it as a good thing. When I reviewed that film I described it as a ""film about nothing"". While I wouldn't go as far as to say the same about 'Call Me by Your Name', there are similarities in that sense. What is actually separating this from other love stories out there? Is it the homosexual element? Is it two straight actors playing homosexuals convincingly well (ala 'Brokeback Mountain' - another highly over-rated film in my opinion)? Are the movie-going public simply fascinated by this concept? I'm not sure, and while I'm certainly not calling 'Call Me by Your Name' a bad film, I don't think it was Best Picture nomination worthy.I kept expecting more from the film. Around the 65 minute mark I actually had to get my phone out and check what the movie was supposed to be about, because nothing had happened as yet. The synopsis was vague to say the least and I hoped it was just holding back information for fear of spoilers. It wasn't. The film really is as simple and straight-forward as the plot line suggests. So what are we, the audience, supposed to grasp onto here? Well, put simply, we have to buy into the love story 100%. And to be honest I'm not sure I did. I've seen a lot of great love stories told in films over the years, and this one wouldn't rank in the top 100 I'm pretty sure.If you break the film up into three parts, before the couple get together, during the time they've got together and then after they've gotten together, then I think the structuring needed to be different. Too long is spent on the first phase, not quite enough on the second phase and then far from enough on the final phase. The final phase was the chance to really drive things home and draw some emotion out of the audience. Even during the short time we get in that final 1/3 we get two tremendous scenes. One with a speech from the father and then the very final scene of the film. More of that and you would've had yourself a truly great film.The actors do do a tremendous job and fully immerse themselves in their respective roles. The potential was certainly there for this to be something great, but it was just lacking in creativity on the writer's part. The story plays out far too straight-forward.

Romance at it's finest,"Call Me By Your Name is a truly modern love story and one that, while not subverting any expectations, delivers incredibly well on the traditional romance film format.The film follows Elio and Oliver who gradually stem the rose and their friendship blossoms into romance in a believable way.The direction of CMBYN is very impressive with each shot being meaningful and of significance accompanied very well by, for lack of a better word, magical soundtrack that conveys a range of emotions while you listen to the tracks.The romance between Elio and Oliver isn't forced and feels completely natural. The script makes sure every scene with these two is full of sensual tensions with each line of dialogue being full of subtle indications (a notable point being the word gay is never used once). Most impressively, this all feels respectful. Even scenes that feel more erotic, convey the physical acts as the couple expressing their feelings for one another rather than being explicit for the sake of it.It's because of all the strengths, that when the conversation between Elio and his father take place, as well as the gut-wrenching twist at the end (which I won't spoil here) actually have an impact and compels the viewer to feel like they are in the scene and feel the same emotion as our protagonist.Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a modern cinematic masterpiece that was clearly handled with a great passion by not only the director, Luca Guadagnino, but also our leads, Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Makes you feel the beauty of love,"I remember watching this movie for the first time. I was surprised that a movie filmed in this very atmospheric manner could not only make you feel like you are there in Nothern Italy with the main characters, but also touch your heart.This movie could touch anyone, and it does not matter if you are 20 or 50 years old. Amazing acting, great decorations, and this very realistic and emotional story. This movie makes you forget about your location and your problems by getting you into this different reality full of feelings and aesthetic atmosphere.

Absolutely Moving.,"CALL ME BY YOUR NAME- 99%
Call me by your name attached an arm through the screen that was grasping my heart till the last second of the movie. The realism in this movie is so uncanny that I have never felt so attached when watching a movie. It has a slow structure that makes everything worthwhile. The feelings of summer and Love were in the air. I could feel the heat, the joy, the sadness, the hope, the pain, the water, I could feel every scene of this movie. 
I relived my first love watching this movie, and the journey was extremely affecting where I found myself crying rivers of emotional distress without a reason.

A film to remember!,"From the setting, the characters, the plot even the wardrobe painted a beautiful picture of summer fun in 1983. Summer fun as most of us experienced at least once before, can lead to a summer love and that's what we see with main characters Elio & Oliver.
As their love was only shared for one summer, it was still an everlasting impact on both character's lives moving forward as both characters found something within themselves by loving each other truly. Scenes that display tense emotion and deep conversation came off as natural and convincing to the viewer thanks to the works of Timothée Chalamet, Arnie Hammer & Michael Stuhlberg!
Flow of the movie may have been slow to me but definitely paid off overall and with all the great dialogue between the characters, this movie will be a topic of discussion when someone asks me ""What's a good movie you have seen?""

Not enough there to recommend it,"There is a sweet, gentle, coming-of-age love story at the center of CALL ME BY YOUR NAME. You will need to check your own compass to decide whether a homosexual sweet, gentle, coming-of-age love story between a 17 year old boy and a 23 year old grad student is the type of movie for you. But, if you give this one a chance, it is sweet and...well, gentle.It also is slow, languid and devoid of much story, but full of beautiful images, angst and heart.Based on the acclaimed novel by Andre Aciman, with a screenplay by James Ivory (of Merchant/Ivory fame) and directed by Italian Director Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME tells the story of Elio, who is discovering life and love while spending the summer in Italy with his College professor father, his mother and graduate student Oliver, who lives with them while working with the professor. Elio discovers his own identity and sexuality when he builds a relationship with local female Marzia and then with Oliver.The lynch-pin of this film is the character of Elio, since we spend the entire film with him, and in the hands of Academy Award nominee Timothee Chalamet, we are in good hands. This young actor,shows much angst and frustration and the depths of joy, love and sadness in his face (often-times in the same shot) that made this character seem very real to me. Chalamet well deserves his Oscar nomination. Strongly complimenting him is Amira Casar as his mother, Esther Garrel as Marzia and, especially Michael Stuhlbarg as his college professor father. I had heard grumbling that Stuhlbarg should have been nominated for an Oscar, and I didn't quite see that - UNTIL - the final scene between father and son, which is (in essence) a marvelous long monologue by Stuhlbarg that is delivered in a quiet and unflashy fashion. This scene is worth the price of admission itself.And that is good, for the rest of the film is just as quiet as this final father/son scene. This movie is quiet, real quiet, almost...too quiet. I would have preferred some variation in mood and pacing along the way and this is because I really didn't care for the performance of Arme Hammer as Oliver. An actor I normally like, his character's age was supposed to be around 23 (which would only make a 6 year difference between the two characters), but Hammer is 31 and looks (and plays) mid-'30's, while the youthful looking Chalamet (who is 22) is playing a believable 17 year old. This difference in age (for me) took me out of this film. I would have liked to have seen this with someone who looks (plays) 10 years younger than Hammer. As it was, I kept getting a feeling of Oliver taking advantage (and not falling in love) with Elio, so didn't buy his exhortations of love.If you can get past that, the film is beautifully shot, but there just isn't enough story or variations of pace to make this one to recommend (besides the performances of Chalamet and Stuhlbarg).This film is nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor, Chalamet (deserved) and Best Picture (not deserved at all).Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Call Me By Your Name is sweet, tender and juicy like a fresh (not used) apricot.","I have to get this off my chest immediately, ""call me by your name and I'll call you by mine"" is easily the best line of dialogue of 2017. Now that's out of the way, dramas that showcase rich developed characters whilst conveying an emotionally beautiful story are rare. Yet here we are with one of the most engrossing dramatic journeys of last year. A young boy undergoes a transformational traversal of self-discovery as he rapidly falls in love with an American man who is residing in his family's Italian abode. Coming hot off 'Moonlight', it tackles homosexuality from the perspective of a young impressionable boy who struggles with dealing with these unknown feelings. The inner conflict that rages within him starts to manifest and take control, where he is soon plunged into a forbidden love. And what a beautiful film this is. Guadagnino captures the natural beauty of rural Italy, with mint green colours glistening in the sunshine, and the tantalising romance between Oliver and Elio. His usage of long takes and landscape shots allows both the actors and environment to be at the forefront of this drama. An understated style that still elevates the cinematic quality. Chalamet was magnificent at portraying innocence, fragility and humanity. He held the whole film on his shoulders, not an easy feat given some of the scenes involved. His onscreen chemistry with Hammer was outstanding and the sole selling point for watching this. However, it's Elio's parents that add that extra slice of humanity as they are undoubtedly the nicest parents ever. The monologue from Stuhlbarg proves he is the best ""chameleon actor"" working today. I clung onto every word during that scene. Aside from the heartbreaking conclusion, there wasn't a massive amount of emotional impact for me. It's a nuanced story which carries emotion throughout, I just wanted some more power in certain scenes. However, an incredibly mesmerising journey that is both beautiful and sorrowful.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Love Me Tender"" - Elvis Presley (1956)","A sweet ""First Love"" story (for Elio/Timothy Chalamet). And Arnie Hammer enhances Chalamet's performance.
I liked this film very much. Contrary to so many gay love stories, one avoids the ""love-is-misery"" angle that permeates so many gay stories. It's simple: Boy meets man, becomes attracted, then attached, then falls in love. And it's reciprocal.
People complain that Hammer can't pass for a 24-year old. What a petty complaint: Dorothy couldn't pass for a 12-year old in the ""Wizard of Oz,"" but it didn't destroy the story, which is now one of the classics of all time.
This was beautifully told, with the sex not happening too soon (a la Brokeback Mountain, another good (but tragic, love story)), ,and the tenderness between the two growing as a flower does: in its own time. Chalamet never made one wrong move as Elio. Hammer was just a. tad too sophisticated for a 24-year old, but that can be overlooked, as he brought out Chalamet's vulnerability without the sarcasm or mockingness inherent in the majority of gay films. Hammer is warm and embracing (psychologically) and, as Chalamet says, in his late-night tv inteview by Neil Patrick Harris (see youtube), ""Who wouldn't fall in love with this guy?"" and that about says it all about the tenderness between the two men.
Really lovely, without snarkiness, pettiness, unncessary drama or anything to muck up the blossoming of the beautiful flower called Love.
And the father's speech towards the end? Brilliant and touching. ""But to make yourself feel nothing, so as not to feel anything...what a waste."" (A heartwenching and wise understanding of how so many people try to rush past pain when a relationship dies.) Many people need to learn that simply because Love does not last does not make it less beautiful. As Kahlil Gibran once wrote, ""In order to be able to contain Great Joy, One must be able to contain Great Sorrow."" And this film delivers on both ends of the spectrum.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Vidiot Reviews....,"Call Me by Your NameHomosexuality is the solution to the age-old toilet seat up/down debate.A theory confirmed by the May-December lovers sharing a lavatory in this drama.Noted bookworm and audiophile Elio (Timothée Chalamet) is forced to surrender his bedroom for the summer when Oliver (Armie Hammer), an archeology student of his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), comes to stay with his family at their countryside villa in Italy.While he is initially hostile towards the older visitor he has to show around town, Elio eventually realizes that his unfriendly demeanor is just a way to disguise what he really feels. Fortunately, Oliver feels the same.While it is a beautifully shot and wondrously acted adaptation of the coming-of-age erotica that completes director Luca Guadagnino's desire trilogy, one cannot overlook the film's blatant ephebophilia, its overly optimistic ending, or its marathon runtime.Nevertheless, thanks to pepperoni and sausage, Italy remains the origin of penis euphemisms.

UPDATED REVIEW: First hour and 57 minutes terrible; last 15 minutes sublime,"Well, I made it through to the end at last, and man, am I glad! It DID get better!At exactly 1:57:00 on the Blu-ray, when Elio and his father meet in the library, an entirely new movie starts, and it is fabulously, fantastically, spectacularly, amazingly good. Perfect, in fact. Moviemaking cannot get any better than that. If the first part had been even half that good I'd have loved the whole movie and enthusiastically given it at least 8 stars.Now I understand why Chalamet was nominated for an Oscar (the first two hours give no clue) and marvel that he didn't win. Now I understand why the movie and the director were nominated and why Ivory won. It's pretty amazing that the last 15 minutes could be so much better than the 117 minutes that came before.I stand by every word of my original review (so I'm leaving it unedited below, and I think I'm going to leave the one-star rating), because it perfectly says what's wrong with the bulk of this movie. That's too bad, because some people won't press through all of that to get to the good part.So I would advise anybody who has ANY problem with this movie -- whether it's a personal, aesthetic and artistic problem like mine or a moral problem with the subject matter -- to skip the entire first part, all the way to 1:57:00, and watch the remaining 15 minutes to the very end. Do NOT stop when the end credits start to roll, or you will miss some of the finest acting you will ever see.The last 15 minutes are completely self sufficient; there's no need to know what came before -- in fact, you'd be better off NOT knowing. This is still really crappy as a gay movie, there is still no credible chemistry between Chalamet and Hammer, but that's irrelevant in the last 15 minutes. The dialog in just those final scenes gives you all the information you need and makes the relationship completely credible after the first two hours failed to.The fact that the first 90% of the movie is bad is no problem after all, because you don't have to watch it. At the first urge to hit STOP or FAST-FORWARD, just FF all the way to 1:57:00 and enjoy 15 minutes of the best movie you've seen in a long, long time.------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL REVIEW:Dead at its erotic core, and Elio is obnoxiousCall Me by Your Name reminds me of Brokeback Mountain, because they both seem to me like movies made about gay men but by straight people and for straight audiences. In both cases, though, the characters aren't actually gay men but straight men who experience spastic episodes of gay-like behavior, which is one of my chief problems with both movies.I love James Ivory, but he should have won Oscars for writing and directing Maurice -- the first unhomophobic mainstream gay movie ever made and 30+ years later still the best gay movie ever made -- instead of for writing Call Me, but it's typical of the Oscars to award the right person in the wrong year for the wrong movie.Hollywood is full of morons, but occasionally they accidentally get something halfway right, like a roomful of monkeys eventually pecking out Hamlet on a typewriter if you give them a trillion years to do it. Ivory included Ismael Merchant and Ruth Jhabvala in his acceptance speech even though both were dead and had nothing to do with Call Me, so he realized he was getting the award, at least in part, for the wrong movie.Two things bother me about Call Me, one trivial and one not. The trivial one is entirely James Ivory's fault, because it's something that's in the movie's screenplay but not in the book. It's the way Elio and his friends and relations switch effortlessly and fluently -- often several times within a single conversation -- between English, French, Italian and German (in the book, it's all English with a little Italian, since it's in Italy).That IMMEDIATELY elevates the characters beyond reach and alienates the audience, because normal 16-year-olds (or 70-year-olds) CANNOT speak four languages so fluently that they can start a sentence in one language and flit at will in and out of the other three languages before they get to the end of the sentence, without even taking a breath. It made me hate Elio before he'd even done anything. What a privileged, obnoxious brat!The second thing that bothers me about Call Me is exactly what bothers me most about Brokeback Mountain. It's that the sexual attraction between the two men is completely unbelievable.In both cases (Call Me better than Brokeback) the actors go through the motions PERFECTLY, doing everything they ought to be doing exactly as they ought to be doing it, but it leaves me feeling as cold and dead as a dead fish. Nothing they do resonates with the part of me that resonates with sexual attraction. What they do LOOKS authentic, but it FEELS completely false. Empty, Cold, Mechanical. Expertly choreographed and performed, but lacking even a tiny spark of the relentless, consuming fire that drives real sex.I would say that it's because the actors, in both movies, are completely straight (which they are), and that it's just impossible for ANY straight actor to get gay sexual attraction exactly right, making it feel real and alive and inescapable. But that obviously is not true, and, again, it's Maurice that proves it.James Wilby and Rupert Graves both are completely straight, but the fire between them onscreen in Maurice is REAL, so real it's almost scary, but very wonderful. FINALLY I'm seeing on a movie screen what I feel inside and have NEVER seen onscreen before (or since). James Ivory got that from those two straight actors in Maurice, but it's completely lacking in the two more recent movies.It makes it worse that the two actors in Call Me are extraordinarily beautiful men, while neither Keith Ledger nor Jake Gyllenhaal is. Ugly men making out can't be expected to be very sexy, but men as beautiful as Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet making out OUGHT to be sexy just BECAUSE they're so beautiful; so when it's not, the disappointment is much greater.I should admit now that I haven't finished watching Call Me yet, although I bought the disc and started watching it almost three months ago, on March 13. I still have more than a half-hour left to watch out of the 2+ hour movie -- so I've averaged watching one minute of it every day for 90 days, although actually in spasmodic chunks of 3-5 minutes each.The infuriating multilingual conversations and the erotic deadness at its heart make me so angry that I can take only a few minutes of it at a time. So it's possible that it gets a lot better before the end, but I doubt it. Struggling through that movie is for me like climbing Mount Everest in a blizzard; it will be a miracle if I ever actually make it all the way to the end.",,Anonymous,Romance
What is it really worth?,"Having read both the book and seen the movie twice I have contradictory impressions. First, Andre Aciman has a deep understanding of the problem of men who are both gay and also feel unhappy about being gay, or rather understanding men who are both straight and gay at the same time. He is better than a shrink or therapist in demonstrating the joys and sorrows of men of this sort.Still, living through the emotions of the two male characters is not only painful, it is also boring and predictable. It turns out that the only really sympathetic character in the story is the father of the young boy Elio. He alone seems to understand his son and his protege's basic problems and he alone has himself been to some extent in their predicament. In fact one could believe from his role that all men are to some extent in this dilemma of dual sexuality.My only question is this: who want to know all this? Does this story, granted its brilliant analyses of the problems dealt with, really help anyone who might be in similar dilemmas? I think rather the story is so true to life that it can only cause pain. And if all men to a degree are represented here by the two principal male characters the pain is even more intense for those who do not recognize who they really are sexually, having perhaps blocked self understanding lest they learn too much.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Happiness,"The opening phrase ""somewhere in the north of Italy"" is a prologue to the fascinating story of fairy-tale happiness, which is the meeting of a highly educated intellectual and a young creative personality, separated at the age of a couple of decades, and then suddenly converging, revealing a commonality of mutual feelings.The fantastic nature of the story is that they find each other and nobody hinders them. Their lyrical romance does not harm anyone, despite the fact that there is always an extra in love, who will, alas, not be at work. But this love has neither an enemy nor contradictions - that happy event, when everything is perfectly understood, accepted, forgiven and supported.Born in the beginning, the feeling of happiness, not leaving for a single moment, accompanies every moment of this picture, filled with capacious frames from intimate short and voluminous, spatial general plans expressing the thrill and deep breath of lovers, who, as the father of young Elio, very very fortunate.How lucky and all of us with the discovery of a rare gift of Timothy Shalame, who has the ability to control himself and manage his emotions, becoming a completely different person, while leaving the slightest reason to doubt the change of face, which determines the credibility of the whole story, consisting of tender appeals and responses, verbally and tactfully exchanged the main characters of this picture, happy with each meeting alone.Italian Luca Guadagnino represents a radiant light and breathing passion, not devoid of sadness and humor, a sparkling ribbon of happiness, as sincere as the characters of this story, doomed to the inevitable parting, the consequences of which enrich with new paints the psychological portraits of parents, son and his lover , and Shalame performs a creative feat, hanging on the credits in a tremendous pause, which will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ok,"It was ok, but, unfortunately, I didn't really care that much.It never felt like love, it felt like a season passion for one, a simple forbidden attraction to the other. The age gap is not that problematic, but the maturity gap is what it makes this a bit weird. One is a full grown adult, playing a 24yo, but the actor seems what he really is/was, 30. The other plays a teenager and his atitudes are precisely what you expect from a teenager. So, one seems like the tutor of the other, much more than anything else.I understand what some have seen here.

"Forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values filled this terrific film","Relative unknown Director Luca Guadagnino (""A Bigger Splash"" 2015) has hit the movie jackpot with this at times painstakingly slow moving storyline that ultimately proves a backdrop for forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values. While Awards talk is high across the board for actors Armie Hammer (""The Social Network"") and Timothy Chalamet (""Lady Bird"") - especially his final scene in the film, the breakout performance (in my book) here is Michael Stuhlbarg (TV's ""Fargo"") who embodies the soul of a thoughtful and honest father, and who delivers one of this years best end of film monologues - kudos to writer James Ivory for these final words of self revelation and wisdom. Also standing out in this film is French actress Esther Garrel (""17 Girls""), who graciously walks the line of the young women on the outside. As beautiful as the film develops into, the heart of film really doesn't get started until the proverbial fruit is pulled from the tree. Yes, cinematography (Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) sets the carefree warm summer Italian villa mood, and Ivory's story about this educationally astute family is appealing, but I wanted more of everything at a faster pace. Not to be missed here is the films score, written by Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey, featuring amazing songs by Sufjan Stevens. There is a lot of great emotion within this terrific film, especially towards the end, so stick with it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sexually provocative whilst remaining elegant,"There is just something about this film. It's remarkably moving and wise. The first time I watched it I had an awful headache and I wasn't too sure what all the fuss was about, but it stuck with me. I couldn't get this film out of my head so I watched it again. Upon second viewing it all just clicked. I've watched it twice more since and read the book (strongly recommended btw).There is something so honest about Elio. The fact that I don't feel I completely know either of the characters at the end of the film is why I love it - it feels real. It is just a snippet of their lives.My ONLY qualm is that it's a little long. The forest shots to music are lovely but perhaps a little gratuitous? I mean, that is literally my only complaint. If I'm having a panic attack, I'll sit down and watch this film. It's one of the most serene movies I've ever seen.I was going to mark this down to 9/10 bc of the length but I just can't bring myself to do it - it's too gorgeous. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A lot of idylic romance, but that's about it","1980's Lombardia, in a summer in which there is no rain, where everything is just high philosophy, swimming in lakes and reading in the sun on an Italian mansion, two people fall in love. The acting is good, the script is subtle, the love story is expressed very well, the scenery is amazing. It's just that there is no story other than the romance. Everything is perfect, including the ending. A perfect summer romance with no ups or downs, no extra context, just love. My wife loved the film, I was trying very hard not to fall asleep.Bottom line: You probably have to be in the mood to enjoy the film. I didn't think the gay angle was significant in any way.

Perfection,"If you want to know Why do gay men love ""Call Me By Your Name"" here are my 2 cents.I was a gay kid I grew up in the 1980's & it was terrible. It was the start of the aids epidemic & gay bashing seem to be a sport. In many places all over the world it still is.At school I was bullied and felt like I had no place safe. When I was a freshmen on the first day of high school someone wrote ""Fag"" on my locker.So I never used the locker again the entire time I was in school. It was too ""Risky"". Sophomore year someone wrote ""Fag"" on my new OP Jacket. Afraid of what my parents would say when I brought it home I decided to ""Throw it away"" and act like it was stolen.This is what happened to me. Sad thing is that ""Yes I was gay"" but I never acted on it. It was drilled into your head gay sex =death. I was in my twenties by the time I came out and becoming the man I was born to be.When you are a straight guy growing up you have heroes and role models. When your gay ""You feel your on a sinking ship"" with no life rafts. You are drowning not in an ocean but in your own tears.So this brings me to the film ""Call Me By Your Name"" Set in 1983 in northern Italy, Call Me by Your Name chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), and Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father Samuel (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archaeology professor.What was nice was the film did not deal with AIDS, COMING OUT, or politics. It's just a love story. I do not want to give too much away but it was nice to see a film that I could relate too.What is a miracle is that since the film takes place in 1983 none of the issues you think it would deal are not talked about at all. This is a relief. The story is really about 2 men and a romantic Summer romance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
an artistic lustful romance,"Greetings again from the darkness. Although confusing the two is understandable, there is a difference between a story of romance and a story of love. That's not to say that the two can't overlap; in fact, they often do. In movies, romance is the dish most often served because it's usually more interesting. Watching the flirtatious dance and often awkward exploratory stage of what was once called the rituals of courting offers a writer, actor and director infinitely more possibilities than what we associate with the years of deep connection labeled as love. Andre Aciman's novel is adapted by James Ivory (of Merchant-Ivory fame, and 3 times Oscar nominated for Best Director) and the script leans heavily on romance ... lustful romance, to be specific.Director Luca Guadagnino (A BIGGER SPLASH, I AM LOVE) is an expert at making movies that engage our senses. His movies delicately tease us - they slowly absorb us into the emotions and feelings of the characters. Very few filmmakers have the skill to subtly seduce the viewer, and draw us into the story so that we are no longer merely observing. It's nuanced story-telling at the highest level.Elio's (Timothee Chalamet) family spends the summer at their estate in northern Italy. You've likely never met a more cultured family. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a renowned professor, his mother (Amira Casar) a recognized translator, and Elio himself is a musical prodigy who whiles away the days by transcribing classical music and reading every book he can get his hands on. Oh, he also flirts with the local girls because he is, after all, a 17 year old boy. His intelligence and corresponding wit is of a much older person, standing in stark contrast to his innocence and childlike maturity level with all other pieces of life's puzzle.Elio's world is rocked when his father's newest research assistant, Oliver (Armie Hammer), shows up. An ""Americano"" who offsets his extreme politeness with an unrefined ""Later"" when departing any encounter, Oliver explodes on the scene like a Greek God. He and Elio have an initial passive-aggressiveness towards each other as they test the boundaries for weakness, and more importantly, interest. Things move very slowly as the passion and curiosity brews during their bike rides, walks through the apricot orchards (forbidden fruit), swimming in every watering hole, and competitive banters on intellectual topics. There is a sensuality to most every scene, though those same scenes are filled with unspoken tension.The sunlit beauty as each summer day passes initially masks the emotions, and the stunning setting, people, colors, and music is accentuated by the camera work of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom. Nature is on display in its full glory; not just through trees, sunlight, and water, but in that elusive and unexplained connection between two people so strongly drawn to one another.Director Guadagnino's film easily slides into the romantic sub-genre of such films as BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, and CAROL, and the artistic approach provides a gentleness that even the peach scene can't undo. Michael Stuhlbarg (who seems to be everywhere these days) has an extraordinary father/son scene near the end which reminds us that each one of us has a story on how life may or may not have turned out as planned. The gut-wrenching pain with sharing that story usually means it remains untold; however, the invaluable lesson is not lost on Elio. First love and first heartbreak bring both emotional ecstasy and emotional devastation, and whether you believe the film's statement ""We have less to give each new person"", you'll likely agree that the use of Psychedelic Furs ""Love My Way"" is spot on.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love at its purest,This movie is an absolute masterpiece and the most beautiful ethereal description of love I've seen on screen in a long long time. Rarely do film adaptations of books turn out this well. Timothee Chalamet is exceptional and it is well deserved and fitting that this be the movie to propel him into stardom. His portrayal of Elio is pure and incredicle. Armie Hammer deserves praise as well for his role. Michael Stuhlbarg is fantastic and his final monologue deserves an academy award.If you are open minded and want to watch a movie that portrays love in a way you've never seen before I must recommend this movie. It will leave you yearning and emotional for days after.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film epitomizes why film is a type of art,"This film will take the viewer on a journey of self-discovery. While some closed-minded individuals will write the subject matter off because it is a story of first love between two male characters, it is much more than that. This is a story that every human being can identify with, the story of first love and sexual awakening. The film evokes every possible emotion in the viewer and is a complete treat for the senses. While it may be an independent lower-budget (by today's standards), it never falls short in any area. The cinematography is breathtaking, the locations beautiful, and the music perfection. That being said, the acting is of a caliber seldom seen in cinema. Timothee Chalamet is destined to become the next Laurence Olivier. His talent knowns no bounds and one can only surmise the potential ahead for this stunningly beautiful and multi-talented young man. Armie Hammer proves once again, his matinee idol good looks are only surpassed by his ability to own a character. He embodies this character in mind, body, and soul. The chemistry between these two actors is never forced, but completely believable and natural. This film is destined to be a classic as it is absolute perfection. The viewer becomes lost in this world of 1980's Italy and in the pure emotions of these beautifully written, directed, and acted characters. This is the type of film that deserves to win every award at every competition and is one you certainly do not want to miss. I hope the rumors are true and that there will be a sequel as these characters have become so dear to me that I want to know more of their future.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"not the deepest movie, but worth seeing","James Ivory has spent his career directing what are generally seen as serious movies (Room with a View, Howard's End, etc). He tackles a different serious topic as screenwriter of Luca Guadagnino's ""Call Me by Your Name"" (and winning an Oscar for it), focusing on a romance between two young men in 1983 Italy. I thought that what was most interesting about the movie was the setting. Neither one totally fits in with the surrounding - Oliver even recalls being the ""odd Jew out"" in a small town in New England - so they have no choice but to find each other.I should say that the movie is not the most profound. While we learn a fair amount about both Elio and Oliver, it doesn't get to the point where we truly understand either character (though we do sympathize with them).In the end, I'd say that the movie is worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mmm, A Boring Film About Twink Love","I heard mixed reviews, so, was not sure if I would see this. We liked the trailer so thought we might like it. This for me was a long, drawn out, boring, not believable Stealing Beauty. While the Liv Tyler film was also slow and very similar, there was something likable about it. Both had beautiful scenery and seemed to parade young people's coming of age, first sexual encounters, and the European casualness surrounding sexuality. What I was very confused by is how Kevin Spacey was blackballed and dragged through the mud for misunderstanding cues by an underage guy in the '80s and then months later this movie is praised and yet is about the relationship of a man and a boy of similar ages in the '80s. Seems extremely hypocritical and a bit disturbing.Other than that this film had a tinge of creepy. I just did not get their relationship or on what planet Armie Hammer would be interested in this kid. I thought it was just me so I asked some gay male friends that are a similar age to Armie Hammer and they both did not get it either and their criticism of the pairing was harsher than mine. First of all, I'm shocked Armie Hammer is in his early 30s. I thought he was late 30s to early 40s. The whole time watching the film I was thinking, ""He looks like his father. What is romantic about some guy 20+ years older pursuing this kid?"" It seemed very Lolita to me. I was also shocked to find out the book was about a 26 yr-old having an affair with a teen boy. On no planet does Armie Hammer look 26.I just got the impression that this was some Roman Polanski style infatuation with twink boys because I did not find the relationship remotely believable. I'm sure the people who find this film beautiful and remarkable are guys like Bryan Singer and his cadre of old, creepy producer and casting friends. Armie Hammer is this Adonis who can hook up with anyone and Elio is this twerpy, annoying, dorky-cute teen that I can't imagine any grown man being attracted to let alone in love with unless, like I said, he fits into the Roman Polanski camp of dating teen French girls and dropping them off at high school. And, of course, like a classic Italian film, the parents know about it and are super chill about the affair.I also did not believe the pretentious scene where Elio, a 17 yr-old boy wanted to lay in his mother's lap while she read him 15th century German literature. Give me a break. This also played into the fantasy of some old dude's brain of Grinder fan fiction. I know American brainiacs who spent their teen years in Europe and they were obsessed with comic books and Dungeons & Dragons and dreaming of getting a girlfriend someday.The scenery in the film is beautiful...that's about all the film has. It's not a terrible film, it's just a bit creepy, unbelievable, and very slow without much payoff...other than the scenery and the romance of living in Europe.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
cinematic triumph,"Call Me By Your Name is an absolute masterpiece and an unforgettable experience, one of those rare films that lingers with you long after the credits roll. Set in the sun-drenched Italian countryside during the 1980s, this coming-of-age romance follows Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) as they navigate a summer filled with passion, self-discovery, and the intensity of first love. Every element of the film is beautifully crafted and feels like a 10/10.The acting is phenomenal. Timothée Chalamet delivers a career-defining performance as Elio, capturing the character's vulnerability, curiosity, and internal conflict with extraordinary subtlety. His chemistry with Armie Hammer feels genuine and unforced, making their relationship both heart-wrenching and deeply relatable. Hammer's portrayal of Oliver is charismatic yet sensitive, providing a perfect foil to Elio's introspective nature.The cinematography, with Luca Guadagnino's direction, transports you to the Italian countryside, making you feel the warmth of the summer sun and the lazy, languid pace of rural life. Each shot feels deliberate and poetic, capturing both the beauty of the landscape and the intimacy of the characters' journey. There's a dreamlike quality to the atmosphere that perfectly complements the narrative, drawing viewers into Elio's world and emotions.Then there's the soundtrack, which adds another layer to the film's depth. Sufjan Stevens' music feels tailor-made for the story, with lyrics and melodies that resonate with the themes of love, longing, and loss. His songs ""Mystery of Love"" and ""Visions of Gideon"" are particularly haunting, leaving a lasting impact.Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a cinematic triumph, a film that feels timeless and deeply moving. It captures the beauty and pain of love with an honesty that few movies achieve. This isn't just a film; it's an experience, and one that's truly unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Classic Sensory-Focused Summer Film,"I don't know how many times I've watched this movie since I first found out about it, but it has become a go-to for me. Sometimes the breeze blows a certain way and I feel the need to watch it again, to hear its iconic music and settle back into the swamp of visual immersion. It sustains itself on its aesthetic essence and that's what you remember most-- or what i remember most, though I also understand the emotional weight of the romantic tragedy of their relationship. I eventually got over it, but I'm sure I could tear up if the last scene gets me at a particular point again.It's not completely ground-breaking but it impacts the heart where it aims to. Not every scene has to be packed with pounds of ""deep"" relevance. The reward comes from the slow play-out of emotional narrative and the leisure that really makes you feel like you're enduring summer in Italy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An erotic romance that just never seems to go anywhere or actually end,"There's the old saying ""The third time's the charm."" Most directors figure themselves out or make their best film on the third try. Steven Spielberg (Jaws), Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets), and Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums) are some of the names on this list. After premiering his third feature film at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, director Luca Guadagnino unfortunately doesn't get access to this prestigious club.Set in northern Italy during the summer of 1983, 17-year-old Elio Perlman goes through the days with nothing to do expect playing piano, swimming, and reading. One day, a grad student by the name of Oliver comes to the house for a summer study abroad with Elio's father, who is an esteemed professor of Greco-Roman art and sculpture. At first, Oliver and Elio are two completely different people that can't seem to figure each other out. Both their physical bodies (Oliver strong and tall, while Elio skinny and pale) and ways of thinking (Oliver has confidence, Elio sticks to himself) are different, which leads both of them to be wildly curious about the other. This curiosity sparks a wide range feelings, eventually leading to an intimate relationship that makes them question and explore their sexual identities.The chemistry between the two leads is off the charts. Chalamet and Hammer excellently play off each other and keep every scene feeling natural. Director Luca Guadagnino patiently plays out their relationship throughout the whole summer, letting us soak up every detail of the Italian countryside and the lives inhabiting it.While slow and long stories usually bring out high emotions, this one failed to do that. The slow build up of rising actions drag the emotional weight down and make the final resolution fall flat and feel disappointing. The 130-minute runtime feels much longer as we painstakingly watch for the first two thirds as the leads contemplate the choices they are about to make. The emotional peak and my patience had worn thin at the point when they do make their decision.Guadagnino specializes in slow films that explore character's hidden wants and needs. He did this in 2015 with A Bigger Splash, which garnered fairly positive reviews from critics and mixed from audiences. He's definitely an expert on shooting in Italy, as this is his third consecutive film to be set in the country. His eye for breathtaking visuals is apparent in this film. The villa and the surrounding farmlands are shot beautifully and lend to a feeling of openness that the characters inhabit between each other. Guadagnino also uses the land as a way to get the characters to interact with each other. Whether it be bike riding or swimming, the earth offers many opportunities for the characters to spend time and learn about each other.The film also uses a couple songs from independent musician Sufjan Stevens. Each one brilliantly encompasses the setting and events that unfold throughout. ""Mystery of Love"" is an absolute must listen as it flows like a summer breeze and quietly symbolizes the emotional eight each character carries.Each actor holds their own and translates the heavy material from the page to the screen. Newcomer Timothée Chalamet has a bright future ahead of him as he brilliantly plays a young adult experiencing a period in time where is uncertain of what he feels. He plays Elio as both intelligent for his age and challenged by what is going on around him with the arrival of Oliver. Armie Hammer gives probably his best performance yet as a character that can best be described as the perfect American hunk. He has the looks to get all the girls, but something inside of him lures him towards Elio even though it is against everything he's been taught and done. Hammer has the confidence of a beautiful man, but also the insecurity of someone who is experiencing love for the first time and doesn't know what to feel. The similarities between Chalamet and Hammer's performance is what connects their characters so tightly and make them so engaging to watch when they are on screen together.Michael Stuhlbarg also knocks it out of the park as the studious and caring father of Elio. He's always reaching out to his son to offer advice and support, but also wanting Elio to figure things out on his own. He caps off the film with an impressive monologue that ties everything up to an emotional close.It's a shame that a film like this one can have everything going for it except for the main plot. The great acting and gorgeous cinematography couldn't hold on to my interest long enough to warrant a reaction by the end. Just like a hot, lazy summer abroad, I just wanted it to end so I could go back home.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Left me emotional but did not live up to the hype,"Following the enormous praise this film has received I went and saw it with high expectations. And I have a lot to say about it.First - and I'll get right to it - it did not live up to expectations. Unfortunately. My main issues are purely from an entertainment perspective; it's not a super slow film, but it's certainly not packed either. It's not a Hollywood drama, and while it shouldn't be and certainly doesn't try to be, it was slow at times. For personal taste, I could have done with a few more eventful scenes.Second, also regarding living up to expectations, I wasn't left feeling as devastated as many reviews had led me to believe I would. Without saying too much about the plot, that's related to my first point.Third, the hype about the acting and chemistry is real. Boy is it real! The two main actors are simply brilliant together. In fact all the actors delivered.And finally - and this is a big one as it's what led me to write this review - I experienced something I have never experienced before. When the credits started rolling, on top of a very long closeup scene of one of the main characters face, the movie theater was silent. DEAD SILENT! No one got up. No one spoke a word. Everyone was emotionally taken. We all stayed until the very end, not because of some overly dramatic event, but because of the pure realness of the entire film. GREAT job!Call Me By Your Name is beautifully shot and has great actors, and make no mistake, that's where the emotions comes from. Not from a dramatic plot. It's very much down to earth.

A Golden Summer: Love and Longing in the 1980s,"The film transports me back to the warmth and magic of the 1980s, an era brimming with a certain charm that today feels almost like a dream. As I watched, I felt myself slipping into a time when summers were endless, and emotions felt more vivid, more raw. The film evokes the spirit of the decade with stunning authenticity-from the music that drifts lazily in the background to the simplicity of days spent in quiet towns, where every moment could feel monumental.What struck me most is the way the film captures the atmosphere of the 1980s, a world before constant connectivity, when interactions were more intimate and each encounter held a certain weight. It's a place where a chance meeting, a brief touch, or a knowing glance could change everything. Watching the story unfold, I relived that era through the lens of a love story so beautifully rendered that it felt like stepping back into a time when emotions were simultaneously simpler and more intense.The characters' coming together against a backdrop of golden fields, fresh apricots, and turquoise waters brought back memories of summers past-days when each experience left an indelible mark on the soul. The 1980s were a time of discovery, of learning to navigate love in ways that felt exhilarating and perilous. This film captures that essence: the joy of connection and the pain of separation, wrapped up in a world where every goodbye felt more final and every love felt more vital.Watching it, I was reminded of what it felt like to be young in a decade so full of promise and unspoken desires. It is a bittersweet reminder of love that could be all-consuming and moments that felt both fleeting and eternal, all drenched in the golden haze of memory.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Haunting,"Timothée Chalamet sets the bar very high. He is entirely natural, you never feel he's acting, yet he communicates every skipped heartbeat of his character's love. Armie Hammer, meanwhile, impresses in a completely different way as Oliver, an American arrived in Italy to work as an academic assistant for six weeks . Initially presenting himself as an old head on young shoulders, Mr Hammer seems to shed years as the story progresses, his spirit freed by his encounter with Chalamet's Elio.The first hour of this remarkable film winds up the sexual tension to an almost unendurable pitch, as misunderstandings give rise to missed opportunities and missteps. The course of true love never did run smooth....The film is not without flaws. Only an actor as good as Michael Stuhlbarg, as Elio's father (who is Oliver's employer) could convert a self-conscious, set-piece speech into the moving, compassionate declaration that we get. And although on occasion Luca Guadagnino's direction borders on genius -- including the astonishing final scene -- it occasionally resorts to unsubtle symbolism that would turn into something comic if it weren't for the commitment of the actors.All that aside, I find many images, lines of dialogue, and Mr Chalamet's incredible intensity, haunting me. I expect this will continue for quite a while yet.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful,"Although Armie Hammer may have given one of his career-best performance, that dwarfs in front of Timothee Chalamet's incredible performance. One of the best things about this film has to be that even being a coming of age story it never assumes a life-changing experience turns you into an all wise human who becomes ready for any kind of challenge ahead. Also, no one is antagonized here either. In spite of all of this, the amount of praise this got was not justified for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

great cast but poor writing...,"Great acting & one particularly great scene b/t father/son, 
but overall, the writing was barely there...slightly inane &/or confusing & contrived much of the time. 
Very little was done to establish the deeply felt feelings the writer expected us to see in the relationship.

They did have good chemistry but the story of their feelings was poorly written.

the Best Time,"The label of love growth is greater than the label of homosexuality.

The most magical movie you will ever see,"I will forever and always come back to this movie when I long for the feeling of home. I've never been in love. I'm only nineteen. However, I have been to Italy before. And somehow, Luca Guadagnino managed to bring the magic of Europe and young love into this movie in a way I've never seen someone do before. Timothée and Armie perform so brilliantly that every scene makes you feel like you're there. It feels just like you're there with them, you're slowly falling in love and you feel it all with them, the excitement and fear, the beauty, the pain, the shame, the unknown. You can feel it. All of it. Because André Aciman's book gave the most perfect foundation for Luca to use this tremendous talent of bringing you into the movie and not letting you out of it. I like to say that I've seen nearly every movie this planet has to offer (which is absolutely impossible of course). But this one is something else. Call Me By Your Name touched my soul like no other movie ever has and for some reason it won't let me go. Thank you to Luca and everyone else who was involved in making this movie for creating something so magical that one could simply not find the words to describe it. This movie will always be home to me. A masterpiece. An absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Call Me Maybe,"Call Me by Your NameAnother not another love story. Beautifully told. Simple enough to follow, yet complicated enough to experience. Dialogue can be a bit sappy at times, but I guess that is a side effect of love rather than just bad writing. Nevertheless it feels stupid. Other times it can be a bit too vague. The dialogue. As well as what's currently happening. These are mostly minor issues though.Acting is great. Perhaps even slightly over done for the main character. Not in a bad way though. Perhaps they just wanted to show him off. Switching between 3-4 languages, playing guitar and piano with ease that'd make Rachmaninov blush; scribing music, reading tons of books and looking like a teenage Greek god in the process, is too good to be true. Relations between people feel natural and organic and most part realistic. Or lets say believable rather than realistic.The visual style and tone is smooth and gentle. Fitting well with the general flow of the film. Setting feels authentic and fit for the period. The countryside is as dreamy as everyone.The soundtrack, concerning the pop music, is brilliant. Did not care too much about the piano score in some parts. Though there is piano played in the film, the piece playing in the background at times, did not seem to fit.Pace seems to limp on occasion, but is not a major concern. There aren't too many obvious mistakes, but the scene where they pick up a freshly found archaeological artefact like it's just a random stick, is mind-blowing. Overall, Luca Guadagnino does a great job in portraying love without the usual drama and still maintains interest. It's easy to destroy innocence, much harder to retain, but the film succeeds. And his love looks a lot like love. And love doesn't care who you are.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Raw Depiction of Romance,"This gorgeous film will cut anyone who sees it to the core. It was carefully crafted with the softest of brushstrokes from director Luca Guadagnino. The striking visuals and setting are seamlessly presented to the audience and go hand in hand with the love story we are witnessing. The story, and the way it plays out, is hauntingly effective. This feat is achieved with such an intimate, soft tone that feels painfully real. The production takes a step back and allows the story and the characters to just be, and the end result is overwhelmingly moving. The performances by everyone, but of course by the two leads, are entirely credible with their naturalistic delivery of dialogue and internal emotional resonance. This movie is beautiful in the most natural way, depicting a bittersweet romance in a manner rarely seen in film today. It is pure beauty and will go down among the most effective and memorable romances in film history.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Film of 2017,"When going to see this movie, I did expect good things to come but after watching it this is one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. This movie blew me away in so many ways, first I would like to mention the sound track which was amazing. Now let's talk about the screenplay, the script was written by James Ivory who also directed A room with a view, and he is 89 now and I hope to god that he wins best adapted screenplay. The dialogue was incredible, the way how he mixed English with Italian with French was just great and how it has those slight poetic speeches that made you feel. Luca Guadagnino directed this film he also directed I am love and A bigger splash and his directing in this movie blew me away. From those wide long shots of them talking from just simple shot of them just riding their bike around, he captured the beauty of Italy and showed the love these two men have. But the thing that stood out the most for me, the thing that blew me away the most was Timothée Chalament's performance. His performance was one of the best I've seen in a long time and his raw performance was incredible, he was so realistic, you could tell that he was struggling with his sexuality and his love for Oliver felt so real, but the seen that showed his true talent was the ending seen. Over all I cannot flaw this movie it was raw and intense especially with the love making and its movie like this that really set a landmark in cinema",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Way Too Long,"A 90-minute movie packed into 132 minutes, this one goes on and on and on with nothing happening, supposedly building to the ""coming of age"" moment between the 17-year-old and the ""older"" man hired by daddy as a research assistant.The idyllic Italian summer has the guys playing cat and mouse about the house while the intellectual parents look the other way. There's lots of talk, lots of bicycle rides into town, lots more talk, shots of the apricot trees, and then some more talk.While the acting is good, the story drags. And it's odd that for a gay-themes movie, the only actual sex depicted is between the kid and a girl. Other than grabbing and wrestling, you never see any actual sex between the guys.

Elio(in a good turn from Timothee Chalamet) is a young man who enjoys summer, reading books, and good food, and learning and living culture, along with being with friends and this Lacoste shirt wearing young man is about to have his world changed when Oliver(Armie Hammer)visits to be Elio's father research assistant.Along the way the two hit it off and slowly, but surely one thing leads to another as the two make out and learn and feel each other out.

I cringed through most of the stilted dialogue.Hammer looked too old for this role for it not to come across as a little creepy, even if it didn't in the book. And Hammer's acting failed to make an attraction from a 17 year-old in the least convincing. As others have said, there was simply no chemistry. The peach scene triggered the gag-reflex, and has nothing to do with sexuality.I am completely baffled at the praise it has received.

This was the 80s!,"I felt the need to write a review to clear up some of the nonsense said in some of the reviews here, mainly that the characters aren't real and that it's all very contrived.This is a beautiful movie. It's just gorgeous; sure, it's a tad too long, but the story and the setting is just wonderful.But don't be fooled, this is a story that quintessentially captures the essence of the 80s: fear!If you're a millennial who has no experience of that time, where you are now free to love who you wish and the world is accepting of homosexuality, then welcome to a new and wonderful world. BUT it wasn't always this way. The 80s were a time when homosexuality was a dirty word, where gay culture was really in its infancy and there was a lot of fear.Most people didn't even know an ""out"" gay person and gay people were mostly the subject of jokes and derision. Hell we didn't know about Freddy Mercury - that's how naive we were!So this was the 80s, and WORSE, the EARLY 80s, so it's entirely understandable that Oliver is terrified about his secret coming out; it ruined careers and shattered lives back then.Most men in the 80s lived bizarre double lives, and it's entirely true to form here. The men had families, wives, and were visiting public toilets to get their true desires fulfilled. This was how it was.Ultimately, the relationship between Oliver and Elio is a fairy tale which only now could be made real.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unanswered Questions,"A very Aryan-appearing male shows up at this B&B for visiting scholars with a Star of David around his neck. Virtually the first question the Jew asks his host is, Where is the bank? Banking has nothing to do with the central theme of this movie (an attraction between two males, one older, one quite young). Why are the characters Jewish? The only subsequent reference to Jewishness occurs many months later, when we see a menorah (incorrectly rendered) during Hanukkah and someone grabbing a gold-covered chocolate coin. End of Jewish references. None of the reviews I read comment on these occurrences in the movie that I found really quite peculiar, the banking question especially. That said, no one will agree with me, but the director/writer has no concept of ""scene."" Scenes should be mini-stories, mini-dramas, if you will, that cohere and have a punch, but the ones in the movie are mostly pastiches and rarely end in a satisfying manner.

Not convincing,"This movie did not convince me.The way that these guys get envolved may feel erotic to some, but the director chose to rush this process too much to make this love look real. 
Timothée Chalamet is charming and plays his role with a brave palette of young enthusiasm. But Armie Hammer is not convincing as a summer love. For some reason it feels like he is not right for the part. His play is too cold and he lacks a rough edge. On top of that, he seems too old to play this role.

Better than the book,"Andre Aciman's problematic novel this film is based on is rendered more palatable in this film version. In the book, Elio does not cry when Oliver leaves, there is no big drama and we all knew it was coming. Oliver was a visitor, only. Visitors leave. That left the book without a powerful ending. The film changes that and adds this expected element so that the audience can have a proper ending. The book also drags on giving pointless views into the future, which the film wisely drops. Although greatly reduced in the film, the ""I'm jewish too,"" scene and totally pointless jewish discussion in the book is unfortunately not removed from the film and comes across as it does in the book, leaving viewers scratching their heads as to why it was mentioned at all, as the jewishness of the characters adds absolutely nothing the story. The necklace could have been any necklace, and is not even part of the book.like the book, there is a flat quality in the film which can be seen as either good or bad: we have an unexceptional story about a commonplace thing - two people experiencing an inexplicable attraction to one another - which simply exists as it does in life, not for any reason or rhyme, but nonetheless being totally overpowering to the couple involved. It's just life and love. And pain, and it's beautiful if you feel it and perhaps boring if you don't.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The actors are great. The film has lengths, which some people find fault with, and I too had to get used to very long scenes showing the lavish lifestyle of Elio and his family. But in the end I think it was a clever trick to make us feel even more immersed in the atmosphere of the movie, almost feeling the warm weather, almost tasting the food, but also being ""stuck "" and waiting for something to happen.

Something beautiful,"Movie based on the novel by Andre Aciman. It captures the charm of the book and adds *something* that can't let you forget about that film. Good script, beautiful depiction of Elio's conversation with Father. Great work of the actors who allowed the audience to move to that world. The shots are really good, the movie is a bit dramatic and presented in a very calm way. The beauty of Italy and young Elio's feelings are perfectly shown. This is not an easy film, it presents a difficult situation between two men. Some scenes may be overkill, but keep in mind that this is a movie based on a book. In the film we can actually feel what Elio is feeling, we can see his pain and his love. To all the serenity of this movie comes a soundtrack that is AMAZING. The music fits perfectly into this atmosphere, especially the work of Sufjan Stevens. Shots, music, colors, actors, surroundings make it a really good movie. After watching the movie, there is a feeling of emptiness. Something makes it hard to forget about this movie, that something changed in us after watching it. Maybe the relationship between Elio and Oliver has been a little idealized and overrated, but maybe that's how love works? Because one of them surely loves. The last scene is heartbreaking. After all, it is just my opinion, I recommend everyone to watch it or read it. It is for sure s o m e t h i n g.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It deserves the Oscar nomination, and it's beautiful.","""How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once."" Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg)Seventeen-year old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) has fallen for scholar Oliver (Armie Hammer) in 1983 Northern Italy, a time and place where gay love is not spoken. But thankfully good hearts like his father in the quote above, know how rare and salutary love is even if it is same sex.This Oscar-nominated small film deserves its acclaim, from writer James Ivory, who knows a thing or two about rich locales in Italy, to 
Sufjan Stevens' classy score, Call Me is Masterpiece Theater reworked for our time. Just add it to Brokeback Mountain and Moonlight for three peerless, artful depictions of queer love.The languid pace that allows the revolutionary love to grow like ripening fruit is just right for those of us who long for the magical, bucolic Lombardy region at summer with lunches that last delightfully forever.Come to think of, there is little conflict except for the girls who must forsake these handsome men not even knowing they are at the least bisexual but heading to homosexuality at a rapid pace. Call Me By Your Name is a romance as much about adolescent coming of age as it is about the vagaries of love in any form or any age.If you long for the sweet Merchant-Ivory motif set against a seductive Italian hill town, this work of art will inspire you to love again.""He was good, and you were both lucky to have found each other, because... you too are good.""

Azzurro is the warmest color... or is it?,"Raised in an intellectual, liberal, upper-class Jewish-Italo-French family of rural Northern Italy, Elio (Timothee Chalamet) finds himself at the crossroads of two pivotal moments of his life: adolescence and summer holidays. When the two coincide, he's a living hormonal volcano at the verge of an eruption. Luca Guadagnino's ""Call Me By Your Name"" is the chronicle of Elio's sexual epiphany during that fateful summer of 1983.Rid of any academical obligation, Elio's enjoying nonchalant pleasures under the Mediterranean warm summer: he reads, plays music and spends time with childhood friends Chiara (Victoire Dubois) and Marzia (Esther Garrel)... while his archaeologist father (Michael Stuhlbarg) and his socialite mother (Amira Casar) just let youth have its fling. Elio is tall and good-looking enough but with a spoiled child's bratty attitude that can compromise the attraction. He's introspective and obviously inexperienced but knows how to underplay his awkwardness to keep a chance with girls.But then comes the intruder: a 24-year old graduate American student named Oliver (Arnie Hammer). He's hunky, looking like a man in his late twenties and could be a model for a Lacoste or Givenchy ad. It's not exactly thunderbolt but Elio finds himself strangely drawn to Oliver. The scenario is a reverse ""Graduate"" with same genders but not much a 'film with a message', it is closer in spirit to 19th century French realism (it's James Ivory after all, from Ivory-Merchant) and the theme of crystallization of love, as a mixture of pain and pleasure even more vividly felt in the stagnation phase.But stylistically speaking, in a sort of homage to French culture, Guadgnino directs the film in a very 'Nouvelle Vague' style, setting up some very beautiful-looking scenes for a small little interplay. He doesn't aim for narrative significance and trusts the value of ordinary moments where one exchange of looks, one gesture, one word will satisfy our 'appetites'. It's one of these movies where the unspoken speaks loudlier than the actual dialogue. After a volleyball game, Oliver touches Elio's shoulder, he brushes him off but the ease with which Oliver gets the girls infuriates him.And while girls are given rather thankless roles as pawns in the cat-and-mouse game between Elio and Oliver, the two meet in secret and get closer and closer. We understand the transgressive aspect of these moments but we never exactly know the degree of the family's open-mindedness to assert how much is in jeopardy and I guess that's not an issue. Luca Guadagino doesn't resort to formulas and doesn't exactly put much obstacles in the romance because these are already set in Elio and Oliver's minds (or hearts). It's an internal battle between a quest for pleasure and a social guilt, leading the two to have little breeches of intimacy in case the 'big time' doesn't come.Guadagnino doesn't care for momentums and let the romance float on a cloud of uncertainty and uneasiness. Chalamet looking 17 does convey that innocent naughtiness and indirectly highlights the maturity of Oliver at the risk of making the story a tad controversial for our sensitive minds but I suppose same-gender romances are so seldom made on mainstream cinema that this one could get away with the criticism. I'd rather judge the coming-of-age story, I don't think they should follow specific narrative purposes, the interactions are enjoyable to the degree that I kept envying the lifestyle of these two guys while freezing my ass here in the North of France.In a way it provided me a certain escapism but once I got past the existential torment boiling inside Elio, even the scenery turned out to be a sort of hideout to cover the thinness of the script. I wish there could be some energy some anger, a real momentum... I guess Elio losing his virginity with Marzia was one, the infamous peach scene that could work as a metaphor for the forbidden fruit but even then, the story didn't have that little glue to stick these moments together. Even in the realm of sexual transgression, there's a 'bourgeois façade' that becomes irritating for a while.Now it is highly possible that my dismissal is physically biased: am not and can't be aroused by the sight of two men kissing. I happen to have a foot fetish and I couldn't stand the sight of Oliver massaging then kissing Elio's foot... and the peach scene grossed me out. And naturally, I had no problem with the sex scenes in ""Blue is the Warmest Colon"". But just because I'm not in a position to enjoy the film on a visual level doesn't mean I wouldn't have wanted the film to stop being so civilized about what remains a call from the flesh. I saw ""Call Me By Your Name"" back-to-back with another gay romance ""The Kiss of Spider Woman"" and there's no comparison. The former makes it look like a game, the second like an existential ordeal.And I maintain my other grief: there's never a moment where we feel there is any justification in the whole secrecy, Elio's parents seem rather progressive and the father's climactic speech seemed like a late confession that could put even more frustration than consolation. Or maybe the secrecy was due to age concern but 17 isn't exactly a taboo age, and it certainly wasn't in 1983, not for boys, not for girls. Speaking of girls, how about their treatment in the film, displaying their naked bodies to better highlight that the two boys don't care about them... they're literally objectified to insist that they're no objects of desire, making them twice losers.What the film had was a certain truth to life, a capability to make you relate to Elio and reminisce of your own adolescent insecurity and attraction to older people... but in my case, it only worked on a superficial level. I wish the story was energized by the same anger or transgression of ""Blue is the Warmest Color"". It's intended warmth still left me cold.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simple coming of age film,"Call Me by Your Name was a gorgeous film with an enjoyable but simple story. A coming of age story about a gay man who falls in love with an older student; this film is a slow burn. It has a relatively slow pace, but the film is still captivating with its beautiful shots and interesting characters. This film excels at character development. You can see both Chalamet's and Hammer's character change the way they feel about and act toward each other throughout the film. I also think that the acting was very good. Timothy Chalamet, Armie Hammer, and Micheal Stuhlbarg had great performances. All of them really displayed their character's emotions well. The last thing I really enjoyed was the cinematography. I thought the visuals were very beautiful, partially because of the amazing location choices and partially because of the lighting and camera work. Now the reason that I gave this film three and a half stars and not higher is because of the few things I did not enjoy. I thought the film had a hard time ending. It kept acting as if it was about to be over, and then an additional scene would start up. I enjoyed how the film concluded once it did, but before that I kept feeling restless. This film also did not make me feel as many emotions as other recent coming of age stories (e.g., Moonlight). I felt less connected to the characters even though I thought they were great. Overall, I enjoyed this film and can see why many people loved it, but I do not think it added anything new to the coming of age teen romance genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

All the respect for Chalamet,"This film is a brilliant exploration of the sadness surrounding the discovery of one's first love to someone of the same sex. The story's pace and the timing of any important revelations is perfect, the sensitive and effortless direction captures the beauty of Italian landscape and the mood and spirit of the '80s. A lot have changed still then regarding the treatment of LGBTQ issues, but given the location of the film is in Italy, I'm guessing the male machismmo is still very much pervasive there at this day and age. It almost feels like were watching a contest going on between Elio, Oliver or Mr. Perlman, Elio's father, as to who is the most miserable.Chalemet gave a very heart-breaking performance for a straight guy as a teenager trying to discover his sexuality with his father's research assistant in his mid-20s. Too effective and credible a performance that I believe he should not gain a reputation for brilliance entirely just because of this film. It's an acting talent that should not be wasted, more doors should open up for the audience to show off his acting chops.With Hammer, he exudes the melancholic aura that he desperately tries mask. Whatever it is that looms at the back of his head, it is best for the viewer to figure this on their own make theoir own opinion. It is this ambiguity that makes his performance an interesting one to watch as the story unfold.Mr. Stuhlbarg, on the other hand, is just an important character in the film and just as pivotal as the two male lovers because as the title suggest, he could have said that line himself to Elio or Oliver..My rating: A-minus",,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, but I didn't love it","Call me by your name (2017) is now the winner of best adapted screenplay, and was also nominated for other categories, one being best actor (Timothee Charlamet). This film tells the story of Elio and Oliver. Oliver, played by Aarmie Hammer, is a man that has come to stay with Elio and his family. Elio is a 17 year old that starts to fall for Oliver during his time with them. That is where our film's plot lies. I'll be honest by saying that I personally did not love this film as much as the majority of viewers did. But I am in no way bashing the film or saying it's not worthy of praise because some aspects of it are worthy. I'll go over the positives first. The biggest upside to this film is the acting. Both Charlamet and Hammer give great performances, they really do. Charlamet was deserving of the Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. I was very impressed by his work and I connected with his character. Hammer was good as well, and I was also impressed. I didn't really like his character that much, and I didn't care for their chemistry, in fact I felt there was a lack of it. But putting that aside, most of the dialogue is clever and there are good performances to be seen. I just couldn't really get into the story of the two leads.

The Tuscan scenery is great!,"Call Me by Your Name (2017) was directed by Luca Guadagnino with screenplay by James Ivory.Although this film has aroused almost cult-like devotion, with an incredibly high IMDb rating of 8.1, I can't recommend it.One of the basic plot devices, over the centuries, is ""There's a stranger in town."" In this film, the stranger is Armie Hammer. Hammer portrays Oliver--a graduate student in anthropology.Oliver is every woman's dream, and every gay man's dream. He's handsome, intelligent, and he's immediately accepted by the villagers as he joins their ongoing card game.Elio Perlman (played by Timothée Chalamet) is the son of the famous anthropologist with whom Oliver is working. He's handsome, intelligent, and talented. The girls love him, but he's exploring his own sexuality. Can you guess what happens next?This is basically a happy movie, because the Perlmans are so loving and approving, and the Tuscan scenery really is beautiful. However, I have to file a minority report and say that it didn't work for me.

The film wallows in human kindness and caring. It's just about as beautiful an American film as I've ever seen.

Call Me By Your Name (2017),"As soon as I heard this film receiving some award buzz, I knew that I would have to see it. Interesting film title aside, I really went into this film blind not quite knowing what to expect. Sometimes Oscar films can be a bit baity and overbearing or not worth some of the praise it receives, that is the truth. I can say, that does not apply for this film. I don't know what my favorite film of the year is just yet but I'd except Call Me By Your Name to be in the top ten of the year.This film is about a 17 year old boy living in Italy who falls for an American assistant to his father, who comes and stays with them for a period of time. Elio (Timothée Chalamet), soon realizes that he has feelings for this older man and they begin a relationship. Elio has to come to grips with his sexual awakening and see if a relationship is possible despite being in a relationship with a local girl. There's definitely much more to the film than my horrible summary of it, that's for sure.Its a coming of age film of sorts but feels so fresh and like it makes a point to be different. New face Chalamet is now here to stay, having appeared in both Lady Bird and this film. He is fantastic in it and this happens to be the best I've seen from Armie Hammer as well. I had to just see two minutes of this film to conclude that this was a Luca Guadagnino film, the vibrant color and the gorgeous vacation setting cinematography made it feel like A Bigger Splash, and it turns out to be a spiritual successor in a trilogy to that film.The backdrop of the 80s works so nicely with the film because this was also a time where homosexuality was quite hidden but becoming public. The score and soundtrack for this film is fantastic. ""Love My Way"" hasn't sounded this good since the Grand Theft Auto Vice City days. Once you finish the film, you know that you've been treated to something special and a strong contender during awards season.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Purity and innocence of love,"17-year-old Elio lives in the Italian countryside with his parents. One day, his parents decide to host 24-year-olf graduate student Oliver during the summer in order for him to help Elio's father with his research. Elio and Oliver's personality are drastically different, with the former being quite an introvert and solitary youngster, while the latter is a carefree and extroverted mature man. Elio will not find much interest in Oliver at first, but he will soon find himself attracted to him, much to his own confusion. Begins here a game of seduction which will bring more to both men then imagined at first. 
Call Me By Your Name is love between two individuals at its purest form and leaves viewers with tissues to cry with when the credits start rolling at the end. It is relatable in so many ways, tackling the subjects of first love, first sexual relations, separation, heartbreak and does so while beautifully and adequately representing the LGBT community. While the story can seem slow at first with very few dialogue, this brings the movie its realistic aspect and helps the viewers truly get to know Elio and Oliver's personalities and identify with their individual experiences. The cinematography, with many shots within Elio's house's garden or in the woods, is beautiful and fits very well with the simplicity and naturality of Elio and Oliver's relationship. Finally, the soundtrack is a blessing to one's ears and resonates Elio and Oliver's personal feelings in each scene, notably in the very last and heart wrenching scene with Elio.

a liberal slow piece,"Call Me by Your Name is an adaptation of a novel of the same name, about the relationship between Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) in the summer of 1983 Italy. Part romance, part coming-of-age, the movie presents an astute view of a romantic relationship between two men. A melancholic and introspective movie due partly due to Elio's character, it feels a film that is part of the romantic movies that presents a more progressive view of characters and reality.This makes the journey between the characters the main development in the movies as the plot of the film is relatively simple. I felt that the movie was interestingly avant garde in a few ways it was shot. Cinematography, landscapes and some camera effects creates an innovative depiction in the film. Music score is wonderful; matches the mood perfectly. Character performances are powerful.While the movie is definitely well made, certain flaws I felt were in the story and motivations. Oliver seems too much of an impecable character which might be because the performance of Hammer is done too well. It's strange but he felt unrealistic in this regard. Plot points were forseeable. The earlier interactions between Oliver and Elio did not suggest much tension (Which might just be because I'm as equally unaware as Elio).Even though I'm nitpicking, the movie was great but other movies have done a better service to the plot before. Yet, this might just be because the relationship didn't feel as believeable to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too long and dull,This takes place in 1983 Italy. 17 year old Elio (Tinothee Chalmet) meets 24 year old Oliver (Armie Hammer) who's there to help Elio's archaeological father catalog his findings. Elio and Oliver discover they're in love but what can they do?VERY slow-moving gay romance. It moves at a snails pace and gets real boring real quick. Also Chalmet and Hammer are terrible actors. Even worse their characters are obnoxious jerks and you don't care about either one. I seriously considered walking out a few times! However the ending had two very effective moments that had me in tears. Still you have to sit through 2 hours + of boring melodrama to get to it. Not recommended.,2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Timothée is AMAZING! This guy will definitely go far and I'm sure I will be seeing him more. I loved Armie Hammer before, but now I love him even more, and the chemistry between the actors is so good.

Wow!,"I'm glad I had a chance to see ""Call Me By Your Name,"" which is an extraordinary film about love, and lust, and sexuality, and coming of age, and right, and wrong, and cultural blending, and humanness at this moment in history and always. It's less than that too, and very sensual.The film stars Timothy Chalamet as a 17 year old American boy summering with his college professor parents in Italy, in 1983. The family takes in an older male graduate student (Armie Hammer) as a house guest to assist with the father's academic research, and the man develops lustful feelings for the boy who reluctantly reciprocates. The film builds on that connection, turning it into a fully charged sexual relationship that both characters recognize is socially unacceptable, but they carry along anyway in the shadow of the parents who knowingly allow it to blossom. The film delivers moments of tenderness, and moments of discomfort that beg for an off switch but nevertheless must be seen. It's a complex film stuffed with metaphor and message, but that message probably won't sit well in contemporary America. In that sense, the film feels very Italian and very, very, grown up.""Call Me by Your Name"" is mostly in English, but there is some Italian with subtitles. If you see ""Call Me by Your Name"" please give the closing credits their due and spend the last 3:25 appreciating a single lingering tight-shot of Timothy Chalamet, as his character relives the enormity of one brief summer burned into his soul forever. It's an unforgettable shot that closes out a powerfully memorable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good movie,"I saw this film simply for the controversy it created when it was first released in 2017. I resisted my urge not to see a movie on a topic which is not 0f my liking, but I am glad that I ultimately watched this superb movie. Besides watching an excellent love story of a different kind, it reminded me of the good time I spent in Italy as a diplomat in the Pakistan Embassy, Rome!Directed by an acclaimed director, Luca Guadagnino, Call Me by Your Name is a 2017 coming-of-age film which follows the story of 17-year-old Elio Perlman, played by Timothée Chalamet. (What a superb acting by this lad!). While spending the summer of 1983 in Northern Italy with his parents, Elio falls in love with Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, an American graduate student who comes to study with Elio's father.The film is a beautiful exploration of first love and self-discovery. Chalamet delivers a captivating performance as Elio, perfectly capturing the awkwardness and vulnerability of adolescence, while Hammer brings a strong presence as the confident and charming Oliver. Their chemistry is palpable and makes for a deeply moving love story.The film's setting in Northern Italy is visually stunning, with Guadagnino's direction highlighting the lush scenery and warm Mediterranean climate. The cinematography and score add to the dreamlike quality of the film, creating an immersive experience for the audience.One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the complexities of human emotions. The characters are multidimensional and their relationships are nuanced, which makes the story all the more compelling. The film also handles the topic of homosexuality with sensitivity and authenticity, depicting the challenges and joys of discovering one's sexuality in a world that may not always be accepting.Overall, ""Call Me by Your Name"" is a beautifully crafted film that explores universal themes of love, self-discovery, and acceptance. With its stunning visuals, captivating performances, and emotional depth, it is a must-see for anyone who appreciates a good love story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent adaptation,"Great movie! The book relied mostly on Elios inner monologue and the movie relied on nonverbal communication between the actors to convey what they were feeling.

That final act by Timothee made me forget everything that I was thinking of saying about this film, and before that, the fine actor who played his father caused the same, with that subtle glorious speech of his. ""Do not kill the sorrow, and along with it the joy"".

It crossed the age border that makes you a little uncomfortable but the acting was brilliantly executed and delivered.

An overwhelming summer love,"I had never written a review before, but after watching this movie i just felt the necessity, so i am sorry for my not so good english. I don´t know where to start, but i should say that is one of the best romantic stories i have ever seen. I don´t know what adjectives should i use to describe this, it is so sensual, erotic and beatiful. The cinematography is gorgeous, with some beatiful landscapes of Italy (and also a lot of culture!). The sondtrack is really great and worth listening more than once, including the Sufjan Steven´s songs. What can i say about the acting? Timothee Chalamet was just perfect as Elio, he is outstanding and is probably getting many awards; i can´t wait to see him in other movies. Armie Hammer as Oliver was great too! They both have excellent chemistry and the dialogues between them are perfect. I haven´t read the book yet but Luca Guadagnino made an excellent job, and i am sure that is greatly adapted. What i liked the most about this film is that it doesn´t bring up the typical homophobia or AIDS plot, is just the romantic story we deserved, and every single minute is worth the watch. It will probably become a classic in the future. I won´t spoil the ending, but i gotta say that is just so overwhelming and heartbreaking at the same time. You definitely have to watch this movie as soon as possible. Oh, by the way, there is a scene involving a peach that you probably heard about before, it is as perfect as you can expect and it could get the entire film the awards it deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shot composition was lacking,"Starting with the positives, the acting was fantastic. I completely believed both performers and the acting style was effortless and natural. The age difference was also incredibly evident. Casting Timothe as a relatively newer younger talent was a brilliant move. The script was powerful toward the end. However the film moved fairly slowly. The pacing could have been more carefully thought out. Annoying the framing framing and composition throughout the film was incredibly poor, especially for a film of this stature.

Quintessential,"This is my first review on here, but it was only right to for ""Call Me by Your Name"". In the midst of such emotional turmoil, this motion picture enthralled me, immensely; irrefutably, the director - Luca Guadagnino - utilises an uncanny convention of cinematography, which ultimately augments the overall aura of the film. Timothée Chalamet provides us with an abject ebullition of beauty and perfection, when it was least expected, and his career in cinema can only burgeon from here onwards. As for Armie Hammer - his performance imbues a celestial perpetuity, whilst also possessing a manner of virility.

Wanted you to know,"Any movie that makes me want to read the original is a great movie. But ""Call Me by Your Name"" achieved a little more than that. The movie tells a love story between Elio (played by Timothee Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer), who is a grad student that came to live in Elio's house, working for his father who is an archaeology professor.The movie has a rather simple storyline -there is no deceit or major conflict that drives the movie or the romance. It just captures two different people falling in love, slowly. The movie is set in somewhere in Northern Italy and the atmosphere is almost dreamlike and carefree, all captured through some beautiful shots and screenplay. Music was fantastic. As a sucker for classical and Sufjan, I thought it was so beautifully incorporated. The entire movie is so incredibly sensual, and reaches to the core of the audience through its portrayal of young love and the inevitable heartache. This was all possible because of Timothee Chalamet, who was honestly eye-catching. I am straight and it made me question myself. His performance was truly some of the best and I regret myself for not watching his movies earlier as I only watched Dune.This movie was set in 1983, which was a time where homophobia was the common zeitgeist of the age (although the movie didn't feature any of that). Even then, the two pursued each other in a limited amount of time. To cherish both the joy and the heartbreak is the advice that Elio's loving father (Michael Stuhlbarg) gives to his son and that bit was the most beautiful moment of the movie. Ultimately, what does it mean to call somebody by your own name? It's a foreign practice if done alone, but what makes it so incredibly romantic when you do it to someone else? It could mean that they are so absorbed into one another that they are essentially each of their partner. It could also mean that love allows you to see your own reflection many times. Regardless of what it means, it's an inexplicably romantic gesture that I may hope to use one day.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Elio, Elio, Elio...","This is a visually stunning film. Dramatically, it pulls its punches until long after you've expected, and wanted, them. And stubbornly, it never goes where you want it to go. And that is the point. Even so, by its conclusion you will feel that you've been on a profound journey drenched with strong, and confusing, emotions. Armie Hammer plays Oliver, an American college student on a foreign study assignment to Italy. There, he is a house guest of a family in a country villa with a 17 year old son played by Timothee' Chalamet. It is the early 1980's: the purgatory years for gay people when ""Dynasty's"" Stephen Carrington whiplashed between gay and straight from one episode to the next on American television, the AIDS epidemic was in, what turned out to be, its infancy, laws criminalizing gay people remained in penal codes around the world, and marriage equality had not yet been imagined; much less litigated, even much more less become a reality. Within this geo-social landscape, questions began to echo through these societal, and homophobic, norms. ""Norms"" that turned out, in fact, to be abnormal. They turned out to be merely dominant; and poorly examined. It is within this societal context that Elio and Oliver meet.The pace, and arc, of their relationship is deliberately, well - not fast. On the way, however, we are treated to the breathtaking beauty of the Italian countryside, squabbling, and of course passionate, Italians, and the heterosexual distractions that constitute the moat between the two main characters. Armie Hammer throws his acting depth onto the sacrificial fires of this film for the greater good of delivering an Oliver who is as one dimensional as a billboard and as alluring as a mirage. He is tall, handsome, and cocky. He smiles with acres of white teeth and punctuates his conversations with one word quips like, ""later"". The power in his character is literally its lack of obvious depth. It is a thankless job. But so effective in the totality of this story. He is allowed a few brief moments to reveal the roiling conflicts inside of himself. Then just as quickly as they appear, they're withdrawn lest they be examined too thoroughly; which is the point. Elio, by contrast, is a walking human autopsy of the living. His deepest troubles and longings are laid bare. And Chalamet is extraordinary in revealing something about youth that we are incapable of taking our eyes off of. He is a fawn pulling himself up by his wobbly legs for the first time and then bursting into a full gallop fueled by instinct, exuberance, and energy. These are the qualities that have been slowly killed in the adults who surround him. They are the qualities that echo from the past; from the relics that Elio's father dredges up from the ocean floor (foreshadowing here...), to the beautiful countryside's centuries old stone walls adorned with faded, macabre, Mussolini posters. These same qualities will be killed in Oliver, ultimately. But you can't prevent instinct, exuberance, and energy, because it is continuously reborn. As it has been in Elio.The deliberate, and sometimes deliberately frustrating, pace with which this story is told renders its most powerful moments a punch to the gut. Before that sledgehammer (no pun intended) lands, we are re-acquainted with the chaotic messiness of youth where anything is theoretically possible; until it crashes head on into reality. That's the time in life when we learn how not to hurt people by hurting them and then regretting it. By the time the final conversation between Elio and Oliver arrives, over a hissing and crackling long distance phone line, you will need to pick your stomach up from the floor. Elio, in a barely audible whisper, cries out to Oliver. His voice is the only voice that hasn't succumbed yet. He is the sole survivor that, for all practical purposes (bizarre plot line detour notwithstanding), is alone is the wilderness. Oliver cannot hear his pleas over the din of the grinding gears of the pantomime of life around them. Elio's pleas echo back to him alone; and leaves us with the question, him too? You'll get an answer to that. But not in this review.Passing through the lobby after the film I saw a man, seated, head buried in his hands, sobbing uncontrollably. He was being comforted by a female companion; his sister, a friend, or wife, don't know. Truth be told, we all felt at least a little bit like the way he looked. Was he Elio? Or Oliver? Don't know. That scene in the lobby, for me, was the inescapable ending to this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful snoozer,"Were I not a Timmy fan who read the book, I would have turned this off. Or maybe because I read the book, I found the movie unbearably slow? Things about each character I felt were important in the book didn't make it to screen, unnecessary things were added, the dialogue between Elio and Oliver was stilted, Elio's family's American accents felt incongruous... That being said, the set is gorgeous, the color palette is gorgeous and it's wonderfully shot in 35mm. I also did appreciate that Elio's bisexuality was kept a key focus, as many films erase bisexuality especially with male characters. I'm glad the film didn't use the dragged out ungodly ending from the book, though it seems Luca planned or is planning to do that as a sequel... I hope not.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I finish it in three days, I couldn't detach myself from the pages: this book make me felt the love, the feelings that Elio was discovering in that period of time, the vibes of the places, the summer, the sadness. It made me feel deep emotions and I remember that I was reading some pages literally with heart-shaped eyes.I was suffering for love, so I related so much with Elio, and I could feel his emotions and his thoughts because he was a teenager and we were basically the same age.

Call Me By Your Name ... My Name Is Boring.,"Brokeback Mountain was a great Oscar winning film that altered gay representation in cinema and was a strong reflection of the changing times. Call Me By Your Name is nothing new or groundbreaking, and says little of the times we live in. A film that is slow and character-study driven can be very entertaining, yet most tend to come across as artsy and pretentious. As is the case here. Minimal dialogue and long shots of wind in trees is supposed to mean ""award worthy"". The characters seems to jump from one motivation and personality type to another from scene to scene. Oliver changes from serious adult to childish youth so quickly it feels difficult to watch. the dad's speech is unrealistic. Oliver is Way older than the character's 24. There's so many better gay-themed films out there to see, they just don't get award nominations. worth a watch, but nothing like best picture quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Powerfully Poignant Romance,"Have you ever seen a movie that you liked but then once you see the ending you really really liked the movie? Well, that was Call Me By Your Name for me. What is undoubtedly a good movie for 115 minutes, becomes a great one after the full 132 minutes. Luca Guadagnino directs this film in such a calming but yet provocative manner. When the film needs to heat up, it does, and when it needs to slow down and provide a more methodical and thoughtful approach to romance, it most certainly does that as well.I guess with every big film there's always a section of the audience that comes out with serious backlash to some sort of aspect to the story. With Call Me By Your Name, it was that the romance between a 24-year old male (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) and a 17-year old male (Ellio, played by Timothee Chalamet) is unethical and highly controversial. While I can't speak for how that particular group of people felt watching the film, I can tell you that I never once felt like this was a relationship that wasn't consensual. In fact, it's not even so much that it was definitely portrayed as consensual by the two males (and the parents of the younger male for that matter), but it's that the film never makes an outright statement saying that a relationship with this age gap is ""right"". It's a fictional story with fictional people. No one is telling you this relationship is right or glorifying what is considered to be a forbidden relationship.Personally, I took it more as a young male figuring out love for the first time and the person who helps him discover that love is an older (albeit only 7 years) male with more experience. I won't tell anyone who feels differently that they are wrong, that's simply the way I saw the story play out. And if I'm being honest, I thought the relationship between Ellio and Oliver was beautifully told and portrayed. Chalamet is magnetic and relatable (no matter what your sexual preference is) and Hammer nicely balanced the ""hard to get"" and effortlessly desirable part of the romance. I'm a straight man in my mid-20's but I found there to be things very relatable in both of their characters.The film also does a good job of presenting a world that feels foreign but also approachable. Taking place in Italy and in 1983, Call Me By Your Name is great escapist cinema, while also being something timeless in storytelling. Something only few films can capture, a few being Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy, which was clearly an inspiration. My only gripe would probably be the pacing, which is purposefully slower in nature. For me, I just would have liked something that gets to the punch a little quicker. Speaking of ""the punch"", the clear winner of this picture is Michael Stuhlbarg's ending speech about love to Ellio. I never thought a short monologue from one man to another could be so powerfully poignant, but that was this speech.8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Solid Film but Far From Great!,"Unsure what I am missing considering the passionate following for the film. CMBYN is a solid romantic drama but far from the masterpiece people want you to believe.Pros:
* Charming performance by the lead Timothee Chamalet. 
* Solid supporting cast. 
* The script is well-intended and honest. Refreshing to have a film like this not succumb to cliché Gay script plotlines. 
* Lush production and cinematography.Cons
* Armie Hammer is wooden, in genuine and miscast as far as I am concerned. He shares uncomfortable chemistry with Chamalet and is by far the weak link to the film.
* Film comes close to the cusp of being too pretentious.
* At times the film is boring and really struggles when nothing happens.Having seen nearly every Gay film out there, this one ranks right in the middle of the heap. Good to see some massive recognition for a film like this, but the hype isn't really deserved. It's a not-bad film but this isn't ""Brokeback Mountain"". There were far better films of it's type over the last couple years.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful landscape,"This is a thoroughly European experience, at least in regards to the family who is ""Jewish, French and Italian."" The languages that flow throughout the movie are enrapturing, as is the cinematography. But the sexual tension loses its power as it is prolonged and does not move the story forward. Someone wrote it was long but the time passed quickly. Huh? I was checking my watch every 10 minutes after the first hour and a half. This movie could have been powerful had it been further edited. As it was, it became tedious. The father gives this awful, preachy lecture to the son which made me grimace. The screen turned dark, and I thought, finally, The End. But no.

Timothée Chalamet had a spectacular performance. He is getting the recognition he deserves in 2020. He is going to go very far in the acting world. The way that Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer played their characters was done in a spectacular way. Their development into lovers was very well done. The ending was the most hurt I've ever felt in a movie. The way Elio wept in front of the fireplace was extraordinary. I watched every moment and could feel exactly what he was feeling... loss.

Way over-rated....,"I watched this thinking I was going to love it and cry a river after reading a bunch of reviews. First half was slow...slow, slow....and just when you think it couldn't get any slower....you guessed it...it got slower. I just couldn't buy the older handsome guy falling for the young skinny teen guy. And the whole relationship was completely inappropriate under the circumstances. In some ways, it was very realistically written and acted, but the degree of realism perhaps was more of a distraction. When the father has a heart to heart talk with his ""gay"" and in love son near the end, I just didn't buy it. As a whole, his advice/comments didn't ring true. The writer didn't say what I would have said in a situation where I'm older and wiser and now have a lot of good advice to give young people. Not a happy ending, but probably a given due to the circumstances. Acting was good, but I was never drawn into any of the characters. I liked God's Own Country better.

Not Good Enough,"Call Me By Your Name is a romantic drama about coming of age and discovering yourself.The film is presented as a love story but, alas, it didn't feel like it. It was surely a story about lust and sexual awakening, but there were close to zero romance; no sweet moments between the leads, no lovely scenes, nothing, just pure heat.Also, the one leads didn't pass off as the ages they were presented to be. The one didn't look close to twenty five, rather, he looked over thirty, and the other surely could pass for younger than a seventeen year old. Thus, their romance was awkard as it felt like the older guy was taking advantage of the teenage boy who fell in love with him.Other than that, the scenary was pretty and the performances great.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of a kind masterpiece,"Everything in this film screams ""instant classic"", from its incredible attention to every detail, the breath taking Italian scenery that, with the help of the director, makes you feel as if you were right there with the actors, the complicity and intreague of the characters that are so lovable and relatable that Makes le you feel as in love as they are; and finally the unique soundtrack that harmonizes perfectly with the film's paste and atmosphere. The director Luca guadagnino was able to immortalize Andre Aciman's powerful and compelling story so much as to feel yourself reeled in and part of it at the very first minute. This movie presents itself as the one of the only really Oscar worthy films and it really takes us back to the golden age of cinema when movies we call classics and masterpieces today were created.

Oh Man Is This Gay,"Is it really a good time to award this movie anything, considering the Kevin Spacey allegations? Do you really want the firestorm to return to entertainment, Golden Globes.
If you can set aside the homosexual nature of this movie, it is a really effective story of crushes and first love. Though plodding and a bit of a slog, the mood is what you go for. Such as the late afternoon dinners. Swimming in the lake. Listening to rain. This has that coming-of-age sense that ""Man In The Moon"" (the one with Reese Witherspoon). It's heartbreaking in terms of how life does move on even after devastating emotions (well, at that age anyway). And the beauty of simple life in Europe in the 1980's as a teen must've been this charming. Again, this is going to be trashed by Middle America, with good reason.

A Breathless And Sumptuous Movie,"Call Me By Your NameOn the face of it this movie appeared just to be a coming a age story over a breathless summer in Italy in 1983. However it was about so so much more and it is a movie that requires several viewings to draw out the multiple and profound themes that lay just below the surface.The movie looks atThe nature of sexuality linked to age and the tragedy of a sexual prime slipping away. The father says ""there will come a time when no one looks at you, let alone comes near"", and yet he appears ""happily"" married to Elio's mother. His message is to seize the moment to avoid regret.That any sexuality cannot be ultimately ""forced"" or suppressed despite the strictures of any society, and that we should just be ourselves.The careful way the age gap between Elio (17) and Oliver (24) was handled, they are both equal in their needs and desires at that moment in time, planets colliding.Elio adolescent liaison with Marzia demonstrated his strength of desire for Oliver far outweighed his attachment to her. This was nothing personal, never stated, but entirely understood by her when they agreed to be lifelong friends.The metaphor for Oliver was ""later"", but in fact the reality was ""now"".The movie went on to introduce a breathless heat and sumptuous cinematography with a ravishing score.Timothee Chalamet brought a animalistic, instinctive and nuanced portrayal of teenage infatuation. Without being to effusive he demonstrates the art of invisible acting effortlessly, this man is the entire package. I only hope he is given the quality work that respects his talent.Armie Hammer was solid and he really gave a great performance and perhaps well outside his comfort range as a non-European lol!I really loved this movie, it is just a joy to watch 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bore Me By Your Name,"I was very impressed and allured by the rave reviews this film had got, which enticed me to watch it. On top of that, I'm a fan of Timothee Chalamet after enjoying his great performance in Dune (2021). Not to mention, I have a soft spot for romantic drama films and I am also a gay male. So naturally, I would be interested in this film. But boy, did it disappoint me!The film starts out rather slow and sluggish for the most part. What saved it was the beautiful and picturesque setting in Italy. Whilst we are introduced to Oliver in the first scene of the film, we don't see anything special or riveting between Elio and Oliver until an hour into the film. I actually enjoyed the chemistry, but what was actually happening in the film besides the characters conversing with each other, jumping in pools, walking around and dancing? Just fillers. Nothing much. No tension, no intrigue, nothing really to follow. Most of the film was the characters going in and out of their house, toing and froing (it was literally ""Home and Away""). All these superfluous scenes pushed the film to over 2 hours.From bad to worse, I got taken aback when Elio started to get very intimate with his girlfriend, even to the point of unnecessary strong sex scenes with the two. It genuinely undermined the relationship and romantic interest he has with Oliver. I just don't see how a (closeted) gay man would be enjoying kissing a girl so much - The two had prolonged kissing scenes, which went off at a tangent and really betrayed the point of the film. I reminded myself that I was watching a gay movie as the film focused on Elio and Marzia significantly as Oliver leaves the town. Besides, Elio was the man infatuated with another. So there's no point at all for him to have a sexual relationship with a woman when he was obsessed with Oliver. I would've understand Oliver doing that as he was probably more bisexual. Elio seemed unrealistic in this regard. He was supposed to be pretty gay, and yet he briefly becomes Casanova who melts women.Now the tables turn - After becoming a Casanova, he transforms into a very salacious gay man. Okay, I felt a bit embarrassed and ashamed, as a gay man, to see Elio and Oliver acting overly salacious and ribald, from Elio shoving his penis inside an apricot to Oliver spontaneously pulling down his pants and giving him a blow job out of nowhere. Such absurdly unnecessary scenes and acts that didn't add much to the film, and rather made them look like perverted creeps. Which reminds me, why do gay movies usually depict homosexuals as sexual weirdos? Disobedience (2017) featured two lesbians (played by Weisz and McAdams) spitting on each other during sexual activity. Society will hate us more if we're depicted that way. By the way, the man who wrote the book was straight, unsurprisingly so (and honestly straight men do have a misconceived notion of us - that we're lubricious beings).But most of all, where was the emotion in this film? I did not feel anything for the two characters. The ending was emotionless and it did not captivate me. I like sad music with two star-crossed lovers confessing their forbidden love (yeah, I'm being cheesy), and the movie lacked such emotionally sweeping scenes. Oh and another thing, how come Elio's parents didn't suspect anything? They were monotonous, uninvolved and covert throughout the film. They didn't add anything (or take anything, for that matter). Most characters didn't, including Elio's ""girlfiend"". They were all just there like pot plants. That's why I said the film had no tension, intrigue and suspense. The father's speech at the end made me cringe. Brokeback Mountain (2005) is still the best gay-male movie out there.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very spectacular and fresh potrayal of the universal themes of love, longing, desire , pain and sorrow!!!","""Call Me by Your Name"" by Luca Guadagnino is based on the novel of the aforementioned name by André Aciman. This movie feels more of a poetry to love as it captures the raw feelings of the two characters Elio and Oliver with great magnificence. The story which is being told to us feels so real as if it is actually happening infront of our eyes. The background noise sits in quite well and makes us feel like we are experiencing it too. It is a heartfelt coming of age movie about two men who fall in love during a summer in Italy, during the times when homosexuality was stigmatized. Luca Guadagnino very tastefully capture the essence of love,longing and desire and the pain and sorrow that gets associated with that. He spectacularly shows us the pure, akward yet intrensic moments of a budding relationship and the passion of new love with the sense of freshness. He tells us a story about love which must have been felt by many people over the course of their lifes but is capable of encapsulating it with artistic visuals and great acting by Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. The most fascinating thing about the movie is how Luca uses his tools of symbolisms and cinematography to depict what the characters felt on the insides. The track ""Mystery of Love"" by Sufjan Stevens - beautifully captures the heart of their relationship and makes me wish for a love like that.Everything about the movie is so beautiful sometimes words fall short to describe something so immensely beautiful. Timothée Chalamet's acting is so iconic in this movie that I totally became a fan of him instantly. He made me feel the full spectrum of my emotions in 2 hrs 12 mins. The very last scene even after being so static in nature is one of my favourite as it shows the magnificence of Chalamet's acting. I stan Timothée Chalamet!!!!

Mildly Amusing Gay Film - Call Me By Your Name,"This is a beautifully photographed gay film. It will probably not appeal to heterosexuals, which make up over 80% of the world's cinema population, but the other 18% go to lots of these films and they turn a nice profit. To each his own. I lost interest about halfway through the film, as I find gay relationships boring and not useful for my particular universe. However, the acting is very good, as is the direction, and the film is mildly amusing. A tourist, who is arrogant, ill-mannered, very smart and dances like Elaine Bennis, comes to vacation in beautiful Northern Italy. He meets a young gay Italian boy, who has not come out of the closet yet. And there you have it. This is why I got bored halfway through the film. The rest is just so predictable.

An admirable attempt,"If everyone had parents like Elio's, the world would be a happier place to live. The reality, however, is that this is not the case; the majority of them are unable to overcome their prejudices and the long-established social norms of the society in which they exist.These stories serve as constant reminders of the harsh reality that the majority of people do not comprehend, and even if they do, they will not admit it out of fear or because they have been marked by the intimidating figures and their disgraceful gazes.Just imagine how many relationships have been destroyed, diminished, or simply faded away because of all these preconceived notions. If only we could open our minds and hearts to these individuals, millions of lives and hearts would be saved.Heading straight back to the film, it is a beautifully presented coming-of-age drama that compassionately promotes self-discovery and sexual exploration. Two organic performances by Chalamet and Hammer, respectively, heighten the storytelling. Their chemistry is the most compelling element in this narrative.My only criticism is that there are too few conflicts. Aside from the tragic climax, the story had little interest in engaging in any kind of dispute. Everyone is positive; everybody is so reassuring that these circumstances feel unreal, almost like a dream, as if you're in a fantasy land, but the truth is that it never was and is probably never going to be.

Kinda pretentious and boring,"Elio (of 17), a young musician, starts exploring his sexuality and learning about love with his father's student, Oliver (visibly older), who's staying at Elio's family home in Italy for the season.
First of all, the good things. The score and soundtracks are beautiful, all of them either charming by themselves or fitting to the film's time and place. The overall acting feels natural and real, if you're part of an Italian family or have lived amongst them, you'll recognize the warm and homely vibes from their interactions. This feeling is also reinforced through the beautiful setting of the italian summer; the color palette and filters are all fitting too.So, what is it lacking? The actual plot is dull. Some scenes shine through and might add some meaning, but half the film is just filling: characters going to places, staying at places, having daily life interactions with each other, with very little dialogue through it all. A lot of it could have been cut off and it wouldn't matter. But, most importantly, the relationship between the leads had no real chemistry between them; we do see Elio sneaking glances and touching Oliver's stuff, but when did Oliver even start being attracted to Elio? And what about the girls? Why do they keep making passes at them if they're not into it? The conversations are scarce and don't help clarify anything either- not until the very end, at least. I do realize a more poetic, intellectually romantic sort of public might find their relationship more appealing, though.I'm pretty sure most of the really bad reviews (1 to 4 ratings) are because of the disappointment resulting from the high expectations its hype generated. Taking that aside, it's just a (seudo?)intellectual movie trying to display love and relationships in a natural setting, nothing much else happening.

We get to know 17 yr. old Elio and his parents, spending time at their summer home in Crema, Italy. Then Oliver, who is a research assistant to Elio's dad (a professor of archaeology) arrives to spend 6 weeks there. Elio shows Oliver around in the local town. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Italian director Luca Guadagnino, who just a few years ago brought us the excellent ""A Bigger Splash"" (and you can immediately pick up on certain structural similarities between these two films). Here, Guadagnino examines the restless and at times confused state of Elio who, for reasons never made clear, comes around to liking Oliver, a lot. Frankly, I struggled with that. Another thing: am I the only one who raises a question as to the age difference between Elio (whom we know is 17) and Oliver (his age is not disclosed, but I'm guessing, being a research assistant, probably mid-20s, if not older), a significant gap from a 17 yr. old's perspective. But there are plenty of other great things about this movie. First and foremost, having grown up in Belgium (with significant vacation time in the south of France), the movie captures the endless summers of my youth perfectly (I moved to the States in... 1983, the year this movie is set). The bike rides, the meals outside, the laying around in the grass, etc. etc., that is what summer time was like in the late 70s/early 80s. Second, Timothée Chalamet (as Elio) is nothing short of spectacular (on the heels of his smaller role in Lady Bird). While his name sounds French, he is in fact an American, but perfectly bilingual. Third, the production set and photography is pure eye-candy. Last and certainly not least, there is a fabulous soundtrack, with several new songs from Sufjan Stevens that capture the movie's mood just right. No surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced today, ""Call My By Your Name"" got 4 of them (Best Movie, Best Actor, Best Adopted Screenplay and Best original Song).The movie finally went wide this past weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Bottom line is that there are a number of great things about this movie, but I cannot give it a ""perfect"" 5 star rating for the reasons I mentioned. That should not stop you from checking out ""Call Me By Your Name"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifuly filmed, ""Call Me by Your Name"" is not just a love story; it is also (mainly?), a sensitive narrative of self-discovery","""Call me by your name and I will call you by mine"". Thus, in a very simple way, but with an undeniable commitment, lovers Elio and Oliver declare that they no longer belong only to themselves, but, from that moment on, they are also part of each other. They give up even more of the deep intimacy, donating their most personal asset - their own name - to the one in which they see themselves, experiencing their total fullness in the depths of the one in front of them. Call Me by Your Name is yet another testament to the search for beauty undertaken by the Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, but not only that, but much more than that. Far from presenting an empty aesthetic refinement and without reflection properties, what is on stage is a delicate and sensitive analysis of love and loss, freedom and trust, having as a starting point the attraction that develops so imperatively between these two boys.Adapted by James Ivory from the book by André Aciman, ""Call Me by Your Name"" immerses the viewer in a sensual atmosphere from the beginning thanks to the warm palette of strong colors, employed by Thai director of photography Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who with this transforms the bucolic locations into an ideal setting for young and intense romances - and it is interesting to observe how this vigor is balanced by more contemplative shots, such as that of an old man lying on the grass, laughing at an argument that takes place next door, and which evoke calm and peace important in the construction of a narrative dominated by powerful feelings.This is a contrast, by the way, which is present in the central figures of the film. The more we get to know Elio and Oliver, the more those initial roles break down and new facets are discovered. ""Do you know how happy I am that we slept together?"", says the American to the boy at one point. The image of Oliver riding a bicycle without holding the handlebars shows a liberation in this sense, and the strength of these characters is due, of course, to the great performances of Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer. More than giving in to the sexual scenes, the two build their characters with subtlety and a sensitivity that is only heightened by the material they work with, written by James Ivory.Lived by Armie Hammer, Oliver is presented as a man of intense appetites and, therefore, lustful (notice the voracity with which he devours his breakfast or drinks a glass of juice), Oliver is imposing in his physique and in his expansive personality, while Elio gains Timothée Chalamet's thin body, which, projecting the neck forward, makes it clumsier and suggests a certain insecurity. Similarly, if Oliver projects his voice and gestures when speaking, Elio almost whispers the words and appears restrained much of the time. On the other hand, it is curious to note how it is this one who seems to take the initiative to approach the other, who, in turn, seems hesitant to give himself up (after a restrained kiss, Oliver tries to interrupt what is about to happen and, revealing a lot about himself and the world he lives in, he says: ""So far we've behaved. We've been good. We haven't done anything to embarrass ourselves. Let's keep it up. I want to be good."")However, trying to stop a physical attraction so vivid and still strengthened by an unquestionable intellectual compatibility is a task normally doomed to failure - and, reflecting the image of the statue rescued by Professor Perlman's team, a desire like that does not remain submerged when there is a curiosity. So big to unveil its beauty. Thus, it is natural that Oliver always remains present in Elio's mind, which is illustrated by the frequent shots in which the first can be seen in the background, out of focus, while the second is positioned close to the camera. In addition, director Luca Guadagnino hints at the temptation aroused by small gestures, such as a touch on the other's back, or even pieces of clothing, such as a swim trunk carelessly left to dry. Incidentally, the best aspect of Guadagnino's approach resides in his understanding that this whole process of discovering love can be complicated, confusing, but it is, above all, good, pleasurable. Elio is not tortured by what he feels or by realizing his same-sex attraction - Call Me by Your Name is not a film that is ostensibly concerned with homophobia -; instead, it is his curiosity about Oliver and what he awakens in him that drives the protagonist. When making his first ""official"" date with the other, Elio does not feel guilt or anguish, just anxiety that the time to see him will come soon.The dynamic between Chalamet and Hammer, by the way, is essential for the viewer to feel the chemistry, lust and affection existing between the characters, the affection they show with each other and the natural way they play, talk and interact is contagious. Touch, as if they had always known each other. At ease with what they feel (physically and emotionally) after the initial stumbles, Elio and Oliver see each other as an extension of themselves - and therefore, when the request that gives the film its title (and which is complemented by ""and I I will call you by mine"") is finally heard on the screen, we understand the romantic essence of the phrase and how they can trust each other with their own identityThis sensitivity comes from a film that values the very act of feeling. A close-up of two legs rubbing against each other by the pool, a hand caressing the other and a whisper that lends its name to this film. It is through these small gestures, but which say more than words that ""Call Me by Your Name"" is completed, and it is amazing how even the supporting characters become more complex through them, as in the powerful silent motherly comfort that Elio receives after the heartbroken. Even so, it is in Elio's father's touching, almost confessional, final monologue that the feelings accumulated during the screening are expressed. The final scene, a close-up of the face and Elio to the heartwarming song ""Visions of Gideon"" composed for the film by Sufjan Stevens as the end credits roll sums up the journey, as if it were more than a love story. As if in this close-up, Luca Guadagnino reassigned to Elio the role that has always been his. This was, after all, always his coming of age, his story of discovery and growth, and Guadagnino - elegantly - clings to his face until the end. With his parents blurred in the background, this moment becomes intimate and confidential between the protagonist and the audience itself. In it, a whirlwind of emotions crosses Elio's face, which in a short period of time outlines confusion and pain, but at the end a smile of understanding. The smile of someone who recognizes the pain, but celebrates the opportunity he had to experience a love as intense as the one he experienced with that person. This is the real privilege.Director Luca Guadagnino is faithful to Italian cinema, its filmography and the premises of the work. Great Italian filmmakers shamelessly tackled sex and sexuality, such as Fellini and Pasolini, while Guadagnino himself gives sensual tones to his productions, as he did in ""A Dream of Love"". It was no different here, with a strong erotic charge in the romantic atmosphere, being, in short, another novel with a lot of sensuality, without becoming exaggerated as Fellini did with ""Satyricon"". Nudity is not appealing - it doesn't hurt to remember that European cinema does not follow the logic of Hollywood cinema -, as it is within a context. The direction ends up being an ode to beauty, encompassing male beauty and natural charm, through beautiful scenarios that show the stunning Italian landscapes (gardens, lakes, monuments, small urban centers, etc.) and an exquisite sound edition (bicycle, birds, a squeezed peach, etc.). The costumes are also impeccable, remaining faithful to the era in which the story takes place, favoring summer colors, usually putting Elio in a T-shirt (more informal) and Oliver in a shirt (more formal), but both with very short shorts (well above knee height). Anyway, technically, the film is stunning.""Call Me by Your Name"" is not just a love story; it is also (mainly?), a narrative of self-discovery, and it is through Oliver that Elio will learn not only about the feeling of absolute surrender, but about himself - and it is no wonder that, throughout the projection, he creates variations for a Bach cantata, as this musical exploration is a reflection of his search for his own voice. His lust for Marzia, for example, is no less real than his lust for Oliver; nor is it enough, since it comes without all the other elements that make North American unique for young people. And this is something that does not go unnoticed by those around him - be it his parents, the family servants or Marzia. Incidentally, one of the most touching components of the film is Professor Perlman's loving nature, which Michael Stuhlbarg plays with immense human warmth and which culminates in a monologue that moves for the honesty it denotes and the vulnerability it suggests. This is a novel of formation, testimony of a specific moment that will be etched in the memory of those who lived it, felt it or even witnessed it. Impossible to remain indifferent, even harder to want to show any contrary reaction. A handshake can have a thousand meanings, or just a carefree touch. But the seal that is established from the first contact, this remains alive. Indelible and permanent.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A truly tough film to rate,"""Call Me by Your Name"" is what it is, and I don't mean that in a flippant or condescending way. It's just that it is a very low-key, deliberately slow-paced character study with one killer, incredibly well-written--and likely unforgettable--monologue at one point. It undeniably, effectively depicts a brief period in two lifetimes that will never be forgotten by the two main characters. But for some reason I felt detached and a bit put off by being a part of it. I should mention I'm a huge fan of James Ivory's (and his two partners') past films, my favorites being ""A Room With a View"" and ""Maurice."" ""Call Me..."" has the same meticulous location detail and atmosphere of those films, but the characters here feel under-developed and almost one-dimensional, which surprised the heck out of me considering the past films he's been a part of (I realize he was the screenwriter here, and not the director, by the way). But I have to give it credit for simply and effectively portraying two young/youngish men as they are brought together in idyllic, lovely surroundings and left to discover each other because they have so much free time to do so. What they discover is portrayed as very special because they are both good people, but that killer monologue I mentioned earlier left me feeling conflicted as to just how special it truly was, and whether the character delivering it was sincere or just trying to be a part of needed healing and giving perspective to this moment in life for someone he cared about deeply. I will say I was left thinking about the film as I left, if feeling unsatisfied and confused by it, so I guess I can at the very least say it wasn't a throwaway film or moviegoing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely fantastic.,"This movie is real life on screen. It grabs hold of every sense of your being and doesn't let go until the end, I was changed forever after this movie. I know for myself being a woman and gay this story related and to my friends straight as well because the love between these two beautifully portrayed characters, it really only shows love not gender. The performances by Armie Hammer(Oliver) and Timothée Chamalet(Elio) are captivating and give new life into portraying love and Michael Stuhlbarg's(Mr. Perlman) portrayal captures a supportive parent and the monologue at the end of the movie is one that has stuck with me and I remind myself about constantly, as well as changed the way I will parent my kids. This movie is a coming-of-age film where the slow burn of desire and passion for another person in the reality of life is portrayed in the most simplest and accurate forms.

"stylish, sensual","Call Me by Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino is a beautiful movie based on instant admiration, attraction and body worship. Timothee Chalamet as teenager Elio is awesome. Elio lives with his mom Annella and dad Mr Perlman( Michael Stuhlbarg: The Shape of water, Arrival..) in Northern Italy . Oliver (Arnie Hammer :The social network), an American student ,stays with the family for 6 weeks to study under tutelage of professor Perlman. Elio is drawn instantly towards Oliver's good looks and American ways of relating to others. Passion is beautifully captured between two humans. When it is time for Oliver to leave, Elio is filled with gloominess. Elio learns about life and life's opportunities from his dad. Oscar nomination for style and Oscar worthy acting by Timothee Chalamet. In some ways, the movie had some similarities to movies Beginners with Christopher Plummer and Breathe in with Felicity Jones. What makes Call me by your Name special is the quiet understanding of the situation by Elio's mom who sees the need for Elio and Oliver to spend some alone time. enjoyed the beautiful locations and Stylish Direction of sensual scenes. superb title.

"Not as good as Brokeback, but still great.","A beautifully made film set in the picturesque landscapes of the Italian countryside, that explores the sensual growth of two individuals discovering what love really means. This is a film that I have been curious (no pun intended) about for a while now but only watched until recently. The cast has tremendous chemistry together, and both Armie Hammer and Timotei Chalamet deeply immerse themselves into a fully believable relationship that I'm sure elevated the acting status of the pair. At this point, Timothy Chalamet needs no introduction, considering that he is not even 30 yet and has already conquered Hollywood with a plethora of outstanding lead roles, but I'm sure this is one of his best performances. The film looks gorgeous, accompanied by beautiful atmospheric music elevating the already stunning surroundings of Italy. Amazing camera work, in addition to dialogue that resonates with each character and a final message delivered by Micheal Stuhlbarg (Timotei's father), leaves a deep and strong perception of life. Don't get me wrong this is not a film for everyone and I'm sure the Cannes Film Festival was losing its mind on this one, but Call Me by Your Name is a transcendent love story for the acting or filming connoisseur.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love is love,"We will eventually say goodbye to our youth. But regardless of whether the loved one is away or not, we should all thank those who have appeared in our lives. The movie tells us that the same-sex love is no different from our usual love. There are sensitive temptations in the beginning, sweet time in the middle, and regretful differences in the end.

Guadagnino mesmerizes with a superb cast.,"The setting is rural northern Italy in 1983. Oliver (Armie Hammer) is an American graduate student visiting the Perlman family for the summer to work on an internship with the family patriarch (Michael Stuhlbarg), an archeology and art professor who used to live and work in the U.S. Professor Perlman has a seventeen-year-old son Elio (Timothée Chalamet) who is infatuated with Oliver.A great film is one that succeeds in getting past early hurdles and leaves one with an exhilarated feeling by the end. Here are the early hurdles for ""Call Me By Your Name"":1) The atmosphere was one of such super-privilege that it seemed inaccessible to more than 95% of the population. To have enough wealth to live in beautiful large home in northern Italy while being paid for working in the arts and archeology (with plenty of free time) seems like a dream for most of us. And when the family and their guest casually change languages (English, Italian and French with occasional German) while discussing all forms of the arts, it sometimes seemed rather lah-dee-dah.2) It took a while to get past the fact that the two young lead actors both looked like younger versions of other famous people. Chalamet resembles what could be a young Justin Trudeau. Even more so, Hammer could easily pass as a young version of the TV character ""Frasier"" played by Kelsey Grammer. Not only does he look, sound, and act like ""Frasier"", being a wealthy art-lover is the icing on the cake.The film not only passes these hurdles but the viewer even gets over the initial dislike of Oliver who, in the beginning, comes off as pompous and presumptuous (like I mentioned: ""Frasier""). But in the second half, Hammer succeeds in showing the genuine vulnerability of Oliver to the point the viewer can feel compassion for him.Chalamet is even more powerful in subtly putting Elio's feelings on display after initially succeeding in reminding viewers of the frustration and insecurity of a teen falling in love with a young adult who seems so worldly.The character of Professor Perlman seems ornamental for most of the film but at the end, he delivers a monologue that is the movie's highlight - in addition to being one of the best scenes of movies released in 2017. It not only provides a shocking twist (and subtly at that), it gives a lecture on life that might seem to be addressed to young Elio; but no doubt it is the writer addressing members of the audience of all ages about our deepest feelings, memories, and life choices. Kudos to Stuhlbarg for his delivery, screenwriter James Ivory, and his source - the book by André Aciman.And the greatest kudos go to director Luca Guadagnino for putting this brilliant work together. He uses the beauty of northern Italy to mix with the film's deeper themes of love, compassion, and the willingness to risk and be vulnerable to more fully experience life. This goes way beyond any class differences that seemed so apparent at the film's beginning. And Guadagnino takes the viewer in so slowly, it's impossible to see how he did it - we're too caught up in our own feelings.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Luca Guadagnino2) Acting Ensemble",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Exquisite Masterpiece,"I have seen this movie around 5 times and each time I find something new and wonderful. Both Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet are perfect in their roles; the tension building up to their first encounter part of the gripping plot.Then there is the nostalgia angle. I was about the same age as Elio in 1983 and the movie brought back fond memories of that less complicated and happier time. And if you love the Psychedelic Furs - ""Love My Way"", you will see what I mean.There are many things going on this film from the pretence of being something you're not, the absolute ecstacy of discovering the power of sex with someone you care for, and then the heartbreak of losing them.I love how this film shares with you, and invites you, to participate in the highs and lows so that you are so drawn in you feel a part of it all. Then there is the beautiful Italian scenery where the story takes place; the lazy Mediterranean summer when the upper middle class can laze about, eating al fresco and dancing far into the night.I cannot rave about this film enough, so I might stop here.

Arguably, not much happens other than the incredible sexual tension and blossoming love between Elio and Oliver but it's so beautifully paced and delivered that I was really moved by it.I found myself totally drawn in to Elio's pain and desperate longing, the character arc of Oliver, the monologue by Elio's father, and the perfect way the laziness of a hot Italian summer was captured. So much so that I'm still thinking about it days later which is always a good sign.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Atmospheric and Poignant,"As Luca Guadagnino's breakout film that took off in 2017 to have a highly regarded cinema run and press tour, Call Me By Your Name remains at the top of many lists of Queer Films heavily recommended by magazines, reviewers, influencers, etc. All these years later. The most notable tokens that still show up in pop culture related to this film are the impeccable soundtrack (key tracks from Sufjan Stevens), Guadagnino's artistic style and, of course, Timothée Chalamet.Though all three creatives mentioned above had significant work and experience under their belt prior to this film, the three working together- alongside other assets too, of course- definitely stirred up a specific type of magic because their joint popularity exploded from here.In terms of story, cast, crew, and pre-production origin, there are multiple cultures at play on screen and the blend of American and Italian style works very seamlessly. Almost like a diet foreign film for those who cannot bring themselves to regularly see them, Call Me By Your Name managed to capture mass appeal at the time of its release and it could arguably be regarded as a turning point (along with Parasite) for commercial American movie theaters opening their doors to more foreign cinema.At the helm, an American-Italian family of three spends every summer lounging and studying at their summer home in Northern Italy and every year the father, an Archaeologist, invites a new graduate student to be his research assistant. The Perlman family is welcoming, smart, charming, and often ahead of their time- especially Mr. Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) when it comes to his style of parenting. When the chosen student, Oliver (Armie Hammer), arrives for the summer, he unknowingly makes waves with the rest of the household, including the Archaeologist's wife, Annelle (Amira Casar) and son, Elio (Timothée Chalamet).Over the course of the summer small irritations and cultural differences blossom into romantic feelings and encounters as both Elio and Oliver shed their misconceptions of one another in favor of being vulnerable and honest.Though this film continues to age poorly and the age gap between Oliver and Elio is never addressed within the story, the choice to cast Chalamet as Elio really dampens the glaring issue presented on the page as he was twenty-two at the time-- much older than his seventeen-year-old character. It's unclear how much of the book's source material was changed intentionally and how much was inadvertent, but the film glosses over Elio's age and spends the majority of its focus on the slight antagonist to love interest arc instead. My one true gripe with this film is that they had the opportunity to change the ages of the characters and didn't, even though it wouldn't have changed the story at all.If you close your eyes to the unflattering elements of the movie (not even going to give any airtime to the Armie Hammer situation), the summer warmth, leisurely pace and low stakes make the film a pleasant atmospheric experience at the very least. There aren't really any serious topics discussed or portrayed at all. Instead, the settings, lighting, music, dialogue, and relations between the characters are all designed to have the audience feel the same annoyance, intrigue, loneliness, joy, validation and grief as Elio does. Despite nothing particularly dark happening, this film makes me cry almost every time I watch it because the atmosphere created on screen is that good at pulling the audience into the character's shoes- there was a very good reason it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars!If for nothing else, I would recommend everyone to at least give it a try because there's a scene near the very end where Elio's father delivers an incredible monologue. Not only is it so tactfully written, but the casual familial intimacy between Michael Stuhlbarg and Timothée Chalamet's characters is truly so special and well-acted. I hadn't seen a scene done like that before and I also haven't seen another like it since.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
