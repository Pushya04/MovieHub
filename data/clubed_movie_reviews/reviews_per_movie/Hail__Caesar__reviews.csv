Undercooked but tasty,"The Coen Brothers are heroes of mine. They travel from universe to universe remaining true to themselves. Hail, Caesar should have been , I thought, a familiar universe for them but they seem lost. A journey without a clear destination. There are, of course, a few pleasures along the road. The scene between Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Finnes is a gem. Alden Ehrenreich is a breath of fresh air with vintage breezes that are exciting, compelling and totally disarming. The tap dance routine with Channing Tatum is also a lot of fun even if I can't quite get Channing Tatum. Great body and he can dance but he seems to be somewhere else. Impossible to connect on the screen with him. I hear he gets millions of dollars per movie so maybe it's just me. The opposite of George Clooney who launches himself body and soul to every moment he has on the screen. I will shut up now and wait for the next Coen Brothers movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a film for the average viewer.,"I was very surprised how quickly ""Hail, Caesar"" was in and out of the theaters...but now after seeing the film, I can completely understand why. It was as if the Coen Brothers simply said ""let's do a film for ourselves...who cares whether or not the public enjoys it or not!"". I appreciated it myself...but I am also not the average film-goer. As for the average viewer, the film makes allusions to many events in the history of Hollywood...but if you aren't aware of these events or rumors, you'll not understand or appreciate much of the film.The story is based SLIGHT on the life of Eddie Mannix--a motion picture exec who was known as a 'fixer'--a guy who knew how to make bad problems do away...and with the bad behavior of many of the stars, this was an exhausting job. The story seems to be just a slice out of Eddie's life--possibly not the worst time as a fixer but a busy one. Through the course of the film, several problems arise--such as a pregnant single starlet and an actor of dabbles in communism. In each case, Mannix has to get to work to be sure the public never knows...and you see how exhausting this job is.If you are looking for big laughs, you won't see them. There are a few small ones...just a few. Instead, it's more like a time machine trip to the early 1950s and you are that fly on the wall watching these Hollywood types as they go about their lives and doing stupid things. I do NOT strongly recommend the film but only mildly...and only if you are a real fan of the films of yesteryear AND are aware of the misbehaviors of some of our stars...or alleged misbehaviors.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Would that it were so simple,"In the Coen Brothers latest ""Hail Caesar"" we have exactly the same Hollywood-based mix of communist writers and Hedda Hopper-style gossip columnists as recently seem in ""Trumbo"": but the films could hardly be more different.""Hail Caesar"" is the film within the film: the latest Victor Mature style 'God and Sandals' epic for Capitol Pictures, starring the megastar Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Trying to keep this movie on track - together with all the other movies being concurrently filmed - is tough no-nonsense fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). These other movies include an Esther William's style water ballet starring gal-in-trouble DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson); an Anchor's Aweigh-style musical starring Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum); and a pot-boiling drama featuring non- acting singing-cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich).To add to Mannix's tension, Whitlock is drugged and kidnapped before the final climactic Crucifixion scene can be filmed. Who's behind the plot and why, and can Mannix restore order while keeping the story out of the eye of voracious journalist twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both Tilda Swinton)?The film plays out as a series of loosely connected vignettes, some much more successful than others. Johansson's water ballet, and indeed her entire sub-plot, is all rather dull and irrelevant and in my opinion could happily have been ditched.Channing Tatum however is a revelation as a song and dance man in a Gene Kelly tribute. His song and dance number was for me the best part of the film and I could watch this stuff all day: I would personally LOVE IT if someone would make a complete retro-feature film in this ilk. Watch out too for Christopher Lambert (""Highlander"") as his almost incomprehensible Swiss director.Capturing the most attention though is young Ehrenreich as the upcoming star without a clue. Many of his scenes, especially those with classical director Laurence Laurentz (a brilliant Ralph Fiennes) are hilarious.Popping up in cameos are Jonah Hill (as the fixer's well paid 'man to take the rap'); Frances McDormand (""Fargo"") as a dottie film editor who really shouldn't wear scarves; and Robert Picardo (""Star Trek Voyager"") as the Jewish representative in a contentious meeting of religious representatives discussing Christ's portrayal in the film (""So, a priest, a Protestant, a Greek Orthodox and a Jew walked into a studio..."").Having last year enormously enjoyed the studio tour at Warner Brother's studios in LA (HIGHLY recommended if you can book ahead for when you are in town) it was great to see the studios making an actual film there again (as opposed to TV). Cinematographer Roger Deakin has great fun suffusing the studio and everything else with a 50's glow, an effect extending to the old 4:3 screen format (which I can see generating some ""my DVD is defective"" returns in a few months!)Is it any good? I think it's fair to say that this is a 'Marmite' movie (which if you are non-British is a way of saying that the film will massively divide opinion). I've not seen as many people walk out of a film at the cinema in recent years.I personally found it a light-hearted and nostalgic trip into a golden age of studio-management, show-casing again the comic gurning talents of Clooney (particularly prevalent in the scene where he gets slapped around a bit and which demonstrates his range - as if we needed reminding after ""The Descendants""). Brolin is great as the straight-guy Mannix and most of the rest of the cast add value, though Johansson seems Ill at ease with her role. I'm also afraid 2 x Swinton is not equal to 1 x Mirren in ""Trumbo"". But it is Alden Ehrenreich that is the real acting find of the film - a breakout role for him after more minor roles in films like ""Stoker"" and ""Blue Jasmine"".This is not the best Coen brothers film, being patchy and spasmodic and, in places, rather too clever for its own good. I got the same feeling watching bits of this (for example, the writer's meeting scene) as I do in many Woody Allen films: that I am not politically / philosophically intelligent enough to understand the niceties of the script (and I'm considered quite bright!). This can be a bit alienating for an audience.If I think back to all its numerous sub-parts it was often in 4-Fad+ territory.... but overall it's lack of cohesive story arc brings the overall confection down a notch or two.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

Wanted to Like It So Much More,"I am a huge Coen Brothers Fan. Many of their films are hard core 10's in my ratings and I had an uneasy feeling going into this one. The trailer made me think of Intolerable Cruelty more than O Brother Where Art Thou or many of their other films.It felt like a strung together series of little set pieces that didn't hang together as a whole. I won't mention the plot since there was virtually none and what there was was fairly flat and unimportant.Normally the Brothers can overcome a weak plot (although strong plot-lines have driven several of their movies) with strong quirky performances and memorable cinematography.Sadly, the dialog lacked snap, the film didn't pop off the screen looks wise, given that it's a period piece, and with such a strong cast, everyone looked tired - almost as if they had come in to film their parts after getting off their day jobs and they were just doing a favor to the Coen's.Overall I've seen much worse but when you go to a Coen Brothers film, you just expect much more.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Not one of the Coens' better films,"Caught this at a screening the other night, and wasn't very impressed. The laughs are infrequent, and it's downright boring in stretches. It does have its moments, though: My favorite was Brolin trying to get reassurance from an array of religious leaders that his new biblical epic won't offend anyone. And Ehrenreich, who I'd never heard of, was great as the clueless but sincere rodeo expert who has somehow fallen into serious act-ting... much to Ralph Fiennes' chagrin. Who knew a line like ""if only it were so simple?"" could generate such hilarity? Such moments are few and far between, though.Overall, this is a C+ flick - I think it's getting over-rated by critics just cuz of the Coens' name. It's one of their weaker efforts.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Glorious Mess of a Movie,"It looks so good. Really, the feel of 1950s Hollywood has never been better, the photography is first rate with a stellar cast directed by the popular and very much held in esteem COEN BROTHERS. Trailer made it look like an fun Frank Capra kind of film. And when we walked out of it, given all the above, we missed something. A movie. There is none here. It is a great job made by talented people aplenty. It wants to be that fun film but never finds the movie. A few jokes. Not enough. Quirky fun characters, but not weird enough. Sublots aplenty, but they never run together and never are resolved. Good acting that goes nowhere. This fine film is just a bunch of dead end streets that are way too short with really interesting stuff on the side of the road but no intersection.Neil Simon was given script advice once that all the characters have to meet in the play AT LEAST ONCE. Here, none meet at all. They have the subplot and that is it. Ending was weak too. Meh.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not for everyone, and maybe that's a good thing...","HAIL CAESAR! (""A Story of the Christ"", as we are told in the title card) is one of those offbeat gems that I have no doubt grows in affection with repeated viewings. Folks here complain that it's not a laugh-a-minute farce, that it's not this, that it's not that...Here's what it *is*: the film version of RADIO DAYS.Just like Allen made a loving pastiche of radio at its height in the 1940s, so have the Coens done for film at the tail end of its Silver Screen era, when studios manipulated its contract players and worked the media to prevent the ""unfortunate"" aspects from being revealed to an audience that just wanted escapism fantasy. Josh Brolin is the tightly-wound studio ""head of physical production"", an enforcer who's being seduced by a potential job with Lockheed to oversee work on the atom bomb. Before he can come to a decision about whether or not take it, he has to deal with the sudden disappearance of the slightly disconnected-from-reality George Clooney (who looks like he's having a blast in this, especially in the final scene of his big budget sword-and-sandel Jesus epic). Along the way, we see the Coens' take on Esther Williams, Carmen Miranda, Gene Kelly, and a host of other stars from the era...... and this is what makes the film so damn much fun. It's not about the story, it's about how the Coens are celebrating the films we have perhaps idealized a bit too much: Esther Williams' underwater ballets and Gene Kelly in NYC for 24 hours and Gary Cooper trying to play it in a toney, high-class period drama. There are so many references to the great films of the day that if you blink, you'll miss a few — they follow fast and furious and sometimes with little more than a sly wink. If you are an old time movie buff, you will love this film to tiny little bits. If not... well, you probably wont enjoy it all that much.But then the Coens probably didn't make it for you, did they...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"In many ways should have been stronger, but is still good fun if you like the Coens' work","This film seemed to get quite a mixed response when it came out, and watching for myself I can understand why. On one hand it is a light bit of fun, which is professionally delivered in all aspects; however at the same time it always feels like it could easily have been more than this – and maybe could have delivered more along the lines of other Coen brother films. How strongly you feel about this will depend on the individual; for me I fell between the two stools.As a comedy I enjoyed it. It had smart dialogue and characters, all with plenty of color and atmosphere. At the same time the film looked great from the cinematography through to the cast involved. This did work against it for me too then; mainly because it seemed to always harken back to other films such as Barton Fink, and other better films. This feeling is confirmed because Hail Caesar! is at its best in the moment, but doesn't really build or develop into something more satisfying. It is still funny, very well delivered, and enjoyable as part of the familiar Coen world, but they have done better, and it is hard not to think that while watching this.",,Anonymous,Music
Hail Hollywood!,"For those who have no knowledge of Golden Age Hollywood, skip this as the humour is very much based on in-jokes.Fans of Golden Age Hollywood will enjoy the pastiches of Hollywood films- a sword and sandals epic starring George Clooney, an Esther Williams swimming film starring Scarlett Johansson, a stagey drawing room comedy directed by Ralph Fiennes and a Gene Kelly style musical clearly based on On The Town, starring Channing Tatum. Unfortunately this collection of pastiches doesn't come together into a great film. Josh Brolin's fixer character is boring and the kidnap plot is very dull (and relies on another Golden Era Hollywood in-joke that only cinephiles will get- even as one myself I was bored with that element).Removing the kidnap plot and giving more screen-time to the other characters (Ralph Fiennes role is pretty much just a cameo) would have improved it considerably. I can see they were aiming for a similar style of comedy to Singin' in The Rain, which parodies the arrival of the talkies. Aldren Ehrenreich gives easily the best and funniest performance as a star of cowboy pictures forced to star in Ralph Fiennes' stiff mannered comedy; this shows what the film could have been but missed the opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"This movie got an A rating in the Cleveland Plain Dealer from a film reviewer I have long respected, so I took advantage of a free late afternoon to go see it on the day it opened.It's a shame the review was so positive, because it made my disappointment that much greater.There is very little in this movie that is funny. (The audience I saw it with almost never laughed.) Most of the parodies are simplistic and flat and don't say anything clever about the subjects they are lampooning.Take the extended water ballet sequence that is meant as a send-up of Esther Williams movies. The sequence itself looks like a poor man's version of one of the numbers in *Jupiter's Daughter*. Scarlett Johannson looks frightened all the while she's up in the air in that little basket, but not frightened enough to be funny. And then? Nothing. The number ends as it would in an Esther Williams movie, and there is unfunny dialogue with the swimming character concerning her pregnancy.And so it goes throughout the movie. Things happen, but there is no followup. There are parodies of different types of movies popular in the 1940s and 50s, but the parodies aren't clever or insightful. George Clooney's character gets kidnapped by left-wing script writers, but those scenes don't tell us anything about the black-listed screenwriters of the era.Etc.Some of the reviews on here say the movie is terrible, some think this movie is the best thing since sliced cheese. It's neither extreme. It's just a largely flat comedy, with too few laughs.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Ironically but vainly dedicated to the 50's gossips,"Despite the fact this movie is ironically dedicated to the 50's gossips (Charlton Heston, Esther Williams, Gene Kelly, ...), despite the constant second degree humour, despite all these excellent actors, despite my keen interest in the filmography of the Coen brothers, I got seriously bored!In bulk: a Roman legionnaire who discusses sociology with communists who have just kidnapped him; a starlet who plans to adopt her own newborn; a suitcase full of banknotes flowing right next to a submarine, because of a chihuahua; a motion picture exec who daily confesses his sins; ... and so on and so on ...",,Anonymous,Music
Funny pastiche of bygone Hollywood,"One scene in particular (saiors in a bar) is brilliant and recreates the atmosphere of old Hollywood musicals to much better effect than the over-hyped LaLa Land.

Also Ralph Fiennes is fantastic.The storyline is not particularly strong, but I don't think this matters. Really it;s a sort of loosely connected set of vignettes, lots of which are really well crafted and funny.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice try,"This just doesn't gel. It is too disjointed, too compartmentized.

There are some great dance numbers as well.Alden Ehrenreich is the real standout of this film. He obviously took the part seriously and researched, practiced and worked hard.Move over George Clooney and I mean yesterday.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Satire that lacks energy, conviction, characters, character development, a focus, and nearly everything that makes good satire","After the phenomenal and emotional roller-coaster of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a film that still hasn't found the audience it so desperately deserves, Joel and Ethan Coen followup arguably their best film with one that might be their most forgettable. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is a disappointment of epic proportions; an empty, unfocused satire on Hollywood business that has too many characters fighting for too little screen time, almost no energy despite attempting to work with a high-stakes plot, no strong character relationships despite the fact that everyone is trying to get a word in at all times during the course of the film, and finally, no central conflict that results in the characters ostensibly mustering up any kind of energy. If the characters themselves barely care about the situations they're in, why should we, the audience, who is now out of the high cost of a movie ticket?The film revolves around a Hollywood mogul Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), who is hired to help fix the troubled production of a Hollywood epic known as ""Hail, Caesar!."" The film stars the famous Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who winds up being drugged on-set and kidnapped by a radical group of communists that call themselves ""The Future."" Mannix is tasked with giving the group $100,000 in exchange for his star actor.The Coen brothers spend much of the film hopscotching from different characters and different sets in what feels like a setup for a mini-series rather than a one-hundred minute film. Such characters are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes), a very meticulous director, Thora and Thessaly Tacker (both played by Tilda Swinton), rival, twin-sister gossip columnists, Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a low-rent Western actor-turned-movie-star, who is one of Mannix's closest clients, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an actress who becomes pregnant out of wedlock in the middle of her film, and Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), a Gene Kelly-type actor, also working under the order of Mannix, who winds up at the center of the film's outstanding dance sequence between a group of Coast Guard members about to embark on a nautical mission that will prevent them from seeing a dame for months.""Hail, Caesar!"" is a film of moments, meaning that, once the film is over, you'll remember certain scenes you enjoyed, certain actors' cameos (which most of the aforementioned are) you appreciated, and if you're lucky, lines you can quote verbatim. At the end of the day, the sporadic humor that those little moments provide is not enough to recommend a film. The Coen brothers don't seem to know what direction they want to take this film, and with such a concise runtime, they have no time to make good use of the actors they probably paid quite a bit to show up on set for one day. This gives the film the look and feel that most of these A-list stars are simply fighting over screen time, and that isn't funny, especially when you have true talent being only momentarily showcased so the film can dart off to the next decorated setpiece.Then there's the issue of the film just not having much life to it outside of immaculate costume design and some strong cinematography (done by Roger Deakins, one of Hollywood's most masterful cinematographers working today). Because the actors aren't given characters to work with, no real energy or interest builds for them, and neither do character relationships. What we were supposed to gain from the scene involving Jonah Hill (who is on-screen for maybe a minute and a half) and Scarlet Johansson where Johansson's DeAnna asks Hill's Joseph if pressing down on the machine that stamps the papers hurts his forearm? Was this sort of flirtation so necessary that it needed to be included, or were the Coen's too busy giggling under their breath to notice?""Hail, Caesar!"" is overpopulated with scenes that don't work to further what little plot is here, and with such a high-stakes story about a lead actor being kidnapped by a band of communists, Clooney's Braid Whitlock doesn't seem too phased, Brolin's Mannix, who has never been a particularly strong actor to show real emotion or gusto in his personals, doesn't seem too concerned, so what is there left for us to care about?Some comparison has been made between both ""Hail, Caesar!"" and Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" and while the two have a similar approach to dry wit and deadpan humor, as well as similar actors like Fiennes and Swinton, Anderson's picture was a perfect example of copious energy and exhilarating, rapid-fire comic exchanges. ""Hail, Caesar!"" is the exact opposite; a frequently dull and almost entirely uninteresting film, predicated upon the strength of a few great scenes and some decent, albeit far, far too short, performances in a thoroughly muddled picture.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Day in the Life,"Lots of disappointing comments about how this movie does not live up to the Coen Brothers ""standard"" (I guess that means laugh-out-loud), is full of stars who get fleeting screen time, has no plot to speak of, no great villain or other dramatic concoction to keep up glued to our seats, etc., etc.What it is is a funny ""day in the life"" story of the guy (Eddie Mannix--superbly played by Josh Brolin) who has to keep some kind of lid on the craziness that is the studio system of the late 40's/early 50's. Looked at from that character perspective, this is an examination of one man's struggle not only with the insanity of his star stable (Clooney/Johansson/Ehrenreich), but with the question the movie actually revolves around--will Eddie decide to stay, or will he go to Lockheed, who have offered him a job that will make him more money and get him home on time for dinner. The confessional scenes that bookend this movie allow us a fuller glimpse into why Eddie does what he does.Brolin allows us to feel the conflict Eddie is experiencing, amidst the ever rising chaos around him (from a kidnapping, to a possible paternity suit, to having a cowboy actor take over the part in a drawing room comedy), to discover he actually likes what he does, and actually finds a sense of personal worth in handling the ever-escalating mess that is constantly pressing on him from all sides.Brolin's performance is so tight, so controlled and so real, that he is able to carry that storyline with great vigor and compassion. The rest of the lunacy, from the underwater Ester Williams scenes, to the Gene Kelly dance spoof, to the cowboy (Ehrenreich absolutely adorable and on point) and Carmen Miranda get together, simply provides the backdrop. You don't need to know any of the Hollywood history to appreciate this film, other than to know that a good portion of movies, at that time, were not pot-boiling epics, or racy, foul-mouthed satires, but rather quiet movies about individual struggle. Brolin keeps that focus throughout this film, making the ending, just like the movies of the past, a very happy one.A very pleasant, clever, and funny effort from the Brothers. Yes, a send-off, Valentine, if you will. I can see where people who have enshrined Lebowski as the litmus test for all Coen comedy movies moving forward would be disappointed. Fact is, the Brothers can play more than one note.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth watching?,"This is my first review here, and I hope to do more. I have noticed a niche that can use more contributions, namely, reviews written by people who love movies, but who are not trying to prove how terribly clever and smart they are. Many years ago one of the major movie critics wrote for a metropolitan newspaper, and he had a funny list of categories for movies, the best one being 'worth watching if you're home sick.' His reviews helped me think about why some deeply flawed movies are worth watching, while some highly praised films are simply, for most of us, pretentious junk. 'Hail, Caesar!' is one of the former. First and foremost, any movie that makes you laugh, laugh a lot, is certainly worth your time. The main criticism I have is that it doesn't hang together well. The skits are related, but there is not enough of a strong narrative thread here to pull you through to the end, to give you that sense of 'wow' that a really good movie gives you. The casting is intriguing, with flashes of brilliance. George Clooney is a smart choice; he gave me much to think about regarding the interaction of skill and charisma in a performance. I was also wondering how Josh Brolin made his character likable. And Scarlett Johansson's first appearance is very amusing, as well as one of the movie's many reminders of the sharp contrast between movie fantasies, and the quotidian of our lives that drives us to seek out that very fantasy.So, to steal from the above-mentioned reviewer, 'worth watching at home.'",7.0,Anonymous,Music
All Style and No Substance,"From the previews of this film, I had a high level of anticipation for the Coen Brothers' latest venture, expecting it to be an hilarious and satiric romp through the halls of 50's Hollywood. The Coens are excellent technicians so the riffs on MGM, 50's Hollywood Stars, and the general machinations of the studio system were very well done. But I'm afraid the film's achievements were pretty much relegated to this dimension and overall the film remained in the category which I term ""All Style and No Substance,"" clever but ultimately delivering a thin story. Along the way there are some wonderful bits, especially Channing Tatum singing and tap dancing in a suggestively gay sailor dance routine, Tilda Swinton playing twin columnists, Alden Ehrenreich doing some hilarious cowboy stunts on a horse and with a lasso, and Ralph Fiennes directing in a sort of prissy manner. However, none of the plot lines ever yielded anything substantive. I found it difficult to figure out just what the Coen Brothers were attempting with this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Entertaining and Enjoyable,"Sure, a lot of people hate this movie, and I get it, it isn't for everyone. Your enjoyment of the film solely depends on your sense of humor, expectations, and background knowledge of Hollywood films of this era.I had read into this film a bit before I saw it, and therefore my expectations were pretty much surpassed. I already knew that there wasn't going to be much plot and that a lot of the big name actors and actresses in the film were in it very little. But, no matter how negative some of the criticism I heard, I still eagerly wanted to see it. And I did see it, and I loved it!One of the main reasons why I enjoyed it so much was because of my previous information of classic filmmaking. I knew plenty about classic epic, musical, and western cinema, and there's plenty of nods to various filmmaking techniques of that era that I noticed. A lot of this film kind of feels like it was made back in the 50s, so I have to give credit to the Coen brothers for that.My biggest complaint was how little screen time various actors got. Many of the people who were top billed are barely in the film at all. I mean, Jonah Hill is literally on the POSTER and yet he was in the film for hardly even a minute! Couldn't his part have been a bit longer? Or maybe he simply shouldn't have been on the movie's poster! Other actors/actresses were in it disappointingly little to, such as Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, etc. However short their appearances may be, all of the performances are extraordinarily well done, which is why I wanted to see more of these actors in the first place!Other flaws I found were rather minor. Certain gags went on a little too long, although pretty much all of the gags worked very well for a remainder of their existence. There also isn't much of a plot for a lot of the film. While there is SOMETHING resembling a plot, there was very little of it. Of course, normally in a film (unless it is experimental or a documentary), I like a bit of plot and conflict, and in ""Hail, Caesar!"" there wasn't as much of it as the trailer may want you to believe. But, the film didn't really need much of a plot to keep me hooked and entertained.There certainly were more positives than negatives from my point of view. When a gag in the film worked, it worked extremely well. And the entire film is shot beautifully as well!There's plenty of entertainment value to be had. There's a bit of comedy, mystery, music, and even some elements of drama. I enjoyed ""Hail, Caesar!"" quite a bit, and look forward to seeing it once again in the near future! While there are a few problems, all the positives make up for them really well! This is a great satire that I'd recommend to people who really appreciate older films, have a somewhat dark sense of humor, and don't mind a film with very little plot",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another Bomb for the Coen Bros.,"I'm glad this one was on HBO because if I paid for it at a theater I'd be really unhappy (and, once again, disappointed at a Coen Bros. film). I'm not saying that a film cannot have a variety of tones and multi-layered themes. But at the end of the day, it must know what it wants to be overall: a comedy, a message movie, a thriller, a historical film, etc.Hail, Caesar is crammed full of A-list actors stuck in a failed concept of a movie. I can't say that the Coen Brothers are afraid to go for it, whatever ""it"" is. Sometimes their off-beat approach strikes gold as in Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo or O' Brother Where Art Thou. Then again, they have more than their fair share of black comedy (?) bombs such as Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading and The Lady Killers. Well, sorry to say, add this Hail, Caesar to the bomb list and hope their next project is another gem like No Country for Good Men or True Grit.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
People were quietly leaving the theatre,"Listen closely. We don't have much time because the film snobs will start banging the NOT USEFUL button and this review will disappear into the IMDb ether.This film almost makes you wonder if the Coen Bros are caught in some sort of Star Trek time paradox and are doing their films backwards. If they had started with this film 32 years ago, the critics would say there were some clever set-pieces and the cinematography was superb but the concept should never have been greenlighted and the script was wretched. From such humble beginnings, in 2016, the Coen Bros would then be able to deliver BLOOD SIMPLE and probably win multiple Oscars for their ""growth"" as film makers.But in real time, 32 years after Blood Simple, this film is so bad that people were voting with their feet and leaving the theatre at the 1:00 mark (approximately). The story is awful, the dialog is awful, and the voice-over is bad enough to be used as a ""persuasion device"" at Gitmo.George Clooney should get a new agent because there is not enough money on the planet to compensate him for having to wear a costume that makes him look fat and bloated and 20 years older than he actually is. Only Channing Tatum rescues his own dignity in a tribute to Gene Kelly that actually is entertaining and engaging.The is an awful film. I have never lied to you before and I am not going to start now.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Addendum 2-26: Frankly when I penned the above review right after leaving the theatre, I was not expecting to get involved in a controversy about how flexible the Coen Brothers were ""cross-genres,"" or how clever and eclectic their fans need to be to appreciate the wonderfulness of this specific work. But since the controversy exists, I will add that generally the Coens have produced some of best films I have seen in my lifetime. Inside Llewyn Davis, for example, held my attention like glue, it was a polished gem. Most of their films are polished gems. Unfortunately this is not one of them. If you Google, you will find that, in spite of the sycophantic mainstream critics, this film has generated the Coens' worst box-office numbers ever. And that was the point I was trying to make. Viewers instinctively know the difference between a hit and miss. It's their job -- enjoying films is why they left home, endured the traffic, and found a parking spot in the first place. The actors here try hard, I agree, but the story and the script simply do not connect or resonate or form any empathic bond. The horror is that the ""brothers"" really should have known better.

that old-time Hollywood religion,"The Coen brothers return to the olden days of Hollywood with a witty and eye-pleasing comedy that recycles several legends familiar to antique movie buffs but mixes them up just enough to hold the interest.""Hail, Caesar!"" is set in 1951 at the height of the Red scare and Cold War, and follows a tough but sympathetic hands-on studio producer (Josh Brolin) whose responsibilities include, in addition to budget, casting and moral code enforcement, defusing potential scandals that could damage Capitol's reputation and box office. He also happens to be a by-the-book Catholic who regularly goes to a priest to confess minor sins like cigarette smoking.There is not a single boring or bad performance by any of the huge cluster of actors. Clooney as the doofus leading man whose kidnapping drives much of the plot, gives an inspired performance. Alden Ehrenreich is impressive on all levels as the wholesome and good- natured singing cowboy. Allison Pill is the embodiment of classic pre-feminist womanhood as the pretty, positive, loyal, uncomplaining, blonde cupcake of a wife who maintains the home front for the rugged breadwinner Brolin.Many characters loosely suggest real figures of the studio era: George Clooney = Clark Gable; Tilda Swinton as twin-sister gossip columnists = not only Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons (who were definitely not sisters) but also carrying a whiff of rival siblings Olivia deHavilland and Joan Fontaine, born of British parents in the Far East, who famously hated each other throughout their parallel star careers; Scarlett Johansson = Loretta Young who covered up her out-of-wedlock birth by disappearing for a few months and resurfacing with an ""adopted"" daughter; Ralph Fiennes = a British variation on director George Cukor who was rumored to have had sex with pre-stardom Clark Gable; Alden Ehrenreich = Roy Rogers (whom he actually resembles); Channing Tatum = a dash of Gene Kelly and a dab of Dick Powell. And others.This is not the first Coen film to incorporate musical performance and begs the question, why doesn't this team make an all-out film musical? The Channing Tatum song-and-dance number, vaguely reminiscent of Busby Berkeley's ""Shanghai Li'l"" from ""Footlight Parade"" and Ehrenreich's pitch perfect warbling in a Western musical scene are high points.Memorable and brilliantly written scenes include a theological roundtable of religious leaders assembled by Brolin to vet the production of the titular film-within-the-film, a ""Ben-Hur""-ish epic about a Roman centurion's encounter with Jesus Christ (the scenes from which are stylistically dead-on perfect take-offs on the post-WW2 widescreen ancient epics); and a parallel gathering of Hollywood Communist Party screenwriters strategizing philosophically about ways to use dialectical materialism as a guide to insert Party propaganda into film scripts and hasten a new world (goof: a Communist refers to making a cash ""contribution to the Comintern"" which had been long dismantled by the time this film takes place); a fey director's frustrated attempts to coach the miscast cowboy actor's delivery of high-toned cocktail party dialogue.Finally we are reminded that movie-going in studio-era Hollywood was a kind of organized religious experience; no matter what traditional religious practices moviegoers or producers may have observed, the paganism of the screen experience was an equal influence on their lives.",,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly a very funny and enjoyable film,"Watched this film with no expectations, the trailers made this film look like it was designed for the awards, it looked like art film trying to be funny. So as most movie goers i stayed away from it in the cinema and only decided to watch when it came on Blu ray and DVD.The film was extremely well directed and written, the Coen brother's did a great job on making a very solid film which was very entertaining, to bad they were not responsible for making a good trailer.Anyways, lets get into the review. The film is about a Hollywood fixer in the 1950's whose job is to make sure the stars of the studio maintain face and an image with the media. He is responsible for getting them out of sticky situations and is also responsible for them being well behaved and rocking up on set. Brolin does a fantastic job! I really liked him in the film, he played his character brilliantly, making the audience believe that this film was really set in that era. He has that old look about him, just my opinion, as did Alden Ehrenreich, these two castings were great. For me the odd one out was Tatum, who just doesn't feel/ look like a 1950's actor type. Story of the film was good, and very light heartened for what it was trying to convey to the audience. As bunch of guys steal the studio's most valued actor and demanded a ransom for him, Eddie (Brolin) has to uncover what is going and bring back the super star before the media gets a hold of the situation and jeopardize the whole studio. Meanwhile the studio is still running and all of the actors, directors demands still need to be met.Acting, for most part like i wrote above acting was really good. Apart from Tatum, he felt out of place. i feel instead of Tatum, Armie Hammer would have been a much better fit. If you see the film and have seen man from U.N.C.l.E you'll know why i'm referring to him. Apart from Brolin's performance, i think Alden did an amazing job, as did Christopher Lambert in his small role.Overall this was a very enjoyable film. with more then few laughs to keep you entertained through out the course of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Maybe not Hail, Caesar, but certainly praise, Caesar.","Hail, Caesar! brings all of the elements of a good Coen brothers satire. It is incredibly casted, truly funny and difficult to fully understand at times. Even though the classic movie references went over my head most of the time, the clear attention to detail and an obvious massive amount of research shines through to make Hail Caesar if nothing else a very watchable 2 hours.The Coens have always been great at casting and this may be their best effort. Some characters are underutilized but the leads are damn near perfect. Clooney may be the best vessel for the Coens to put their brand of physical comedy on screen and He always seems to be on the same page with them. Josh Brolin is never a guy who I have been concerned with putting a great performance on screen and he, like Clooney seems to have found this nice median with the Coens making a character here that will rank among Brolin's best. The rest of the cast as previously stated is filled with strong performances by major leading actors. Alden Ehrenreich should not go unmentioned as Hobie Doyle, a movie cowboy who is thrust into the world of dramatic acting. This may have been the find of the movie for the Coens, and I am excited to see wheat he can do.I have always preferred the Coen brothers satires more than their more serious movies and that is because of the strength of the writing. The dark and subtle humor that they are able to achieve is usually top class, but this movie has a little more Ladykillers than Fargo. Hail, Caesar! is without a doubt an attempt at a more mainstream comedy. This is not to say the movie is not funny, it is a funny movie, but the comedy comes from a more traditional sense, which only disappoints because of the strength of their more subtle comedy. There are more classic cinema references in this movie than I can count, and most of those went over my head, but I think that is the Coens intention. They wanted the movie to be satisfying for movie buffs and the casual viewer and the like.When first watching the movie I was disappointing in the look of the film. I figured with the Coens making a movie about classic cinema that the look of the movie would be right out of the golden years of cinema and when the movie started I was not given what I expected. As the movie progresses and we stop in on all of these different movie sets I was proved wrong. They wanted a visual separation between when the viewer is watching the movie presented on screen, and the movies inside the movie on screen. The classic dramas look as if someone time traveled to the 1930s and grabbed an actress in full costume and makeup and brought them back to the Hail, Caesar! set. A very impressive looking movie, especially for fans of cinema.I scored the movie lower than most Coen brothers films, not because it was not a good movie, or there was something in it that turned me off, but just because the catalog of Coen brothers movies is so strong. Hail, Caesar is no Fargo or Lebowski or O' Brother Where Art Thou, but then again is was never supposed to be like any of those movies. They are at the point in their careers where they don't need to make their innovative and groundbreaking movies to prove themselves anymore. It seems like they are just doing movie about things that interest them more than what they think will surprise everyone. If you are a Coens fan check it out. If you like semi-off brand comedies give it a shot, just know what to expect going in.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Its okay,"1. I have never loved the Coen brothers, and it amuses me that most people's problems with this film are the problems I've had with Fargo, The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men - character arcs wrap up off screen with no time to enjoy that they are there, and the focus of the film seems to be on one uninteresting aspect instead of a much greater potential.2. Interestingly, I found this less with Hail, Caesar. The film's final ten minutes did a lot to improve my opinion of this film, linking the seemingly independent stories of Ralph Fiennes, George Clooney, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum together to give a nice feeling that we saw a window of Eddie Mannix's life and that another window might show dozens of other things going on. I also enjoyed the emotional conclusion for Eddie regarding his future - it felt natural and satisfying after a movie in which we've seen him doing his job.3. The film's trailer was misleading as hell. Enjoy the trailer as a two and a half minute short film, not as a teaser for the film because it will be a massive let down. As I've said, most characters have nothing to do with one another and you barely get to register and enjoy the presence of Ralph Fiennes before he's gone. All of his best moments are in the trailer. Every single one.4. The film is also too long - this should've wrapped around the 90 minute mark. Most scenes involving Baird Whitlock and the communists who kidnap him are overly dialogue-heavy without being smart or witty. Each of those sequences is enough to put you in a slump of boredom. Ironically, the gag with Frances McDormand playing a buffoon editor wastes about three minutes of screen time. The film being edited together by that fictional character would explain a lot.5. Of the acting performances, I really enjoyed Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix. It is not a flashy performance or even a memorable one, but he does a great job and I'm glad to see him headlining the cast. George Clooney is probably the most memorable as the loveably dopey leading man who is besotted by rumours from his early career and convinced of the virtues of Communism. Hearing him proudly and innocently explain his new worldview to an irritated Mannix is akin to watching Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld, and Mannix's short and direct response is probably the funniest part of the movie thanks to Clooney's expression.6. Alden Ehrenreich is likely the star made by this film, as the polite Western star who cannot act in serious roles to save himself. He has great chemistry with everyone and nails each moment of the script as required. Scarlett Johannson is memorable in a small role, and its great to see Wayne Knight, Clancy Brown and Allison Pill getting work.7. Roger Deakins' cinematography is a shining light in the film, especially Scarlett Johannson's glorious mermaid sequence.8. The best directed segment of the film was the ""No Dames"" song and dance routine led by Channing Tatum. The choreography is flawless, the lyrics spot on and the cinematography fantastic.9. It is a credit to Joel and Ethan Coen's script that things do flow together. There are a few Chekhov's guns throughout, characters who distract you with their presence only to reveal themselves as being more important at the end. There's also some witty banter - such as between Mannix and four church leaders regarding the depiction of Christ - although let's not hail it as perfect, because then we have to sit through those Communist scenes again.10. I wasn't insulted by Hail, Caesar but after watching the trailer so many times I'd be lying if I said I was wholly satisfied.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Coen, Coen, Con",We should have been fore-warned when the cinema was only a third full as the curtains rolled back. Obviously the absentees had read the IMDb reviews and had decided to do something more interesting such as cleaning the oven or worming the dogs. We forked out £19 to see this pile of nonsense - primarily persuaded by the trailer which contained the only bits of humour in what turned out to be a very long 1.75 hours - and it makes me as mad as hell that decent actors such as Ranulph Fiennes and Tilda Swinton should add their effort and names to such a pile of cr@p. Between them they probably put in less than 24 hours work and got paid xxx thousands. Don't have your pockets picked by these frauds. You've seen the other reviews. You know what to do. Stay at home. Worm those dogs. Put your rubber gloves on clean the oven. You know it makes sense.,1.0,Anonymous,Music

You'll recognize the stars,"The Coen Brothers who gave us one of my favorite 90s films Fargo to a crack at Hollywood of the studio era in Hail Caesar. The film had potential for greatness, but it fails in too many places.The real life character of Eddie Mannix of the real life studio of MGM is given his own studio to run, the mythical Capital Pictures. Mannix had a deserved reputation as a tough guy and a formal Catholic in the Jewish world of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg. He was a tough guy who knew more celebrity secrets than J. Edgar Hoover. He buried many a scandal at MGM and now he heads his own studio.You'll recognize the satire on a lot of familiar Hollywood faces from the 30s and 40s. George Clooney as Charlton Heston kidnapped by Communist writers and held for revolutionary ransom was way over the top and sad to say doesn't do either Heston or the blacklist any justice.Frances McDormand's character of Mannix who is played by Josh Brolin is not easily recognizable. But Ida Koverman who was Louis B. Mayer's faithful scribe also kept secrets well and kept Mayer's life in order.My two favorites were Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists who had the same scent for scandal as Hedda and Louella did. The second was Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry type singing cowboy. The scene where Brolin puts him into a sophisticated comedy where director Ralph Fiennes is trying to teach him some acting technique is my favorite in the film. Imagine trying to remake Gene Autry into Cary Grant.You'll recognize a lot of the movie immortals. Some got more justice than others. Channing Tatum is in sailor musical where he's doing a number like Gene Kelly. I'll bet Tatum worked as hard as Kelly to get it right.Some old timers like me and devoted watchers of TCM will enjoy Hail Caesar. But it could have been a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
What a load of disappointment.,"EXTREMELY awful, It was unfunny , boring and completely lacked character. None of the characters were memorable like in other Coen films. The plot was awful and it is very lacklustre , the Coen brothers should be ashamed of themselves. It was just like on big comic relief special with lots of pointless celebrity cameos popping up everywhere. I wasted my money seeing this and SIX people walked out of the theatre. SIX ! the worst film of 2016 so far. I felt that it is the Coen bros weakest film. There is one good thing. Channing Tatum's musical number, is very catchy and well performed but other than that its just a mixture of unfunny moments being held together with a piece of rotten string.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Is Jesus a mermaid?,"A small film that makes fun of Hollywood and the modern world, though it speaks of the old times. Some scenes are funny though altogether this humor is slightly warped.The western cowboy actor is funny and the scene of ""Lazy Ol' Moon"" is hilarious. And the song is so sad and nostalgic. He sounds like my Swedish friend City Cowboy singing Peter Pan (https://myspace.com/city- cowboy/music/songs) : nostalgia of the good old days when we were young, children, toddlers.The kidnapping or abduction of the Roman legionnaire (Clooney) by some communists and his instant Stockholm syndrome is funny and the treatment of this PTSS by his boss at the studio is even more than funny since he is treated like a child with four slaps across the face. Which does not make him lose his Latin, but definitely makes him lose his faith.The deeply superficial discussion of Jesus by four people, a rabbi, a Catholic priest, an Orthodox patriarch and what is going to be assumed to be a simple Protestant Joe Blow is absurd but so cut off from reality and from the real question about Jesus that we feel we have been dumped in some loony-bin. I just wonder why the children of Ismail, Abraham's first son, in other words the Arabs, in other words the Muslims have not been included. Or is that not kosher enough for the Coen Brothers?The sudden conversion of the Roman Legionnaire to Christianity, though the actor has just been boxed over the ears by his boss and told to please do the only thing he is paid for, be a star, would have been convincing, nearly convincing, at best hypocritical, if he had not lost his faith. You see god exists and he is looking after us and the dumb things we may be doing or saying.The Soviet submarine in Malibu is so unreal and all that happens then is so absurd that we wonder if the Coen brothers are laughing at the Russians, hence Putin, or the West, hence NATO and the USA. One thing is sure the red danger is quite a farce and the only danger we are running into is just forgotten. It is true Jesus dies at the 9th hour and he is buried at the 11th hour. Are the Coen brothers making fun of our fear in aftermath of 9/11 though we use 911 at any moment in the daytime and at night for any little trivial family affair or marital disagreement.The Russian songs used in the film though are of course the Red Army's rendition of them, and I loved Kalinka that I taught in Russian to my French students and to my colleague's Spanish students in Dunn, North Carolina, in 1970. The Americans have always loved those popular and traditional Russian songs and the Red Army here is probably the only real, realistic and true note (for music it is the good word) in the film.

Hail No!,"HAIL, CAESAR! is one of the worst motion pictures that I have seen in a long, long time.There. That should get me on the poster.A rare misfire by the usually reliable Coen Brothers, HAIL, CAESAR! had all the earmarks of a good film - veteran script writers and directors, a stellar cast and a good technical team. So why didn't this work?Let's start with the marketing. By the previews and the television ads, this looked like a whimsical farce of a movie by the Coen Brothers. Call it ""Coen Brothers-lite"", in the same vein of BURN AFTER READING and O BROTHER, WHERE ARE THOU? It starred GEORGE CLOONEY as a major motion picture star of the '50s who is kidnapped by ""THE FUTURE"". It takes legendary Hollywood ""fixit man"", Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to pull a band of Hollywood types together to find and rescue him.But, that is not what the movie is about.It does have a whimsical tone, I'll give them that, but that's about all that is the same from the previews. The movie isn't about Clooney's character, it's about a day in the life of Mannix and the many, many things he needs to fix. Clooney's kidnapping is just one of many stories/crisisis that Mannix needs to fix and, no, he doesn't incorporate the other stars to help out. They had their own problems.Ralph Fiennes is a refined director working with a less than refined actor (Alden Ehrenreich). Scarlett Johansson is an Esther Williams- type who is in ""the family way"" and Channing Tatum is...well, I won't spoil it.I waited all movie for these disparate story lines to merge together, but they never did. They were just different short stories stitched together to form a movie.That would be fine, because this movie stars a boatload of Hollywood celebrities, right? Well, not really...Ralph Fiennes is in 2 scenesScarlett Johansson is in 3.Channing Tatum is in 3.Frances McDormand is in only 1 scene, but steals the movie.Poor ol' Jonah Hill is just in 1 scene, and really, he is in only about 1/2 a scene.Tilda Swinton has the biggest part of these ""stars"", she plays twins who are rival gossip columnists that are each in 2 scenes, so she has 4!Clooney, does have the largest of the small parts, but it still is just too little.The other issue I have is that NONE of these characters (including, and maybe, ESPECIALLY, Mannix) have any kind of emotional arc. All characters are basically the same at the end that they were at the beginning. There really were no ""stakes"" for anyone, which makes for a dull movie.To give the Coen's credit, the move is ""made"" well. Beautiful shots, the costumes and sets give off the proper vibe, so it's not a sloppy or shoddily made movie, it's just not a good movie. They only have 2 people to blame, the writers, which, of course, is themselves.If you want to see a good picture about 1950's era Hollywood, check out TRUMBO.HAIL, CAESAR!?

Boring and Dull,"I was hoping this would be another great Coen Brothers movie. Boy, was I disappointed. The cast is great, but the writing is abysmal. Johan Hill's part is so small he probably shot it in 30 minutes.It was supposed to be a parody of 1940's and '50's Hollywood, but it couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to be a serious movie or a comedy. Mostly, it was just excruciating.There were very few laughs and many plot points seemed incomplete.Thank goodness I waited for this to come out on DVD and didn't waste my money seeing it in a theater.I'm thinking waiting for any future Coen Brothers movies to come out on DVD might not be the worst idea.",,Anonymous,Music
1950s Time Machine,"Forget planning that touristy Hollywood studio tour - watch this instead. This gives you a real immersive experience - you're there in the fifties, you're not just in Hollywood, you're there making movies!The plot itself is a bit thin and the humour isn't as strong as you might expect but that's not too important. What Mr and Mr Cohen give you is an insight into the dream fact filled with wonderfully eccentric but utterly believable and likeable characters. Characters you want to get to know and indeed that's exactly what you get. It's a warm and very satisfying way to spend a couple of hours.Fortunately the Eddie Mannix in this picture is not really based on the real-life Eddie Mannix. If he were, this would not be a fun film because in real life, he was a nasty piece of work. MGM's real fixer began his career by beating up his girlfriend, gorgeous silent movie star Mary Nolan so much so her permanently disfigured which ended her acting career and ultimately her life. He ended his career by being involved with the murder of the 1950s Superman. No, fortunately this is a nice Eddie.One down side of this is that after watching it you'll never be able to watch any of those awful cheesy 1950 'epics' (usually with Victor Mature) like THE ROBE and take them seriously - no great loss.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"I'd honestly give a 6.5. But, whatever.","Coen Brothers sprinkle stars like herbs on an Italian dish. And ofcourse, Josh Brolin is the meat of the film. He does shine in his role. He's a great antagonist as Eddie Mannix. George Clooney does his part well, but I only wished his role had more spice to it. Hobie is a delight and a charm as he's meant to be. There are characteristic Coen Brothers' twists, but they don't hit that well compared to their other films. Also, the undercurrent themes are muddled with too much from World war to Communism and executives running studios. It stands a tad tall about just another vintage Hollywood movie, but doesn't stand very much apart either.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the best from the Coen Brothers! 5/10,"Review: I'm usually a fan of these type of quirky movies but this film was all over the place! There was so much stories going on at once, so it was pretty hard to follow and I wasn't that impressed with the different characters that kept on getting introduced throughout the movie. George Clooney's weird face expressions made me laugh in a few of the scenes and Tilda Swinton, who played the twins Thora Thacker/Thessaly Thacker, also was quite funny but I didn't really see the point of some of the characters. Jonah Hill (Joe Silverman) and Ralph Fiennes (Laurence Laurentz) are only in a couple of scenes, and the main character, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) just seems to be running around, trying to keep everyone happy. The movie is based in a movie studio during the 1950's, and it follows Eddie Mannix, who is trying to find a big shot actor, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), who has been kidnapped by a bunch of writers. While he is on the hunt for Whitlock, who is being held for a ransom of $100,000, Mannix has to make sure that the big budget movies that are being filmed, are under control, and he has to handle the press who are constantly on his back for information. The period was portrayed quite well throughout the movie, and Josh Brolin played the lead quite well but it was hard to find a point to the whole project. There wasn't much of an ending to the various stories and no one seemed that bothered about Baird Whitlocks random disappearance. With all of that aside, it's a still a watchable movie, because you don't know what directed the plot is going to take from one scene to the next but I still expected something special, once I saw the cast. Its not the type of film that will go down as a classic but I have to commend it for it's originality and witty script. Watchable!Round-Up: After watching many of the Coen Brothers work, I was really looking forward to this movie but it didn't live up to its expectations. There first movie came out in 1984, called Blood Simple, which was followed by Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and the Hudsucker Proxy. They then hit the big time with Fargo, in 1996 and then came the brilliant, The Big Lebowski, which I thoroughly enjoyed. After that came O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Man Who Wasn't There, Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, Paris, je t'aime, No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading, A Serious Man, True Grit and Inside Llewyn Davis, which all made a profit at the box office and established there name in Hollywood. All of the A-list stars want to work with them, mainly because of there unique style and approach to film making. I wouldn't say that this film is there best work but it won't damaged there reputation as great film makers.Budget: $22million Worldwide Gross: $63millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery/comedies, starring Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Ralph Riennes, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Veronica Osorio, Alison Pill, Chrisopher Lambert and Clancy Brown. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Second tier Coens still equals a great movie,"Maybe not one of the Coens' masterpieces, but easily in their second tier, which means it's great. It depicts a day in the life of a Hollywood studios in the 1950s, with Josh Brolin as the studio head whose job it is to keep things running smoothly. The main plot revolves around the kidnapping of the star of the studio's gigantic Biblical epic, Hail, Caesar!, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Several other movie stars play parts on the sidelines, including Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-type swimming musical star, Channing Tatum as another musical star, and Alden Ehrenreich as a Western star who has been transferred to a more sophisticated drama. Ehrenreich, despite being the least familiar actor among the cast, steals the show. There are tons of familiar faces in the film (Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Wayne Knight, Fisher Stevens, David Krumholtz, Frances MacDormand, Tilda Swinton - playing twins!) and many of them don't get more than a minute of screen time (Hill, for example - you've seen his entire performance in the trailer, and he made it onto the poster), but everyone's highly amusing. The plot might not amount to much, but it's all a lot of fun, and, as you would expect, wonderfully shot and directed.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as I hoped but amusing,"You see trailers for Hail, Caesar! and you expect lots of 1950s high jinx on set during the last decade of the glory days of the Studio System. Lots of homages and nods to real Hollywood actors. Clooney plays the main actor cast in the film within film of the Crucifixion (good for Easter release) and the centurion at the base of the cross who says ""surely this man in the Son of God"" etc. Brolin plays the Studio Fixer who dances around Press, covers up scandal and sees that everything runs smoothly. Clooney gets kidnapped. Channing does some entertaining Gene-Kelly-esque ""there are no dames"" songs whilst looking like he has painted on cheekbones, cameos all over the place. Cohen Brothers' films are generally brilliant, and this is funny, but it's not as good as was expected. The laughs get tired, the film is a bit too long and when you emerge from the cinema you think, ""what was that really about?"" The film is a weaving of small plots which are good viewing but are shallow. I expected more than the communist subplot and the confessional bookends of story underlining generally good guy in a challenging world. For all the stars, and kudos, it's disappointing and if it wasn't for the stellar cast, or the writer's status, I don't think this would have made it to the cinema... Funny, and a good date night film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun look at Hollywood's 'Golden Age',"This film gives us a look at one day in the lives of those working for a Hollywood studio in the 1950s. Mostly it focuses on fixer Eddie Mannix who links various stories involving various film stars. Most prominent amongst these are the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock, the lead in a new Biblical epic, by communists; western star Hobie Doyle being asked to appear in a classy drama which demands skills he doesn't have and actress DeeAnna Moran who is pregnant but not married. During the course of the film we also see scenes from the films the characters are making; these include a song and dance routine, a spectacular display of synchronised swimming and a comical western scene.This film from the Cohen Brothers is part homage, part tongue-in-cheek jab at Hollywood's golden age when studios churned out westerns, made spectacular musicals and the biggest films were epics set in biblical times. The studios micromanage their stars to ensure their public images are squeaky clean and even serious failings are covered up. This is all done in a way that provides plenty of laughs; I loved Alden Ehrenreich's cowboy as he struggles in a new role as a far more sophisticated character and George Clooney's leading man, in full Roman uniform, as he is kidnapped by communists. There are some fun little twists as we learn more about the characters. The cast are clearly having fun; thankfully in a way that is fun for the audience too. The story is fairly light but that doesn't matter as it is more about the fun moments than a deep plot. Overall fans of the Cohens' lighter fare should enjoy this.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing Adventure,"Hail, Caesar! (2016) - [6/10]The Coen Brothers typically make really good films - typically. There are moments in this film that are great, but those are just moments. The rest of the film is mediocre. I was quite disappointed with this film, and I think most people were. It felt really incomplete and all over the place. There really wasn't a main character, and most of the characters felt emotionally detached from the viewer. I couldn't connect with any of the cast (aside from one, maybe two characters) and when I began to do so, that character would disappear. With more than a couple absurd jokes, strange ""out-of-the-blue"" twists, and a star-studded cast, Hail, Caesar! (2016) tries to be so much, but fails to achieve anything it set out to accomplish (get it ""set"" because a large majority of the film takes place on various different film sets). There are three things that are good about this film. The production design, the cinematography, and the dialogue. The rest of the components that create a feature film feel incredibly lackluster. The writing (aside from the dialogue) isn't good, the acting is undistinguished, the editing didn't work, and the directing is disappointing. From a Coen Brothers' film, I would have expected better. I always wondered why no one ever talked about this film, and now I know why: it is forgettable. I watched Hail, Caesar! (2016) yesterday (from when I post this review), and I've already forgotten a lot about it; aside from the three things that are actually quite well done. I even took notes while watching it. It's forgettable. When a film is forgettable, that is not a good sign (it's more that you want to forget about it after viewing the film). Production design. This film excels in creating beautiful sets, settings, and mood. Each of the different stages in the fictional production company's lot (Capitol Pictures) perfectly captures the essence of 50s cinema. Production designer Jess Gonchor did an excellent job in capturing that era in every single set. I got a lot - a lot - of Wes Anderson vibes. Simply because of how vibrant, original, and complex each setting was. The different settings that Gonchor brought to life, really helped this film establish a realistic world. I haven't really talked about production design in any of my reviews, so I hope I sort of explained it well. The role of a production designer is to create the visual look of the story that is being told, and Gonchor's designs make this film look visually pleasing (coupled with Roger Deakins' camera work). But films aren't just about looking beautiful, they have to be compelling, have depth, and engage their audience. This film stands as an example of the fact that films can look gorgeous, but lack true beauty in their story. The story is so incredibly strange. That is part of the Coen Brothers' style, but what made this film strange is the way it jumps around. In terms of genre, tone, and story. There are scenes that drag, and then other scenes that feel two short (it almost makes you question ""why did we just watch this""). On top of that, there really isn't a main plot. There are a couple of main plots. Thinking about it now, this film would have been much better as a TV show. The Coen Brothers try to squeeze so many different stories into one larger story, and it doesn't work. We jump around constantly, from one story to the next, and get lost in what is actually happening. It also jumps genres as a result of the many different stories. From comedy, to drama, to musical, and then back to comedy. If each of the different stories had been their own episodes in the Hail, Caesar! (2016) TV show, I think it would have turned out differently, but instead we get 5+ different complex stories jammed into an hour and forty six minute film. The stories don't have time to truly develop, as they're also edited to be occurring within each other, and the characters don't have time to truly develop either. When characters aren't able to develop, the actors' performances are affected. I expected more from all of the actors in this film. Each and every one of them has had stellar performances before, and in this it is as if they hadn't. They felt like amateurs. This is definitely a result of the writing. It must have been so difficult as an actor to figure out who your character is, and who they grow into, when there is very little to go off of. The best performance of the film was Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle. He was actually extremely good in his role of Doyle, a country boy turned star who is forced by the studio to change his public image. I thought he was hilarious, having one of the funniest moments in the film, and was able to bring charm to this charmless film. Having actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and George Clooney would make you think that there would be a lot of charm - but there isn't. Their performances are emotionless, dull, and unsatisfying. Josh Brolin also gives a good performance as the man with all the solutions, Eddie Mannix. He also has some of the funniest moments in the film, and brings a greater level of talent than most of the other cast. Although Hail, Caesar! (2016) has a star-studded cast, the performances aren't as masterful as you would hope. Hail, Caesar! (2016) pays great homage to 50s cinema, whilst making fun of cinema itself, and attempts to tackle issues in the film industry (such as writer unappreciation, public image, Communism [yes, you read that correctly], and talent agnst). It fails from pre-production to create a compelling story, altering actors' performances, and narrative feel as a result. The cinematography, production design, and dialogue are the best parts of the film, but looks aren't everything in Hail, Caesar! (2016).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring,"Beautifully made -- that's the only positive thing I can say about this film.There's virtually no story. No drama. Nothing really happens. There's 2-3 laughs. It's a Coen Brothers vanity flick with a whole bunch of A-listers and their mates.The funniest thing about this film is all the up-their-own-backside ""professional"" critics who are praising it and saying explicitly or implicitly that if you don't get, the movie isn't aimed at you. In other words, you're not in the know -- you need to appreciate 1950s Hollywood to get this movie.I'm a big fan of the Coen Brothers -- they have made some amazing films. But I notice that when artists get to the top, they lose their hunger. They start putting out crap. Hopefully this is just a one-off.",,Anonymous,Music
Some interesting scenes strung together,"At the end of watching Hail Caesar, I turned to my girlfriend and said, ""that was not a movie.""And yet, it does have much in common with movies. There is a story, kind of. There are characters. There are some entertaining scenes. And yet...I wasn't actually thinking ""this wasn't a movie"" while I watched it. There was a basic story involving a studio executive handling various emergencies and secondary stories involving a kidnapped actor and a miscast cowboy. There was an excellent cast (although so many actors that few get much screen time), including a wonderful Tilda Swinton as twin gossip columnists. While it started slow, the movie had entertaining moments, including a fun Busby Berkley-style swim number, an amusing attempt to get the cowboy to deliver a single line correctly, and a first-rate tap/swing number.But at the end, it just felt like there was nothing there. The movie is built on the very slight scaffold of the executive's decision on whether to move to a different industry, and because you never care about him (he's a classically generic, faceless character), you don't really care what he decides.Much of the movie is simply scenes from fictional movies, including a Ben Hur variant. I say variant rather than take-off or parody because the attempts seems more to mimic the style of these films than to burlesque them. The result is not quite parody and not quite tribute.If the Coen Brothers wanted to make a bunch of old-Hollywood style scenes, they would have been better served to simply make their version of an old-Hollywood movie (as they did with Hudsucker Proxy) than to make this odd pastiche.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

We left the theater halfway through... it was THAT bad.,"Never in my life have I left a movie halfway through! Right from the start my friend and I knew we were in trouble.

We were so surprised because it got great reviews (I seriously cannot imagine anyone finding a redeeming quality about this movie)... and because the cast is stellar we thought it would be a winner. Wrong!!!By the way, no one in the theater laughed AT ALL. In fact, we started laughing at each other's reaction to the movie since there was nothing else to laugh at.Some of the acting itself (aside from the boring plot and humorless lines) was decent... so I am not faulting most of the actors.

This movie is a) not what it seems and b) brilliant,"The Coens sometimes release movies that are immediately accessible, where everything you see is more or less all that there is to take away from it. True Grit, Fargo, Raising Arizona, Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, etc.Hail, Caesar! isn't one of these immediately rewarding movies. It's one of the other kinds of movies they release where repeated viewings and some contemplation is involved because not all of what's going on is immediately accessible on your first exposure. There are multiple layers of interpretation at work simultaneously, making for a lot of meta- content. More like a puzzle that rings around in your brain long after you've seen it. Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There, A Serious Man, etc.Immediately after my first viewing, I was in the same boat with a lot of the reviews here, where I was convinced this is a Coen dud. Everything seemed to ramble around with no real connecting story to carry it through. My first reaction was: 'this sucks'. My complaint was that none of the on-screen action seemed very well connected at all to anything else. The trailer kind of created an impression of a comedic kidnapping thriller with some Hollywood tributes thrown in for candy, but that isn't the experience you get at all.Instead I was left asking: why is so much time spent on the different movie-in-movie sequences? What does any of it have to do with the main character's story, except tangentially through his work for the studio? It just seemed like kind of a pointless pastiche of pseudo-tribute scenes with maybe some funny lines and Hollywood observations here and there.But, these guys have been making movies forever. They don't just throw sh*t in for the hell of it and cross their fingers. Every scene and character has a function, and it's always related back to a central idea or theme.Think of the Mike Yanagita character in Fargo - the weird scene where Marge goes to visit him in the restaurant and he goes all stalker-creepy on her and makes up a story about his dead wife. I puzzled over that scene long after seeing it the first time. But, of course, that scene and that character has a meaningful, significant function in the movie. Google 'what significance does mike yanagita have in fargo' if you're fuzzy on the details.So, what's the unifying idea in ""Hail, Caesar!""? What is this thing about? My view is that this movie is exploring one central question: ""do our actions in life matter?"". Every story element is coming at that question, either seeking an answer, or trying to provide one: Mannix, the communists, religion, and movie makers.To see this in action, and without including any spoilers, wipe your mind clear of previous judgments and opinions, and watch it again with fresh eyes and these questions in mind:1. What problems is Mannix asked to fix?2. Does he take 'direct action' to fix those problems?3. What contribution does his action make to the solution (if there is one)?4. Would the problem have 'solved itself' without his action?5. Bonus question: why are Thora and Thessaly twins?...if you watch this film and look for evidence of this central question, you will find it in every single scene. Every single character and line is contributing to the exploration of this question and the different answers. Watching the movie through this lens, I had a completely different experience, and found myself loving every minute of it. These riddles and rhymes are everywhere in the movie.Do the Coen's try to answer the central question in the movie? Yes, they do.Their answer is: 'were that it were so simple'Or, said another way: 'it's complicated'",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Unexplicable Waste of Talent, Not Entertaining, Poor Direction","Having watched the Cohen Brothers career in films beginning with BLOOD SIMPLE, a wonderful film noir, my wife and I could not believe HAIL,CESAR was such an uncreative MESS. It is artless, poorly directed and acted and made no sense in any creative way. As the author of 5 books, 3 on film noir (none on Hollywood historical spectacles,)I can tell you that HAIL, CAESAR has hit a non-respectable low on all counts---direction, acting, writing. It is the most artless film ever made and everyone who went to see it deserves a refund. The actors-- Clooney, Fiennes, Johanssan were terrible to watch but how did Josh Brolin get into this chaos of a somewhat expensive chaotic senseless film. The screenwriters and director should send this junk to any festival that offers an award to the WORST FILM FESTIVAL of 2016 and there wont be any competition!

"Hail, Caesar-It has its moments but it could have been much better than it is","Hail, Caesar tells the story of a Hollywood fixer who solves every problem related to the production of movies in a studio.
 Hail Caesar is an obvious love letter to the big old Hollywood movies, from a technical standpoint the movie is great, the production design on the interior of the movie sets is very detailed and elegant with vivid colors as well as the costumes, the 1950´s aesthetic is very well created too. The cast is great except for some actors who didn´t have many screen time and only made a cameo, and there´s also great scenes here, the Alden Ehrenreich scene were he can not say the line, the Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum dance sequences are just an example.However the script its a mess, it falls five different storylines without focusing exactly in one, the editing could also been improved, some scenes felt like they were cut out and just put there, and by the end end of the movie some characters didn´t have a conclusion and the ones who did felt rushed.

"Not much of a plot, but still fun","The Coen Brother's star-studded film, Hail, Caesar! jumps into the backseat with golden-age Hollywood, but fails to measure up to its inspiration. The plot jumps around a lot, and really seems to just be an excuse for the directors to shoot multiple scenes reminiscent of older films (Ben Hur, The Robe, Anchors Away, Ricky Nelson films, etc.). There are many funny moments, but there is little cohesion to them, and it is easy to get lost. With an all-star cast, including Jonah Hill, George Clooney, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson, it would've been nice to see more well- rounded characters. Channing Tatum's character seems to have only been included to prove that Channing Tatum can sing. In fact, most of the characters seem to contribute little to the plot at all. All this being said, the movie is fun. It is light hearted and enjoyable. The plot may have more detours than a cross-country drive, but each detour has a charm all its own.

Another Coen's Hidden Gem,"I love the comedy in this film.

What we do not is what is the obstacles that he faced for being in that position and this film showed us that 'It's complicated'. Would that it were so simple?I love every bit or scene whenever a new character is introduced. There's must some kind of wittiness on every character in this film for example the Editor Room scene when C. C.

my new least favorite Coen Bros movie,"After reflecting on Hail Cesar, I stand by my initial response of ranking this below both A Serious Man and Intolerable Cruelty. The trailer is ridiculously misleading, what you see in the trailer looks like a Coen comedy about the kidnapping of an offbeat Clooney character. What follows is a quasi musical drama about a no nonsense Hollywood executive moving from Grand scene to grand scene (all of which add up to nothing) while the bros. rely on another kidnapping plot line, all to highlight communism in the film industry in the 50's (and the blacklisted writers).Clooney portrays no charisma or off beat Coen charm in his bland and forgettable role. Scarlett Johansson actually takes away from the film, as her atrocious accent makes you want to leave the theater. Tatum struts around as a pretty boy closet case sailor, in the gayest musical scene ever. Tilda Swinton's 2 roles are slightly annoying as is the western actor trying to act dramatically. Ralph Fiennes and Josh Brolin neither add anything pr take anything away, they are just there.The only redeeming parts were a nervous Wayne Knight, and a Hollywood meeting about religion in the current film being made between 4 holy men, in which the rabbi steals the entire movie. It sucks to write this and feel this way, but IMO, the Coen Bros are best when they tell a small story, this is a grand spectacle all over the place, but not in any place you want to go. The worst Coen Bros. Movie to date and only worthy of watching when on a deep deep Coen Bros. kick.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen brothers tried to include too much,"It's a parody of the movie world set in and around Hollywood, California, about 1950. It follows a couple of days in the life of a studio head who fixes myriad issues that arise daily.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the devout Catholic ""fixer"" who is daily buried in issues that need addressing. He goes to confession every day over things like lying to his wife about smoking and is considering a job offer from the Lockheed Corporation that would pay better, provide long-term security, and allow for regular working hours.Eddie has a host of people to deal with, including starlet Gloria Delamour (Natasha Bassett); Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a singing cowboy trying to play in a non-western; Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), a dim-witted star who is seduced by a group of communists led by Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum); and DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an unmarried actress who wants to keep the baby she is carrying.There are many more characters, most of them a parody of an individual or Hollywood ""type"" from the studio system era, including musicals and epic Biblical narratives.For me, the Coen brothers tried to include too much, making the film hard to follow at times.

Hit-n-miss offbeat comedy from the Coen brothers,"Hail, Caesar! takes place in the 50s Hollywood. Josh Brolin plays Eddie Mannix, the head of physical production at Capital Pictures. That's a pretty job title for what amounts to a fixer. Someone the studio heads call when one of their actors is caught speeding, or doing drugs, or having the unfortunate case of preggers. And then, one day, one of their biggest stars goes missing just as they're about to finish their biggest movie yet.The story of this film is nothing to write home about. Or rather, it's not the focus of the film. This is a very loose collection of scenes, all aimed to celebrate the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Coen Brothers clearly just wanted to film showy scenes in the style of the classics. We have a choreographed swimming scene. We have a tap dancing scene. We have cowboys. We have stiff upper lip period drama. We have film reel catching on fire. We have it all.And whenever the film is doing that and introducing all these wacky characters along the way, it's very good. Whenever it's trying to tell its story, it's kind of bland and boring, to be honest. For example, Mannix is getting these job offers from a big company named Lockheed. It's good money and better hours, but it would mean leaving the movie business. And I don't care. I so don't care. Go back to tap dancing!The film's humour is also somewhat questionable. But then, it often is with the Coens. They're a fan of rather absurd humour, where you're supposed to laugh because the situation is just so odd. Sometimes it works, often it doesn't, but at least it's intelligent. I'll give it that.Hail, Caesar! is an amazing movie to check out if you're a fan of the classic era of Hollywood and its style. The Coens obviously are in awe of the era and this is a great love letter to it. But, if you don't care about that all that much, there are better comedies out there.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Mediocre ""Brothers,"" at best","For the Brothers Cohen, this film was disappointing.

The CGI scenes were finely rendered, but they were often wasted on dull characters and an even duller story.If you want to be thoroughly entertained by the history AND antics of '50s Hollywood, read an accurate text on the subject. Hollywood's history is truly stranger, better, and funnier than anything the Cohen Brothers have provided.

Then something else will happen unrelated to the last scene with DIFFERENT people that will remind you of a different classic movie.

"Wacky, Wonderful 'Hail, Caesar!' is the Coen Brothers' Valentine to Classic Hollywood","Around the halfway mark of the Coen Brothers' newest film, Hail, Caesar!, an audience member was heard voicing his thought that, this was the weirdest movie he had ever seen–and this reviewer wouldn't say his evaluation was all that far off.Yet it's exactly this sort of ""weird-ness"" that defines any Coen Brothers' movie, where colorful but mentally clouded characters are typically confronted with cosmically coincidental events, leading to a type of larger, dead-pan comedy, that's dripping in drop-dead seriousness that forces them to question the meaning of life and their place in the universe.The universe at large in Hail, Caesar! is the 1950s back lot of the fictional Capitol Pictures, an MGM-like Hollywood studio whose theatrical world offers such wonderfully wacky tangents as bumbling cowboy movie stars lassoing with their spaghetti, as well as looming scares of Communism and learning of the first Hydrogen bombs.At the center of this world, the ringleader of the Circus, is Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer whose job it is to keep the studio's stars in line, but whose own personal certainties are less assured. As if trying to quit a light smoking habit wasn't the biggest hiccup in his day (the film covers a twenty-seven-hour day), Mannix learns of the kidnapping and ransom demand of the studio's biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), during the shooting of his lead role in the grandly epic big-picture event, titled, 'Hail, Caesar!'Mannix proceeds to bop around from one looney tuned character to the next, including the Dixie-whistling cowboy turned bumbling big screen star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), twice- divorced movie star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), twin sister newspaper journalists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (Tilda Swinton), and tap-dancing Gene Kelly inspired Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), who all amount to being an embarrassment of riches in Coen-land.The Hollywood send-up may be much more divisive than the directors' other films, and likely because it's packaged as a mainstream movie with the likes of George Clooney and Channing Tatum cartooning around as old-timey Hollywood movie stars. But the Coens' only take the shell of old Hollywood and collapse the facade, exploring stories of kidnapping and hijinks, as well as much larger, universal themes of exploration and questioning, such as Politics, Religion, and other head-scratching questions akin to, What Does It All Mean? This search for meaning in a world so ridiculous, that it allows its audience to see the coded philosophic themes and lessons that its harebrained characters can't, makes this another winning outing for the Coen's.The Coen's continue to eschew conventions of narrative structure, allowing their incredible style to drive the film here. Audiences expecting a more classic kidnap comedy will most likely be disappointed by the odd tangential story lines, but should know that the minds of this machine are operating on a top-tier level of intelligence that makes a minute long scene, of Hobie Doyle fumbling the phonetics of a sophisticated line like, ""Would that it were so simple,"" give resonance to the entirety of the story–if only life were so simple.For more, visit www.CINEMACY.com",9.0,Anonymous,Music
You'd need to know something about cinematic history to completely get it BUT...,"... it really is a ""Tale of the Christ"" in allegory. Eddie Mannix is ""the fixer"" for a Hollywood movie studio, Capitol Pictures. His story is supposed to be in parallel with that of the Christ. This is not at all obvious. I had to watch it a couple of times - a couple of times in which I was actually trying to pick up all of the pieces of Hollywood history - to actually get it. Eddie is trying to quit smoking, and he is continually going to confession about his failures in this area. The devil is actually Lockheed, which offers Eddie a tempting offer to abandon his ""flock"" - the stars he looks after - in return for an easy job and financial security. He's got a family - wife and two kids - and television is on its way. What will he do? In the meantime Eddie's ""flock"", the stars of Capitol Pictures, are modelled after Hollywood history of the year in which this is set - 1951. Eddie is trying to deal with the unwed pregnancy of an Esther Williams clone, who curses, smokes (while pregnant), and is not at all sure who the father of her child is. Then there is the sudden disappearance of their biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), without whom ""Hail Caesar"" cannot be completed. It makes fun of the singing cowboys, and what happens when you try to install one in a drawing room drama with a snooty directory, and even Carmen Miranda and Tilda Swinton as identical twins and competing gossip columnists - I am assuming she is supposed to be Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons - are lampooned.In this version of 1951, ""the Commies"" are real threats, not just boogeymen, and figure largely into the plot.If the Cohens made a mistake here it would be depending upon the audience knowing about old Hollywood and getting the allegory of Eddie Mannix as the Christ. You could watch and enjoy ""Fargo"" and know nothing about Minnesota, you could watch and enjoy ""Blood Simple"" and ""Raising Arizona"" and know nothing about the American southwest, but it might be tough going to watch this and get all of the jokes and plot points and know nothing of the history of Old Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Did they leave in the ""Deleted Scenes""?","Plays like a rough cut. There are some truly fun moments - the cowboy movies, the sailor dance, but there are also many scenes that are almost lifeless. And that's the problem. In between these fun moments, the audience quiets down and starts looking around the theater to see if anyone else is getting that same ""uh oh, we should have waited for this to come out on Netflix"" feeling.Some of the more positive reviews sound like essays from a community college film class. Quite a few of the positive reviewers have alleged ""true"" Coen fans will love it - hence if you don't love this movie, it's because you should be somewhere more suited for unsophisticated people, such as a wrestling match or Adam Sandler film festival. I'm not sure what irritates me more, the faux elitism or the $10.50 I paid for the ticket. This isn't a case of ""some people just don't get this movie"". The Coens have never been in that stratospheric league of art house filmmakers whose work only appeals to some lofty intellectual upper class. It's a ""movie movie"", aimed at people who appreciate movies perhaps a bit more than some, perhaps, but still at the mainstream. This movie fails to deliver a coherent, engaging story to its intended audience.Cut out the confessional scenes, cut out the Lockheed subplot, cut back on the scenes with Ralph Fiennes, trim the scenes at the Malibu House and pare back Clooney's role (unless you can actually have him do something interesting). These can go on the DVD as ""Deleted Scenes"", because they already play like those.Expand the story with Jonah Hill and Scarlett Johansson, because that could have been funny and sweet instead of an off-screen nothing. Add a climactic chase between the cowboy star and Channing Tatum, each using their already-established skills, through the studio, passing through and riotously disrupting several movie sets.It is visually lovely, but moves slowly on its way to nowhere.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Of self-love and heartlessness,"'Hail Caesar' is not the first movie where Joel and Ethan Coen have lovingly curated a pastiche of another world, and then proceeded to make a comedy that isn't really funny because it doesn't have a heart. There really is something wonderful about this over-the-top portrait of 1940s' Hollywood; but its marred by the film's deliberate self-consciousness, from the ridiculous voiceover (as also used in 'The Big Lebowski') downwards. The Coens are often acclaimed, and there's no doubt they have a certain vision; but to my mind, the only film of theirs that worked completely was 'Fargo', where the deadpan comedy of the absurd was matched by a portrait of everyday tenderness. But 'Hail Caesar' feels more like an (admittedly clever) act of self-love.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Coen Bros. Vanity Piece that works,"Just rewatched it because I couldn't really remember it. Because I had forgotten it I assumed I wouldn't enjoy it, but I did. This is one of those Coen Bros. Movies where they get a whole bunch of actors that have done more substantial work for them in the past and let them have some fun. That's pretty much how you have to watch it. A fun little movie with lots of cameos and light humor. A period piece that is very pleasing to the eye. No, it's not going be remembered alongside Fargo, No Country or Lebowski, but it's a fun watch for Coen fans or anyone looking for something light to watch on movie night.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Entertaining, but not for the plot","Reaction to a film by the Coen brothers has to be highly personal, due to the off-beat nature and quirkiness of their work. To me, ""Hail, Ceasar!"" was entertaining not for the plot, but mainly for its style, elaborate sets, and oddball characters. The outstanding characteristic of the film is the fact that everyone remains relatively calm at all times, despite working in the high-pressure motion picture business and being involved in a particularly stressful situation (the kidnapping and ransom for the star of a high budget movie during its final days of filming). That characteristic alone makes watching the movie interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Really Wanted to like this!!!,"After seeing the previews on Television, and knowing the type of movies the Coen brothers put together, I was extremely excited to see this movie! I absolutely loved O Brother Where Art Thou, and thought George Clooney was exhibiting a similar performance in the previews of this movie, but alas, I was wrong... Clooney was great but he didn't have much to work with.I have never sat in a movie and watched as many people walk out as I did in this movie. I stayed 'hoping' it would get better, but it didn't. Unfortunately this movie fell REALLY short.I was disappointed that Some of these powerful actors had such little screen time. Nearly all of Jonah Hills screen time was in the preview! Scarlett Johansen had hardly no time in the movie. If you're looking for a movie that will be a cult classic, or have lines which you will hear repeated over and over again, refer to the other Coen brothers movies!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Twizard Rating: 90,"The classic studio era of Hollywood was really a glamorous time--full of movie magic and larger-than-life stars. But the man who was very much responsible for that image we've acquired over time was Hollywood fixer, Eddie Mannix. He kept the public from seeing the slime and dirt that went on behind the scenes.As history goes, Mannix really existed, but for the sake of this film, the people and events around him are very much fictitious.Taking place in the early 1950s, big time movie star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped amidst starring in the studio film Hail, Caesar! But that's just the main conflict. The overlying focus is on Mannix (Josh Brolin) and his responsibility in making sure he does his job right. From an illegitimately pregnant movie star to a homosexual rumor to a Communist threat, Mannix must keep the gossip columns away and put up a facade for the rest of society.The film really is a great inside look at the backside of the film industry in those days. But it may only be appreciated if you know the context of the events taking place. The feel is authentic as it mimics classic cinema in its own right.The sets may be impressive, but the film tries to cover too much ground in one sitting. Just like a typical Coen Brothers film, Hail, Caesar! will leave audiences sitting there debating the point. They tend to dance around what they want to say and get there very indirectly. It's filled with small comedic bits and a lot of extra stuff to help establish the universe.Perhaps the most impressive sequence is during one of the several films-in-a-film where Channing Tatum's character stars in a Gene Kelly-type picture, and there's a 5 minute tap-dance musical number. You'd almost wish you could watch an entire movie of just these types of moments. However, in this day and age, we'll have to settle for Hail, Caesar!Twizard Rating: 90",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The story of Eddie Mannix will never end.,"The story of Eddie Mannix will never end. For his is a tale written in light everlasting.Eddie (Josh Brolin) is a Hollywood fixer. His job or shall we say the mission is to correct the indiscretions of well-publicized film stars.At first, the film takes on the feel of an epic. Soon we realize that it is more than the tale of Eddie and ""There but for fortune goes you or I.""There are many great actors who are at their best in this presentation. I should not be distracted from the characters, but I find it fascinating guessing where I saw them before. Tilda Swinton gets to play twins.However, it is George Clooney as the valued actor Baird Whitlock who holds the presentation altogether.

"Hail, Coenceit!","Occasionally the Coen Brothers turn out films with a little substance, but these days it's mostly powder-puff satirical comedies. 'Hail Caesar' belongs firmly in the latter category, with its tale of a lead actor kidnapped by a clique of Communist intellectuals from the set of a campy melodrama about Ancient Roman legionnaires. The studio's Mr Fix-It searches for his lost star while he pacifies the inflated egos of actors, directors and gossip columnists and negotiates with a potential new employer.After about twenty minutes, it becomes obvious the far-fetched story is just an excuse to serve up some pastiches of 1950s-era movie scenes being filmed on the lot. The theatrical frolics, insider jokes and caricatures of movie-land personalities might produce a couple of weak chuckles, but none of it adds up to anything more substantial than a self-indulgent trifle.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

The scenes between one another were incoherent and the study group with Clooney was just too boring. This movie did not ""move"", it dragged on. I studied film in college and wrote screenplays so I know the story has to ""move"" along.A horrible choice for Clooney and Brolin. Frances McDormand had the best part of all, quite funny even though it was a small part.With the Coens, NOTHING beats the Big Lebowski and Fargo.

Solid vegetable movie yet disappointing for Coen Brothers Standards,"The latest film by Hollywood's best directing pair (Joel and Ethan Coen) ""Hail, Caesar!"" features the best ensemble cast displayed in the Coen Brothers' career thus far. The film contains all the classic trademarks of a Coen Brothers picture, however, the movie is polarizing and something that only 50+ year olds can enjoy with its dated jokes, esoteric references, and lack of a focused narrative.""Hail, Caesar!"" starts out strong with some finely tuned humorous scenes bolstered by sharply written dialogue by the Coen Brothers. The premise, as shown in the trailer, is another abduction/ransom plot with a clever Coen Bros twist. As the movie goes on the plot becomes more stretched out with subplots that stray away from the main plot/focus. This leaves a handful of moviegoers (anyone under about 40-years-old in this case) bored with nothing but hit-or-miss 50's humor and cryptic references to entertain. The story did not have enough spark and vigor to carry its rather short runtime unlike what The Coen Bros did in ""Fargo,"" and ""No Country for Old Men,"" nor did it achieve the comedy gold in ""The Big Lebowski,"" and even the underrated ""Burn After Reading."" Although it did have all the fine performances, deft dialogue, colorful cinematography, and exquisite period detail that all the films listed above had.It's a shame that all the talent and flair the Coen Brothers could muster up only produced an iffy crime story without any dramatic heft in its watered-down plot with dated jokes only 50-year-olds would get. Yet it still would be unfair to say this movie was garbage because of its filmmaking craft. The Coen Brothers really are some of the most competent and distinctive directing voices. Only if next time they could make a more universal and comprehensive picture that would captivate audiences of all ages instead of just anyone familiar with 1950's pop culture.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Talent is All Here But It's a Rare Misfire,"Hail, Caesar! (2016)** (out of 4)The Coen Brother's latest has Josh Brolin playing Eddie Mannix, a studio ""fixer"" who makes sure stars stay out of trouble and that reporters never report the bad stuff. His studio is making an epic religious movie but star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by communist while country star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) tries to cross over into melodrama.HAIL, CAESAR! is a movie I really, really wanted to love but it just doesn't work. The film is obviously a passion project because it gives the Joel and Ethan Coen a chance to play around with former studio films like the religious epic, the musical with sailors and you've even got a pinch of film noir. The movie is trying to pay homage to all of these older films and for the most part its heart is in the right place but there simply aren't many laughs.Sometimes you just sit in a movie theater and get a vibe from the audience and I really think the crowd had the same reaction I did. It was fun seeing a spoof of the religious epics like BEN HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It was fun seeing a musical like ON THE TOWN. The singing cowboy is even given a spotlight. All of this stuff is recreated with passion from the Coen's and the all-star cast is game but it's just not funny. After a while the film really begins to feel like it needed a re-write or two.Brolin is certainly good in the role of the heavy pushing his way around to keep the studio going. Clooney is good in his role but he honestly isn't given much to do other than sit on his sword constantly. Ehrenreich and Ralph Fiennes have the best moments as the country star and his high esteem director. Scarlett Johansson plays the ""bad"" girl who can't keep up with her lovers. Tilda Swinton has a memorable double role and Frances McDormand shows up in one of the few funny highlights. Channing Tatum is also good in his role.So, the stars were all here and the director's obviously had a passion for the material so what went wrong? I really don't know. This is just a rare misfire that had so much potential but it just never came together.",,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar!  is yet another of the Coen brothers' off-beat films","As someone who's familiar with Hollywood history, the fact that Josh Brolin played a movie executive named Eddie Mannix and his superior is the unseen Nicholas Schenck-both actual names of movie businessmen, part of me wondered if the studio-Capital Pictures-was the fictional name for M-G-M. The screenplay threw off that tangent when Eddie mentioned the actual Metro studio refusing to lend Clark Gable. Now that I got that out of the way, I'll just say this is another one of Joel and Ethan Coen's creatively unusual movies-the kind you'd only expect them to make. It concerns the makings of the studio's time doing various pictures like a mermaid one, a musical involving sailors, and one involving a Roman soldier discovering the mission of Christ. It's interesting that me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this on Ash Wednesday. There's also a singing cowboy who seems to know more than what he first seems initially. While there are some scenes that are funny, it takes a while to get the plot going since some scenes seem designed to interrupt the flow of the story. No way is this a conventional narrative and I'm sure the Coens prefer it that way. In summary, Hail, Caesar! is worth a look for anyone who likes the unusual.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hollywood Fixer,"A Coen Brothers film? I'm in. A Coen Brothers film with the always fascinating setting of 1950's Hollywood? I'll be there opening night. Hail, Caesar! tells the story of a Hollywood Fixer, named Eddie Mannix (sort of based on the real life Eddie Mannix), who deals with covering up several studio and celebrity troubles on a day to day basis in order to keep the public knowledge to a minimum. Out of the 6 or so Coen Brothers films I've seen, this isn't their best. But I can acknowledge that some of their previous films have significantly grown on me over time, like Fargo. But I also can't help but think this film turned out to be a pretty big disappointment.Josh Brolin plays Mannix, and for awhile, the film fixed me into thinking it was one of the best films of the year, just like Mannix would do in all sorts of situations, because for the first hour or so, I was completely hooked. I loved how the Coens chose to represent each of the huge genres of the 1950's, particularly the western and the musical. I had never heard of Alden Ehrenreich before this film, and to me, his performance as Hobie Doyle was the overwhelming highlight of this film. There is a particular scene in which his character is making a transition from Westerns to straight dramas and his director, played by Ralph Fiennes, is arguing with him about articulating his dialogue. That scene made me laugh more than most straight comedies do.Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson also have notable but brief performances and both with equally visually gorgeous looking choreographed scenes. Really, the entire cast is perfect. More surprisingly, for the first hour I loved every scene even if nothing had melded together has a fluid film yet. But that's the glaring issue with Hail, Caesar!, the film by no means works as one cohesive story. The trailers, posters, and all the marketing sold it as an offbeat comedy/crime/mystery film, but the actual crime doesn't carry the weight it needed to. Once you realize why exactly George Clooney's character was kidnapped from completing his film, it makes you shrug your shoulders and think ""well, that was a waste.""I do however think the good outweighs the bad. There's so much to like about every single one of the performances and the first hour is Coen Brothers at their best, but the second half drops off significantly, and disappointingly so. Also, don't expect Jonah Hill to play a prominent role in the film like the marketing tells you, he's in one scene and has 4 lines at most. Other than that, Hail, Caesar! was a fun time at the theater for the most part, even if the second half feels so convoluted, uneven, and uninspired.+Witty dialogue is still there+Perfect cast+Watch out for Ehrenreich in the future, the man can act+Choreography and feel of the genre films are straight out of the 50's-Second half drops off-Doesn't really work as one cohesive film7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music

As Messy As It Is Hilarious,"Coen comedies always boast quick, smart dialogue that rivals the best of early-Hollywood's screwball heyday. However, their repartee can border on overly-heady, and Hail, Caesar! is no exception. It (somewhat haphazardly) covers topics as numerous and diverse as truth, Hollywood corruption, the odd marriage of Christianity & capitalism, and the misplaced awareness of our own sins. Luckily, none of that really matters, as Hail, Caesar! manages hilarity in spite of its own pretensions. The Coens' ability to poke fun at their own nihilistic ponderings bolsters this riotous yet complicated love-letter to old Hollywood. We follow 1950s film-studio fixer Eddie Mannix as he tries to keep his biggest productions on task, all the while dealing with actors and filmmakers who refuse to make his job easy (sloppy casting choices, unplanned pregnancies, abductions). The cast is amazing from top-to-bottom. Brolin carries the film with comedic confidence; Clooney shines in his role as a doofus Heston-esque star; and remember when we all thought Tatum was just dumb eye-candy? We were idiots. However, the standout of the bunch is relative newcomer Ehrenreich, as a uniquely funny good-ole-boy western star in over his head. With each of these characters, the Coens manage to systematically tear down the movie studio system while clearly showing affection for it. This mimicking of so many different styles shows a skill that cannot be overstated. While I think anyone could like Hail, Caesar!, students of Hollywood history will get extra enjoyment from the regal beauty and attention to detail that propel this period comedy. Despite the overreaching themes and messy editing, the Coens capable filmmaking hands make this a joyously fun farce despite its flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Would that it were so simple...""","Welcome to the Hollywood studios backlot in the early 1950s, per the Coen Brothers (helmers/directors/producers and editors) comedia del arte twist... focused on the ""swords and sandals"" epic: HAIL, CEASAR!Tomfoolery and jesting diversity of A-list actors panning dead serious lines, fortuitous ability to be in a ""mirthless chuckle"" by a singing cowboy, et al; the foreshadowing of the yet to come Buster Scrubs' anthology; that is portrayed by the variations typical of the studio movie making grandeur of that era.The driving plot is a depiction of Jesus confronting a Roman general or CEASAR or something like that...Such as the Gene Kelly sequence musical number lead by masculine Channing Tatum.

"A Mild Coen Brothers Offering, But Fun Nonetheless","I consider myself a Coen Brothers fan, as I've seen a majority of their films, new and old, and haven't found one yet I didn't like. ""Hail, Ceasar!"" is certainly not a new favorite of mine, but I found myself quite entertained by it as a whole.The first problem with ""Hail, Ceasar!"", I'd say, is how it was advertised. Trailers made it seem like much more of a comedic noir, where Josh Brolin's character tries to solve the mystery of George Clooney's kidnapping. In reality, that's only a portion of the whole package. The film is more centered on showing a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a studio fixer in golden-age Hollywood solving a number of issues with several films, the kidnapping only being one of several. This makes the movie feel like it lacks a true central plot and conflict, and can seem rambling at times. It's less of a cohesive film rather than a collection of scenes and moments. That said, the great ensemble cast, solid direction, and fun dialogue makes the film an entertaining one nonetheless. It's not one of the Coens' best, but it isn't a bad edition to the catalog.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen Brothers hit a new low,"I won't bother with a plot summary for this film for the simple reason that it doesn't seem to have a plot. With that being said, let's crack on with the review.Before I start, I would like to say that I am neither a Coen brothers' fan boy nor am I a staunch hater of the brothers. In fact, I've found my attitude mixed towards the brothers when it comes to their films, but it's safe to say that this is easily the worst film of theirs that I have seen thus far...So what exactly is going on here? Are the Coen brothers poking fun at greedy film directors, producers and/or film makers? Are they also laughing at the fact that a big shot 'studio fixer' would go to pieces when a 'low-rent' alcoholic actor is kidnapped and held to ransom by a bunch of Communists? This sort of satire was covered in a similar vein (and just as badly) in Birdman 2 years ago and whilst I appreciate what the Coen brothers are trying to do here it can only be considered a monumental failure.I think the problem with this film is that the Coens try to cram too much into the film which results in the film having no real focus; you have Clooney's character being kidnapped, a sub-plot about Scarlett Johansson's character being pregnant, a bad actor Hobie Doyle getting more recognition than he deserves. This all leads to a rather messy screenplay and sadly, in this case, it's a film with several stories, but with none of the stories being remotely interesting.The best part of this film was actually the bit where all the sailors were singing and dancing, but to be fair even that section of the film was overdone and went on for too long.In my book, this film is a technical success - It's well-edited, and the acting is excellent by everyone involved - the Coen's really couldn't have assembled a better cast. It's a shame that their writing is so weak, the film is unbelievably boring and even their dialogue (which is usually pretty good) is rather sub-standard and ultimately it is these things that really ruin the film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Complete and utter garbage,"I'd like to sue the Cohen Brothers for wasting two hours of my life, along with HBO, whose titles of late mostly belong in the ""suck"" column.The worst part about a terrible movie being acquired by HBO, is the fact that they put it on a scheduled play list for two months. So the torture of this horrible Cohen Brothers monster, will be shoved in my HBO line-up, like it or not, and it will seem like an eternity until it runs its course.The sad part is, the actors really gave it their best. Even Channing Tatum, who, if I never saw again on screen it would be too soon, proved that he can dance. Unfortunately, his dance routine seems to take up half the movie, just like all the other little 50s bits they stuck in here to relive the period were all waaaaaay too long. Reason: The movie had nothing going on....at all. It is really an embarrassment.If I have to pick 'one thing' that I liked in this horror, it would be Scarlet Johansson's 'spot on' 50's Hollywood New York accent.There wasn't one spot I even smiled, no less laughed. The Cohen's tried to put a comedy spin on the socialist environment in 50's Hollywood, and got so lost in the process, you are left holding your mouth open at the end, because you can't believe what you just watched.Avoid this like the plague, unless you like torturing yourself.",,Anonymous,Music
Nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age,"""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016 release; 106 min.) brings the (mis)adventures of a fictitious film studio in the 1950s producing several films, including the 'prestige' film 'Hail Caesar!, A Tale of the Christ', starring Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney). As the movie opens, we get to know Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), head of production who after going to confession (only 24 hrs. after the previous), gets a girl out of trouble. Meanwhile on the set of 'Hail, Caesar!', it isn't long before a couple of extras manage to drug Baird Whitlock and abduct him. As if all of that isn't enough, Mannix is being courted by Lockheed with a great and generous job offer. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, who most recently charmed us with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Here, the Coen brothers go into another tribute, this time the 1950s Hollywood studio system, still in full force but already past its peak. The Coen brothers bring us a parade of characters, too many to keep track of, and movies within the movie (at least four of them), all the while crafting picture-perfect scenes that are pure eye-candy if nothing else (check: the water ballet scene with Scarlett Johansson's character; the dance and tap foot scene with Channing Tatum's character, etc.). The movie is carried by the performances, more so than the story, and for me the big revelation is Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle, the singing cowboy who now must deliver in a regular speaking part. A number of the big names only appear briefly (Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, etc.). There is a wonderful score. courtesy of composer Carter Burwell, who seems to be everywhere these days (he's got 3 other films in the theaters right now, including ""Carol"" for which he received an Oscar nomination, ""Anomalisa' and ""The Finest Hours""). Bottom lime: the movie works best as something to enjoy in the moment, without thinking about it too much. In that sense, while this is of course a fine movie, it is also one of the Coen brothers' more forgettable movies.""Hail, Caesar!"" opened nationwide last weekend, and I finally had a chance to see it this weekend. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (and leaning heavily towards seniors, I might add). As the movie's end titles started to roll, the guy seated next to me asked his wife ""what was the point of this movie?"". The answer is that there is no point to this movie, it is made to be enjoyed in the moment, with a good dose of nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age. If you have a chance to see ""Hail, Caesar!"", be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I encourage you to do so and draw your own conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I am a big fan of Josh Brolin, George Clooney, and the rest of the actors, and even at my age, love Channing Tatum and his fine self, but other than watching Tatum's dance scene, I was completely under whelmed. Really people, it was so boring I went to sleep, and I never nap! I woke up after a few moments and yes, it was still boring and I had no trouble figuring out the plot. I sat there for a few more minutes and was nodding again so I left, so unless the last 10 minutes were riveting, I have to vote Hail Caesar the most boring movie I've seen in ages.

Some missed the opportunity to truly catch the romance, and I mean Ethan and Joel's lasting love affair with both the art and substance of movie making, and it makes me sad for them. This movie is about the passion and purpose of movie making. It's the ""right thing to do"". That's after all, that's ""what God wants us to do"". Father Ethan and Joel, ""I get it now"".So watch it.

It was good, but it didn't quite live up to the memory of the original bathing suit goddess from the 40's. Where's Ricardo Montalban when you need him.What did make the grade and in fact surpass it was the throw back to the 40's song and tap dance routine. Fred Astaire would be proud. They outdid themselves on that one. All the timing and dance moves were down to a tee. I could watch just that over and over again. And no skirts in this one at all, just boys in tight sailor whites.One more thing that was impressive were, now don't roll your eyes, the rope tricks. Well OK, roll your eyes. Cowboy actors from the 30's & 40's were famous for their riding and roping. There was some of that turn your head riding going on, but the rope tricks were just like Will Rogers had been the instructor.All in all, if you are in love with both sides of Old Hollywood, the in front of the camera as well as behind it, I think you'll enjoy this step back in time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Solid satire spoiled by one tone deaf element,"The Cohen Brothers and one of their best casts had all the makings of a definitive satirical look at ""Golden Age"" Hollywood but no one had the guts to tell them that the disastrous right wing Red Scare years that destroyed so many lives was still not funny, probably never would be, and treating the HUAC charges as if they were grounded in reality only made it worse. There's wonderful, funny, surprisingly accurate stuff here, but the title sub-plot is an insult to some of Hollywood's legitimate greats, not satire and sunk the original release as thoroughily as the Brothers did the ransom money in the mistaken belief it would ""take the curse off"" the big lie in the subplot. 🙄 Channing Tatum's tantalizingly gay dance for a film about sailors about to ship out is a hilarious highlight and the charming ""singing cowboy"" makes you wonder why the lad has not had a more major career. His performance and story were all the film should have been.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail Disappointment,"This is another classic example of never judging a movie from its trailer. The trailer was so good and showed a lot of promise but the movie turned out to be a damp squib. The Coen brothers who have written some classics in the past seem to have an off day. There is so much potential in the story about the movie business in the 50s but too many characters and side plots ruin the film. There is a small bit of history added in about Communists in US in 1950s but that twist looks lame because the story is dull. Perhaps, the Coen brothers should take some inspiration from Tarantino who specialises in making films with multiple characters and side plots. What also made me upset is the Coens waste the talent of multiple actors starting from Clooney, Johansson, Fiennes, Hill, Mcdormand & Swinton who is a double role. They have all interesting characters but never remain sort of caricatures because of the poor writing. And finally coming to Josh Brolin. Brolin is an under rated actor as per me. In the only well written role of a studio fixer Mannix, Brolin gives us performance I could easily relate to. A hard working family man who tries to keep everyone happy and run the studio yet is disturbed and looking for inner peace. A nice performance and I hope in the future Brolin gets similar well written roles in better written movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Painfully slow film. Lots of wasted talent.,"We had high expectations after seeing previews to this film and our group made it a night out to see the latest Coen Brothers film. Our entire group left the theater deeply disappointed. Slow story, bland acting, too much inside Hollywood nonsense. We are big fans of the Coen Brothers. What went wrong here? Too much freedom, bad advice, bad studio input? Who knows, but this film is a dud. I am shocked by the positive reviews here and on RottenTomatoes. NOTE that user reviews across the board are not good. This film is Rotten. It has a few mildly entertaining moments, but the plot drags us into a strange Hollywood insider debate about who deserves credit from a bygone era. Cameos come and go and are largely wasted. I got more entertainment from the preview than the entire film. Watch the preview and be glad you did not waste a full evening seeing this bland and misguided film. Worth a 99cent rental on a Monday night on Apple TV? Maybe. A big maybe. Almost fell asleep about 75 minutes into this film. Boo Brothers Coen. Try again.",,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, the humanity!","The Coen Brothers have given us some wonderful black comedies and dramas -- among them, some of my favorites: No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy,etc. I was so excited to see them tackling old Hollywood again as they did in Barton Fink.What a letdown.The story is a day in the life of Eddie Mannix. Eddie Mannix was a real person, Louis B. Mayer's ""fixer"". He has been played in the past by Bob Hoskins and Barney Martin. His wife, Toni, was the girlfriend of George ""Superman"" Reeves until he broke it off.Unfortunately, a day in the life of Eddie Mannix is episodic, with problems solved off-screen. Some of it is amusing. With the exception of a 30-second scene with Frances McDormand, none of it is laugh out loud funny. It's a shame because there were some fine performances from Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, and Tilda Swinton.The old Hollywood is beautifully replicated. We have a Spartacus- type film going on, starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney, who looks dreadful) who is kidnapped by Communists and held for ransom.Johansson is an Esther Williams type, and we see women doing a water ballet while the character rises from the water in what looks like a big champagne glass. Instead of a huge smile and extending her arms a la Esther, she looks very tentative.There's a Gene Kelly-Sinatra type film about sailors that has a cute musical number by Channing Tatum, whom I guess is supposed to be a gay Communist; and finally, a period piece that a western star (Alden Ehrenreich) is thrust into, walking bowlegged and talking with a twang.Fiennes is the director, Laurence Laurentz, who attempts to coach him. Tilda Swinton plays columnist sisters, fighting for exclusives.So fixer Eddie has to get Baird Whitlock back, fix Johansson's problem, calm Fiennes - it's a major drag. It would have been better to concentrate on the film Hail, Caesar and take out the stupid Communist plot.This film had so much potential, but it goes NOWHERE. And by the way, it contains an old wives' tale - someone says that Mannix saved a major star involved in a hit and run by hushing it up, and the person who took the blame did six months in prison for him. That's supposed to be Clark Gable, and the story is dead wrong.If you want the real story, go to snopes.com - it's a fascinating dissection going back to the original article, which states that Clark Gable rammed his car into a tree on Howard Strickling's lawn.How the story evolved is actually more fun than this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic or Formula Coens is in Eye of the Beholder,"The Coen brothers have been making their style of movies for long enough now that they have a definitive formula to their screenplays. Everything therefore is gauged in your appreciation of their formula. Many claim to have spotted a trend of classic followed by a dud. I have not paid that close attention to that phenomena, but I judge by my own reaction: was I entertained?, was I drawn into the story? Everyone may have their own list of favourite Coen bros films throughout the years, and there may be certain attachments beyond the quality of the filmmaking that can be attributed to that.For instance, I found ""Fargo"" to be a simple tale with a B-movie budget, with the Coen's tapping into an obvious well for humour - the quirky behaviour and language of Minnesotans.""Miller's Crossing"", on the other hand, is such a well layered piece of scriptwriting that it deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence with ""Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"".""Barton Fink"" I have a bias against since I knew for a while that this script was born out of exhaustion when the script for ""Miller's Crossing"" was taking so long. It feels like a half-baked attempt at finding nuance while hoping to get a green light by throwing horror into the second half.I'm sure I have already caused disagreement with other Coen bros fans. ""Barton Fink"" has a legion of critics who say it's one of their best works. Which brings us to the too lightweight ""Hail, Caeser!"". Right off the bat - where is George Clooney? Sure, he is kidnapped, but that shouldn't limit his screen time to a few poignant pieces of dialogue with his captors. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, which is really only a cameo. She is talked about more off-screen than is seen on-screen.I thought many critics would be comparing this film to ""My Favorite Year"", where a big movie star disappears, and a studio employee is responsible for finding him and returning him back for the big finale. The era for that film is the golden age of television. This is a slightly older period, but nevertheless the script is a series of set pieces meant to highlight movie-making of the early 1950s. What actually brought me out to the theatre to witness this on the big screen was Roger Deakins' cinematography; only to be denied a proper showing with a dim bulb and fuzzy out-of-focus image.This film is a series of set pieces, kind of stitched together through the Capitol Studio lot, with James Brolin being the ringleader. Here I was not sure what to make of Brolin's character. Is it a complaint that he was too normal (too human)? There are other set pieces that are close to slapstick, including Clooney's character, which kind of betrays the tone with the more serious Brolin and his tender wife. With other films taking the film-within-a-film motif to a greater degree, I felt the characters had too few layers, and hence a little less satisfying.But then again, a lightweight Coen bros film is still astute in fleshing out dialogue and finding an offbeat subject that has a sense of individuality. With some setpieces finding true smile-inducing characters with appealing antics (Alden Ehrenreich performs lasso tricks!), and a briskly paced day-in-the-life of the motion picture studio, this film still has much more to offer than other similar attempts (puts the over-rated ""The Artist"" to shame).I am writing this review having just watched it, and perhaps it would be more fair to let this movie settle in my mind before deciding whether to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down. On the one hand, the editing room scene feels like classic Coens. But on the other hand, attempts to build tension don't connect in the climax. There certainly is a split between critics and audiences in finding the love for this outing. Almost the same complaint was made about the flawed ""Tomorrowland"" which was supposed to feature George Clooney prominently, only to disappear for the first 40 minutes or so of the film. In this case, our likable gruff, Mr. Ocean Eleven, is dressed both in character and in costume for a larger scope adventure, instead literally is parked in a chair for almost the entire film. So for that I was disappointed. James Brolin, who had the right tone and was a lot more intriguing in the recent ""Sicario"", is a little too normal for this film, and he is the main character.With a star studded cast and a story that jumps around a lovingly recreated early 1950s Hollywood, it is hard to get emotionally involved with any of the main characters, so the final determination I suppose comes down to - was I entertained? I would say, just barely, making this a more mediocre outing than other heightened Coen worlds that are preserved in the pantheons of the critical mass. On the other hand, on a cold February afternoon that a Minnesotan like me decides is better spent inside a movie theatre, I felt I got my money's worth.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Stale Pleaser,"""Well, I'm sorry the Coen Brothers don't direct my porn,"" fumed Jonah Hill in 2007's Superbad. Flash-forward to 2016, and Hill now occupies a coveted star cameo slot in the latest by Hollywood's most illustrious filmmaking brothers (sorry, The Russos). This is the world we live in.But hey - the pictures are a wacky business, dontcha know? In fact, that's about as close to a moral or theme as we get with Hail, Ceasar. As salivary as the prospect of the Coens putting their oddball spin on the golden age of Hollywood with a bigger budget than Barton Fink was, they've sadly - seemingly unironically - fallen prey to the same vacuous glitz and cavernous superficiality of the ol' dream factory they spend an entire feature poking fun at. The result, while still pleasant and replete with choice Coen tidbits, is easily their laziest and weakest work to date. Maybe they should have added more pornIf anything, the film industry, so replete with the weirdos and sleazeballs that are the Coens' bread and butter, may have been too broad a target for them to make much of an impact. The oddest thing about Hail, Ceasar is how frequently characters make verbal reference to the film industry as a circus full of eccentrics in need of babysitting, as the playback itself feels disconcertingly welldull. We could forgive the rampantly incohesive bevy of subplots, and seemingly unintentional slew of film history inconsistencies and anachronisms (for a film championing classical Hollywood, the Coens sure seemingly didn't do much research) were there a core plot strand, or classic Coen lead, for everything to rally behind, a-la Lebowski. Instead, most of the characters we spend the most time tromping around the backstage lots with with - Brolin's growly Harry Mannix, Clooney's mawkish superstar buffoon, even Tilda Swinton's huffy twin gossip columnists - simply aren't very interesting or engaging; they're pale caricatures of characters done far more interestingly elsewhere - heck, even elsewhere by the Coens.Instead, the vignettes that buzz with the most life and infectious fun - Channing Tatum's exquisitely bubbly sailor-clad tap dancer, Scarlett Johansson's potty- mouthed starlet doing mermaid aquatic acrobatics on top of a mechanical whale, and Ralph Fiennes' prissy, effete director demurely teaching elocution - are relegated to tiny sideplots, whimsically snipped away, like pre-feature Roadrunner shorts you'd rather stick with rather than the bland melodrama proceeding them. It's a bemusing trend that at least three or four scenes throughout the film close, anticlimatically, with a cutaway shot to a character hesitantly uttering ""Huh."", as if manufacturing beats so forcedly even they weren't certain the scene had run its course. It's all so slapdash and clumsily cobbled together that Frances McDormand's cameo as an editor who is nearly throttled to death splicing together dailies in the editing suite feels grimly prescient.Still, even sleepwalking Coens still have so much to offer, and many of the aforementioned frivolous filming subplots allow them to let loose with some of their trademark bonkers surrealist visual poetry, not unlike The Big Lebowski's now infamous Viking bowling alley dream sequence. Similarly, relative newcomer Alden Ehrenreich is an inspired find as a chipper Roy Rogers-esq cowboy out of his depth dabbling in a period melodrama, and there's a delightful Wayne Knight bit that will make audiences want to dash out and watch Space Jam all over again. Otherwise, there's slim pickings on display here - even the usual Roger Deakins/Carter Burwell power combo is lacking its usual hilariously austere, cheekily operatic Coen ambiance. The Coens have always been content to opt for style over substance (or at least style bolstering playful ambiguity for those willing to dig deeper for elusive meaning), but here, we're disconcertingly short on both, in this shambling, derivative skeleton of potential.And yet, for a movie so irreconcilably flawed, Hail, Ceasar sure did leave me in a jaunty, cheery mood leaving the theatre, even while drawing up a list of its faults. Perhaps there is a sneaky meta-commentary to be had after all: this film, conflating wide-eyed Judaeo-Christian worship with snarky Communist condescension of the money-grubbing shackles of the system, sure did serve as an opiate for the masses. Hey - if the only takeaway from Hail, Ceasar, apart from some charmingly Coen classical Hollywood dance pastiches, is the urge to go out and indulge in some old- school Hollywood fare (or even old-school Coens fare), I'll take it.(But seriously - Coens: The Porno. Think about it, Joel and Ethan. It'd really tie the room -err, your careers - together)-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The perfect paradox,"How does one pay homage to the golden era of Hollywood and lampoon the golden era of Hollywood simultaneously? The Coen brothers answer that question perfectly with this movie. Not quite as avant-garde as Wes Anderson or níche as so many directors would like to be in their depiction of early Hollywood (L.A. Confidential, I love you, but I'm looking right at you), this film is extremely enjoyable, especially if you grew up with parents who recorded everything they could on VHS (commercials and all).",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Casear!; Film of Films!","The Coen Brothers are certainly some of the greatest living directors working today. Their films have become very famous for paying homage to older films while at the same time managing to change and combine genres giving their reputation as genre-benders. Some examples of this are the black comedy- thriller, Fargo, the contemporary western, No Country For Old Men, and the supernatural horror- drama- black comedy- genre defying Barton Fink. These films are considered some of the greatest of all time and for their new film, Hail, Caesar!, they have attempted to create a film that is every genre of the past at once that can be seen as either a fun homage or a disorienting mess.Even though the plot and characters are fictional it follows the real life Eddie Mannix who was a Hollywood executive during the first half of the twentieth century best known as a ""fixer"". The story takes place during one day in the early 1950s and Mannix (Josh Brolin) has to solve the problems of the day in the film studio where he works at, most notably the kidnapping of movie star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). However, the plot is rather superficial as most of the movie is watching movies that are being made by people in the film studio. It sounds a bit odd, but since part of Mannix's job is watching movies and making sure they are on the right track that is what a majority of the film is and it is a very clever way in which the Coens are able to create more films within the film. With almost each one being a different genre the Coens create a western, an epic, a romantic drama, a noir, a submarine film and a musical all within the 100 minute run time. The film studio itself feels very alive and fleshed out with everybody always doing something and the film has a constant energy. Characters come and ago sometimes without any background as if the audience is already supposed to know who they are which is rather fitting since most of the characters are movie stars. The film drops you into its world and without a story to guide you through it can become really confusing and disorientating quickly. However, it truly doesn't seem like a film that cares much about telling a great story, but more about writing a love letter to the glamour age of Hollywood. More of a film for the filmmaker than for the audience. Trying to fully comprehend what is happening at all times in the film is nearly impossible and arguably unnecessary it seems more like a film that is better being viewed for all the love and energy being put into it.On the production side, the film is perfectly cast even though some performances can last only a few minutes all the actors add a certain amount of humor by incorporating a certain part of themselves into the performance. For example, George Clooney plays a naive character due to his movie stardom status who seems to just take everything as it comes to him and it only makes it funnier because George Clooney one of the most respected actors today is playing him. The cinematography by frequent Coens Brother collaborator Roger Deakins is beautiful managing to change every time the genre changes to really add to the experience, When it's a musical the film is very colorful and vivid and when it becomes a noir dark shadows are cast and it begins to rain.While certainly not the Coens best film, with knowledge of early Hollywood and the types of films that came out of it the film is a fun love letter to the glamour age of cinema that will most likely be enjoyed most by cinephiles.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A complete and utter mess,"As much as I love the Coen brothers, they've truly messed up what could have been a promising film in Hail, Caesar. I think the Coens are trying to be too clever for their own good and in this instance, it has well and truly backfired. One of the missing ingredients is the Coen brothers' trademark absurd sense of humour e.g. The Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou, Raising Arizona just to name some of their most hysterically foot stomping funny films.There were simply too many elements and sub stories in Hail, Caesar that ultimately led nowhere. How would one draw the threads linking a studio executive (Josh Brolin) looking for a missing leading man (George Clooney) who was kidnapped by a group of communist writers, whose mysterious leader also happens to be a campy, tap dancing sailor and a premadonna-ish Hollywood actress (Scarlet Johanssen) trying to offload her child so she can re-adopt it? And that's just the main story line. There are other sub plots that are much too confusing or pointless to introduce in this review. Suffice it to say that this turned out to be a complete mess of a film.For filmmakers as talented as the Coen brothers this is a real disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
That's Entertainment!,"The Coen Bros. are at the height of their powers in this utterly amusing, engaging, and mesmerizing trip through the Hollywood stages of the postwar era that created noble enchantment. Every actor was superb, every scene fascinating and deeply developed and artfully presented. After sitting through a half hour of cheap television advertisements and previews for the worst forms of satanic Hollywood gunk being thrown to the masses today (all of it cartoonish exploitation violence), watching the Coen brothers at work spinning their outlandishly sophisticated magic was a revelation. The irony of so many of the scenes was exceptional in its humor, as, for example, the sumptuous household of the Communists, and the gay undertones of the sailor dance scene. It took me several minutes to compose myself after guffawing uncontrollably during Frances Dormand's cameo appearance. The movie is resplendent with loving homages to classical Hollywood genres of the 4r0s and 50s. Every actor is simply superb and I want to learn a lot more about them after seeing this.

And then you get there and Frances McDormand gets less than a minute. The lure turned out to be nearly all cameos. As for the architecture: big ideas, all garbled. Pieces of something but nothing more. So disappointing. The truth is, this is not the beginning of decline but confirmation. But you wonder how could they have gotten this to market?

Really underrated. Very interesting,"I thought it was greeeeeeeat. Totally not what I expected, although it's the Coens so that was my fault. I thought the trailer was kind of unexciting and to me, didn't really feel like a Coens' film. I'm not surprised audiences hated it at all, but I found it endlessly interesting, exciting, and entertaining, and thankfully, definitely a Coens' film through and through. I had no idea where it was going at any point and for a comedy, that's really, really rare. I have to admit, in terms of following the plot, many times I wasn't really sure what was going on. But I loved every second of it. It's a film entirely made of the character moments (I'm thinking back to that scene with Alden Ehrenreich waiting for his date with his limo driver, or the absolutely hilarious scene with Frances McDormand). I got so much joy out of watching it that the plot became totally secondary. I'm not really that huge of a fan of stuff like Raising Arizona or The Big Lebowski and so perhaps that's why I'm so surprised by how much I loved this. I also don't remember Josh Brolin being this great since Milk (yes, he was better here than in Sicario). I hope this gets some love come Oscar time but I doubt it. I can't wait to rewatch it and this has the makings of a cult classic (audiences hated it though, so proooobably not)",,Anonymous,Music
Another pleasant surprise from the Coen Brothers,"Joel and Ethan Coen, the geniuses behind 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', O Brother Where Are Thou' and 'No Country for Old Men, are back once again, and have delivered splendid surprise with this period set comedy-drama starring an exhilarating cast of some of the biggest actors to shine in Hollywood today. This film set in the 1950s, places Josh Brolin in the role of Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood studio executive of a company known as ""Capitol Pictures"", a studio company filming their new motion picture titled ""Hail Caeser"" which stars a hotshot actor Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney) as a messiah warrior in a biblical story set in Ancient Rome. However, when Whitlock is drugged and mysteriously abducted, Eddie must get his head in the game and keep the actors and staff workers of the industry in line, including a attractive swimmer DeeAnna Moran who becomes pregnant during production (played by Scarlett Johansson), a singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (played by Alden Ehrenreich) who must deal with an ill-tempered film director (played by Ralph Fiennes), and a sailor-suited dancer Burt Gurney (played by Channing Tatum). Jonah Hill makes an appearance as the financial agent.This film is filled with almost everything you can expect from a movie directed by the Coen Brothers: engaging characters, stellar performances, and a solid screenplay. This film is both funny and energetic at various points, with its story set in the Hollywood industry during the post-World War II era. Joel and Ethan Coen make great use with the story with the idea poking fun at Hollywood with clever social commentary and diving into the hypocrisy and corruption that goes on behind the camera. While the story does have some flaws in terms of consistency with its overflowing subplots thrown at every turn, it moves considerably well. Throughout the run time, we are treated with some of most masterful scenes including an stylish musical number by Channing Tatum who demonstrates an impressive dance routine, Scarlett Johansson performing a musical opera with her exotic swim skills, and a powerful cinematic-fueled monologue by George Clooney's character. Then the story dips into the scandalous behavior including communism which was a major threat to Hollywood back in the 50s, committed by the stars and crew members and the dishonesty that drives the production into trouble. These scenes paint such a dazzling picture at the Hollywood environment in the 1950s. And with the colorful production design that gives the scenes a moody and eye-popping 50s-style look really stands as a work of art.With such a stellar cast, incredible performances are what many can only ask for. Josh Brolin gives stunning performance as the main character who must deal with the atrocities that go on when their production goes to utter hell. George Clooney shines bright in his role as the actor starring in a historical motion picture that pays a good homage to 1959 classic 'Ben-Hur', and the monologues his character delivers in the filming scenes are quite entertaining to watch. Channing Tatum is also quite impressive in his role, playing a Gene Kelly-like character and performing a catchy tap dance on the counter and tables at a bar, while delivering a shocking singing voice. Scarlett Johansson and Ralph Fiennes are both good, but is sadly underused for the most of the time. Serving even less screen time is Jonah Hill as the financial agent of the company. The fact that the his character has very little screen time is quite a shame as he gives a credible acting for his time on-screen. Alden Ehrenreich is probably one of the best actors here, playing a cowboy with an archetype of Kirby Giant.Hail, Ceaser! is a great work of art by the Coen Brothers and an inspiring take on the satire of Hollywood. This is film sparkled with tremendous performances, a great screenplay, dazzling characters, and let's not forget the profound cinematography by Roger Deakins. Maybe not the best of their works, but it still deserves our attention. Hail, Ceaser is a movie every Coen Brothers should see.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Much to Laud,"(RATING: ☆☆½ out of 4)THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The comedy can be found in the Coen Brother's film, but it's sporadic mayhem at best, thanks mostly to a wonderful cast.GRADE: B-Journey back to the heyday of the Hollywood film studios and their bevy of stars who lit up the movie screens! The Coen Brothers' latest film, Hail Caesar, still has its stars acting aces, production values that wow, but not much to laud with a tiresome plot that barely comes together.￼The film is an homage to the old Hollywood system, but it rarely builds to an absurd laugh-out- loud farce, rather settling on intellectualizing debates about faith and redemption during the Red Scare of the 50's. (However, I did have a non-stop grin on my face throughout the film.) The direction by Ethan and Joel Coen remains solid as they mock and worship these celebrities with their high cheekbones and chiseled physiques, ill-equipped to handle life, let alone fame and fortune. On the studio's roster are such choice characters, both behind and in front of the cameras. At the forefront is Eddie Mannix (a highly effective Josh Brolin) whose 24 / 7 job at Capital Pictures Studio is to put out the many fires ignited by the studios' acting talents (?). His clients include: DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson), an Esther Williams bombshell who wisecracks and grouses her way through every take, Hobie Doyle (a breakout performance by Alden Ehrenreich, channeling a Sal Mineo vulnerability to perfection) as an empty-headed Western star, Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum, making Gene Kelly proud) playing a song and dance man, and Baird Whitlick (an amusing George Clooney) as a rugged leading man type starring in a ripe religious epic in the style of vintage Ben Hur but without the class.￼Adding to Mannix's problematic issues are Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) as a temperamental film director (but then who wouldn't be with this stars), Tilda Swinton as dueling gossip columnists, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and in an all-too-short scenes, C.C. Calhoun (a funny Frances McDormand) as a frustrated film editor and an unethical agent named Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill). The ensemble is flawless and wondrously dopey, but they are let down by a screenplay that never aligns or engages its characters.￼The film succeeds in mixing other genres (film noir, musical comedy, screwball comedy, Biblical spectacle) and this pastiche are the film's highlights. As long as the film remains on the studio stages, the film works. Were Hail Caesar! to focus more on these marvelous parodies, the movie would be a memorable classic bit about Old Hollywood. Instead it veers off course with subplots about Communist writers, a kidnapping plot, and religious affirmation scenes which goes on far too long without much merriment or laughs. The tone becomes stiflingly serious and labored and one wants more time spent on the wacky antics from these Hollywood types lost on the film set.Still, there are so many standout moments to revel: Tatum's energetic six minute tongue- definitely-in-cheek dance number entitled ""No Dames"", Johansson's Busby Berkeley synchronized swim spoof, McDormand's all-too-short stint, Ehrenreich's singing cowboy's lack of intellectual sparring with the overtly sophisticated Fiennes, Clooney's exasperated buffoonery, etc. This ensemble creates vivid and interesting characters ready to leap to screwball heights but they are weighed down by a screenplay that misses so many golden opportunities to become a riotous comedy. The parodies are spot-on, the plot is duller than need be.As previously stated, the film is a well-crafted look at Tinseltown, with kudos to the astute production design by Jess Gonchor, lovely period costumes by Mary Zophres, and Technicolor- inspired camera-work by the prolific Roger Deakins.￼If the plot itself tends to meander all over the place and, too often, loses some of its light- weight footing, the small pockets of perfected glee from the Coen's inspired cast of delightful characters make the film a pleasant enough diversion. Here, it's the individual scenes of the film, the movie-within-the movie segments, which more than make up for the many missteps in this disappointing film.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rubbish,"I was amazed to find that this film was by the Coen brothers and starred George Clooney. It must be designed to appeal to a particular type of humour - nostalgic American with a fondness for underplayed slapstick. It's not for British audiences! At the showing I went to several people walked out before the end, and there was no laughter at any point. The plot is over-complicated, and much of the acting is stilted and poor - possibly deliberately though this is difficult to discern. Some scenes seem to have no purpose in relation to the storyline - a real hotchpotch of distractions. There is even a religious theme which instead of being funny may well give offence.

Set in the 50s, 'Hail Caesar!' goes behind the scenes the industry of cinema in a fashionable way.It's not a huge film, and if you're walking in expecting a movie like 'Fargo', 'No Country For Old Men' or 'Big Lebowski', you might be disappointed. There is not too much plot, but it's very very funny.I really love watching movies (maybe too much) and I am a big fan of the Coen Brothers. I was really looking forward to see this film without expecting too much. It's fair to say that 'Hail Caesar!' relies more on acting and style than story, but I'm not complaining. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was very well done, the script is funny and the acting is also on point.George Clooney's facial expression were priceless, and there was a lot of interesting supporting characters to lift this film. It's a typical Coen Brothers movie, the dialogue is well-written and very sharp, and the actors are delivering the lines perfectly.In my opinion, Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle really stole the show. The crowd in my theatre were laughing out loud every time he appeared on screen because you knew something funny was coming. I am looking forward to see more from this young actor, great find by the Coens.This is basically a satire of Hollywood and the 50s, you can expect jokes about religion... and Communists. In the end, I walked out of the theatre having a great time, and I'm probably going to see this film again. Being a fan of comedy, I have to say that I might be biased, but this was awesome!8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail Hollywood,"Greetings again from the darkness. Homage or Spoof or outright Farce? Though the Coen Brothers motivation may be cloudy, their inspiration certainly is not. The Golden Age of Hollywood is skewered by the filmmaking brothers who previously applied their caustic commentary to the movie business in Barton Fink (1991). However, this latest seems to borrow more from the unrelated universes of their films A Serious Man (2009) and Burn After Reading (2008) in that it alternates tone by focusing first on one man's attempt to make sense of things, and then with a near slapstick approach to ""urgent"" situations.The film seems to be made for Hollywood geeks. Perhaps this can also be worded as  the film seems to be made for the Coen brothers themselves. Rather than an intricate plot and subtle character development used in their classic No Country for Old Men (2007), this is more a collection of scenes loosely tied together thanks to their connection to Eddie Mannix, Capitol Pictures ""fixer"". Josh Brolin plays Mannix, a twist on the real Eddie Mannix, notorious for his behind the scenes work at MGM in controlling the media, protecting the stars and studio, and protecting movie stars from their own idiotic actions. He was a real life Ray Donovan. It's Mannix's job that creates the hamster wheel to keep this story moving (with a complement from narrator Michael Gambon).We witness a typical day for Mannix as he confesses to the Priest that he had a couple of cigarettes after promising his wife he would quit, negotiates with communists who have kidnapped the studios biggest movie star, deftly handles the studio head's greedy desire to shift a western movie star into a genre for which he is ill-prepared, plans a cover-up for the starlet having a baby out of wedlock, and juggles the demands of the competing twin gossip columnists searching for scandal. Mannix keeps his cool through all of this while mulling a lucrative job offer from Lockheed that would put him right in the midst of the nuclear war scare.With an exacting attention to period and industry detail, the Coen's remind us of the popular genres and circumstances of the era. George Clooney plays mega star Baird Whitlock, working on the studios biggest picture of the year – a biblical epic entitled ""Hail, Caesar!"" (think Ben-Hur, The Robe, etc). Whitlock is kidnapped by a group of communist writers (not yet blacklisted) who are striking out against a capitalistic studio that doesn't share the rewards with the creative folks. It's a different look than what Trumbo offered last year. In a tribute to Roy Rogers and famed stuntman Yakima Canutt, there is a segment on popular westerns featuring Alden Ehrenreich (Beautiful Creatures, 2013) as Hobie Doyle, a popular actor whose an artist with a rope and horse and guitar, but not so smooth on his transition to the parlor dramas being filmed by demanding director Laurence Laurentz (a terrific Ralph Fiennes). In boosting Doyle's public perception, the studio sets him up on a date with a Carmen Miranda-type played by Veronica Osorio. Her character is named Carlotta Valdez in a nod to Hitchcock's Vertigo. Another sequence features Scarlett Johansson as DeAnna Moran, an Esther Williams type (with a behind the scenes nod to Loretta Young) in a Busby Berkeley-esque production number featuring the synchronized swimming so prominent in the era. One of the film's best segments comes courtesy of Channing Tatum in a take on films like On the Town, where sailors would sing and dance while on leave.Tilda Swinton (whose appearance improves any movie) appears as the competing twin sister gossip columnists Thora and Thessaly Thackery. Her hats and costumes are sublime and pay worthy tribute to Hedda Hopper (who also balked at being termed a gossip columnist). Jonah Hill's only scene is from the trailer, and it could be misleading to any of his fan's coming to see his performance; and the same could be said for Frances McDormand (a very funny scene as a throwback editor). And so as not to disappoint their many critics, the Coen's have a terrific scene featuring four men of various religious sects who are asked their opinion of the script – so as not to offend any viewers. The pettiness is palpable.Roger Deakins is, as always, in fine form as the cinematographer. The water and western productions are the most eye-catching, but he does some of his best camera work in the shots of individual actors or scenes-within-a-scene. We have come to depend on Joel and Ethan Coen for taking us out of our movie comfort zone, while providing the highest level of production – music, costumes, sets, camera and acting. While this latest will leave many scratching their heads, the few in the target audience will be applauding fiercely.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"I was very excited to watch Hail, Caesar! because it's directed by Ethan and Joel Coen and the cast is promising. The trailers also made the movie look quite interesting but I was so disappointed when I watched it.The movie was so dull, the dialogue was very boring and there was no interesting climax. The movie started off well focusing on Josh Brolin's character then it fell apart with the several unnecessary side plots.For example, Scarlett Johansson's character wasn't important, she wasn't even linked to the main story line and Jonah Hill was only in one scene. But all the actors did a great job especially Alden Ehrenreich, I have never seen him in a movie before but his performance was brilliant.Overall, the movie was aimless when I was watching it I thought it will have an interesting ending but It was a very predictable ending that couldn't save the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
True Coen,"Hail, Caesar is the Coen brothers doing what they do best. This movie is along the same vein as the big lebowski where the humour is dry but humour there is. From the outrageous musical number to the outrageous plot. People who are bad mouthing this movie are obviously not Coen fans. I love it. I thoroughly love the idea of this film as a sort of insight into the world of movies in the 50s. I read some horrible reviews going in and knew then that it would be a typical Coen film. The Coen brothers are geniuses and deserve all the accolades.Long live Joel and Ethan Coen.Everyone who enjoyed Fargo or The Big Lebowski should see this film. Its not laugh out loud funny but its a visual treat.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Go out there and be a star!,"It's as light as a feather and gossamer thin, full of stars in what are little more than bit parts. George Clooney gets to look like a fool again (the Coens have a skill at doing this). James Brolin is a powerhouse as a deeply troubled Catholic studio operative and everyone else is having fun.It's not a great movie in the way that Fargo or No Country for Old Men is, but it's stuffed full of little moments that are delightful.And it's not as good as The Player or the Coen's own Barton Fink when it comes to movies about Hollywood, but still there's a lot of cynical fun to be had.Is there a plot? Well, sort of, maybe, of a type, but it's more a collection of moments than a story.But what great moments they are.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Nothing going on,"Witty, pretty, with some great shots, fun acting and a few laughs, but ultimately, it feels like nothing ever happens. This is the most surprising thing about the movie: despite the conspiracy, the abductions, media machinations and long-winded confessions, there's just nothing really going on. Nothing, really.For someone interested just in acting it might be worth watching, to see Clooney's wonderful performance and to see all the stars switching from the high-pathos acting of the depicted era to being civil. Scarlet Johansson's cameo is an absolute treat and Josh Brolin is, as expected, magnificent.But for a casual viewer: the movie has essentially no plot, no character development... well, again, there's nothing going on. Ultimately, it feels rather disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
terrible try to make a fun movie,"this crappy movie could be summed up in 4 sentences, yet somehow one needs to write more. so this is me writing a review for this movie, which probably takes more time, than the writers had to sacrifice on its script. thank god I save my writing time by not watching the end of this ""movie"".I rarely hate on movies, but this one deserves to be hated upon. I watched it for 9 hours straight! After that I checked my watch and realized I was just 46 minutes in! This movie compares to Movie 43 quite well, because its summary reads: if you watch for 30 minutes you might turn mental. - hence I put 2/10 instead of 1.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Not among the Coen Brothers' best but still quite entertaining,"Hollywood, 1950s. Eddie Mannix is Head of Physical Production at Capitol Studios. His life is one of non-stop action: casting issues, production issues, keeping the studios stars in line, ensuring the studio avoids negative publicity, dealing with the press, playing matchmaker to the studios stars, among other things. His current main issue is that one of the studios biggest stars, Baird Whitlock, has been kidnapped by Communist screenwriters. But its all in a day's work for Eddie Mannix.Quite entertaining...in spells. It's really quite hit-and-miss. The first 30-40 minutes or so, which were mostly background, were great. There was a wonderful sense of lightness and quirkiness about the movie.However, the plot development wasn't always engaging and was sometimes silly or dull. Worst of all was the main plot, the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock. It seemed implausible and silly from a point and never really got back on track.On the positive side, the Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) - Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) sub-plot was great: funny, and the casting issues around it seemed quite realistic. Some great moments in other sub-plots too.At an overall level, what keeps the movie from falling apart is the boundless, infectious energy of Eddie Mannix. Josh Brolin is superb in the role.The other glue is the Coen Brothers obvious love of cinema and the art of movie making. This movie is a homage to the Hollywood of the 50s and the Coen Brothers spare no effort in recapturing that era.Good ending which ties the whole story together well. The takeaway message from the movie may be self-serving but it is loving and sincere.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst movie ever!,"This is the worst movie I ever have seen. George Cooney is a great actor and does great scenes but the movie can't be saved. My friends were with me and agreed that it's a bad movie...hard to follow. The scenes were hard to follow. Not worth watching this movie. I don't understand how it got such a high rating at IMDb. It's nowhere near as good as THE NOTEBOOK or STARWARS. It's rated a ZERO but the lowest I could give it was a 1.Several of the scenes made no sense at all. George Clooney was dressed in a great roman soldiers costume. I think the costumes were great for the period of time (mid 1950's era), but the storyline of the movie stunk.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Quite entertaining throughout,"I had no clue what this movie was about when going in. I was quite thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie. Had a simple concept of the main man keeping control of the Hollywood scenario back in the day. Jumped to some entertaining in studio filming with some pretty good humor mixed in. The story was straight forward with a satirical look at things. Definitely worth it if you are not the type that needs straight action and/or intriguing story to pull you through the movie. If all you need is good acting from all and a story that is entertaining and fulfilling, then this one you will enjoy. Some of the later reviews on here are hitting this movie way to hard as they must have been expecting an epic or something.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Clooney Catastrophe,The star line up for this film is impressive but that's as far as it goes. I thought it sounded like a fun romp but the reality is it's a laboured take on the studio system. The characters are very 2 dimensional and the storyline is impossibly weak. I find it hard to believe Clooney could play such a lame role and how on earth did they make him look so unattractive? Alden Ehrenreich did manage to shine in portraying his role as Hobie and his performance did generate laughs. Otherwise there was a distinct lack of laughter in the aisles. Josh Brolin provided the necessary gravitas and could've provided a ready foil for the comedic elements but this was never really exploited. I really fail to see why so many respected actors would risk their reputations in a film of such low calibre. It is certainly not one of the Coen brothers better offerings and I think they are simply riding on their reputation.,3.0,Anonymous,Music
worse than awful,"I love all the actors that were in this movie but the film itself was horrible. There was barely any story. It was so sad to watch all that money and time spent on such a big production only to end up with something so pointless and boring. When are movie writers going to understand that if it serves no purpose then it should not be in the script?? 90% of this film served no purpose. Zero. None. Nada. Absolutely pointless. Totally, completely irrelevant. Just a waste of my time. Please. Stop. Making. Pointless. Movies. Like. This. One.",,Anonymous,Music
"The Coens, '50s Style.","""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016), directed by the Academy-award winning Coen Brothers, is a light-hearted portrayal of nineteen-fifties Hollywood, where large film studios are all powerful. In amongst the barbs and repartee, the Coens' clearly feel an affinity with the era, and along with their cinematographer Roger Deakins, recreate the visual look of the decade with an uncanny precision. It's the first film in years to recall the Technicolor brightness of American pictures of that time; it reveals a real affection, while still maintaining a clear-eyed sense of the iniquities of the then-studio system. Studio executives control their stars' lives to the smallest degree, while waspish gossip columnists try to discover any scandal.The Coens add into this mix a number of pastiches, not just of Roman and Biblical epics, but of Westerns and musicals, with a spot-on musical number featuring Channing Tatum as a sailor (in clear reference to ""On the Town"", 1949), one of the film's highlights. Being at heart a screwball comedy means the Coens' darker impulses are kept in check so that even the malevolent group the Future, who abduct George Clooney, are seen as charmingly misguided.Josh Brolin displays fine comic skill and brings a layer of nuance to his serially perturbed studio boss character, while the ensemble cast match the all-star extravaganzas so popular in the nineteen-fifties: everyone seems to appear, from Tilda Swinton to Scarlet Johansson, Jonah Hill to a very memorable Aldren Ehrenreich as a singing cowboy.Perhaps one criticism that could be made is that it never becomes more than the sum of its parts: the script, by the Coens, offers a wonderful whirlwind of episodes, jumping from Ralph Fiennes' refined director offering Ehrenreich elocution lessons to a distraught Brolin trying to hide the fact his biggest star is missing. Yet it never quite coheres into an organic whole and by the time it concludes, you're left feeling that it is a rather slight, shaggy-dog story: a lot of fun and frequently amusing, but not one of the Coens' masterworks, a minor work by major auteurs.However, it would be churlish to deny the film's many pleasures, from Carter Burwell's score to the production design by Jess Gonchor, with costumes from Mary Zophres. It's authentically nineteen-fifties and that alone is reason enough to see it; combined with witty performances and deft direction, it almost doesn't matter that the film is about very little. Enjoy the ride and forget about the destination.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar! I was completely unimpressed","Hail, Caesar! I was completely unimpressed. Perhaps I have too high a degree of expectation from the films of the Koen brothers, but not a strong cast, not a good satire over Hollywood in the 60s before the abolition of the Hayes code did not convince me. Hail, Caesar! Sort of like a comedy, but it hardly makes the viewer laugh. The film is not bad in itself, but cranberries about the Russian KGB and the protracted plot disappoints.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you grew up watching films from this era, you might enjoy it...","The story is set in the 1950s, at a film studio where Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin) is a 'fixer'...if a problem arises in the making of a movie (be it with actors or whathaveyou), he'll 'fix' it. That could include things like getting an actor out of a difficult situation off the set, or...something more dramatic, as we sell when this film unfolds. Expecting to see George Clooney in this movie, for a moment I wondered if Eddie Mannix was being played by him...all old guys look alike, maybe?As I child, I'd remember seeing movies on the ABC (Australia) about cowboys and million dollar mermaids etc, so if you were growing up when those kinds of movies were being made and you went to the cinema to see them, you might get a lot out of the characters in this movie which play the knock-off versions of the real actors from that bygone era. For instance, I'd say that the character of DeeAnna Moran (played by Scarlett Johansson) is intended to be interpreted as being Esther Williams, who starred in ""Million dollar mermaid"" (about the Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman). ""Million dollar mermaid"" no doubt had some choreographed dance routines done in the water which were created (I would learn in a documentary many years later) by Busby Berkeley...and you get to see that recreated in this movie...or reinterpreted, as I'm no expert on this subject.Since this movie is billed as a comedy, I have to say I did get a few laughs out of it. E.g. there's a funny scene early on in the movie where Mannix is holding a meeting with various religious leaders of different faiths and denominations about a movie his studio is making (""Hail, Caesar!"") and it's funny seeing how these leaders react to the premise of the movie. Actually, there's a line in the end credits of this movie which relates to this scene.Also making me laugh was a scene between Wraith Fiennes (as Laurence Laurentz) and Alden Ehrenreich (as Hobie Doyle). Presumably Hobie is meant to be Gene Autrey (I'm not sure because I don't think that I've ever seen an Autry movie). Tongue-in-cheek, the scene is about electrocution.By the by, speaking of knock-off characters, I'd say that Channing Tatum (as Burt Gurney) is meant to be Gene Kelly. The dance routine with Burt Gurney reminded me of a sketch on ""The late show"" featuring Mick Molloy...demonstrating how anachronistic such fare is in the modern world (this clip might even be on You Tube).Since this was the era of senator Joe McCarthy, I have to say that I do find it a pity that the film's treatment of this era seems, if not fanciful, then at least insubstantial.My initial notes for this film gave it a score of 75% but a few days after seeing it now, I'll just dimish my score a tad...if I had of put ""75%"" in the header of this review, my practise is to round down my scores, not up, so the net effect is the same...this film gets 7 stars from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been great,"The movie starts off fine, good characters, good humor. Then about halfway through I realized that wherever this was going was taking way too long. All of the scenes are really good but there isn't any focus. After the long dance number in the middle my interest was lost for good.The Cohen's seem to be in this rut of trying to be themselves or trying not to be themselves or not like anybody else, I can't really tell. But there is too much trying on their part. Before they naturally wrote their movies and it seems that they are aware of the spotlight or something.Seems like after winning best picture that they've tried not to repeat that move? I don't know, that's an easy time to point at and say it happened here. But ever since then their movies have tried to be outside the box instead of naturally being that way. Buster Scruggs was good for the most part. I hope they find their passion sooner than later.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A brilliant post-war self-reflexive commentary on the Hollywood studio system.,"Go inside classic showbiz! Before the decentralization of ""Hollywood"" filmmaking, the big studio was king. And Hail, Caesar captures the socio-economic mountains and pitfalls of the decline of the Golden Age of Hollywood perfectly, complete with a pure message about love, dedication, and highbrow humor along the way. You couldn't have asked for a better cast. From the excellent writing to the impeccable acting, this film is sure to provide you with old-school style entertainment paired with plenty of topics of discussion–especially for cinema scholars and historians like myself. Return to the Hollywood that still inspires dreamers today and experience life in the studio system. This is one of the best self-reflexive films about Hollywood itself since Singin' in the Rain. Although, the social-commentary is more or less a plot device that plays in the background while the main plot is the true focus of this exceptional narrative. Truly a remarkable film that will likely find its way into sociology and film studies classes alike.Where to begin?!? As a peer-reviewed published cinema (and themed entertainment) scholar and historian, there are are so many different ways of applying a critical analysis to this film. Leaving the cinema last night, I was perplexed as to how to write about it. Ordinarily, I have a general idea of the direction I will head in my review by the time the credits roll–not this time. There is definitely a subplot in the movie that would be great material to dissect and analyze but I don't want to spoil that for you; although, I can say that is is very apropos for that period in 1940s/50s Hollywood.In order to analyze the material that I found most interesting, I want to first spend a moment on the film itself. Even before watching it, you already know that it boasts a brilliant cast and thankfully everyone lives up to the expectation that comes with their respective talent. From the leading players down to the A list cameo appearances, all the actors bring a unique flavor to the overall recipe of the movie. One of the elements that stands out the most is the attention to detail in the classic Hollywood production design. Essentially, we are watching a movie containing the making of another movie. The matte backdrops and traditional rear projection doesn't stop in the story of the film being made in Hail, Caesar, but the classic production styles and designs cross over into the production of the Hail, Caesar itself. From the color schemes to the wardrobe and makeup, the attention to detail is flawless. Although much more humorous and satirical than the epitome of self-reflexive post-war Hollywood films, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Hail, Caesar does a superb job of going inside the word of showbiz and highlighting positive and negative consequences of the former studio system.The film opens up with Mannix pulling DeeAnna (Scarlett Johansson) from an unauthorized photoshoot because the image the studio has of her could be tainted. That is really the first glimpse into what it was like for stars who worked in the Hollywood Studio System. Not limited to the talent, Mannix even told directors who would star in the pictures that they were hired to direct. Capital Pictures even pulled a cowboy off his motion picture to then star in a drawing room comedy. When you worked for the studio, you worked FOR the studio. From your image to the projects you worked on (whether talent or technical crew), your every move was managed by the studio heads. Sounds like the perfect setup for exploitation, doesn't it? In many ways, yes. However, the studio system also provided a central hub for working in motion pictures. One of the scenes show Mannix walking down a corridor of editing offices, and that is something that isn't quite the same today. Studios has exponentially more staff until the final collapse of the studio system in the late 1950s/early 1960s. You had a regular job Monday-Friday and were typically on a salary. Yes, many aspects of your career were managed–even down to you accompanied you to the premiere of the film you either worked or starred in. But, many more people were employed by the studio directly than today. Just something to think about.The studio is aptly named Capital Pictures. And rightly so, because at the heart of the movie, the two-fold plot of the film contains socio-economic commentary. The counterpart to the socio- economic side is about being dedicated to one's true passions. Mannix can easily represent anyone who has a job that they work hard at and are dedicated to but often drawn to opportunities that would be easier and make more money. Do you choose to follow your passion? Or, do you choose the easy way out that would be more profitable? You will have to see the movie in order to discover how Mannix dealt with that real-world conundrum. Although the story of the passion of Christ is a backdrop in the film, it actually plays quite an important role near the end of the third act. The message of love transcends the screenplay (being shot in the movie) and impacts the actors and studio leadership. There is so many wonderful elements to discuss in Hail, Caesar and I have just touched on a few of them. I encourage you to make your way to the cinema this weekend in order to experience it for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting, Just Not Up to Coen Brothers Caliber","This movie has a great ensemble cast, but it is a shame that some of the characters that have great potential are not followed throughout the entirety of the film. We tend to stick to a few key characters, and it is a shame we have strong actors like Scarlett Johansson who do not receive a lot of screen time even though they make up the ensemble cast.As this was advertised as a comedy it would have been nice to see more humor in the movie, though even though there are a few key moments that are funny, all of these moments are hilarious. A lot of these moments happen to be focused around a character named Hobie who is an action-star-turned-speaking-actor, and his interaction with Ralph Fiennes proves to be comedic gold. Also, pay attention for a segment with the premiere of a movie Hobie stars in called ""Lazy Ol' Moon."" It makes older movies look like caricatures.What holds the film together is that while it is made up of an ensemble cast, there are only a few stories to follow, so it is difficult to get lost in these stories. Some of the stories are more enticing than the others, however, but you will find them to be intertwined so it all makes sense.The direction of this movie still shows the Coen brothers are strong directors. The movie looks brilliant, the art direction makes it very believable that we are experiencing old Hollywood, and there are extremely well-choreographed and well-executed sequences. This is a good Coen brothers films, but it is not that high on the list compared to the rest of their canon.3.0/4.0",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Hollywood Homage with No Story,"Sadly, Hail, Caesar!, is a misfire in the eyes of this reviewer, especially given that it is a Coen Brother's film. This is one of those times where A+ quality people made a C- movie. Simply put, this is a classic case of a movie trailer being more entertaining than the actual movie itself.I understand that the movie is a satire on Hollywood and the craziness that goes on there, but it could have at-least been a bit more amusing. We are shown the craziness of random casting changes, Hollywood gossip, political intervention, director-actor relationships, and the difficulty of keeping everything together. But in doing so, the overall story meanders and never comes full circle (or all that coherent for that matter). The title character (Brolin) goes from one set to the next as we are shown elaborate dance scenes, giant sets, and behind the scenes turmoil. The problem is these scenes do nothing to advance the plot. It's a nice trip down memory lane to see old school productions, but that's it. It's all glitz and glamour and no brains.Caesar may have a ton of star power and production designs galore, but it simply lacks the most fundamental aspect a movie requires, entertainment. I wish I could say I found the movie hilarious or thought-provoking or tense, but I can't. Everything here felt half-baked and the story that seemed to be at the core felt very underdeveloped. Leading to the overall experience being rather boring (I know this is one of the worst words to describe a movie but it appropriately fits here). For a superior experience, go watch 'Trumbo' instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Light comedy that touches all the bases,"Interesting combo of send-up and genuine entertainment. For example, there are two production numbers that are exaggerated, but not in a way that diminishes the original genres that they were derived from. Instead they are updated, and watchable.It's not a weighty movie -- just a lightweight look at a bygone era, and the things that happen when movies are being made, with familiar faces (although I challenge you to spot Frances McDormand) and funny jokes. I don't know what anyone else is saying about Channing Tatum, but I really liked his performance. And this guy Alden Ehrenreich -- whoa! He is just great. He has a gift for comedy and movie star good looks, and his character is *earnest* -- and likable. He is fun to watch. The secretary to Eddie Mannix, the studio head (presumably named after notorious MGM fixer Eddie Mannix) is a prominent character and she is compelling - she steals every scene, I think: Heather Goldenhersh! Today she'd be a producer, and I think the movie makers are making a poignant statement with her character.Lots of cameos: ""Newman"" from ""Seinfeld,: David Krumholtz, Alison Pill from ""Newsroom,"" the stand-up comic from ""Mad Men"" -- really fun seeing so many familiar faces in unfamiliar roles.I saw it in preview at Cinemark Egyptian in Hanover Maryland.

Comedy? Not so.,"Disclaimer: I did not watch the whole movie. I watched maybe 45 minutes to an hour before giving up on it.---This movie looked and sounded like it would be a hilarious parody of 1950s Hollywood. I was rather looking forward to seeing it after we rented it. Not only did it have a great list of talented actors, but it also had the Coen brothers who have been responsible for a number of enjoyable films.I regret to say that this flick fell flat on its face. What I expected to be a movie full of laughs turned out to be a collection of big names who got so little screen time, it was impossible to connect with their characters at all. There was no real plot, save for what a day in the shoes of Mannix, or whatever his name was, might be like. It was a collection of subplots which never interwove, never appeared to be meaningful, and never managed to catch my interest.The few laughs that I did have were few and far between, and I constantly felt like I was waiting for something amusing to happen. It didn't.I gave this film 2 stars for the only two good things about it. The set/costuming, and the beautiful cinematography. I can't even give it a star for the actors, because while talented actors were included, I don't feel that any of them were properly utilized.Finally, I will say this; I am glad I rented this movie rather than saw it in theaters. I would've been incredibly upset had my boyfriend and I taken the time and given the effort to go to the theater, not to mention the $40 that would've been wasted on tickets and popcorn.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

We see twenty seven hours if his life, which are already enough to be filled with many entertaining and baffling events.""Hail, Caesar"" shows many interesting events in the Hollywood film business back in the day. I find the Hobie in the ballroom scene very funny, that Hobie can talk normally outside the camera but not when the camera is rolling! The bit about Scarlett Johansson's character is funny as well. Tilda Swinton's characters are funny too. Though the events are entertaining, there is not much intensity and irony that is often in a Coen brothers film.

Not great but not awful.,"Joel and Ethan Coen, have they don't it again?No, I don't think so.Going back to their earlier efforts Raising Arizona, Millers Crossing, Fargo and The Big Lebowski the brothers had an ability to create weird and interesting characters who carried the narrative as well as beguiling us with their idiosyncrasies. These films were like jumping on a roller-coaster and riding it through the loops,the twists and the turns. Hail Caesar is more like walking through side- show alley and stopping to look at the carnival freaks; each of them interesting on their own but non related to the last and the only thing they have in common is they're in the same circus.The central character Eddie Mannix is an interesting guy. Played by Josh Brolin he has a fascinating job and you get the feeling he really loves films, the people and the industry. But wouldn't everyone love his job? He's not acting a role, writing a script, directing the talent or producing a picture? His job is to make sure all those elements work together and sort out the problems which could prevent the completion of the productions. This includes maintaining the pure reputations of the female stars, convincing directors they should continue with miscast actors and rescuing his biggest star from a group of communist writers. Just your average day for a god-fearing father of two in Los Angeles 1951.Josh Brolin is the best thing in the film. He's supported by George Clooney in over-acting mode doing his best homage to 1950's Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster dressed as a Roman Centurion. His kidnapping is supposed to be the main story but it feels like an excuse for Brolin to move from studio to studio allowing us to witness an Esther Williams-esque aquatic piece with Scarlett Johannson in the starring role, a Sailor-themed dance number with the excellent Channing Tatum clearly inspired by the great Gene Kelly or a black & white socialite vehicle directed by Ralph Fiennes doing his best Noel Coward impersonation.I left the cinema asking myself whether the Coens created Hail Caesar as a thank you to all the producers who helped make their pictures? These thankless yet well-rewarded individuals very rarely get the recognition they crave. Other than that I don't get the purpose of the film unless it's to poke fun at the black-banned writers of the McCarthy era or just so the Coen boys could create a swimming pool scene, a singing cowboy piece, a black & white high society drama, a sword & sandal epic or a dance number without going to the trouble of making five separate movies?Hail Caesar is not a return to form for the Coens in fact it may not make their top ten but it is an interesting walk behind the scenes of the Hollywood studio system of the 1950's.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie for people who love movies,"The main reason Hail, Caesar! Received a lukewarm reaction is that the audience expected something different. The focus isn't on the plot, the tight narrative or the character development. Its appeal lies elsewhere. Just Like Hugo, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, it's a nostalgic trip, a movie about movies.The Coen brothers decide to pay tribute to '50s Hollywood and what a glorious spectacle that is, they have done a wonderful job in taking us there. All the movie segments that are shown could convince anyone that they are part of actual movies that were filmed in the '50s.The main character is Eddie Manix, played by Josh Brolin. He is the guy who is responsible for keeping everything under control and fixes any problem. It's a difficult job, but one he can't do without.He has to deal with the frustration of Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) as Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) a star of Western tries to become a dramatic actor.DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant and a father has to be found - or maybe a more creative solution is necessary. By the way, the water ballet scene is magical.Another pleasant surprise is a musical with Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum) as Gene Kelly.And Eddie has to make sure that the twins journalists (both played by Tilda Swinton, who has a small but funny part) won't have any success while fishing for gossip.The central story revolves aroundBaird Whitlock (George Clooney) about to star (think of Charlton Heston) in an epic about Jesus Christ seen through the eyes of a Roman but he gets kidnapped. He is the usual goofy character that follows Clooney in most Coen movies, but he gets the chance to take part in a Communist meeting and that provides some great moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lot's of Goofy Ideas, but Still a Serious Enough Tone","I was excited to see this movie. I haven't seen too many Coen Brothers movies, but I've liked the ones I've seen. Nevertheless, I was curious as to how well a Coen comedy would turn out. I'm happy to say that it was a lot of fun.Hail, Caesar! is a very different movie. It's not at all what you'd expect, but despite this it turned out very well. The ideas are all very funny, and while it's more fun to think about how goofy it is than actually watch it, it's still presented well enough that it stands as a great movie even without the comedy. I was happy to see that a lot of clichés in kidnapping movies like this weren't indulged in, and it really was a very unpredictable movie.The characters are quite good too, surprisingly. The humor helped to show what each of them is like, and although Josh Brolin easily received the most screen time of them all, it was clear what kind of person each character was from the handful of scenes they were in, which I thought was very impressive.Overall Hail, Caesar! is a great movie. While it's better remembered than watched, it stands as a great movie even while watching it. The plot is unique and well-presented, the characters are good, and the ideas are, while over the top and goofy, very well suited to the whole film. Most of them are subtle enough not to be annoying, nor are they ever overused. The movie still maintains a relatively serious tone throughout, but the subtle ideas thrown in here and there are fun, and somehow manage to actually suit the movie very well. In the end I'd certainly recommend Hail, Caesar! to pretty much anyone. It's not for everyone, so you'll just have to see it to know.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sh*t...Pure and utter Sh*t,"Do yourself a favor if you are deciding whether or not to see this movie, Sh*t on a plate and stare at it for 2 hours, you will get the same experience. This was literally on the top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. George Clooney should just hang it up. He too is a pile of sh*t. From the opening of the movie I realized this was going to be one of the worst experiences in my life. I was dragged by my wife to see this movie, and almost contemplated serving her with divorce papers for making me endure this utter failure of a movie. I can not express enough how terrible this movie was. Please. Do not see this movie. Do it for yourself. Do it for your family.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A subtly brilliant paean and parody of Hollywood's golden age,"""Hail, Caesar!"" may not be the best Coen Brothers movie ever, but then again, it might just be and even a film that ranks somewhere in the middle of their oeuvre is better than the best films by most writers and directors.The movie is meticulously detailed and intricately interwoven. It's both a paean to and parody of movies from Hollywood's Golden Age. It's often fascinating and frequently hilarious. Performances and production values are uniformly excellent. It's a very intelligent film, meticulously researched, with humor that ranges from subtle and sophisticated to broad and burlesque.What it lacks are genuine highs and lows. A movie star is kidnapped, but is never in any real peril. An uneventful car chase ends without a confrontation. At several points, the film or a film within the film builds toward a climatic moment, only to have it deliberately subverted, usually for comic effect. The protagonist's day entails handling a series of disasters, but he handles them almost effortlessly due to his comprehensive understanding of the industry and his absolute authority and the disasters never really spiral out of control or build exponentially, as in some action and comedy films.It's a film that one could probably watch a dozen times and notice additional nuances with each viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Back to the old Hollywood,"'Hail Caesar!' it's a fun movie and also embraces old Hollywood. It's about putting in everything we know about Classic Hollywood in a single, hilarious film. It's not one of the best Coen brothers film, and is somewhat confusing, but funny. The Coens are just goofing around with this one well-made movie filled with amusingly stylized performances by famous actors that make that movie worth seeing. Despite how many problems I had with the film's inconsistent narrative, the directors still manage to make the overall experience quite entertaining. It's a different film from what we often see and worth our time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Soooooooooo Disappointed,"Let's start with the fact that I am a huge fan of the Cohen Brothers. I have seen all of their films in the theater, and I own a ton of their movies on Blu Ray. I also understand that they have an equally wide range of styles and genres in which they work as producers, writers, and directors.However, after watching the trailers, I assumed we were in for something similar to their brilliant ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?,"" that to this day, remains one of my favorite movies and soundtracks of all time.Nope. Not even close.I am not going to ""spoil"" anything here regarding plot lines, because the ""plot"" was so disjointed, random, and disconnected, that to imply that there was an actual plot would be misleading.You know you are in trouble when you have to rely on voice-over narration to try to hold something together. But even the narration seemed confusingly unhelpful. Three, or was it four, or maybe even five, sub-plots that had no real connection whatsoeverexcept that they were all set in the golden era of Hollywood.The irony of having the whole ""Commies in Hollywood"" bitespecially with the ridiculous submarine scenein the year the ""Trumbo"" was released, was just too much to handle. There was a perceptive groan in the audience...no laughs.This was, at best, an overblown, over-produced, over-cast mess.Someone in the audience behind us said, ""It's like they are trying to do homage to Wes Andersonbut don't seem to know what makes Wes Anderson movies work."" I couldn't agree more.The production value was entertaining in its bombastbut the cast was completely wasted on this.Sorry guysI'll remember you for Fargo, No Country for Old Men, Oh Brother, The Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, and even Barton Fink. But this one? I am going to do my best to forget this one altogether.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Lots of Levels,"This movie operates on a lot of different intellectual and historic levels - so it's going to fly right over the head of most people - who will be totally confused - and believe it's not them it's bad filmmaking. If you read - its a mess, it's confusing, etc. you know who is reviewing. It's a natural ""screening"" (no pun intended) movie. It also will not appeal to the all too common (no pun again) general emotionally hardened viewer who need blunt force violence, demeaning of self or others or shock to be entertained because they have lost all feeling. Its very subtle - very original - GREAT! - while not at the level of ""Dinner with Andre"" but close. Would LOVE to see a sequel to see what happens to these characters - because each one was terrific and I don't often feel that way - could they make it into a TV series to generate lots of episodes possibly.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar!","A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.Hail, Caesar! lines between drama and comedy get blurred, but so do the lines of what makes a good story. Coen Brothers celebrate the movies of this era and have some good-natured fun at the expense of the system that produced them. This film is full of real world specific references ranging across nearly 15 years, beginning with Capitol Pictures based openly on MGM in the 1940/50s. There's a lot of variety in the Coen's formula and an extremely wide range of tones. But all of their stories eventually come down to the question of whether the protagonists have any sort of personal moral compass, whether they follow it, and how the world punishes them if they stray from it. In a blind viewing, the average cinephile could probably identify this film as a Coen Brothers picture, because of their signature: serious people taking ridiculous situation gravely, straight-faced film references, several distractingly famous people taking on cameo-levels roles and George Clooney playing a dummy. The main theme is a man following his code, but also, the craziness of man, the nature of faith and the terror of trying to figure out what path through life is the correct one to take.This film showcases the greatest cast the Coens have ever assembled. Josh Brolin character is a fast, decisive thinker who doesn't examine his choices once he's made them; though he was really good, funny and likable as Eddie Mannix. Plus, a great performance comes from the 26-year-old Alden Ehrenreich, astonishingly good at playing a bad actor and surprisingly selfless. This film deals more directly with existential questions than most best-known feature films about filmmaking; about the frustrations of the business, most of them feature characters touching on the questions ""Why do I do this? Is it really possible to make art under these conditions? Am I selling out? Should I get out of this business while I can?"". While divided on these questions and the industry in-jokes are nearly always funny, this film is unabashedly in love with Hollywood and regards the 1950s studio system with the utmost scepticism even as it becomes an expression of movie love at its purest.Hail, Caesar! delights in the genuine magic of the old studio machine and it luxuriates in the details of this period. As ever it is the details that win us over. This is a very weird movie but in a good way because it's different. The cinematography by R.Dickens is beautiful. Coens Brothers craft seemingly grinds to an even sharper point of perfectionism and clarity than usual. The most sublime moments in the film occur when the behind the scenes machinery drops away, the films being produced become the film we're watching and we're invited to lose ourselves in a state of vintage Hollywood.Next to these gemlike moments - which the Coens very smart editors of their work as always, refuse to linger on - the story being told here all fades into insignificance : Baird's disappearance is resolve with little tension or surprise which leaves some narrative holes: it's rather an excuse to explore 1950s Hollywood than the other way around.Overall, Hail, Caesar! is a noising new testament to that old time religion known as the movies. This film is one of the Coen's most serious pictures as well as their silliest.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rather Disappointing,"I'm typically not very enthusiastic about the Coen brothers comedy movies, but I heard this one was about the shenanigans of the film industry in the early days, so I was modestly excited.So it's unfortunate that Hail Caesar is a bland, unfunny experience with only sporadic chuckles.The Coen's assembled an A-list cast for this outing: George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, etc. And outside of the main characters Brolin and Clooney play, everyone else feels...squandered. Wasted in over glorified cameos. Jonah Hill's only scene in the movie was featured in the trailer. And all other members of the cast are involved in plot lines not directly involved with the main story. Like what Family Guy goes with their non sequiturs.Scarlett Johansson is definitely the weakest link in the cast, donning a hokey and distracting New York accent as she goes about playing an actress who's pregnant during her movie's filming (oh, the irony). It just seemed like an unnecessary part of the film that could've easily gone without.Roger Deakins is once again behind the camera and once again delivers a stunning visual palate, but it doesn't do much to help the movie from feeling dull and overall a disappointing effort from the Coen's. Though it isn't on the level of disappointing as The Ladykillers, it is far, FAR from being on the level of Fargo and The Big Lebowski.Hai, Caesar! 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
An Enjoyable Mess,"The main plot of the movie reads as a day-in-the-life story of Eddie Mannix, head producer of Capitol Studios, as he has to deal with kidnapped actors, potential PR disasters, and unhappy arrangements. However the plot gets muddled when it decides to make a big deal of every sub- plot. Of course the biggest and most peculiar is the abduction of Baird Whitlock by a group of communist screenwriters. It holds the most meat of the movie, and yet doesn't feature into the day-in-the-life approach of Eddie Mannix. He's just simply not that bothered by it; ""Give him a day, he'll turn up"" Instead his side of the movie is padded out with the other sub-plots. Hobie Doyle is plucked from his lineless Westerns and assigned to a dialogue-driven period drama, DeeAnna Moran is dealing with a husband-less pregnancy that would look bad for the movie and the studio, and Thora and Thessaly Thacker compete for the latest exclusive in movie gossip. Mannix is the guy who ties these all together as he attempts to resolve them all (finding that, in the end, they all kind of solve themselves anyway).As with all of the Coen's movies, Hail, Caesar! does attempt some deeper meaning, although again like all of the Coen's movies, what exactly it's trying to say is buried deep beneath the bizarre and humorous story. It's most obvious angle, and also the principle supply of laughs, is the satire of the movie industry, particularly that of the 50s. It's riddled with movies-within- movies that riff on iconic stereotypes of Hollywood at that time; Westerns with silent protagonists, musicals with tap-dance scenes, religious epics with bombastic speeches, et al.Below that though is another theme, but if I'm honest, I'm not exactly set on what specifically the theme focuses on. On one hand it's about belief, as Eddie Mannix truly believes in the movies he's making, and that they matter, that the Thacker twins' audience will believe every bit of gossip they type up, Baird Whitlock succumbing to communist beliefs without too much of a struggle etc. On the other hand, this could all be seen as a riff on loyalty and authority; Mannix being loyal to his movies, his directors, his actors etc, Thacker twins being loyal to their audience in supplying them the gossip they desire, Hobie's loyalty to Mannix in tracking down the whereabouts of Baird etc. In truth it all comes off as unfocused. It definitely wants to say something, but the approach it takes muddles up the message on the way out.Comedy-wise, Hail, Caesar! isn't the Coen's funniest, but it doesn't completely flunk either. There were a number of jokes throughout the film that I did chuckle at, most notably the discussion amongst four religious figureheads is not only the film's high point, but also it's most amusing. They were so few and far between though that I can barely remember most of them, which isn't exactly promising.Acting was on top form from everyone. Josh Brolin's Mannix is a hard edge who's perpetually worried about doing the right thing and making the right choice. George Clooney's Whitlock is respectable and devoted to his job, but largely clueless to the real world around him. Alden Ehrenreich (who I found out today is the exact same age as me; born on the exact same day) was also pretty great as Hobie, who looks like a fish out of water on an indoors set, unable to speak his lines, and yet with a well-established idea of his place in the industry, doing as he's told, but smart enough to take his own initiative as well. Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Alison Pill, Clancy Brown, Wayne Knight, and Michael Gambon all make appearances of varying degrees, but none of which extensive enough to make any marked impression.Visually the movie is unsurprisingly beautiful watch. Hail, Caesar? Hail, Roger Deakins more like. There isn't really a lot I can say as Deakins' cinematography has yet to disappoint. He always makes the imagery in any movie he touches pop and stick in your mind's eye. In Hail, Caesar! he uses the subtle theme of movie vs reality and plays it up by making sure all the movie within a movie scenes don't look out of place, even when they have a cinema screen or camera viewfinder border. There's a couple of ""real world"" scenes that are produced as if they're part of a movie within the movie as well which cements the visual goal of blurring reality.As I said, the Coen brothers either make great movies or awful movies; movies that are tight and focused and know exactly what they want to be, or movies that meander around pointlessly with nothing particularly important to say. Hail, Caesar! falls in the latter category. It lacks focus, it's never quite sure what it wants to be or what it wants to say, and it's large cast and number of sub-plots just muddies the whole narrative, ensuring that no sub-plot and no character really gets the attention they deserve. It's not a complete Coenflunk though. It looks and sounds great, and it's revision of 50s Hollywood tropes and clichés is spot on. When it does take the time to be funny, it garners a few hearty laughs, and the running jokes are sublimely subtle in their delivery. With all that considered, I give Hail, Caesar! an enjoyable 7/10. It won't rock your world, but there are worse ways to waste an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'.,"It is easy to take Hail, Caesar! (2016) as just a thoroughly enjoyable lightweight comedy. But there is much more to this film if you understand the dark history of the Hollywood studio system of the 1920s – 1960s and its demise after a USA Supreme Court found that it breached competition law. The phrase 'genre factory' alludes to that era when big production companies owned permanent movie lots, actors, sets, distribution networks and even cinemas. In common use 'genre factory' is the opposite of 'art-house' and Hollywood has always been sensitive about its reputation for mass- produced formulaic movies while independent art-houses are credited for innovative aesthetic works. Read in this context, Hail, Caesar! steps back for a huge laugh at the studio system and its legacy.The storyline is based on a day in the life of a Hollywood executive, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) as he moves between scenes of various movies in production. Juggling several films at once, his job is to make sure that the big-name stars are happy and their public image remains wholesome. A staunch Catholic, he struggles with guilt over his promise to quit smoking and goes to confession every day. Across its sprawling film lots, we see scenes from a western, a period drama, a sailor dance/musical, a synchronised swimming spectacle, and the 'big' biblical epic Hail, Caesar! Things go awry when the epic's star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by a madcap group of disaffected scriptwriters and communists, a side-story that lampoons the Cold War communist peril depicted more seriously in Trumbo (2015). While sorting out the missing Whitlock, he also deals with the embarrassing pregnancy of his unmarried aquatic star whose swimming costume no longer fits; wards off irritating twin-sister gossip columnists who threaten scandal scoops; and mentors a hapless trick-riding Western star who must learn to speak in a drama film. It's a mashup style of pastiche comedy that both celebrates and mocks Hollywood genres and movie icons.This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'. The camera overhead and behind-the-scene shots on different sets is the Coen Brothers' way of self-reflectively reminding audiences of Hollywood's unbroken power to fabricate the illusions that are the very essence of the movie industry. Honest fixer Mannix symoblises the manic faith in schmaltzy escapism, the opiate for the masses, produced abundantly in the citadel of capitalism and so loved around the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Of course I should have remembered that not very often are movies with a large popular cast very good to begin with. That said, Hail Caesar had a few chuckle worthy moments, and was only slightly entertaining. Mostly though, there was too much going on that didn't seem to fit or make sense.

Hollywood Valentine bouquet looks pretty but eventually wilts.,"Hail, Caesar is a nostalgic tribute to Hollywood movie studios by the Coen brothers that follows a day in the life of famed Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin). Covering a myriad of both small and large problems from quitting smoking to saving careers from scandal Caesar is filled with wonderful set pieces, funny arch characters and incidentals but as a whole a scattered mess that doesn't deliver much of a story.Mannix's day begins rousting a movie siren from career disaster as he pays off cops and cuffs her a few times for her blundering. It's then off to confession where he is racked by lying to his wife about quitting smoking. Then it's a day of keeping religious leaders content, an aquatic star's pregnancy secret and gossip columnists at bay; mulling a job offer with Lockheed and paying off a cabal of commie writers who have kidnapped studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).Hail, Caesar has a buoyant Hollywood Confidential look that is rich in production design and well lensed by Coen regular Roger Deakins offering up some richly nourish compositions as well as flawless Busby Ballet and On the Town.. Like the rag it offers a variety of stories with characters that come across more as caricatures than real and it dilutes both tension and interest as Mannix moves from one fire to the next while attempting to avoid nicotine along the way.Brolin's brooding Mannix is spot on but his simmering intensity begs for a meatier plot with higher stakes. Ralph Fiennes and Scarlet Johannes are both broad and hilarious while Francis McDormand in a brief cameo as a film editor nearly steals the film in under two minutes as does Alan Ehrenreich in a lengthier piece as amiable singing cowboy Hobie Doyle. Did I also mention Tilda Swinton playing twin gossip columnists doing the same? Even with the surfeit of entertaining performances the story scatters and it is left up to fans and historians to drain a semblance of interest from the veiled and blatant references to Ester Williams, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Carmen Miranda, Loretta Young, George Cukor, Clark Gable while using using Paramount and Warner Studios as backdrops to the fictitious Capital Pictures in the film.With its sleek and colorful mid 20th century look, a half dozen fun performances and some outstanding choreography on land and water Hail, Caesar is filled with entertaining moments but is more a three ring circus than a cohesive story telling and it ultimately disappoints.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Cohn brothers film!,"Hail Caesar, I would say is clearly not a movie for everyone. I'm not sure who the demographic audience is. The Cohn brothers have always had a unique way of telling their story in films. Although, when done in the right way, it can be a good thing as some of there movies are quite clever. However I don't think this is one of them.A great cast, with the likes of Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, George Clooney, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum among others. Would lead you to think, this movie could be something special. Instead we are left bored through parts of this movie.Set in the 1950's, Josh Brolin plays Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood problem solver, who keeps the studio's stars in-line and keeps everything ticking over. Without Brolin's outstanding performance, this movie would have been awful. So much charisma and charm makes you continue watching, and although one or two funny moments in the movie.

Bad movie with some good acting,"Being a Cohen brothers fan for a very long time, I went to see the movie with certain expectations. None of them were fulfilled. Despite the fact that some parts (very few) are good, the final result is disappointing. It looks like they put in the blender some good and expensive fruits together with some rotten ones, without giving too much thought to the final result. It hasn't the usual flavor of a Cohen brothers movie. Some positive mentions: 1) Frances's part - exquisite, I believe she had the most fun and well played part. 2) Clooney and Brolin were OK most of the time. 3) Tatum's musical number was really well executed, but I can't say the same about Scarlet's part. And it is not necessarily her fault. Conclusion: a Cohen brothers movie without Cohens.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid comedy despite a rocky narrative.,"Hail, Caesar!' is the Coen Brothers latest comedy....satire....thing. These brothers have directed such masterpieces like, 'No Country For Old Men' and 'Fargo'. (I'll stop with these two because writing all their awesome movies out would take far to long.) With all their excellent films backing them up, it was pretty much impossible for me not to be pumped for this movie. Especially with a cast list like this, wow. And after seeing this film, my expectations have been met. Not exceeded but, simply, met. The best part of this movie is, for sure, the dialogue. The Coen Brothers have always been known for sharp, snappy banter that they can effortless form between characters. And they do a fine job of exactly that with 'Hail, Caesar!'. The conversations that form before our eyes don't just flow, they bounce. They move with just the right amount of energy to give these simple lines on a paper, some pep in their step. It's what they do best because they are the best at it.Their lines can transform an eh actor into a good actor. Because they've already done half of the actors job. All to often in films today we have great actors trying to make an awful script sound okay. Not this movie. 'Hail, Caesar!' has great actors and great dialogue. But the reason that it's so good is because it builds on itself. Each character genuinely feels like they are talking to each other as people. Using back and forth to construct a natural conversation.It sounds so simple but, for some odd reason, this has become all to rare in cinema today. And since the dialogue evolves in a natural way, the humor lands ninety percent of the time. Because it feels genuine. The humor in the movie never comes across limp or bored because it feels like the people in the movie actually mean it. Yes, I know we are only a month into 2016 right now but this will most likely stand as one of my favorite comedies of the year.All this is well and good, but a movie would be nothing without a story. While, the story it has is certainly unique, it really isn't that good. Like, at all. Here I would normally point out one or two particular problems with the story but I can't. I can't because everything about the story is bad. The pacing is uneven, the twists make no sense, and (to top everything off) the movie runs for about thirty minutes too long.Mainly thanks to A LOT of unnecessary fat. The film is obviously trying to be a clever satire of the film making business and it is, but it does way to much trying to be just that. It leaves in scenes that feel like they should've been saved and released with the DVD as deleted scenes. Each time one of these scenes crops up the films comes to an uncomfortable halt. Although, it's often difficult to notice these scenes because of how hilarious they end up being.The Coen Brothers film knowledge and consistent entertainment continues to impress me. Yet, much like a few of their other works, 'Hail, Caesar!' suffers from an unfocused and, frankly, quite a bland story. It's poorly paced and sometimes extremely stale. That being said, this is a fun film. The cast seems to be enjoying themselves quite a bit, having been given a great script to work with. That helps to make this a pretty enjoyable ride although very flawed ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

There were so many opportunities for action, drama or humour and there was just nothing. So it scores nothing Dialogue: I do hope that this was not ad-libbed. Because then I would have to say that the actors got it seriously wrong. Let's just assume it was a the corny dialogue that made most of the stars look like they were phoning it in using autocue. There was one scene with a minster, a bishop a rabbi and an orthodox priest. again a target rich environment for humour.. and it was just flat.If there was any clever word-play I missed it And that sums up the whole film. Great possibilities, under-par delivery. Disappointing",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A truly grand return,"I'm writing this review to all those Coen Bros fans that relish in the rollicking grand theater experience that only this dynamic duo can deliver. Go to the pictures, buy the popcorn and forget all your worries and bath in the warm ambiance of a delightful film. So much fun to be had. Clooney is having fun here and never misses a beat, in fact, all the players know the joke and weave a wonderful path to the punchline. I have read a lot of negative reviews for this film, so I felt compelled to respond with some due praise. Ummm, I still have to write 3 more lines to get this review acceptable for submission... 10 lines does seem a bit too much. I probably shouldn't bother considering I have offered no real insight or thoughtful critique... I just wanted to say how good it was, no-one wants to read that rubbish.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail No This is F***ing bad,This movie is just a terrible movie. Let me first get this out there this movie is F***ing bad. The movie was sold-out and over half of the theater left and on top of that people fell asleep. This supposed of been a comedy there was nothing funny about this.George Clooney has made to bad films in a row Tomorrowland and Hail Caser. Unless you want to be stupid and waste your money don't go see this trash.This has been the worst movie of the year so far. The best part of this movie was when it was over. If you like a boring film then this is the movie for u but not for anyonelse,1.0,Anonymous,Music
Irrational exuberance,"When Alan Greenspan warned against irrational exuberance, back in '96, he was talking about the stock market. But the Coen Brothers could use the same warning. Their best films are brilliant in their simplicity. Examples: Blood Simple, Fargo, Barton Fink. The story can be summarized in a few lines, there are relatively few characters, and the cinematography is sober.'Hail, Caesar' is the complete opposite. It has an intricate story with lots of different characters. The cinematography is exuberant and sumptuous. But the result is disappointing. The deadpan jokes, the sharp edged dialogue, the mildly bizarre characters that make other Coen movies so entertaining, have made way for slapstick humor and outrageous scenes.The film is a work of skill, because the Coen Brothers are expert film makers. And the actors are good, although most have little screen time and some are overdoing it. But the film is not extremely funny, neither particularly exciting. The pastiches of classic Hollywood scenes are the best parts, but the story about a Hollywood troubleshooter running from one disaster to the other feels as if the brothers have put too many ideas and characters into a single movie.It's not the first time the Coen Brothers poke fun at Hollywood. They did the same thing when they made Barton Fink. But that film was infinitely more intelligent, funny and entertaining than this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Once upon a time the king Julius Caesar was kidnapped!,"So here's the new film from the Coen brothers. They have become rare in the recent years, I was always checking out what's next for them and now I'm slightly disappointed with this. I enjoyed watching it, it is one of those you want to rate them better, but you can't for some unidentified reasons. According to my analysis why I was not satisfied fully is the story. I mean the narration was rich, performances were phenomenal and music, locations, all were fantastic, but the screenplay was kind of aimless. The beginning, the ending or even in the mid part it had no purpose, but something like a mockumentary about the film industry of the 1950s.With the average screenplay, the directors have shown their magic. Very cool presentation, you would enjoy it if you're theirs films fan. But I don't think all his fans would be pleased enough. This is truly a multi-starrer film, everybody was at their best in their retro characters. If you share your experience with others who also saw it, they might ask who do you liked the most. Probably many would favour Josh Brolin, because he had more priority than others who comes under his belt. But George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich also have given a good show followed by Scarlett Johansso and Tilda Swinton. The remaining ones as well not bad, but Jonah Hill was completely a waste.Since it is about the film industry and its people, brace yourself for some good laughs. There is variety in it like different genre/theme and multiple layers in the narration. Like from moving to the western to the historical subject and then to the musical and many more. It did good at the box office against its budget, only because of the star power it has and the filmmaker's reputation came in handy. Though I hope the Coen brothers would come back strong with another product and it does not take another 3 years. It is not an award winning film, just a good entertainer, but praisable quality.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Almost Walked out of Theater,"Yesterday we saw this film at Studio Movie Grill in Rocklin. This year we have been to quite a few movies and based on the trailer, we thought this one looked like it would be funny. Boy were we wrong! It was a complete waste of our money. The trailer has the only funny scenes in the entire movie. We love SMG, but not that movie. Save your money and go see 13 hours or the Finest Hour or even Star Wars for that matter! All of those are far more entertaining. This movie was boring to say the least. We almost walked out, and we have never done that before. The only thing I can honestly say is that it did have a lot of famous stars in it. These are stars that normally have good movies too. That is why this movie was such a disappointment!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious,"Funny. If you're familiar with the old 1940s studio days and the stable of stars, gofers and fixers, you'll find this hilarious. The Coen brothers do not aim for the center of the bell curve. The jerky review about ""people walking with their feet"" makes this point indeed. The jamoke writing this terrible review neither understood the film, the innsy humor or the historical tie-ins and took everything at face value. A lot of the audience did the same thing in No Country for Old Men, leaving the theater grumbling, ""That was no ending.""Ah, but it was! And so is this film. American cinema is the great contribution to the art world and there is so much witty business and satire tied in this film that, like The Big Lebowski, I could watch it a dozen times and still come home with some witty little pearl.OK. The Coen brothers approach Cinema-making as an art. Ethan Coen read Wittgenstein in college and you won't really appreciate the depth of their art unless you take the effort to see the integration of structuralism, neomodernism and the wit of the traditional Yiddish Theater which gave birth to the Marx and the Ritz brothers.Don't take my word for it. Go see it for yourself. It's a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Left me flat at first,"Watching it for the first time on DVD, it left me flat at first. As one who enjoys inside Hollywood humor, there were a number of laughs, but not as many as I expected. Then after thinking it over and watching some of the bonus features, a new view came to mind. Eddie Mannix, as played by Brolin, comes across much more sympathetic that one would think, given his reputation as a ruthless fixer at MGM, which had two goals - make tons of money, and look wholesome while doing it. Studios needed people like Mannix, because the talent end of the movie business has been the same from the days of Chaplin to now - a great number of spoiled, petulant children who can't seem to control themselves or their egos. If there wasn't someone like a Mannix keeping the stars in the studio daycare in line and protected, it would be an absolute miracle anything actually got done. True, Mannix appeared to have some affection for the stars he had to occasionally put the thumbscrews to, but his overall loyalty was to the dollars and cents and the protection of his bosses. They trusted him to get things done, and he did it. He's the man who helped protect the images we looked up to. By looking only at the excellent re-creations of classic Hollywood genres, one could miss the story of how Mannix was responsible for keeping everything going. If the movie was called ""The Fixer"", and we had a few more scenes indicating the pressure the owners in New York put him under, it might have been clearer that this was a film about who had the power in Hollywood. Not so much the stars, but the owners and their muscle men. At least the Mannix played by Brolin appeared to have some personal struggles with what he had to do. Not too bad a film if you watch it that way.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolute garbage...POSSIBLE SPOILER,"I'm not a huge Coen brothers film by any stretch although admittedly I did like"" Fargo"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" but the simple fact is that 'Hail Caesar' is nothing more than muddled mess with absolutely no story line whatsoever.What exactly was the point here of Whitlock's kidnapping? Same goes for a slut movie actress played by Scarlett Johansson getting pregnant and needing to 'find a husband'? Then of course there is Channing Tatum's being an alleged Communist and escaping back to the Soviet Union about a nuclear submarine??? All of this may appear to be spoilers but the fact is that the script is disjointed and frankly stupid when in point of a fact a parody of 1950's Hollywood could've been done SO much better. When you look at the talent in this film I think many of these actors want to be in a Coen brothers movie because they sense there is some prestige in it but overall many of them played the equivalent of cameo roles compared to Clooney and Brolin who the film is really centered around.What is truly laughable is that people thought this was Academy Award material this year or even next and the fact is it's more fitting of a Razzie Award than anything else.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good does not equal ""edgy""","I watched the film without reading anything about it beforehand, with a smile on my face; then red the reviews. The reviews were very disappointing. It was very nice tribute to all those movies I watched as a kid. It was like visiting movie moments, back to back. It gave the atmosphere of the time, without taking any side or being heavy handed about it. I am sure all those reviewers who criticized the film ""loooved"" Kill Bill movies,which were hailed as a tribute to a genre. So if you idolize horrible movies with a lot of blood, it is OK. But if you do it with another aspect of movie history, it is blah. Maybe they should have ""satirically"" cut some heads, to be ""edgy"".",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Reasonably amusing satire on the studio system via The Cohens.,"The studio system is given a rough ride as we follow the exploits of studio head Brolin putting out fires, massaging the press, and pushing the newest stars on unwilling directors. Great turn by Ralph Fiennes as snooty Laurence Laurents. Fans of any genere of the 50s will find something to like here. The emerging Communist sympathies that came after WW2 are examined as well. As a group of Soviet akin movie writers kidnap an unwitting Hollywood star in George Clooney and try to brain wash him in Communist doctrine. There's a hilarious parody of an Esther Williams musical swimming sequence. Featuring a fantastic Scarlett Johannson as a gloriously foul mouthed Hollywood mermaid. The movie is more hits than misses. But if you don't know the reference points you'll hate it . Plus Clooney is terrible in the lead with his , "" look ma ain't I funny?"" mugging which brings the movie down at least 1 star.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
6.5/10,"Despite being, admittedly, not a fan of the Coens, I was still really excited for this film, just by looking at the cast. Add that I have always been fascinated with movies on Hollywood, from ""The Player"" to ""Mullholland Drive"", I have loved so many of them for the most various reasons, yet unfortunately ""Hail, Ceasar"" is a slight disappointment even if in its own right it s a very fine film.Where it fails is in figuring out what it is. It has a very messy tone and ever messier story lines and their coherence to this story is always questionable. Way to many times a scene passes by, which is perfectly fine and entertaining, yet as soon as it has gone by you wonder what was the point of it and why was it in the film, and more often than not you aren't given answers, it was just a fun scene.Moreover, there simply isn't any really interesting hook or character to stick with. The stakes always seem so low and uninteresting. The whole film is strikingly void of any subtext and that seems surreal when talking about a Hollywood picture about Hollywood. When the film ended I kind of got its basic message, but I was left pretty empty handed for the rest. If only it was funny as it thought it was I am sure there would have been loads to dig into, but the whole comedic aspect of the film is undermined by distant characters and a lack of edge and nastiness.Still, there is plenty to be enjoyed in the throwback. As much as its satire may be almost absent, there's lots of light irony in it that is loads of fun. Josh Brolin is terrific and is given the most interesting character of them all. All of the cameos aren't really that distracting, instead they are quite fittingly integrated even if Jonah Hill was criminally underused in a role that was perfect for him and he managed to nail in what is probably sixty seconds of screen time. The love letter to the Hollywood of the '50s really works despite everything around it, as a film fan it was quite a delight even if it wasn't as delightful as it should have been. Deakins nails another one here and his work here is pretty understated even if it is one of the best parts of the picture.If you're a film fan and a true lover of the classic Hollywood, as me, you will find it hard to dismiss the film overall and you will find some fun to be had even if you will be definitely yearning for much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Lower-league Coen,"When a film-maker builds up such a formidable body of work, it's all the more crushing when their next project falls somewhat flat. The Coen brothers Joel and Ethan have been churning out genre-bending masterpieces ever since 1984 with Blood Simple, and maintained a healthy independent spirit until they were eventually noticed by mainstream Hollywood with 1996's Fargo. Ever since, despite still serving up great work such as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), their filmography has been occasionally blighted by bewildering misfires such as the double-whammy of Intolerable Cruelty (2003) and The Ladykillers (2004). Sadly, they've done it again with Hail, Caesar!.It's obvious that the Coens hold a keen interest in the old Hollywood system of the 1940's and 50's. They were satirising the world they view with a certain curiosity and perhaps a little disdain back in 1991 with the outstanding Barton Fink. Yet while that film portrayed a bleak, subdued world full of madness and loneliness as John Turturro's titular script-writer struggled with his work and his own demons, Hail, Caesar! is the glitzy, garish world of big-budget biblical epics and movie stars with everything to hide. Studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the man to try and hold it all together, from having to shield his actors' shady pasts from pesky twin journalists Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both Tilda Swinton) to handling an organisation of academic-type communists who have kidnapped his biggest star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney).Working almost like a series of loosely-connected vignettes, the Coens also weave numerous sub-plots into the mix. Mannix must also deal with the issue that one of his leading ladies, DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johnansson) is unmarried but with child and can no longer fit into her mermaid costume. Singing cowboy actor Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a pretty face more accustomed to strumming the guitar and riding horseback, is thrown into a drama role at the last minute, much to the frustration of sophisticated director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). There are smaller roles also for Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand and Jonah Hill in what is an unnecessarily bulky ensemble that the Coens struggle to keep a grasp of. With no real sense of direction, Hail, Caesar! often feels like a collection of clips from separate, better movies.Despite the narrative flaws, there's still plenty to savour. Those distinctly 'Coen-eque' moments are peppered throughout, with Hobie's awkward first day on set and Channing Tatum's musical tap-dance being particular standouts. Although Brolin excels and Clooney makes for a very convincing wimp, Ehrenreich is the one who steals the movie as the extremely likable dimwit who may actually be the only one paying attention. He demonstrates great comic timing and all the charm of the western idols his character is paying homage to, and he seems the perfect fit for a young Han Solo in Disney's as-yet untitled origin story. The film may have even worked better as a whole with Hobie as the lead and doing away with several side- stories. Instead, it is an unfocused splurge of good ideas rather toothlessly executed but wonderfully performed. Definitely lower- league Coen.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Another quirky hit from the Coen brothers,"First and foremost if you haven't seen any Coen brothers movies I would highly recommend watching at least one before this so you know what you're getting into! I feel like this movie is going to get a lot of negativity because: A) It came out in February so people assume it will be bad. B) People aren't expecting what the Coen Brothers do best: Quirky Comedy. I was really surprised at how interesting this movie was, there so many small characters that I absolutely loved, and I wanted to see more of, the movie is only like 104 minutes, and I honestly wouldve liked it to have been longer, which is why I cant give it a 10/10. Anyway this is a great movie to see (especially in February) and there's so many funny scenes that the Coen brothers brilliantly wrote.Im giving this film: 8.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Simple pleasure,"A basic concept executed perfectly by talented director's the Coen's imagine a brilliant action packed world in 'Hail, Caesar!' Feeling constantly shifting and lively this allows the brothers to flex their style and show the brilliance the two are capable of with ease its brilliant.

Second time was the charm,"Loved watching this movie better the 2nd time to be able to keep up with all the characters and sub plots. All the scenes held my attention and the attention to detail on this movie was just crazy. Every featured actor was fantastic. A bundle of very different characters mashed up in Hollywood with all types of different aspirations.I saw this move when it first came out and thought it was just a good Coen brothers movie. I stumbled on YouTube clips last night and stated watching. There were 10 or so clips and what I noticed was each clip of different scenes would all have the same ""best part or scene in the movie"" in the comment section. It was like watching 10 shot movies with different actors knocking it out of the park. I get that plot and story flow are a big deal for some people and this movie can seem like many fragments scattered where the viewer is trying to figure out what's going on. All I can say is watch it one more time. What seemed like good fragments comes together to make what think is my favorite Coen brothers movie.PS. Eschelon's Song by The Red Army Choir is probably the best closing credit song ever and if you don't choose to watch the movie at least YouTube this song for serious inspiration.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
OK - just not too much substance,"The premise for 'Hail, Caesar!' sounds more ""meta"" than it is - a film studio in the 1950's making a Roman/Jesus epic called 'Hail Caesar' and starring Whitlock (Clooney), the biggest Hollywood star. The film works as a tribute to classic movie-making, with Brolin playing Mannix, the head of ""Capitol Studios"", trying to keep his sometime wayward stars in check.The film nails the choreography and massive scale the soundstages had, especially with Johansson's mermaid scene and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor scene. Surprise - he can also sing! Probably the funniest moment is new guy Doyle (Ehrenreich)'s cowboy scene and stunts. Unfortunately, there's no real plot other than Clooney getting kidnapped by kind Communists - doesn't really go anywhere.Fiennes, Johansson, Hill, Tatum & McDormand all don't have enough screen time. The score is good and there's some jokes, although most of them are more like a sly wink to the audience - definitely not the Coen's best work! The score's good and Clooney and Tatum both ham it up, but I definitely felt underwhelmed afterwards.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oy, Caesar...","""Hail, Caesar!"" was one of the most anticipated movies of 2016 and one of the earliest releases. Being the last Coen brothers' movie made it an event by itself and probably one of the first expected Oscar contenders. Well, are you surprised that it only got a (lousy) Production Design nomination? I am not. Because... let's not kid ourselves; we all know the movie that marked the beginning of 2016 was ""Deadpool"". Sure it is less artsy and subtle than the more gourmet offering of the Coens but the film had the merit to feature a consistent plot, hilarious gags and without trying to be too smart, showcased a level of hip wit and self-deriding fun that ""Heal Seizure!"" failed to deliver. And I'm the first to deplore it.I know these two movies are as close one another as Meryl Streep to a Michael Bay's script, but they have one thing in common that justify the comparison, they're meant to be fun and they rely on parody. The parody is the key because it works on a material we're all familiar with but then distorts it in order to produce gags based on unpredictability. The trick is to not to rely too much on the spoofed material because not every audience would get the references or because the film serves the references, not the opposite. I'm more familiar with Hollywood history than comic-books heroes, yet I enjoyed ""Deadpool"" more than ""Give'em Hell, Caesar!"", I know it has everything a movie lover should love, it is a love letter to Hollywood, not without that ounce of wicked wit the Coen brothers made a specialty of. This is a film I wanted to embrace with my arms wide open, I love the brothers' movies and a film about Hollywood is the kind of offer I couldn't refuse. But this is 2016, we had ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Chicago"" and ""The Artist"", then ""Argo"" and ""Birdman"", movies about old-school Hollywood have flourished like cactus in the desert. I even started to reconsider my love for these films because of the way they started a tiresome trend but again, this is a Coens' movie so it's always new even by the standards they create. I saw the film once, I had to see it twice, and then even a third time.Indeed, if it came from any other director, I would have thrown it already in the trashcan of my contempt but the Coens always get the benefit of the doubt. So how does ""Hell or High Caesar!"" hold up after the third viewing? Well, maybe better than at the first but that's not saying much. The premise is simply brilliant, having a Hollywood office worker whose specialty is to fix things (he's not called a fixer for nothing), and played by the always convincing Josh Brolin made me feel like I was going to penetrate an atmospheric neo-noir masterpiece like ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Then the movie cuts to the titular film-within-the-film, a Tale of the Christ where George Clooney, playing a washed-up version of Robert Taylor in ""Quo Vadis"", is kidnapped.But by the time we get the identity of the kidnappers, and their political inclinations, the film features a collection of old-school Hollywood pastiches with an Esther-Williams actress played by Scarlett Johannsen in a Ziegfeld Follies act, a Western B-movie actor who's probably a reference to... some B-movie actor and a few other musical numbers. To get things straight, they're all well done, but they don't add anything to the plot except for just being well done, they drag on for so long I suspected they were used as time fillers. Some parts were hilarious though, I loved the scene with Fiennes as a Polish director or where Eddie Mannix talk with the religious representatives and they go into a debate about God. God, that was pure Coen brothers' genius.But despite the obvious effort to cover all the elements that made the history of Hollywood in the 50's, the Hayes codes, stars' depraved lifestyles, the Red Scare, ""Excelsior"" might be just a tad too sophisticated for its own good. It is probably an intelligent movie in its stylish complexity but it commits a rather silly move by predicting our instant praise on the simple basis that it's about movies. Well, the stunt seemed to have worked with critics as the film but it didn't show with the audience and many viewers dismissed it as the worst Coen brothers' film. Would I? Well, forgetting the premise and some hilarious parts, it is probably the worst in the sense that it simply used Hollywood as a vehicle for gags, but they never made you feel you that it was going somewhere, ""meh"" was my most frequently obtained reaction.I felt some strong Woody Allen vibes from it, from the stellar cast (also including Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill or Tilda Swinton as the two gossip columnists, twin sisters embodying the Hedda Hopper/ Louella Parsons rivalry) the film might have worked better had it played like Woody Allen's masterpiece ""Radio Days"". The film could have been a ""Hollywood Days"" with many little vignettes and that would have forced the Coens to push the concept a little higher, to make each one as enjoyable and entertaining as the whole of the film. Or maybe they should have just tried to forget about the whole homage thing because the film was never as funny as when it took departure from its Hollywood shtick.Now, to end on a positive note, if you love Hollywood and appreciate a good love letter with all the archetypes that forged Hollywood legend, just watch the magnificent five-minute dream sequence of ""The Ballad of the Daltons"". As for this film, well you might give Caesar what is Caesar's, but there's not much to give.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

It seems to have everything going for it but just can't quite place what's missing,"The Coen brothers have been quite successful when switching to different genres by infusing a unique narrative style and their trademark quirky humor. Going by their filmography, the movies that are most likely to succeed in terms of box office performance or connect with the audience are the ones which has either a wow or a shock factor which are sorely missing in Hail! Caeser.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a veteran in studio business who takes his work very seriously. When the star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) goes missing from the sets of 'Hail! Caesar' (which is based on crucifixion of Jesus Christ through the eyes of a Roman soldier Autolycus), Eddie has to think on his feet to fix the situation. Between a lucrative job offer from Lockheed Martin, solving issues between a star and a director, fixing a PR issue of a star actress and dodging the media regarding a certain story, Eddie is pushed to corner to bring things under control.Romancing the yesteryear Hollywood has been the calling for many filmmakers in the past including the Coen Brothers (Barton Fink), probably because one can spin exotic stories based on hot-headed and impossible to handle stars, executives with iron fists, limited exposure to media etc. as the corporate culture, social media and presence of mobile phones could have watered down many potential plots if set in contemporary times. While some have fared well, others have ended in disasters.To give credit to the Coen brothers - the screenplay was well structured with enough entertaining moments. Their influence probably would have played the antagonist here with many writers and directors taking a similar approach of quirky humor which eventually sets the bar higher and pushing them to redefine themselves. The cameos are not worthy, the actors seemed a little disinterested, the plot neither hurries nor sets you up for a climax when featuring a plot about an abduction of a movie story. However the ever dependable Josh Brolin and the newbie Alden Ehrenreich playing Hobie Doyle are a refreshing contrast to the rest of the movie. The period inspired communist conspiracy angles, casting couches, tantrum throwing heroines, gossip column peddlers are all used to good advantage.It seems to have everything going for it but just can't quite place what's missing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't work as comedy or satire,"This takes place at the fictitious Capital Studios in Hollywood in the 1950s. A studio fixer (Josh Brolin) has his hands full. Their main star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped, cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) has been cast in a serious drama and is driving his director (Ralph Fiennes) crazy, actress DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant...and not married and communists appear to be trying to take over.This movie is all over the place. I'm still not sure if it's meant to be a comedy or a satire. As a comedy it fails. A few of the lines are good but the humor is more clever than funny. As a satire it also fails. It's not biting enough to succeed. On the plus side it LOOKS good. The colors are strong and bright and the 1950s are recreated perfectly. All the acting is good too--especially by Brolin. There's also a long song and dance number that stops the movie. It has Channing Tatum and a bunch of guys dressed as sailors tap-dancing and singing (badly) and dancing. It's also VERY homoerotic. It has nothing to do with anything else in the movie but I'm not going to complain. All in all I didn't hate the movie but I spent the whole running time trying to get a grasp on what exactly this film was trying to accomplish.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"'He didn't see a Roman or a Slave, but a man.'","The words above come from George Clooney's character Baird Whitlock (as Caesar) as he finally stands at the foot of the movie lot cross and attempts to deliver a message that gives the movie meaning. But the movie really doesn't have meaning – it is pure entertainment, compliments of the Coen Brothers. And that is why the pseudo-serious phrase is funny.To keep the scenario short, 'Hail Caesar! follows a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Pictures in the 1950s, who cleans up and solves problems for big names and stars in the industry. But when studio star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) disappears, Mannix has to deal with more than just the fix. Add to this the stereotype films of the 40s and 50s – romances in elegant settings, Bible epics, Esther Williams underwater ballets, Hopalong Cassidy (and all Western) movies, Gene Kelley type dance movies - and movie lots with all manner of shenanigans (star turns, temperamental stars, cowboys who become romance boys because they are 'needed', intrigue, influence of the Communist party aka blacklist, etc) and you get an idea of the fun of the spoof.The major star turn here is Josh Brolin who manages a role that is equal parts tough and likable and funny. He is aided by such stars as George Clooney (of course), Scarlett Johansson, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, and the team of 'Future Men' (the communist circle who are out to destroy capitalism – with a little help from the inside).The film is Coen Brothers fun, not to be taken too seriously but appreciated for its parody of the Holly wood of the 40s and 50s. Kick back and just laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
diluted Coen brothers,"A few weeks back I wrote about Bridge of Spies and I was mentioning the fact that I expected more than an OK+ story about the Cold War from a script written by the Joel and Ethan Coen brothers. This feeling was now enhanced by viewing Hail, Ceasar!. The trailer was so promising - the anti-establishment brothers made a film about the Hollywood. George Clooney as the drunken (not even, actually) star in the historic super-production. Scarlett Johansson as the blonde brainless starlet. The bigger the expectations, the deeper the disappointment, they say. The brothers seem to have ran out almost completely of ideas and spices.Hollywood loves making fun of itself, but never forgets to mix a dose of nostalgia. This is what made The Artist such a huge success, plus of course the French charm. It's 2016 however, and nostalgia should not be consumed in overwhelming doses. Yet, the Coen brothers seem almost to crawl in repentance to the big studios they succeeded to teach in the past a few things about digging for gold in the classical fabric of American stories. There is only one scene where the Coen spin and spirit succeed to remind the good old days - that's the 'ecumenical' discussion in preparation of the Christ movie with the participation of Catholic, Easter-Orthodox and Protestant priests plus one rabbi. It looked and sounded like a good joke. The difference is that we used to have ten or more such good jokes in the Coen brothers films, now it was just one. The social content which is also present in many of their films is now reduced to a parody of the black-listing of the 50s combined with an incarnation of Communist hysteria (in a Malibu villa by the ocean of all places) which is maybe the second good joke in the film. Still insufficient.In a season that was so deprived of comedies that The Martian got a nomination in the category at the Golden Globes, Hail, Ceasar! is still the funniest show in town, but it's more by lack of competition. George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson looked genuinely bored in a film which should have been fun to make. Josh Brolin is no comedy actor. The ones lucky to get more interesting parts are the amazing Tilda Swinton, and Ralph Fiennes who left me with the dilemma of guessing which film director he took revenge upon when building his character.I am waiting for the Coen brothers to return.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Messy,"Hail, Caesar is a comedy about a studio boss who works to resolve a kidnapping of a movie star. This film is fun, but it's an absolute mess. There were many elements that were downright confusing. Not to mention several stupid plot points and unnecessary scenes. It was very hard to keep up and understand what was happening due to the mess that is this film. Also, the characters were poorly written and weren't flushed out well. This film is a comedy and didn't deliver as much as it should've in that category. There were a lot of jokes that didn't land, it was really funny at times, but it could've been better in that aspect. Visually and direction wise it was very good and I like the concept, there were some good scenes, but that's really the best I can say. This film is okay, but it's just a mess. I wouldn't watch it again. I rate Hail, Caesar a 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not the best Coen brothers ever, but still enjoyable","The Coen brothers transcend genre, from noir to thriller to dark comedy, they can nail it. But I particularly enjoy their takes on farce (especially when George Clooney is involved). This movie is not perfect, but I laughed out loud throughout, particularly when everyone embraced the silliness of the story as part of the whole point. It may not be the Coen brothers' best ever, but it doesn't have to be to be enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Coens are still sharp and smart, but 'Hail, Caesar!' isn't quite engaging enough","In tackling Hollywood's Golden Age, the Coen Brothers have made their glitziest film to date in ""Hail, Caesar!,"" but a couple musical numbers featuring Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson are just the commercial selling points of what is actually another off- beat yet deeply philosophical film from the duo.As such, it's easy to see why ""Hail, Caesar!"" could be viewed as misleading when it turns out not to be the uproarious comedy suggested by the premise of a Hollywood studio fixer whose big movie star is kidnapped by a group called ""The Future."" The first clue of this marketing misdirection is the film's stark opening shot on a sculpture of Christ on the crucifix, followed by our discovery that the big Capitol Pictures epic feature film at the center of this movie is actual called ""Hail, Casear!"" with the subtitle ""A Tale of the Christ.""The religious imagery makes for an interesting contrast with the film's plot. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the man who makes Capitol Pictures' problems go away. A last-minute star is needed for a high society Broadway adaptation? He ropes in Western star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) and makes it work. Johansson's DeeAnna Moran is pregnant out of wedlock? He has a plan to make the child legitimate. ""Hail, Caesar!"" star Baird Whitlock's (George Clooney) disappearance, however, calls for more desperate measures.This story plays out as more of a ""week in the life"" portrait of Mannix with some diversions into these other films, like a hilarious scene in which Doyle, a southern boy lacking sophistication, works with director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) on his lines, or a musical number with sailors with not so subtle homo-erotic undertones. Yet this gives the story (and consequently the viewer) problems staying focused. The narrative thread just isn't as tight or compelling as in other Coen films. Even the ending comes as a surprise, in terms of timing, because we never get a sense of the story's arc.The thematic threads, however, are as sharp and intriguing as ever. In addition the lens of faith being applied to the film from the get- go, the Coens bring in a Communist element in the form of Whitlock's captors, who criticize the old Hollywood studio hierarchy, which of course has a lot of modern-day relevance in both the movie industry and in greater society. The Coens suggest that big movie studios are a microcosm of other hierarchies (including religious ones) and highlight the complex relationship between the large entity that makes everything possible, and the talents of the individuals that it comprises.That makes ""Hail, Caesar!"" another great Coen film to use in teaching a film class, but doesn't make it among their best films, at least not when you consider all the trappings (i.e. big-name stars and musical numbers) that would lead you to believe it should be among their most entertaining works.~Steven CThanks for reading!

And this would be a comedy because...?,"The Coen Brothers have produced some moments of comedy gold over their careers. This film will not join their list of successes.Why? Because this film is poor. It lures you in with a glorious cast, who should be brilliant in this, and then it repeatedly disappoints. Scene after scene of I'm sure 'hilarious moments' on paper, that end up being naff.Channing Tatum and Scarlet Johansson aside this is a silly film, that doesn't know if it's trying to make a point about life/Hollywood or religion or not. In the end it does none of the above.I cannot recommend this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
This movie was sheer joy for me,"The last time I was as unexpectedly elated was years ago with the first Alien film, a much different film. This film is a light-hearted homage to the old studio system which was far less innocent than depicted here. But there are no sordid casting couches at this studio and no one is hoping for a part, they're already the stars.And that allows the Coen brothers to have some good clean fun with the period and the kind of characters that inhabited the era. Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich and Scarlett Johansson all do a great job channeling the wise-cracking Hollywood sorts common to the 40's and 50's. Tilda Swinton and George Clooney do much the same; I particularly enjoyed Tilda's take on a gossip columnist. Clooney's part seemed a little overdrawn but appropriate.The Coens reproduce several of the kinds of scenes typical of the period and it's a delight to see them done by actors like Channing Tatum. His dance number is impeccable and as someone who really disliked that sort of thing back when I was a kid, I was amazed at how I felt seeing it now. It was as if these people were showing that era that we could do it too and I could have stood up and clapped it was so good.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An over-sophisticated movie about making movies,"From time to time, movies like this are made, by talented directors- producers and including talented actors. They are dealing with their love and daily grind - cinema - with lots of inside jokes and scenes fully understood by thousands, yet uninviting to millions.Hail, Ceasar! is a fine example of similar movie, and all the people I know who have seen it said that they managed to ""pass through it"" by focusing on characters only, being surprised how the Coens can convince many Oscar winners and nominees to perform so small and weird parts. Yes, there are some witty-funny dialogues and characters, but the Communist line is too much and excessive even for the Coens...To me, it is the most uninteresting Coen-movie I have seen; well, I can't say it's bad - 7 points for strong cast and characters with ""touch"", but the era and the environment did not come up to me as expected. Luckily, unlike most Coen-movies, it lasted 1.5 hours only, so I was committed to watch it until credentials appeared.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hipsters, flipsters, finger-popping' daddies!","Before the film started, I was subject to a series of trailers for films such as ""The Boss"" and ""Neighbors 2,"" which are both R-rated comedies with PG humor. Either the studios are really stupid, making films that contradict themselves, or really smart and understand the limited intellectual capacity of their modern adult audiences (it's the latter). ""Hail, Caesar!,"" rated PG-13, is what an adult comedy looks like, as it spotlights--as all Coen films do--the absurd whipping post of life, with which the cries of pain from every bloody crack of the whip turn steadily to laughter with time.The heart behind the film's many flailing arms is Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Mannix is the night watchman in the flamboyant insane asylum of Hollywood, dusting deviance under the couch to maintain the innocent image of the stars. The other two big players are Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), an airheaded household-name, and Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich), a simple-minded singing cowboy. Whitlock is kidnapped by a group of men of who talk a lot about book a called ""Capital,"" only it's spelled with a ""K,"" and Mannix must fetch him before the tabloids smell story.The Coens are able to tap into the white noise of comedy, creating laughs from seemingly non-jokes. But at the same time, they don't forsake the classic ""set-up, punchline"" formula. For example, there's an incredible scene involving a meeting that Mannix has called, which involves a Protestant, a Catholic, an Eastern Orthodox and a Rabbi, all in order to get their blessing for a ""Ben-Hur""- esque film. There's a clear joke that the scene ends on--the Jewish guy has an opinion for everything but the thing that matters--but more than that, there's a religious satire, in that nearly every question asked of the clergyman receives a ""yes and no"" response. The Coens are masters of gags within larger gags within larger gags. And of course, there's no shortage of prolonged awkward silences and dumb faces, trademarks of any Coen film.Despite the film's marketing, Mannix is the focus and to a lesser extent, Whitlock and Doyle. For the most part, Clooney's restricted to funny faces, though he nails the scene where he's relating everything he's learned from the Communists to Mannix, like a child eagerly telling his father what he's learned at school that day. Ehrenreich stands out as the Roy Rogers-like Doyle, especially in a scene involving a spaghetti lasso, reminiscent of Chaplin's bread roll dance.Each of the other headliners get a one-joke character, which would be worse if the jokes didn't work, or if more weight were put on them. Ralph Fiennes plays a pretentious, English director, Laurence Laurentz, a man of dual-pronunciations. Scarlett Johansson is DeeAnna Moran, a chain-smoking, man-eater in reality; a naive, angelic blonde on the silver screen. Channing Tatum is Burt Gerney, a player in a homoerotic musical, who just so happens to be--in a delightfully insane reveal--the realization of 'McCarthyism paranoia.Mannix, however, doesn't seem to be in a zany comedy. He feels more like something out of ""Barton Fink,"" ""A Serious Man,"" or ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" Like the main characters of those films, Mannix is miserable, but--unlike those characters--he learns to love the misery, seeing it as a side-effect of doing something worthwhile, rather than unjustified punishment.""Is it wrong to do the easy thing?"" Mannix asks a priest. To Mannix, the answer is yes. To the priest, the answer is yes and no. To me, the answer is yes; keep making movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar! (2016)","Directed by Joel & Ethan Coen.

(PG-13)Eddie Mannix (Brolin) is a tireless 1950s Hollywood fixer handling problems as customary as a director (Fiennes) complaining about a matinee idol (Ehrenreich) being inappropriate for a role, and as outrageous as a communist cell kidnapping a studio star (Clooney) for ransom money. More an assemblage of ""day in the life"" vignettes than a purposeful plot, replete with fine facsimiles of classic Hollywood musical numbers (Busby Berkley and Gene Kelly, the both), Biblical epics, and plenty more; it doesn't add up to much, and some of the sub-plots can get lost in the tangle (Johansson's unwed pregnancy problem is expressed and resolved awfully easily), but it's still pretty fun. Highlights: Ehrenreich's singing cowboy playing in the sandbox of an elegant comedy of manners and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor.

"Hail, Caesar! is as barmy as you'd expect from the Coen's but disjointed","It's 1951 and Capitol Films Head of Physical Production and studio fixer Eddie Mannix (Brolin) has the unenviable role of keeping the cogs of the movie studio well-oiled and functioning. Dim-witted major acting star Baird Whitlock (Clooney) has somewhat predictably been kidnapped by a bunch of bickering Communist intellectuals calling themselves The Future, his safe return guaranteed only by the receipt of one hundred thousand dollars. Mannix is tasked with sourcing and delivering the ransom while endeavouring to keep a lid on a myriad of other studio tribulations. Hollywood beauty DeeAnna Moran's (Johansson) out of wedlock pregnancy is threatening to derail her sweet public image while likable cowboy Hobie Doyle's (Ehrenreich) switch from the limited dialogue of the action western to the intelligent discourse of the serious drama adaptation is proving strenuous. Maddix continues to battle on all fronts while the stories attempt to unfold around him.The characters are all enjoyable Coen standard; Whitlock, the classic Coen Clooney idiot, Doyle the likable and honest ranch-boy made good, Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) the theatre luvvie constantly on the edge of his patience with the new non-thespian film actor generation. No personality is wasted here and each is lovingly added to the increasingly eccentric Coen back catalogue.Hail, Caesar! is beautifully painted and wonderfully flaunts the glorious mid-century Hollywood glamour thickly lacquered over the ego-centric stars of post-war fame. It looks and feels wonderful and is a joy to watch.However, a serious problem with Hail, Caesar! is that none of the main stories overlap in any way so feel frustratingly disjointed, and some of the major plot lines end up fizzling out to nothing, explained away in a quick dialogue afterthought. Characters just seem to disappear completely without any finality. It seems at times that whole story lines are set up to deliver a killer line then forgotten about and discarded like an ugly Christmas puppy.Another problem is that sometimes the character's narrative is neglected in favour of the musical routines, filmed as part of the Capitol movie-making process. Although this shows the distinction between the smiling charming on-screen personas and the problematic actor underneath, on more than one occasion it feels incorrectly weighted in favour of the choreography and doesn't really add much to the movie as a whole.The enigma of the Coen brother's writing is that it treads an exceptionally undefined fine line; when it succeeds it's thoroughly enjoyable original film-making but when it fails it is disappointing and fragmented. The perplexing part is that it's almost impossible to quantify why a scene drops to one side or the other.Hail, Caesar! is as barmy as you'd expect from the Coen's. It's mostly enjoyable, delivers some great laughs and the acting is top notch. Unfortunately, the plot is so disjointed at times with so many aimless tangents that by the end it feels annoyingly unsatisfactory.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""It's complicated"", and funny.","The trailer made it appear as though the plot is about George Clooney's character being kidnapped, and held for ransom, and while that does happen in this movie, it is only one of many different plots playing out here, as we see the lunacy that goes on behind the scenes, in this 1950s backlot.Not so much a plot, more of just a series of vignettes making fun of the various different stereotypes and tropes of old Hollywood: America's sweetheart is, behind the scenes, an amusingly slutty little number, with a pronounced Brooklyn accent. The manliest men in a Navy film are closeted gay men. Communists are running everything behind the scenes, and kidnap George Clooney to prove a point. All the popular (at that time) genres are represented, the musical, the biblical epic, the pro-American war film. Good and evil twin sister newspaper reporters are out to get the dirt on all of them.Basically everyone in this film just has a cameo, or an extended cameo, as characters appear and disappear almost constantly.I enjoyed this one, but it could have benefited from a bit of editing, as it runs about fifteen minutes too long.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail Caesar Is a Huge Disappointment,"I am very savvy moviegoer and I am willing to take a chance on quirky offerings. However, this movie is underwritten, clichéd, under directed, and really, truly, deeply boring--which is something I never thought I'd say about a Cohen Brothers movie. It's all over the place. Each character is a one-joke card board cut out. Brilliant actors like Ralph Fiennes and Tatum Channing are severely underused. The plot does not hang together and Josh Brolin's character seems to meander through the plot; he's either underwritten as a character or badly acted by Brolin. Robert Altman made these send-up films in a much better way. I almost feel insulted that movie critics by and large loved this movie--but I think it's a clap trap of badly written and poorly acted essaylets that not only are not entertaining, but are actually boring. Sorry folks; I love film and I generally give the benefit of the doubt to almost everyone's efforts. However, I can share that I actually considered pulling out my phone and starting to play scrabble--I was that bored during this move. Sorry Clooney, you don't float my boat at all.

Self-amused pastiche,"The production head at fictional Capitol Pictures in 1950s Hollywood is forced to pay ransom on the star of his latest Roman Sandals epic after the perplexed actor is drugged and abducted by a Communist organization; meanwhile, cameras roll on a sailor musical, a water ballet (with a pregnant, unmarried starlet), and a black-and-white romance featuring the studio's top cowboy star out of his element. Self-amused pastiche from the writing-directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen.

Follows a day in the life of Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Pictures in the 1950s, who cleans up and solves problems for big names and stars in the industry.

Golden Hollywood Retriver,"Hail Caesar! Is a screwball comedy and satire of late 1940s and early 1950s Hollywood.

The politics of popcorn,"Hail, Caesar! is a pleasant stroll through a fake 50's Hollywood studio starring mostly fictional characters who live their lives through the fantasies that their producers create. Though each scene shines spectacularly on its own, the movie never has any weighty moments to really tie the audience in and leave a significant lasting impression. However, the Coen Brothers nail the comedic moments, ultimately delivering a satisfying, and overall entertaining film.Most of the film is viewed through the lens of Eddie Mannix, a real Hollywood film executive whose job it is to manage the circus-like freak show that is his production studio. Many pressing issues of the time period are briefly covered; everything from the Red Scare to homosexuality has a part to play, but the film never clearly elaborates on these heavier points. Instead, we are shown a series of small anecdotes that are shown to be regular, day to day happenings in the wacky life of the film industry. Since most of the situations ride on the edge of incredulity, the film feels more satirical than historical.Out of all the amazing actors on this project, Alden Ehrenreich's surprisingly on point portrayal of a pseudo-realistic cowboy movie star really stole the show. Josh Brolin and Channing Tatum played their parts charmingly as well; however, I felt Clooney and Johansson's characters left more to be desired. Even though the rest of the cast had smaller parts than those aforementioned, they all played their eccentrically written parts well enough. The Coen's rapid fire dialogue pulled the film along, but never really provided an interesting narrative to follow. While I sympathized with Mannix's struggle, I never really bought into the Baird Whitlock kidnapping arc, which is what initially seemed like the main plot. Despite narrative-related short comings, clever dialogue and sharp acting really pulled the film together.Though the Coen brothers hinted at deeper themes throughout the film, the only politics truly explored were those of the popcorn munching flicks of old. Funny, witty, yet shallow, Hail, Caesar! provides a solid hour and a half of entertainment.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A motion picture best recollected in tranquility,"We watched this one on the small screen, via Amazon, so we didn't get the full effect of the big production numbers--one of them, an Esther Williams-style ""water ballet,"" clearly descended from the bowling-Valkyrie dream sequence in ""Lebowksi."" My wife tuned out almost immediately. I found it intriguing but not very involving; the jokes are the kind that might make you say to yourself, ""That's cute"" or ""That's kind of funny,"" rather than actually LOL. ""Hail, Caesar""'s comparable to ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" IMHO, in that the main character's basically opaque and not very sympathetic, and practically everyone else is a cartoon or a grotesque of some kind. The brothers' trademark cold-eyed detachment isn't really working for them here, in other words.Nevertheless, Josh Brolin gets full marks for his performance as Eddie Mannix, old-school Hollywood fixer and hands-on production exec. Eddie's to-do list provides the Coens with a perfunctory plot: a starlet's caught posing for ""French postcards,"" the unmarried star of popular ""aquatic pictures"" inconveniently gets pregnant, the erratic lead in a Bible epic unexpectedly goes AWOL, the studio head casts a singing cowboy in a foofy drawing-room comedyMost of the film consists of skitlike set pieces tied together, as the Dude might say, by nutty disquisitions on philosophy and religion. There are some hits here, some misses--a cell of blacklisted writers explains Marxism to a susceptible movie star (George Clooney) (hit); Eddie consults a panel of squabbling clerics to make sure the Bible epic's ""visual depiction of the Godhead"" won't offend ticket buyers (miss).I didn't get the sense that the Coens were seriously trying to engage with any of these Big Ideas, as they did so brilliantly in ""A Serious Man."" I wasn't sure what to make of Eddie's obsessive Catholicism (""Father, it's been 27 hours since my last confession"") or the dimwitted actor's flirtation with Communism. The takeaway seems to be that religion and politics are all very well, but when it comes down to it, you just have to go out there, hit your mark and say your lines. (Clooney's character fluffs his big speech when he gets to the word ""faith""; make of it what you will.)Despite ""Hail, Caesar""'s disappointing lack of emotional impact or intellectual heft, the Coens' reanimations of extinct Hollywood genres are still pretty entertaining; the cowboy shoot-'em-up and super-gay dance routine (""No Dames""!) might be the best of their kind since ""Blazing Saddles."" The cast is spectacular, of course; Clooney always seems right at home in a Coen bros. picture, and we expect Channing Tatum, who plays a Communist song-and-dance man, to display some serious chops; Alden Ehrenreich's ridin', ropin' and shootin' skills are no less impressive.Long story short, this one's probably best suited to TCM addicts and boomers (like me) who grew up watching stuff like ""The Robe"" on TV and wondering, ""What were they thinking?!"" It's more of a Barton Fink picture, in other words, than a genuine Coen bros. movie, but it's well made and quite watchable if you scale down your expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a bad movie,"Hail, Caesar! was an okay film, after seeing the movie trailer I was very excited about the star studded cast. However, I seemed to lose interest about halfway through the film. This could be for one of two reasons. First, it could be because the film has a very political aspect to it, and I'm not very into politics. Or, it could be because the plot just got boring after a while.The musical scenes in the film were the best part. Tatum showed off his vocals. Johansson proved she could put on a great accent and portray a snobbish movie star. And Clooney....well it's George Clooney! They all played well in there roles, I was also pleasantly surprised by Alden Ehrenreich as the character Tobey. I would have liked to see Jonah Hill play a more significant role.As much as a love the cast, and premise of the movie I feel like it could have done better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not that good,"Yes, it's a love letter to post-war Hollywood. But that doesn't make 'Hail, Caesar!' a good movie. The scenes are disconnected and overall story arc weak to say the least. Acting is very uneven here. Ehrenreich is great as the singing Western film star. Brolin is good as the ""fixer"". Clooney is passable as the studio's big star. Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes have all brief appearances, with Fiennes's performence the only one standing out. Not the movie I would recommend, it's better to watch/re-watch one of the previous Coen brothers movies like 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (2013), 'No Country for Old Men' (2007), 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (2000), 'The Big Lebowski' (1998) or 'Fargo' (1996).",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie for people who just love cinema,"While this may not be the best Coen's movie, I think this is probably better than most productions from 2016.It's a hidden gem with tons of references to old Hollywood during the 1950's (you could play a game there, to recognize which actor or producer from this era is being referenced). The underlying theme being the USA living the Cold War, or rather the way the USA perceived the Cold War through movies.You have a little bit of their humor referencing rabbis and theological debates (theology and stupidity do seem extremely close and tied together in every Coen's brothers movie). And the obsessive, compulsive and controlling nature of Eddie Mannix is depicted with a lot of spirit.Weirdly enough: I've never seen communism explained this clearly in a Hollywood movie. The last speech from Georges Clooney, convinced by his communist kidnappers, is interesting and maybe more sincere than you think.All in all: even a second-rate movie from the Coen brothers is still a very good motion picture to enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Incidental but Enjoyable Coen Brothers' Film,"This movie can best be described as a compilation of creative set pieces that the Coen Brothers played around with, loosely tied by a deliberately unrealistic narrative. What makes the movie enjoyable is the good performances and funny jokes throughout it. However, the experience watching it was not as memorable as most other Coen Brothers' movies. The scenes were enjoyable to watch, but nothing really made me feel invested in the story or feel like I was part of its atmosphere. I know the film is meant to be casual and fun, but I think it still could have done more to make each character and setting distinguishable and memorable. An example of a movie that has a similar meandering story set in LA, but with much more memorable characters and dialogue, is one of the Coen Brothers' previous films, The Big Lebowski.
Overall, the movie was fun to watch but didn't leave much else of an impact on me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Pro-level parody that will leave many feeling left out,"Every moment of this film is simultaneously an indictment, confession, parody and homage of Hollywood's Golden era.However, In order to ""get"" this film, you'll need to be reasonably versed in that era - the time after silent films until the mid-60s, when epic films like The Ten Commandments ruled the land. When studios, not actors, called the shots. When Communist fear was at an all time high. When films were more about escape, optimism and grand stories, and always had an undercurrent of patriotism.And you'll need to know that Hollywood had a seedy side of the more L. A. Confidential variety - back when getting busted for pot or getting pregnant out of marriage was the career-ending cancel culture of the day, and Hollywood went to great lengths to protect its actors and uphold the facade. But then as now, these scandals could be buried, and that's where Ed Mannix came in.If you know something about the real Ed Mannix (played by Josh Brolin here), you know of the forced abortions, intimidation and police payoffs. He was not a nice guy. He was a well-known Hollywood ""fixer"" - a guy who makes problems go away - and if the rumors are true, occasionally people. Anything it took to bury a story and preserve the Hollywood image of hopes, dreams, and innocence.But that's the real guy. HAIL, CAEASAR! Takes on the herculean task of somehow turning Mannix from a goon into a saint by applying all the power of 1950s Hollywood magic to sanitize, paper-over and explain away his sins. In hilarious Coen Brothers fashion of course.Yet well beyond Hollywood's ability to sweep things under the rug, the Coen Brothers want you to see and feel a little of what all that Golden Age magic was about. Channing Tatum burns up the screen with a dance number that has to be seen to be believed. Scarlett Johansen does a classic synchronized swimming number. It's full of honest homages and genuine reverence, because for all of its sins, there really was a lot of magic, too.In the end, it's not infinitely rewatachable like Big Lebowski. It doesn't have that depth nor subtlety. For the right viewer, it will, however, stick with you. And I wouldn't be surprised if another ten or so years goes by and suddenly people start to get what it's all about.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not a bad movie, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't","""It's a swell story."" Eddie Mannix (Brolin) works for a huge Hollywood studio in the 50's and deals with all of the problems that comes up and fixes them. This day he has to deal with a unhappy director, covering up the pregnancy of a popular star and the disappearance of their lead actor in their biggest picture. Eddie jumps from fixing problem to problem while trying to decide on his own future. This is a movie that is almost review proof. The Coen brothers, for as big as they are and as famous as their movies are, are very polarizing. People either love everything they do, or avoid them. For me they are pretty hit or miss. They have done some movies I have really liked like Fargo, Big Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou...but they also did Burn After Reading which I didn't like at all. This one, while it was funny and I did laugh a few times was more like Burn After Reading than the others. The dialog is witty and fast paced, but the actual plot itself seemed to really drag and I found myself wondering how much longer it will go on. Overall, this is not a bad movie at all, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't. I give this a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Sooooo Commies Fly,"I don't get it. Pure and simple. There's a host of names and all are familiar faces their performances as taken from all their great films, and then nothing. The plot is hair thin. Giving no idea as to taking this even slightly serious or canning this as some artsy film that got the wrong attention and had to do better. I wonder as to the quality of the Coens,they have made such memorable films and are obviously tired of going the same path that leads to instant success. I see this as an example of extremely skilled Hollywood trying to do a spoof on itself and hitting some kind of internal censorship and then crippling itself from the first intent. The one thing that comes across as memorable are some lead-ins to a story that never get's any further explanation and the some lead-outs that never had a starting point. I like that ! Stories don't have to make sense. But the movie has got to obey it's own rules. The commy gay sailor can leap a long way and land securely, this is set up in a dancing scene and gets a payoff in the deflection to the submarine. Great ! But this is only happens once in the film and there isn't anything close to that again. The Cowboy lasso routine get's the same treatment without a rewarding payoff.

Emporers new clothes,"I find watching a Coen brothers film a strange experience. I quite enjoy their films but i'm not sure why? I don't think their films are particularly funny , in fact most of the time i don't even get them . It's as if i should be laughing but i'm not in on their private joke. Hail , Caesar is about a fixer in Hollywood ( Josh Brolin) who is paid by the studio to keep the actors in line. There are some interesting performances from George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich and a very camp but hypnotic musical scene lead by Channing Tatum . The critics really liked this , i think , because it's about the industry they critic on but for me it was just another oddly entertaining Coen brothers film that i have many times before.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Hailing,"Offered a cushy desk job with an aerospace company, a 1950s Hollywood producer wrestles with whether or not to switch career while experiencing the most chaotic day of his life in this lively Coen Brothers comedy. The film is divided into three main problems that the producer, played by Josh Brolin, has to solve. In one, his studio's biggest star, played by George Clooney, is kidnapped by a Communist cell on the set of a biblical epic a la 'The Robe'. In another, a young western star (Alden Ehrenreich) has trouble transitioning to melodrama. In the third, an Esther Williams-like musical icon (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant but unmarried and cannot tarnish her image. The Clooney and Ehrenreich subplots work best, nicely intertwining near the end and Tilda Swinton is delightful as not one but two (!) reporters looking to write about both actors. Ralph Fiennes is also a lot of fun as the melodrama director. The Johansson subplot does not work quite as well though (despite a magnificently choreographed mermaid-suit number), while an even smaller subplot with Channing Tatum doing a superb Gene Kelly impersonation feels like it should have received more focus. Whatever the case, the film captures the chaos that comes with running a studio, and while the film could have benefited from expanding on how much Brolin loves to fix problems in his producer job, the film certainly shows a level of excitement with filmmaking that simply would not come from an ordinary desk job - and the film could well be interpreted as the Coens' ode to why they keep going in show business.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Emmm,Maybe it's me but I didn't understand very well some passages of the film and the usefulness of most of the characters in the course of the plot. It seemed to me for most of the film that the Communists did not serve much and that they could be replaced with other things without seeing the difference. But apart from that the film is very funny in its frivolity and manages to entertain very well.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Unflattering and burlesque representation of Hollywood's past,"The latest movie from the Coen brothers 'Hail, Caesar!' is another Hollywood invention that may resonate with some, for reasons that I still don't understand to this day. It originally appeared to appeal to a broad swath of moviegoers before its release, due in part to a strong marketing campaign. So, just like many moviegoers convinced by the ads, I decided to watch the latest inventions of the Brothers. To my dismay, the movie did not waste any time to mockingly dismiss the artistry and cultural legacy of the golden age of Hollywood. So, it is natural to try to understand the underlying motivation for a movie that had so much potential, but so incoherent that only those with unique sensibilities could enjoy and laugh from time to time. It is indeed hard to agree with New York Times' film critic Manohla Dargis, who believes the script was ""written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) crowd."" Perhaps she watched a different version of the movie before she wrote her favorable review. Perhaps her perception of what moves and delights the TCM crowd is up for revision as well.The movie tries rather unsuccessfully to showcase the different vices and nonsensical nature of the Hollywood's of the 1950s. Oddly enough, 'Hail, Caesar!' implodes on itself by all the nonsensical silliness packed in almost 2 hours, which few can understand, appreciate and enjoy. If you think the movie falls in the category of wise and insightful entertainment, you will certainly be disappointed. The whole plot is disjointed, so the only thing that one can do is to try to laugh from all the silliness and pointlessness taking place in each scene. Also, moviegoers should write letters to the Coen brothers to remind them that movies need an ending.At a deeper level, the movie tries to indict the Hollywood's past for its political correctness, without taking the time to explore and understand the cultural and social underpinnings of its time. Luckily, the movie will soon fall into the category of cult following, in which ideas are only rehashed and regurgitated among those with no desire to see beyond the horizon.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A love-letter to 50s Hollywood,"This movie is a beautiful and sarcastic homage to 1950s Hollywood.
However, it still very much a farce, Coen Bros. style. In the same vein as Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy, or Burn after Reading this film is blatantly about style and visuals more than substance. And of course the movie acknowledge it itself!There not a lot left to discuss. The story is the weakest element and used more as an excuse to jump from one (scene) film to the other. The style of 50s movie making, is replicated and made fun of. Deconstructed if you will, but not in an accusatory way, but with respect and with, of course, always a quirky twist. I cannot help to think that there is some kind of a meta joke about spending all this time and effort for these brilliant scenes that have no narrative justification, like the sailors dance, or the Would That It Were So Simple scene. They are well-made moments. And they are really funny.The movie is beautiful, and the humour is very good. The music is cool. It is a love-letter to 1950s and for that it work very well. The farcical and ridiculous elements work because they are made with affection. The movie is not mocking its subject, nor the religious faith, nor communism. It is using them to tell jokes. And that is why this movie is so good.My only negative is that it could be more focused, and cleaner on the narrative side of things. Again it does not take away from the rest of the movie. But when you compare them to prior film the Coen bros have done, it feels emptier. The movie is great, I get it the 50s had all the genres: naïve westerns, dancing sailors, swimming sirens, sword-and-sandal epics etc... But nothing really happens in this movie. (Expect maybe Channing Tatum defects to the Soviets but he is not a major character). So you are left wanting more.It came out very closely to two movies having very similar themes and at least settings : Trumbo and Café Society. I believe that watching these three movies you will get the complete idea of the 1950s in Hollywood. And as it happens they all lack something the other has. Trumbo has the true story and actual behind the scenes walk-through, CS has the drama and plastique and Hail Caesar has the spectacle and humour (throw in LA Confidential and you'll also have the thrilling action).",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Movies Within a Movie: Only the Coen Bros Could Zing 1950's Hollywood Culture: All the World's a Movie,"From the very beginning of film as manufactured entertainments to be consumed not unlike candy and popcorn until circa 1965, the Hollywood studios were giant movie factories. They cranked out films like the latest dessert or candy bar to be quickly devoured and ingested until the next time. The studios were often making multiple films on different sound stages. When television became serious competition for entertainment seekers in the 1950's, the studios fought back by making large epic pictures in a new format: Cinemascope, a widescreen format which could not be accommodated by current television technology. Cinemascope films often took place in ancient times: ""The Robe"", ""Ben Hur"", and ""The Ten Commandments"". (Only by circa 1990 did some films begin appearing on VHS tape in their original widescreen formats.)The Coen brothers attack the old Hollywood studio system and culture with the subtlety of a hacksaw and apply it to pre-1960 Hollywood like King Kong escaping from his bonds. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is a ""movie star"" in the old pre-Marlon Brando sense. He plays over-the-top characters in love stories and epics, not just to please cinema-goers who like the stories of his films, but also his adoring fans who will pay the box office to watch whatever he stars in. He's currently in ""Hail, Caesar!"" (undoubtedly similar to ""The Robe"", the first ever Cinemascope movie, and ""Ben Hur"") as a centurion who will experience the humanity and divinity of Christ in ancient Palestine.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a movie mogul probably modeled after Louis B. Mayer (who executive produced MGM musicals) and Darryl F. Zanuck (producer of ""Gone with the Wind""). The actors under contract under the studio Capitol Pictures are his chess pieces, and he moves them around from film-to-film, the studio being like a giant chess board. Mannix assigns his actors and directors at will. But he not only controls the projects; he also governs the lives of the Hollywood people. He determines who will go with whom to film premiers, and even occasionally gets involved with directing their person lives in terms of marriages and families. (In point of fact, Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller was forced by the studios to divorce his wife. The conventional wisdom: female audiences would be less interested in attending his Tarzan films if they knew he was married and unavailable.)The film ""Hail Caesar"" is only a few scenes away from completion, but their star, Whitlock has been kidnapped! Interspersed with this plot are sequences in which we view other films being shot. In particular we meet a country-western airhead who is playing in musical westerns. He's tapped by the studio to play a supporting character in a sophisticated costume drama which has dire consequences! We also see a bar scene in a movie musical being shot where all the off-duty sailors break into song and dance! In the meantime, a horrid stand-in takes the place of Whitlock, and they shoot his scenes with his back to the camera!While most critics enjoyed this scathing reality check of Hollywood culture, general movie goers were less than enthusiastic. There are many in-jokes about the entertainment industry, not all of them flattering, some of them sobering. In some scenes which are supposed to be ""real life"", the scenes look like film shots, particularly with the sky appearing more like a painting than real. I think the point the Coen brothers are making is that the entire Hollywood world is an endless movie in and of itself. Especially when you consider the gossip columnists who endlessly used their pens like swords to expose the latest scandalous behavior behind the scenes. A really fun movie if you understand the unreality of Show Biz. All the world's a movie, without the credits!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Quirky satire about old Hollywood,"I have heard of HAIL CAESAR since December 2019 for the cast and the subject but for various reasons I never had a chance of seeing it. I had it last October and it lived up to my expectations.The film is set in 1951 Hollywood. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer, one tasked of fixing situations that can become scandals and damage the actors of the studio. This time he has to cover a scandal involving water-actress DeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johannson) that became pregnant with lover Arne Slesum (Christopher Lambert) but after they refuse to marry Eddie recommends DeAnna to give her newborn child to adoption. In the meanwhile there is an epic set in the last days of Christ being filmed that is interrupted when Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by two extras. And Hobie Doyle becomes the lead of the new costume drama directed by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) despite he lacks the skills for it because he is a Western star.What strucks the common viewer (that includes me) is the cast: Brolin, Johannson, Lambert, Clooney, Fiennes, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill. Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Wayne Knight and Clancy Brown... where do you find such a cast? They all give great performances as well, and look like they had a real fun. The script is great considering that is based on a real subject, and also very witty, and I am one of the few that found it funny.Highly recommended especially for fans of movies of yesteryear (and last month's BABYLON is a bit like this) and overall, another great outing for the Coen brothers.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen brothers are far from their best in this hit and miss comedy,"No other filmmakers out there today have a more diverse filmography than the Coen brothers. For over thirty years now, the Coen brothers have been bringing us films that span across a wide array of genres. Comedy, gangster, thriller, Western and even romance have all been covered by the duo, each varying in their levels of absurdity.Their latest effort, Hail, Caesar!, is a comedy that was amongst my list of highly anticipated films of 2016. The Coen brothers are enough of a draw for me but when you look at the cast they assembled, you'd be crazy not to get excited. How disappointing it is for me to say that this is not the film I was hoping for, finding the Coen brothers far from their best.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is head of production at Capitol Pictures in 1951 Los Angeles. Also working as the studio's fixer, Mannix keeps a close eye on the goings on at the studio, keeping any scandalous behaviour of its stars out of the press as much as he can.During production of the studio's next big release, Hail, Caesar!, major movie star and lead of the film, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped and held for ransom of $100,000. Mannix must solve the mystery of who has taken Whitlock, all while juggling the troubles of other stars of the studio.I found it hard to really take to the story that the Coen brothers were trying to tell in Hail, Caesar!, something I rarely say after watching one of their films. It felt very unbalanced in pace with the runtime feeling a lot longer than it actually was and, more disappointingly, came across as a bit stilted rather than a film that flows, making it harder to watch.Hail, Caesar! ultimately feels like a load of random scenes patched together to distract us away from a story that is rather weak when you compare it to other films from the Coen brothers. That's not to say these scenes ruin the film though, a song and dance number that introduces us to Channing Tatum's Burt Gurney being one of the stand-out moments.The script, written by the duo, is definitely a shining light for this film. It always seems to be the case with the Coen brothers that they manage to produce a high quality script. There are two scenes that come to mind right away; Ralph Fiennes' Lawrence Laurentz trying to get the desired pronunciation from Alden Ehrenreich's Hobie Doyle, the star of his movie, and a scene very early on in the film where Mannix is discussing the depiction of Christ in the studio's major picture with a group of leaders from different religions.I found myself enjoying the performances given by the talented cast on display. Josh Brolin gives the Coen brothers a tough lead in Mannix while George Clooney plays the goofball ever so well, just as he did in Burn After Reading. It's Alden Ehrenreich who steals the show though with his performance as Hobie Doyle, a singing Western star forced to move to a period drama in order to broaden his appeal. Ehrenreich is marvellous in the scene he shares with Ralph Fiennes, expertly conveying the limit of his abilities and innocence of his character through facial expressions.The Coen brothers once again work with cinematographer Roger Deakins on Hail, Caesar! and the results are deeply satisfying. Deakins is a master of his craft and I cannot express how much I love just how perfect he shoots night sequences.As much as I liked other aspects of the film, the lack of investment I had in the story leads me to say that Hail, Caesar! is the first major disappointment I have had at the cinema this year.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

I wasn't expecting to roll off my seat in laughter. I didn't expect to hold onto my seat in suspense. I did expect to be entertained and this lacked that. If this was supposed to be a dry comedy, it wasn't even that. The ending left me thinking what was this movie about in the first place?

The problem was simply that the script was a bit slow moving and not excessively funny.The film had a good message (as nearly all Coen brothers films do); but it just did not have the depth of humor that, say, O Brother, Fargo, or others did.I thought that Clooney was okay - sometimes very funny other times cliché. Brolin was very good but he just didn't quite have the dialogue to make his role exceptional.That's not to say there weren't some funny scenes nor that it was not enjoyable.

Before the studio system fell; a time where Hollywood was much more secret,"Hail, Caesar! (2016)3.5/4""Would that it were so simple."" - Hobie Doyle""Hail, Caesar!"" was released six years ago, and is still being talked about. It got mainly a mixed reception, but I think that it's a really good film. It portrays one of the darkest times in Hollywood, and one of the most interesting, and gives us a real insight into what it was really like in Hollywood during the 50's. The screenplay provides us with plenty of interesting situations, ideas and even moments, and gives us a genuinely funny film. It's slow-paced, and takes its time, but it pays off in the end. It was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and excellently, too, because this is a beautifully directed and superbly made movie.""Caesar"" follows a studio head in the 50's, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), who's the main head of Capital Pictures. Everything seems to be going well, and currently, they're working on an epic retelling of Christ's life called ""Hail, Caesar!"", until one of the main stars of the picture, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), is kidnapped. He's taken and held ransom by a group of rogue communists making a statement in the historically rough and dark time in Hollywood history, the infamous McCarthy era, where stars were blacklisted left and right. Mannix is going to have to not only recover Whitlock, but make sure that nobody finds out about it, either. But he's also got a studio to run, which is proving more and more difficult with this new problem.It is a visually dazzling film, using a sort of modern 2016 visual scheme combined with the 50's era Technicolor. As usual, I was incredibly impressed by Roger Deakin's sublime photography. The film has an incredible cast, too, which also features people like Ralph Fiennes, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johanson, Tilda Swinton playing two identical twins working in the press, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand and Jonah Hill. All of the cast is excellent.As mentioned, the film is very slowly paced, but in the end, it all adds up, as every minute is really worth it. All of its technical credits are excellent, and the story is also compelling in its own way. It's a movie of great style, and I loved the ambition and execution. The last 40 minutes are probably the best in the movie, however, as the finale builds up, and the film becomes more and more complex.I'm usually a sucker for this kind of a 50's studio drama, and this time, it served; it's a great 50's drama in general, filled with believable moments and interest. It evokes a darker, more quiet time in Hollywood, and I was fascinated.""Hail, Caesar!"" is another very good film by the Coen brothers, excelling at different genres, interest and story. Would that it were so simple, though; there really is a lot to the film in general.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't bother!,"First off, I've always liked the movies of the Coen brothers. But, the brothers completely failed on this one. Did they even try? I never write reviews, but I feel the need to warn fellow movie watchers about this movie. During the screening of this movie, a lot of people quietly left the theater, and very few looked like they were entertained. A terrible and confusing script combined with a weird and unintriguing plot makes this very boring and not worth the watch. My biggest disappointment was how the movie was marketed, with a lot of big actors on the poster and in the preview. Unfortunately, a lot of these actors have small roles in the movie, and some of them doesn't even appear in the movie for more than 20 seconds. All of this makes the movie feel like a movie the brothers made just to get it done, like no one in the production really took this seriously.Stay away!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Stands Out For Its Detailed Period Setting and Almost Too Many Moving Parts Made Whole,"Definitely an Ethan Coen and Joel Coen production, who both directed and wrote the movie. This sparkling period-in-detail movie captures the retro-film pizzazz of the song and dance era as the backdrop to this mild in tone but sharply choreographed thriller comedy drama. The movie introduces a disparate number of song and dance routines that richly envelopes those film scenes along with the stage setting and handlers in which they were shot. At the same time, the narrator proceeds to move the main storyline of the insidious Cold War behind the scenes along with a setting up but never coming directly into blacklisting of movie industry employees. Yet all this is achieved with a serious but light-handed approach, never smartly becoming a parody, one of the most difficult of balancing acts in directing. Josh Brolin's character as a movie mogul in a well-acted performance almost breaks the flowing, entertaining tone of the movie at one point and having to literally repent at another point. There are almost too many moving parts to compress into one movie and perhaps some of the individual storylines and characters get short-shrifted or short-changed for the emotional and substantive depth they individually deserved unlike Pulp Fiction (1994) or Sin City (2005). Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers apparently pulled off a delightful and rather unique theatrical experience that allows this movie to stand out among many.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Fun, funny but overall a slight mess","I love the coen brothers. Raising Arizona is one of my favourite comedies, Fargo is great and No Country For Old Men is one of my favourite movies, so going into this I was rather hopeful. I left happy but a bit disappointed.The film centres around the day in the life of a Hollywood executive, at least for the most part. There are so many different characters and stories going on at once, that the film gets rather muddled. It really needed to just focus on one aspect, instead of multiple stories.The acting from everyone is great, they really make their characters feel like real people. And Alden Ehrenreich came out of nowhere, he was fantastic.I feel the set design and the costume design are the best parts of the film. The costumes look like they are from the time period, and so do all the sets and locations. They really make it feel like it is the 1950's. And the films in production in this Hollywood studio are also really well designed and planned out. Channing Tatums major scene in the film really shows how much care the coen brothers put into this film.The cinematography from Roger Deakins is also excellent. And the score fits the time period perfectly.However the faults lie in the script and the story telling. It's narratively not engaging and it's not as funny as it should have been. I feel I could push it to an 8/10 if it were funnier, but it wasn't. It was funny don't get me wrong, but it's not as funny as say Raising Arizona.But overall it's a fun time at the movies and it might get better on a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Golden Age of Hollywood,"'Hail Caesar' may have been marketed as a zany caper movie, but is more of a tribute to the golden age of Hollywood featuring wonderful period detail (including recreations of lavish song and dance numbers and stereotypical scenes from various Cold War-era popular film genres) than anything else. The main ""action"" plot, involving the kidnap of an air-headed leading man (George Clooney) doesn't follow any conventional course or resolution, instead amounting to a comic series of dead ends and blunders in classic Coen Brothers fashion. Scarlett Johansson turns in a fun performance as a swimming movie star in the mold of Esther Williams, but is somewhat wasted in a sub-sub-plot that only furthers the subplot of the studio head (Josh Brolin), and his dilemma in deciding whether to stay in charge of his chaotic cinematic circus or to take a cushy job with an aerospace company. Overall, 'Hail Caesar' is entertaining film, but as a comedy it provides only a few laugh-out-loud moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Just a terrible movie.,"It was just on HBO and my wife and I decided it was going to be our choice for movie night last night. It was literally the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot was slow and barely there, the writing was terrible, and the directing tied nothing together. Even the acting was stupid and forced, I can't believe these actors would even sign on for this...and Scarlett wisely disappears rather quickly, like she was just in it as a favor. Like troopers we made it through to the end (well, i did...my wife got up and started cooking in the kitchen, she just couldn't take it anymore) and even the ending was pointless and went no where. I don't think you could have made a less interesting film if you tried. Straight to DVD and deservingly so.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

I'm not an expert on the Coen brothers but I think this must be my favorite of theirs. It was never boring for a second and it was a delight to see so many big names in various tertiary roles.I see a few others mentioning that the plot is thin, but in my opinion this movie is really a slice of life piece about Josh Brolin's studio executive character Mannix, a day in the life (or several days) when he has to decide whether a cushy corporate job might suit him better than wrangling the never-ending circus of Hollywood. For me, it was a satisfying journey.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Exquisite - as BOTH a sendup AND a stand-alone picture of originality.,"A gem from the Brothers Coen, Hail Caesar serves up a perfectly paced ""week in the life"" homage centered on the Mogul-run studio system shortly before the U. S. v Paramount Pictures, Inc ruling of 1948.EVERY gesture and line is propelled by a Dream-Cast of Stars, known and yet-to-be. The meekest of characters is rendered as justly as the top-o-the-bill personalities, so you can suspend credibility at the onset and feel good about a flow and continuity that isn't rushed nor sandbagged.Concerning those propelled lines, the Coens give out a script complete with the Hollywood Hi-Hebraic dialog of the Biblical pictures of the early days. This exchange is one of many such exchanges: GRACCHUS:""Aye Attolichus! Rome; Suckled by a She-Wolf and nurturing us, her sons, in turn"" ATTOLICHUS: "" Tonight I bathe in caracula and wash away the dust of 300 miles of Frankish road"". Nice! Everything is played straight. There is zero winking going on. We may amuse in the corniness of it but it's pitched to us right between the eyes and ears and it's good.Rather than recreate what's already been said of the movie, I'll share my own experience with it over the dozens of attentive viewings. I pick up something new each time - be it a nuance, reference, prop, gesture, double-entendre, or background.The multiple storylines each have their own principles and you're suddenly tracking characters that are less ""supporting actors"" and more ""stars in their silos"".The struggling writers v. The studio moguls storyline is beautifully told, underscoring the folly as well as virtue across the political spectrum.I won't divulge any other storyline BUT I will say each scores a 10 on verisimilitude!It's hard to put one Coen movie above another, given their portfolio to date, but I'll go ahead and put this one above them all - only because I'll play this one over and over. After a while, even binging Lebowski over and over gets old. This doesn't!THIS was an instant cult-classic. Naturally, it performed underwhelmingly at the Box, but I'll speculate the 20-year grosses will be pretty sweet.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Featuring a corny storyline, a waste of many a worthy actor ability, and just plain not funny, this has to be one of the Coen Brothers worst productions ever. Of the numerous actors who show-up/cameo here, there isn't one performance worth noting. Everyone was probably under the Coen Brother spell ""If it's a Coen Brother's film, it will be good"".

A Movie Only Neville Sinclair Could Love!,"Lots of reviewers have already pointed out how shallow, ugly, tasteless and unfunny this massively annoying little movie really is. What I want to do is examine some of the underlying themes by comparing it to a movie from the early Nineties that I really loved, THE ROCKETEER.These two movies have so much in common, yet they're very different. The Rocketeer was a feelgood popcorn film aimed at a family audience. Hail Caesar is an art house movie aimed at the elite. Yet both of them are period pictures that both spoof and celebrate classic Hollywood. Both movies feature a main character who is supposed to be a legendary movie star, a sexy screen idol at the height of his career. Both Baird Whitlock in Hail Caesar and Neville Sinclair in Rocketeer are quickly revealed to be very different from the heroic characters they play onscreen.So here's where it gets interesting. The bland family movie actually presents a much darker, more disturbing, and arguably more honest look at Hollywood than the hip satire. With Baird Whitlock, the Coen brothers cop out. He's not a bad man, he's just stunningly self-involved, childishly naive, weak and silly. It's purely accidental (and supposedly hilarious) when he gets mixed up with a bunch of Communists trying to infiltrate Hollywood. They kidnap him and lecture him on Communist doctrine. And he sits there. Looking confused. And that's hilarious, really funny. Only not. At all!Now look at Neville Sinclair. He's nobody's pawn. He's a Nazi spy and he likes it. He's genuinely cruel, cunning, sadistic and brutal. He doesn't think twice about hiring mob killers to help him cover up his treason. He revels in his plans to bring down America. And you know what? He's also a sexual predator who very nearly pulls off a Harvey style rape scene with a genuinely innocent and appealing young ingenue. None of that is funny, but see, it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be real, and it is. And it feels even tougher and more honest now than it was in 1991!I'm a big CLOCKWORK ORANGE fan, and I wish that George Clooney and the Coen brothers could be strapped into their seats and forced to viddy THE ROCKETEER over and over again, until they begin to feel very, very sick!",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointment,"Boring. Either I expected more out of these actors or the film was actually bad. I kept waiting for something to break the film into a captivating entertainment piece and was surprised when the ending titles came up. A positive was the retro 50's cars and clothing. The rest of the film was a disaster for entertainment. I'm very surprised so many main line stars chose to be in the film. I'm not sure the accuracy of the studio sets. My interest in films is usually action packed, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I fully expected to be entertained in a different way, thru drama or comedy, certainly not mystery, however none of these came thru in my estimation. Clooney has made some good/great films and why he chose to do this one is beyond me. Must have been paid a lot of money for the short on-screen time that he had. The same for Ralph Fienes. My value to the film is very liberal.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Beware the Ides of March,"I was really disappointed in this Coen brothers film. I guess you can't always make great films.Perhaps the following analogy will sum up my feelings best.

You wait for that special moment to share it with a loved one, spend a lot of money in the preparation prior to opening it... and then you pop the cork... but to no pop... it's just awfully flat.This film with all its stars should have been a warning. Big cast films usually are disappointing. The film was really all about appearance. They could even win an Oscar for best time period costumes, but the script was uninteresting, flat and with no substance. Did the Coen brothers really make this film? The only scene I enjoyed was with Ralph Fiennes as a director. Man, this film was not even to the level of a Hollywood ""B"" movie... I would call it a ""D"" movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid film,"So the movie was pretty good. I liked the overall tone and how it absolutely satirized everything going on in 1950s Hollywood and even Hollywood today. The staging was also pretty good and allowed for punchlines of jokes and comedy to pay off, which is important in a satire like this. It's not necessarily as good as something say Wes Anderson or Edgar Wright would stage, but for what the filmmakers were going for, it worked out just fine. Being a Coen brothers' movie, it has all the tropes and signatures of them, both good and bad. The good is rich and lively characters with depth, amazing writing, great set design, and Roger Deakins on camera (which never isn't a good thing). The bad isn't necessarily a bad thing, but more of an annoyance in that the movie conveys the same message basically all other Coen brothers' movies have in that the only meaning life and art have is that which we as individuals put into it and nothing more. At times, the plot also felt kind of meandering, and I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it didn't really bother me because the scenarios were still pretty interesting to me and I feel like it might have to do with the layers of the film. It would honestly be a pretty cool case study.Other than that, I'd say it's a pretty solid Coen brothers flick that's being unfairly underrated (and in some cases panned).",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Only see this if you really like the Coen Brothers,"(Sigh)... Despite being disappointed with several Coen Brothers movies in the past (O Brother, Where Art Thou? , Burn After Reading, etc), the high ratings of ""Hail, Caesar!"" convinced me to give them one more shot. Sadly it finally confirmed once and for all that I'll never enjoy their movies. Super slow pace, weird story, and insanely random scenes/cameos with some rather high profile Hollywood actors. By the halfway point I honestly just wanted it to end. The musical number with Channing Tatum was sort of entertaining I guess, the oddball character Hobie had a certain charm to him, and the 1950s setting was a nice spin... but overall this movie just didn't do it for me.

"While interesting and funny at parts, Hail, Caesar! is unable to live up to its epic scope.","The premise of Hail, Caesar! is simple: There's a movie studio and there's a guy that works there. That's it. Now, once the movies inside the movie begin to be introduced (e.g. the titular Hail, Caesar!) things start to get interesting. The Coen Brothers make a film centered on the idea that there is a movie playing on the big screen, but there is also a movie inside that movie, and there are people making that movie inside another movie that was made by other people that made the real movie. Whoa. Unfortunately, that's about as deep as Hail, Caesar! (the movie, not the movie within the movie) gets.The story, inasmuch as there is one, follows Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin, The Goonies), the head of production at Capitol Pictures, as he goes about his daily work. Mishaps are never far away. Through this journey - - or rather, lack thereof -- a truly beautiful world of film production is shown off with short glimpses into the hodgepodge of films that Capitol Pictures is cranking out. The different films are crafted accordingly, the Coen Brothers masterfully weaving in and out of them, showcasing some interesting stuff. Amongst the styles that they coalesce, however, the most important elements of a film like story, plot, and emotion get lost. Despite the style, production, the Coen brothers' incredible direction, and the world that they have pulled out of fifties cinema, Hail, Caesar! remains a handsome film that is mediocre and unsatisfactory lock, stock, and barrel the former aside.That being said, it isn't a film that everyone will appreciate, and definitely not one that the average moviegoer will enjoy, but film buffs might love it. In fact, it scored a horrendous C- CinemaScore amongst audiences but enjoys an 80% amongst critics on Rotten Tomatoes, most of whom would probably love the style and setting and would also understand many of the obscure film jokes. Therefore, positive feelings toward the film greatly depend on which group one belongs to.Still, there are plenty of goofy parts that everyone can enjoy: Burt Gurney's (Channing Tatum, 21 Jump Street) tap dancing scene is terrific, both comedic and well-choreographed. Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich, Beautiful Creatures) is an interesting, well-acted character that is fun to watch and live with inside the movie. There are entertaining aspects with good laughs to be had, but any of those aspects are unfortunately infrequent. Some sequences that aren't funny feel as though they go on forever, like when Lawrence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes, Schindler's List) attempts to coax Hobie to pronounce his name correctly for what seems like ten minutes. Conversely, some that are hilarious, like when Baird Whitlock (George Clooney, Ocean's Eleven) is captured, feel cut short. This off balance feel is made worse by the lack of focus and lack of plot. Ultimately, it is a haphazard wandering through disparate genres.Pulp Fiction attempted the plot-less movie, and it does it amazingly. Hail, Caesar! tried the same thing, but it didn't have anything to support its uneventful plot. Good parts are there, and those good parts really are good. However great Hail, Caesar! tries to be, its comedic spans, colossal setting, and good direction are drowned by its ersatz and inorganic dialogue and lack of a gripping story. It remains uncaptivating.F: While interesting and funny at parts, Hail, Caesar! is unable to live up to its epic scope.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Friends, Romans, Movie Fans, lend me your ears, for I would like to ""Hail, Caesar!""","When we go to the movies, we want to feel that we got our money's worth, right? Well, here's a film that gives us more for our money than most films. For the price of admission to this one movie: ""Hail, Caesar!"" (PG-13, 1:46), we get two directors and two screenwriters (brothers Joel and Ethan Cohen), three Oscar winners (George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton) and three previous Oscar nominees (Josh Brolin, Ralph Fiennes and Jonah Hill), the third appearance by Josh Brolin in a Coen Brother's film, Clooney's fourth such gig, the fifth movie in which Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have both appeared – and five films within a film! We also get three satires for the price of one as this movie gently parodies (but does not pillory) religion, Hollywood's communist witch hunt of the 1950s and the Golden Age of Hollywood itself. Actually, the film's content seems to me like a comedic version of the Oscar-nominated 2015 film ""Trumbo"". There's a lot going on in ""Hail, Caesar!"" Of course, the most important question now is, whether all this quantity equals quality.Brolin stars as a loose interpretation of Eddie Mannix, a real-life Hollywood ""fixer"" in the 40s and 50s. During this one day in his life working as an executive for the fictional movie studio Capitol Pictures, Eddie has a lot to deal with, both professionally and personally. In his personal life, he's feeling guilty about his failed attempts to quit smoking and the lies he tells his wife about it (not to mention the toll that his long hours at the studio are taking on his family life) and he's weighing a lucrative job offer to leave Hollywood behind and help run Lockheed Aviation. On the studio lot, Eddie has to deal with a weather-delayed shoot at a remote location and a producer who needs a new male star for his current production (and a director who's not happy with Eddie's choice). Eddie's also consulting a disparate group of religious leaders on the historical and theological validity of the studio's current biblical epic, and handling an unmarried star who just started filming a new movie and is pregnant, twin sisters who are competing entertainment journalists (Swinton in both roles), a slew of celebrity-oriented rumors and, most troubling of all, the sudden and mysterious disappearance of that epic's star, Baird Whitlock.Baird (Clooney) has been kidnapped. He was just a couple scenes away from completing his role as a Roman military commander in the aforementioned biblical epic, entitled ""Hail, Caesar!"" – and is still dressed in his full ancient Roman regalia when he's taken. Baird is a well-known drunk and womanizer, but that doesn't help Eddie figure out where he is or when he'll be back. Then, a ransom note arrives at the studio. The note asks for $100,000 and is signed by a group calling themselves ""The Future"". (No, this isn't a time travel movie.) Baird's captors are actually a relatively peaceful group of people who treat him fairly well. Of course, Baird's current condition is unknown to Eddie and doesn't solve the problem of a major production falling behind schedule. Also in on the secret of Baird's disappearance is Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrereich), another of his studio's stars. Despite suddenly being pulled from filming a western to act in a period drama for director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes) – and being comically bad in a serious role (and not the brightest bulb in the socket), Hobie wants to help the studio any way he can. In the midst of all this, we get to see humorous scenes in which Johannson and Tatum are each filming their respective movies and Hill gets a short, but amusing scene as an office nerd who helps fixers.""Hail, Caesar!"" is definitely a Coen Brothers movie. More than an obvious statement of fact, that sentence will likely carry a lot of meaning to many Movie Fans. This film is full of quirky characters, clever dialog, smart satire, catchy original songs and excellent actors who are Coen Brothers regulars (including Joel's wife, Frances McDormand, in a small role). All that, combined with the fun ""movie within a movie"" scenes, make for one entertaining motion picture. I liked this movie very much, but I wanted to like it more than I did. As with most other Coen Brothers comedies, I would've appreciated a few more laughs and a somewhat tighter plot, but I still think that this film is one of their best. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"A Subtle, but Crowded Comedy","Hail, Caesar! as a film feels very much like an attempt by the Coen Brothers to make an old-fashioned Hollywood film, in a day and age where it is not accepted. For those who love the films of 1950's Hollywood, and the general history of Hollywood this film is a great way to spend time. Hail, Caesar! is funny, well shot, but lacks the memorable stature of the previous Coen Brothers films. For those who love Coen Brother's films this is not there best, but is still enjoyable.Not that it is all that surprising but this film has quite a few moments that are truly laugh-out-loud funny, but the humor is more subtle. It should be noted that the film is not as funny as The Big Lebowski, so those hoping for another Coen Brothers comedy classic it may not be that funny. Another small problem with the humor is that while the film is funny, many of the funnier jokes are in the trailer, and naturally the film lacks surprises.Another trademark of the Coen Brothers is there beautiful cinematography, thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It seems ironic watching it because the film is set in 50's Hollywood and the film reels they watch look like some of the cleanest film of today. The overall look of the film is mesmerizing, and may be honored a year from now for it's cinematography. However, in many aspects the film falls short of the expectations that the Coen Brothers deserve today.While the film is a good and solid entry it has a few too many weaknesses. The villains of the film are a little weak, and because of the crowded story are never really fleshed out in a realistic way. On top of that the story is a little weak, often taking detours that aren't necessary, and often feeling as though what we're seeing isn't all that important. The film also seems to gloss over the consequences of characters actions, and tries to just be funny, but not over the top just subtly funny, which doesn't quite jive.In the end Hail, Caesar is a comedy for the thinking man who doesn't like the modern comedies that are often dumb and overbearing. Hail, Caesar is a film that looks back at 50's Hollywood lovingly, and for that reason is a great film for film buffs, especially those that love classic Hollywood. However, if you're expecting a great comedy that is both subtle, and brilliant like The Big Lebowski, this isn't quite that.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
LAFF A minute send up of Fifties Golden era Hollywood is pure Fools Gold,"BERLIN REVIEWS BY DELEON: BERLIN 66, Feb. 2016PHOTO: Hail Caesar Photo call, L-R: Swinton. Clooney, Alden Eirenreich, Josh Brolin, and Tatum ChanningBerlin 66 opened rousingly on Thursday, February 11 with multiple screenings of the new Coen Bros. Hollywood send-up ""Hail Caesar"" and a turn away overflow press conference crowd for the Jury led by Meryl Streep which was an event in itself. Day one, one might say, was all about Streep, the Coen Brothers and actor George Clooney in his best jesting form and looking great in a slick black leather jacket at the Hail Caesar press conference table.First off, a few words about the film. Manohla Dargis, in her sparkling NY Times review hit the nail squarely on the head when she called the film an ""off center comedy"" ~ as off center (flip-floppily structured) as it gets with chuckles and belly laughs all the way. To put it mildly, this in not the Co' Brothers most profound film, but it is arguably their funniest ever with a string of brilliant off-beat pearls by actors all of whom shine in their contrary off- the-wall castings. Basically this is a affectionate spoof of fifties Hollywood but much more than that, loaded with absurd humor of the kind that harks back to the Marx Brothers era.A list if the actors and their roles basically tells the story, what there is of it: Jeff Brolin, tremendous as the blustering bigger than life studio fixer draped in a double breasted suit and topped with a bulky fedora, who regularly unloads his guilt in the catholic confessional box;Clooney as a clueless movie star who gets kidnapped by the Communists and walks around through the whole picture clad in his clanky starring role Julius Caesar paraphernalia, down to leather sandals with protruding toes artfully dumbelling it as he rarely does,Scarlet Johansson in a grotesque sinful take on Fifties Simon-pure MGM superstar bathing beauty, Ester Williams! -- uglified (sic) under the Coen brothers baton... The one part that didn't grab me because I loved The real Ester Williams. Scarlet is actually grotesque in this section.Channing Tatum leading a bunch of sailors in white in a sly slightly homo-erotic take on a Gene Kelly MGM dance number -- to me, the highlight of the picture with surprisingly adept tap dancing, jumping from table to table -- this section had me stomping along to the beat in my seat --New face Alden Ehrenreich as a hilarilious acrobatic Roy Rogers ripoff whistling to his white horse then doing handstands in the saddle pursued by the bad guys -- and performing incredible rope magic, even with a strand of spaghetti in a restaurant for his girlriend --but this is only Half of cowboy star ""Hobie Doyle's comedic turn -- He is next engaged to fill in for an ailing actor in a drawing room drama exchanging ten gallon cowboy headgear for a tux and Bow tie, and called upon to mouth a clip of sophisticated dialogue which is like a foreign tongue to him -- the extended scene where his English director (Ralph Fiennes) patiently re-shoots his flubbed entry scene over and over painfully correcting the perplexed actor's stumbling delivery of his single line -- (t'were as though...) -- is a real rib tickler.Another highlight in this linkup of comical skits strung together by the ridiculous premise of Caesar discovering God on his knees at the foot of Jesus on the cross --the whole ""Hail Caesar"" business being a kind of takeoff on early fifties religious extravaganzas such as ""The Robe"" -- A satire of all-powerful Hollywood Gossip columnists who could make or break careers -- such as Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, both played sniffingly by Tilda Swinton as twin sisters ~~ All in all a hilarious piece of extra savvy entertainment and a glorious procession of contemporary stars revealing unexpected comedic chops --Well, okay, it did get to be a bit much by the end, but a very good time was had by me -- if not by All -- of the serious minded film critics and international press people around me.As far as I could tell from my front and center first row seat, I was the only one in the entire audience to burst out laughing or constantly snickering throughout the proceedings. I'll just hafta see it again with a native American audience to appreciate the collective cackle noticeably absent at this ultra-sober festivalThe crammed over flow press conference after the screening was almost equally comical. One Polish gal addressed a long long long question to Gorgeous George, who finally replied: ""Are you flirting with me? ~ it won't work because I'm a married man now!"" ~ which brought a roar of glee from the house. Most questions were, in fact, addressed to Clooney, who between sly quips that brought smiles from his colleagues at the table, finally summed it all up by saying that it was a privilege to work with such talented directors as the Coens, and above all -- FUN all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dull sketch show masquerading as a film,"It's a bit of a myth that film critics and the average cinema-goer disagree almost every time on how good a film is. The scores on aggregate sites such as Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic demonstrates that there is a clear correlation between the ratings of film critics and those of the sites users in general. However Hail, Caesar! is one of the few films to have bucked the trend. While the Rotten Tomatoes' critics score hovers in the mid 80% range, the site's users have rated it below 50%. Here on IMDb, the average rating is a pretty average 6.4/10. I suspect with its in-jokes that it is a film which speaks to the avid cinephile, but leaves most feeling cold and a little bored.Set in 1950s Hollywood, film studio executive and fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) has the job of keeping the Hollywood stars out of controversy. However, once the news that Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has disappeared, Mannix has to deal with his Communist kidnappers while ensuring that the tabloids don't get wind of what's going on. He also has to maintain good relations with unhappy director - played excellently by Ralph Fiennes - who becomes increasingly frustrated working with a talentless actor.The latter character - an actor who cannot act - is played expertly and with nuisance by Alden Ehrenreich. The rest of the film never really comes together, with one getting the impression that the movie consists of a string of sketches rather than a coherent arc. There are a few laughs, the round-table discussion about the nature of the Trinity between Mannix, a priest and a rabbi a highlight. However, the handful of chuckles are not enough to overcome this dull affair.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Squint! Squint at the grandeur!,"The promise of satire combined with so many negative audience reviews immediately got my hopes up for Hail, Caesar! Of course I chastised myself because high hopes are easily dashed. To my extreme delight this movie was not a disappointment, and had plenty of laugh out loud moments. The only thing I'd change would be to flip the second-to-last scene with the last scene to avoid ending the movie on a flat note. The complaints such as ""Meh! Not enough Jonah Hill, boo-hoo."" His character was perfect in execution, and screen time. Everything in this movie was coherent and flowed beautifully. You really do need to have a variety of knowledge to get the real humor, not just the slapstick ""Ha-ha, Sailors looking gay in a musical scene."" Josh Brolin's scene with the religious leaders was hilarious. Now I know satire is not for many, even my friend was worried a lot would go over her head. If you are someone who does enjoy it though, and you have knowledge on a variety of topics, this movie is definitely for you. I would absolutely see it in the theaters a second time. I'm sure there's so much more to discover in a second viewing. While this movie does satirize Hollywood's Golden Era, it really is relevant to today. Such as everyone complaining about this movie who try to appear cultivated and learned would be the Communist screen writers, and the ones who complain about not getting the movie and that the jokes weren't funny would be Baird Whitlock, and honestly I feel like I'm Hobie Doyle. This is not just some period piece. This current world is unfortunately overrun with Professor Marcuses, Communist Writers, and Baird Whitlocks, because I hear their nonsense spouted everyday. Satire exposes these things in a clever and humorous way, that's what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Many great actors included in this madness and they've most certainly gave their best to articulate that script, but something gives me a feeling they have had to bite their tongues through all of this torture.

A cracking film....that many don't understand,"Such a fantastic film that people just don't seem to get. I've read reviews that complain about the plot, or scenes which do not appear to be relevant, but clearly they do not understand what the film is about. ""Hail, Caesar!"" depicts a day in the life of Eddie Mannix, and the mad, often random events of the film are supposed to reflect the busy nature of his job. Excellent work from the Coen brothers, and an absolutely superb performance from Josh Brolin, who held the entire film together. At times this reminded me of the Big Lebowski, specifically its laid back tone. Perhaps not a film for everyone, but certainly not just for ""film snobs."" However, I'm not sure why they plastered Jonah Hill's face all over their marketing, as he had less than 5 minutes on screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Hail, Coens!","Hail, Caesar is written and directed by the Coen Brothers. It stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum an Ralph Finnes along with Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, and Francis McDormand.In the early 1950s, Eddie Mannix is busy at work trying to solve all the problems of the actors and filmmakers at Capitol Pictures. His latest assignments involve a disgruntled director, a singing cowboy, a beautiful swimmer and a handsome dancer. As if all this wasn't enough, Mannix faces his biggest challenge when Baird Whitlock gets kidnapped while in costume for the swords-and-sandals epic ""Hail, Caesar!"" If the studio doesn't pay $100,000, it's the end of the line for the movie star.I love the Coen Brothers. Actually let me rephrase that, I love the Coen Brothers when they are the Coen Brothers. Recently its seems to be the case that whenever a Coen Brother film comes out, it feels less like them and more like a weird version of them. Movies like A Serious Man, Burn After Reading, Lady Killers, Inside Llewellyn Davis, and to some extent, True Grit loose some of the trademark Coen Brother quirks that made films like Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and No Country for Old Men so successful. The Black Humor.I am more than happy to say that the Coens got their mojo back and produced one of their best films to date. In Hail, Caesar, its rather obvious that the two weren't put under any restraint, which resulted in what might actually be their most original-if not the funniest- film to date.Filled to the brim with high brow humor and their signature black comedy, Hail, Caesar's script floured me. A satire with intelligent and thought provoking commentary, this movie succeeds at conveying its timely messages with sledge hammer force while keeping the humor as light as a feather. I loved how easily the Brothers subverted well worn clichés to deliver a movie that is truly out of the ordinary. The Coens also manage to craft elaborately strange and entertaining characters with fascinating stories and subplots. With all that said however I did feel that part of this movie's script, especially nearing the end, began to feel a bit uneven. Though the Brothers strive to instill a profound message about life and the film industry, they come off a bit pretentious and seem to have bit of a little more than they could chew. In addition to this, some character payoffs like Tatum's and Johansson's seem way to dull in comparison to Clooney's and Brolin's. Although this may be the case this film never looses steam as the pristine direction and wonderful cast always seem ready and willing to compensateThis movie is a technical marvel that is flawless on every level. For one the production design is immaculate, instituting a firm 1950's feel with hidden references all over, like the spaghetti western. Onward to the masterful cinematography by living legend Roger Deakens, who managed to capture life in the golden age of film with just the right tint.The direction in this movie was by far the best part of Hail, Caesar. Every single shot is so inspired, its remarkable. From the fabulous musical openings for central character's, the best of which has to be Johansson's, to the precise semi-noir style of some segments, Ethan and Joel deliver, their hands down best directed film to date. My personal favorite shot is that of Josh Brolin praying to the set of the movie which truly felt like a reflection of his inner state.Speaking of Josh Brolin, he delivers a comedic performance like no other and thoroughly breaks type cast. He was remarkably nuanced, while staying true to his character. If the Oscar nominations weren't already out I would be a great advocate for his nomination along with the nomination of Alden Ehrenreich. Alden Ehrenreich was a big surprise for me as he seemed to outshine most if not all of his uber talented cast. He was funny, kind, and light hearted. Accompanying him was the ever so talented Ralph Finnes as he successfully continues his comedic endeavors.Hail, Caesar is a flawlessly directed, impeccably cast, and passionately written, resulting in one of the Coen Brother's best in years. Hail Caesar gets an A- or a 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
No city for sensible men - a mis-step for the Coen Brothers,"If you're a cinephile, then you'll definitely be a fan of at least 1 of the Coen Brothers movies, who have truly made some great modern films that are off beat but delightful and even dark at times. Even if you're not, you'll find that you have enjoyed some of their output over the years without knowing it. However, nobody is perfect, and I think is a bit of mis-step for me.We have an incredible ensemble of stars, most of whom were likely climbing over each other to get a chance to star in this movie! In fairness, they all do aptly well in what they have to do. The direction and humour as ever are wonderful, as well as very topical and satrical writing, finding cerebal moments in otherwise scatty & dark situations.The problem is though that the storyline just doesn't work, and maybe is trying to be clever and comes off as dumb. Hard to take serious enough, as we see Hollywood in its golden era behind the curtains, only to find it is as nefarious and slapstick off screen as on screen.There isn't much more to say here. It has all the ingredients to be a great film, but it all just falls flat on its face. Not by any means a poor film but a letdown nonetheless. However if you liked ""The Ballad of Buster Scraggs"" then maybe this film is more for you than for me. I hope the Coen Brother get back on track for the next film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"All ""Hail""","Joel and Ethan Coen are serious auteurs who make serious movies, like ""A Serious Man,"" and are meant to be taken seriously. So it's only fitting that their newest movie,""Hail, Caesar!,"" would be seriously funny.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is tasked with maintaining the status quo for Capital Pictures, an early 1950s film studio. Over the course of twenty-four hours he must deal with the hugest star in his biggest film (George Clooney) being kidnapped, a popular leading lady (Scarlett Johansson) revealing that she is pregnant and unmarried, a self-important director (Ralph Fiennes) being saddled with a well meaning, yet out of place western star, and twin gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton and Tilda Swinton) hounding him at every turn.If that sounds like way too much to cram into a brisk hour-and-a-half comedy, that's because it is. The movie doesn't dwell on any one subplot for too long, but instead gives us fun, often silly glimpses into scenes out of extinct Hollywood genres. Johansson dons a mermaid tail, and swims about in a synchronized dance routine straight out of a Lloyd Bacon flick. Channing Tatum plays Burt Gurney, a James Cagney stand-in, as he shows off his long dormant dancing skills in an amazingly homoerotic musical number that's infectiously charming. And Clooney, who plays the childish Baird Whitlock, somehow makes you believe that he's too ditzy to be on the set of a ""Cleopatra"" rip-off.In spite of these seemingly unrelated vignettes, or more likely because of them, the odd political ramblings, or the momentary flashes of religious symbolism seem to carry a legitimate artistic weight. The movie has something to say about artistic freedom and the working class, and has strong nihilistic undertones, as most famously immortalized in the Coens' cult classic, ""The Big Lebowski."" What ""Hail, Caesar!"" is saying in specific, I couldn't tell you; I was too busy staring at Channing Tatum's feet. And his well toned ass.That's not to say that the movie is a masterpiece. It doesn't reach the emotional heights of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" and I don't know that it will ever be quite as quotable as ""Lebowski"" (though I will add ""would that it were so simple"" to my list of usable set phrases). Jonah Hill is criminally underutilized, and his comedic talents are almost entirely wasted. Likewise, Frances McDormand does virtually nothing, and seems to have a part in the film just because she's married to Joel. The former ""Fargo"" leading lady is relegated to the editing room, where she gets one sight gag, and is never seen again thereafter.These gripes, however, are easily overlooked. There's so much fun crammed into every sequence, and every shot has some joke or sight gag to enjoy. Somehow, it's also thematically dense enough to make me want to see it again. And again. And again.Besides, if Scarlett Johansson in a mermaid costume and Channing Tatum in a 1940s sailor outfit don't excite you, nothing in this review could have convinced you to see this movie anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a total flop !,"Coen Bros, bless them really made this movie for their own pleasure. And. I dare say they enjoyed the finished product ?Thats all well and good, they obviously were not concerned what the paying public might think, or even , possibly take a walk out of the theatre..

need to bring some pretty specific tools with him or her ! The more intimate knowledge of as many previous and a numerous genre
of movies, mostly serious and a few suspense , comedy and maybe political tales , the more COENS pin their hopes on the viewing
publics pleasure. Caesar is simply a ploy to get as many ticket buyers as possible ? The jokes are all sometimes intricately entwined
for hearty mirth and other times stand out obvious hilarity. So, if similar to me, over the decades you have missed some excellent movies ,
you sir or madam have a serious opportunity of losing out on very much, if any of the usual COENS quirky brilliant humour ?I think thus far is quite enough ramblings from me , therefore if you can steel yourselves to this film, I wish you luck and true pleasure...",3.0,Anonymous,Music
I especially enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance!,"'HAIL, CAESAR!': Four Stars (Out of Five)The Coen Brothers' new comedy flick; about a ""fixer"", in 1950s Hollywood, trying to deal with the abduction of a popular movie star (and other various scandals, involving celebrities). The movie stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill and Frances McDormand. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, directed, edited and co- produced the flick; and (like all their films) it's gotten rave reviews from critics. It didn't perform that well at the Box Office though. I really enjoyed it.Brolin plays Eddie Mannix; a ""fixer"", who keeps celebrity scandals out of the news. His employers' latest big production is a biblical tale, called 'Hail, Caesar!'. The film's star, Baird Whitlock (Clooney), was recently abducted from the set. It's Eddie's job to get him back, while also fending off other negative news stories; involving a pregnant (unwed) starlet, and a rising Western film star (Ehrenreich).The movie is just as odd, crazy and quirky, as you'd expect any Coen Brothers' movie to be. I had heard this film was kind of dull (and slow) though; but I didn't find that to be the case. I love all of the movie's elaborate dance scenes, and it's insightful look at 1950s Hollywood. The characters are all funny, and quite likable, in it. I especially enjoyed Alden Ehrenreich's performance; for me, the movie is all about him. He's set to play a young 'Han Solo', in an upcoming 'STAR WARS' flick; and after seeing this movie, I think he'll do an awesome job. Clooney is pretty good in the film too. It's a lot of fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail Mary Full of Grace,"I went looking for a character arc but there was little to find.The set pieces are enjoyable, who doesn't like a well rehearsed musical.I'll never be able to get used to breaking the 4th wall during the action but that's just me.The religious consultation was very well written, the Coen brothers have a strong eye for detail which makes them a fairly regular success but this film was too slow overall for modern audiences.The communist sub plot was nice but it was juxtaposed around characters we didn't really care for.This film plays out like it was written in 6 acts instead of 3 and each one had a different lead writer. You would think with how careful studios are now that they would have sent this back before turning on the lights. There are hundreds of spec scripts that blow it out of the water.I loved the log line as an industry insider and welcomed the story telling but I understand why so many felt this project was an utter waste of their time.There were some big names that got very little screen time. There were pages and pages of description that didn't move the story forward and neglected the obvious capital on the set. It's a very weird outcome for experienced film makers like this.

I thought for a moment, then replied, ""I'll bet that most people didn't get the humor, to which he replied, ""I think you're right!"" You must go into this film realizing that it's all humor, not a serious line in the movie, and that it's very subtle in many cases.

Beware,"HAIL, CEASAR!: I don't know what they were trying to do with this one. Is it a satire? Is it a parody of 1950's American film? (Possibly) I don't think the Coen brothers knew either. There're snippets of a big sailor dance number, a water ballet, a religious epic about the crucifixion, a classic Western horseback chase and shooting, a director directing, an editor editing, with appearances of gossip columnists, plus several other classical film genres and old Hollywood lore with a litany of A-listers in cameo roles all of which were supposed to be funny but fall dreadfully flat. The paper thin plot revolves around the kidnapping of leading man Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the star of the aforementioned sword and sandals epic, by a group of Communist writers and the efforts of studio head (Josh Brolin) to get him back. Except for the three chuckles elicited, I was bored to death by this colossal waste of time.

"Intelligent, Witty, Honest - Yet possibly unappealing.","The Coen Brothers are incredible, simply put. You can call them overrated, you can call them too artsy, you can call them bizarre; call them whatever you like, but they are some damn fine film makers. They give interesting, original insights to film, and always put effort into their work.A lot of the gags of the film, however, rely a bit on knowledge of the glory days of '40s-'50s cinema, which brings me to the film's biggest issue; some people will not find it funny. This is simply because some people will not have enough of an understanding of the comedy, or it simply wouldn't be their cup of tea. The main source of laughs is the satire and almost spoof-like riffs on post-WW2 cinema, with spoofs of over-the-top westerns and synchronized swimming sequences, as well as soppy melodramas and espionage spy films.The cast is great - particularly George Clooney as the dim-witted actor Baird Whitlock and Josh Brolin as tough guy ""fixer"" Eddie Mannix. Alden Ehrenreich's role is a nice addition to the film's great cast. He brings a young, fresh faced charm and charisma to his role,while Ralph Fiennes and Scarlett Johannson are hilarious in their side-character roles. However,some of the other roles, such as those from Jonah Hill and Tilda Swinton, are in glorified cameos that were prominently featured in marketing for the film. I can see many being upset that the actors and actresses in said roles were given only a few minutes of screen time.Hail, Caesar! is a solid, thought-provoking offering from the Coen Brothers. It benefits from a strong cast, consistent laughs and snappy writing. However, it is slightly undermined by an occasionally jumbled plot structure, and a possibly unappealing comedic style.Morally speaking, Hail, Caesar! is a tale of humans attempting and sometimes failing to do the right thing, while also trying to make themselves better. It's this timeless, empathetic theme that makes Hail, Caesar! a worthy inclusion to The Coen Brothers' already- stacked arsenal of filmography.Rating: 7.5/10 - Worth-While Watch",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Definitely a Coen brothers picture...,"There are people who love the Coen Brothers, people who hate them and people, like me, who are ambivalent. For a frame of reference, I enjoyed Hudsucker Proxy and Oh Brother Where Art Thou, but couldn't get into Big Lebowski, and could take or leave Fargo, and No Country for old men and True Grit left me a bit flat. So now that a baseline is established...Like many of the Coen brothers movies, this featured characters who were over the top to the point of being caricatures. The cinematography was superb and the dialog was clever and delivered well. I have to say the actors did tremendous jobs with their over the top characters. I also enjoyed the sense of nostalgia, for the seedy tabloid days of Hollywood, where the studios control the image of the actors as much as they control what happens on the screen.The problem I had with the movie was that it was a collection of amusing scenes that didn't pile together to create a good movie. They spent so much time making fun of everything (religion, actors, directors, etc) that the satire wore thin and became stilted. At times the caricatures also devolved into stereotyping.I wouldn't recommend this to people, but I wouldn't say it's a total waste. I know there were Coen brother fans in the theater for the sneak preview who seemed excited to talk about the movie after (mostly with comments about mainstream movie goers), so there are definitely people who this would appeal to.

Fun film for fans of Hollywood history,"I would not call myself a Coen Brothers fan, though I do generally enjoy most of their films. This one was particularly enjoyable, however, for its reliance on Hollywood history for both characters and storyline. But that reliance is also one of it two failings. In order to enjoy the film properly, the viewer really does need to know quite a lot about the Hollywood film industry in the decade following WWII. I suspect a great many of the references are lost on the under-40 or even under-50 generation. How many people under 40 have ever heard of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons and are thus able to connect Tilda Swinton's two characters to those Hollywood legends, for example? Likewise, how many viewers born after 1970 would immediately recognize Carlota Valdez as the real-life Carmen Miranda when Hobie Doyle/Alden Ehrenreich asks her how she dances with bananas on her head?If you really know your Hollywood and film history, this is a very enjoyable and amusing film. But if you do not have that historical knowledge, Hail Caesar may only leave you puzzled.The second failing was the awkward ending. The film just stops, without rhyme or reason. Totally unsatisfying.Still, Channing Tatum practically steals the film with his singing-and- homosexually-suggestively-dancing Burt Gurney, so clearly based on a mix of Gene Kelly and Tab Hunter.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A so-called comedy that is not worth hailing,"I love the Hollywood movies from the 1940s and 1950s, so i was really looking forward to seeing this Coen brothers' effort.

I enjoyed many earlier Coen brothers' movies including Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, Intolerable Cruelty and Burn After Reading, so maybe i had high expectations. This one was however dismally trite. The only actor who provided a bright spark was Channing Tatum. Unlike the classics from that period, Hail, Caesar! will not stand the test of time.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Slapdash Unfunny Affair,"lavished 4.5 stars on Hail, Caesar! but it just didn't work for me. I love movies by the Coen brothers and they seldom ever missed its mark, but this one did. It is a satire of Hollywood filmmaking in the 1950s, complete with Astaire and Rogers tap dancing sequence, Esther Williams' synchronised swim-dance, the communist left wing insurgency, the Hollywood classic aspect ratio and even the gossip columnist of that bygone era. But everything feels so slapdash with little regard given to a already flimsy plot. The characters didn't lift off the screen and feel so dull. Sure, there are some surreal scenes with dry wit, but this is no The Grand Budapest Hotel. This all style and no substance, and mostly dull and uninspired. I struggled to keep awake but I was weak; I kept hoping something will happen and the whole movie will lift off. I should have left with a couple midway through the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Romans before slaves,"Two days in the life of a fixer-producer for a Hollywood studio, when he's confronted with the potential scandal of a pregnant starlet, having to shoe-horn a rodeo clown into the lead part in a sophisticated drama, and - worst of all - recovering his biggest star from the clutches of kidnappers before the production of Hail Caesar collapses.Quality comedy that could have done with a bit more edge. Not laugh-a- minute, but there are some great scenes - the stand out is the tap- dancing sailors who, after lamenting the prospect of life at sea without dames, are told they're ""gonna have to beat it"". Also the scene where the religious leaders squabble over the depiction of Jesus in film.Lots of nice performances in mostly nod-'n-wink gags about the period. The lead plays a similar role to that in Inherent Vice. But strangely Johansson makes another underpowered pop-up appearance.Looks superb and sounds good. Big themes too - capitalism, communism, Marxism, Christianity speaking truth to power, the choice between creation and destruction. As usual the Coens give plenty to chew over in the way they dramatise the intellectual content.Overall, a bit short - could have done with tying all the plot lines together in a mind boggling maze of insanity. Plus I would have preferred more of a noir vibe, with some real menace. But it's a good movie and doesn't deserve all the criticism thrown its way.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Mediocre Madness,"I've never been a huge Coen brothers fan so I entered the cinema without any bias when I went to see Hail, Caesar! And whilst I hadn't heard many great things about this film, I don't think it was as bad as people have made it out to be.Everything about this film was reminiscent of the golden age of cinema – the costumes, the quick-witted dialogue and repetitive gags and of course you couldn't go past the fact that there were multiple nods to the most epic 'epic' of all time, Ben-Hur.There were cameos galore, although this might have been to the film's own detriment as opposed to its enhancement. It sometimes felt like the Entourage movie, or the end of Anchorman 2, when stars were on and off screen almost as much as the relationship between any Hollywood A-lister couple. And whilst performances were fantastic by both seasoned stars (Josh Brolin, George Clooney and Ralph Fiennes) and promising up-and- comers (such as Alden Ehrenreich), this wasn't enough to distinguish this film amongst previous Coen brothers success stories.All in all, it left me asking the question, 'What was the point?' there ultimately may not have been one, or I may have just missed it. Hail, Caesar! may not have been an epic success story but it doesn't deserve the abundance of rotten tomatoes being thrown its way.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Glitz aside, it is a droll comedy","It is dumbfounding that Coen Brothers' much-anticipated all-star period comedy had been slated to a dumpster February release earlier this year, which received a lukewarm attendance both from audience and critics. HAIL, CAESAR! ostentatiously settles into the less vaunted category of Coen Brothers' comprehensively well-appreciated oeuvre - a droll comedy sans palpable grittiness, threatening violence or gallows humor, more ebullient in its tenor and visual dimension, a closer cousin of A SERIOUS MAN (2009), O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) and THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998), rather than their award-reaping vehicles such as BARTON FINK (1991), FARGO (1996) and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007),This time the milieu is in Hollywood's Golden Age, more specifically, 1951, a glittery insider-story of movie business told from the studio executive and producer Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a real-life character infamous for his ""fixer"" obligation - to whitewash all kinds of unsavory private lives of Hollywood stars, in order to maintain their public image and not jeopardize the merchandize they are headlining. Yes, most of its star-cast gets their inspiration from real people, sometimes a combo of several, it is all for oldie-savants to trace and locate their references.The main hurdle for Eddie on that day is something could be made into a big fuss, but plays out in a much unruffled manner, the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock (a goofily personable Clooney in a suit of Roman armors, plays dumb and ingenuous at full tilt), currently engaged in shooting their heavily-budgeted production, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, is abducted from the set and therefore, Eddie has to gather the ransom and deliver it, which seems to be a cinch for him, as he casually packs the money into a briefcase and drifts through different sound stages, parries the harassment from the rivaling tabloid columnist twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker (a brash Swinton in her gaudy attire), multi-tasks and mediates various emergencies on the sets.Meanwhile, we have no trepidation about Baird's safety, he is kidnapped by a crop of Communist screenwriters, as a means to extort their shortchanged paycheck by churning out scripts for the big-boss studio, an in-joke cues the HUAC scandal in 1947 and with the involvement of a particular Mr. Marcuse, Coen brothers' sophisticated humor shtick is not at all instantly raucous, but stirs some indelible comic reverberations in after effect, especially when a USSR submarine solemnly emerges in the midnight just to pick up that one specific comrade, it is inwardly sidesplitting, although, the upshot of the ransom has plunged deadly into platitude, no way Coen Brothers would allow that money to fall into the hands of Communists.An omnipresent smirky levity hovers around the whole movie, the cast is well assigned to their particular sphere of personae, Channing Tatum is still handsome and nimble-footed a decade after his STEP UP (2006) days; Scarlett Johansson is a twice-married prima donna now gets knocked up with a director (Lambert) who will not acknowledge the affair, owns the most gorgeous set piece as a mermaid among a team of dual-colored synchronized swimmers. Josh Brolin stylishly enjoys a field-day of all the hustle and bustle, the only problem of his Eddie is that he confesses too often about his cigarette-snuffing. But, unexpectedly, the biggest asset of this comedy is Alden Ehrenreich, who doesn't even have his own picture on the poster, he plays Hobie Doyle, a young upstart in the showbiz who wins audience in Western pics for his cowboy antics, and is cast by the producers to star in his first non-Western high-class drama talkie, directed by the acclaimed European director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes), the segment where he is harangued by Mr. Laurentz to rectify his drawling intonation and hillbilly accent is comedy of the highest calibre, Alden also does an extraordinary job with dexterous élan when he is required, he is definitely the cynosure against a more well-established thespians, a brilliant cast call as the young Han Solo, and HAIL, CAESAR! is his four-square stepping stone into stardom.Last but not the least, about the legendary DP Roger Deakins, who has blessed this film with an utterly glittery veneer of this line-of-work's sleekness and glamor, incredulously counterpoints what lies beneath, its wackiness, idealism, hypocrisy, partisanship and depravity, all reflected from self-mocking lens of the two from the in-crowd.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
What's the point?,"OK.. In very little words, this was a total waste of my time. I got hustled by the cast (Fiennes, Clooney) which acted amazing as always, play was amazing and that is where my 4 goes. But what exactly was that they were acting? And why did they sign up for this?Everything else, from story (non existent), storytelling (don't let me go there), comedy(where?), point (whaaat?) and the worst part is that the filmmakers obviously wanted to ""pass"" a point in the worst way...which I am sure got lost somewhere from the beginning to the end.Worst movie I got hustled to see in many years and I don't easily fall for these kind of complete fails that should not even be called a movie. It certainly cannot hold the genre ""Comedy"", but it can live up to the ""Mystery"" part, as I was trying to find clues for where the comedy was during the whole movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A refreshing return to comedy for the Coens,"You have to love movies to make a movie like Hail, Caesar! We're thrust into the hectic world of a big-picture studio, with Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) trying to keep all of his plates spinning, be they the production of movies, the love lives of their stars, or keeping their scandals out of the newspapers. That's a tale that could be trite and uninteresting in the wrong hands, but the Coen brothers weave it with sincerity and fun, blending parody with homage.It's amazing that any big-budget movie survives to completion, and Hail, Caesar! is no exception. There are many faces required to be in big movies, and many crew members to film them. To make a movie about big movies, you have to go big, too. We have lavish synchronized swims, huge sound stages for ancient Rome, fancy drawing rooms, corny dance numbers, and a Western so bad it's good.The Coen brothers give us a small lesson in Hegelianism which Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) eats up faster than a crustless sandwich. Could the motion picture industry create the death of itself? Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas claimed as much three years ago. Surely, if the spectacular movie is powerful enough to maintain its survival, the spectacular movie is equally capable of destroying itself.There are genuinely good performances by pretty much everyone in the huge cast, especially from Brolin, Clooney, Channing Tatum, Tilda Swinton, Alden Ehrenreich, and Ralph Fiennes. Mannix tries so hard and so calmly to keep the studio and its employees progressing, but we ultimately leave with a sense of fatalism and the nagging suspicion that none of his actions directly solved any of the studio's problems.It's a refreshing return to comedy for the Coen brothers, who had huge misses with The Ladykillers and Burn After Reading.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Deep entry necessary, but well worth it","The Coens usually combine wit and accessibility in a formula that works for many audiences. Here, the wit is sly, scattered, and arcane, like a foreign delicacy. Slow to bind into one set of meanings, it requires patience; however, in the end, it's worth the effort. The Coens are depicting the dream factory of mid-century Hollywood (""Pictchas""); how it drew marginals into its mainstream; and the competing missions and claims on that industry. Their main observation is about actors and movies, not about ideology; for that reason, the character played by Clooney is a vessel for anybody's ideas. The ideological polarities of 2015 will drive some informed viewers into opposition because the Coens offend almost everyone and tend to use caricature. Woody Allen would have had less trouble making this essay, and the Coens might have looked for a unifying context -- perhaps, with everyone working on a single film, not several. However, Hail Caesar works for those who stay and pay attention, and its final scenes are brilliant and insightful.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Appallingly awful,"No-one in this mess of a movie comes out of it with any credit except maybe Arlen. He was not only convincing as a not-so-dumb cowboy star he rather appealed to the viewer on screen. The Coen brothers have made some wonderful films but this, most definitely was not one of them. I daresay they were able to attract the stars that appeared purely on their reputation as filmmakers. Judging by the people in the movie I think it may have been made well before it's actual release date as I think it must have taken forever to form the dull script into some kind of releasable order. Clooney ought to rethink what he gets involved in or his career is likely to go into steep decline. It is boring, preachy, confusing and I found it difficult to believe that good actors were content to take part in this nonsense. Making a movie that people are going to enjoy and take away something with them is no easy feat and it proves that even the best writers and directors can make stinkers sometimes.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoied it as a homage to the Hollywood Studio System of yesteryear.,"For those of us who enjoy movies made in the Golden age of the silver screen and are fans, you'll love Hail, Caesar! even more as it is the perfect satire to that era, pin pointing certain issue of the time, like Alden Ehrenreich playing Hobie Doyle, an actor so perfectly type cast as a Cowboy that he can't do anything else. One of the funniest parts in the movie is when Ralph Fiennes who plays a director tries to give the Heavy accent buckaroo dialog lessons. Scarlett Johansson playing an American sweetheart whose being forced by the studio to marry, so that she will not have her baby out of wedlock. Then there's the part of the movie which reflects how a lot of screenwriters who wrote some of Hollywood's biggest pictures of the time had interest in the Communist party, which makes me reminisce of the Bryan Cranston starring film, Trumbo.I'm surprise how little an element of homophobia was mixed into the content, but I guess that is a cliché done too many times.All of this was being kept in line by Hollywood Fixer, Eddie Mannix played by Josh Brolin, in what seem to be just a normal day at the office, which happens to include the kidnapping of a major movie star, played by Major movie star, George Clooney, just before he was about to finished the final scene of Capital Studios' biggest film of the year, Hail, Caesar!Advertised in the trailer to be the main plot, the kidnapping feels as much of a subplot as everything else, but does intertwine with the other subplots more regularly, with the main plot being more about the duties of Eddie Mannix in the Star System of Hollywood, so don't get too wrapped up in the plot, because it does not work too well as a linear narrative, that's not the point, the point is that the movie does a brilliant job of reflecting that time and era, with a slightly surrealistic approach that was golden age Hollywood. Even using CGI backdrops that make the film look like it was made in a sound stage of the 1950s.It's another great Cohen Brothers movie worth getting into.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Sort of a yawn.,"Don't know what to say about this one. Coen brothers reaching kind of deep to pan the Hollywood clichés and stereotypes of yore. Only one knowledgeable of typical Gene Kelly, Esther Williams musicals, Roy Rogers/Gene Autry (can't remember which) westerns would actually ""get"" any of the material they're trying to poke fun at. Another cliché, the old Christian epic (Ben Hur, The Robe, etc), is made fun of but in a kind of strange offbeat manner, almost semi-serious but obviously satire. And it seems that blacklisted screen writers association with, or accused of associating with communists has become a Hollywood cliché (maybe after the release of Trumbo last year?), for the Coen boys languishingly poke fun at that too. You might actually ""get in"" to an actually well produced dance ensemble, but will have to check yourself - ""Wait, this is a spoof. I should be laughing at this, not actually enjoying the dancing itself."" It's almost like the Coen brothers are saying, ""Gotcha!"" As if they're mocking your reaction, not the old, Hollywood clichés themselves. Who knows? Who cares? I only spent money to get in to see the ""Deadpool"" which my kids roped me into taking them.

Because many of these references are obscure, they're likely of little value to a general audience; because they're too glib, they may even offend cinephiles. Overall, the film is rather mundane. That the movie's production design was nominated for an Academy Award is also surprising in that it appears to have been crafted to be on the same level of a Universal Studios tour attraction.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Brilliant FILM! Any Review Under a 7.5 is Nucking Futs,"I enjoyed this film a lot & was captivated throughout.. I read some of these ""bad"" reviews by bad reviewers which simply tells me that it's either one of two things 1. The reviewer is under 35 & haven't the clue that the film industry was ran exactly the way the story is told they set up couples for photo ops, hid or got rid of pregnancies they pretty much did whatever necessary to keep that squeaky clean image because the actors were considered American royalty plus all of this was going on during the cold war with Russia & some actors were blacklisted for having ties to the communist party 2. The reviewer went in expecting to do nothing but laugh but was disappointed when they realized some brain function would be required to understand the beauty of this gem of a FILM so once the brain started working all they heard was Charlie Browns teacher.. I've always felt a film has so much more in it than a movie.. Movies are thoughtless with laughs or frights throughout & usually have bland plots but a film has it all it forces you to think, to get involved with the characters, it will have you laughing one second but wondering what to expect the next & will is evoke different emotions throughout as this film did for me..

Disjointed,"Was this a comedy? A drama? Who knows! I had a ""Free HBO"" weekend earlier this month, so I took advantage of it to watch Hail Caesar, a movie that sounded pretty good when I saw the trailer a few years ago. But I was younger and stupider then.Was it a comedy? If so, why wasn't it funny? ""Would that it twere so simple"" stopped being funny long before they finally stopped saying it.Was it a drama? If so, why didn't it keep me at the edge of my seat? The movie opens with George Clooney's character being kidnapped, and leaves us in suspense as to why. Well, not that much suspense, really. I stayed with this film for over an hour before I finally turned it off. I still don't know why he was kidnapped. And I don't care. And never will.Scarlett Johansson was solid as a hard-bitten 1930's type movie star. But George Clooney was just ... George Clooney in a toga. If he had walked into the studio cold and read his lines from cue cards, I don't think his performance would have been substantially different. Or perhaps we were supposed to believe that George Clooney in a toga is an inherently funny premise, and the mere sight of it would keep us in stitches throughout the movie? There were also a lot of pointless scenes. The swimming musical number at the beginning could easily have been cut out of the movie without losing anything. But then again, so could most of the other scenes in the movie. I understand from some previous reviewers that the swimming scene was intended to be a homage to the Esther Williams movies of the 1930's and 1940's. And indeed it was -- if ""homage"" is French for boring pointless imitation.Because I didn't watch the last half hour, I have to confess that the ending could well be a thrilling laugh-filled adventure that pulls the whole movie together and leaves the audience stunned with the brilliance of the film and its commentary on both Depression-era and contemporary Hollywood.

The problem with this movie is a horribly undeveloped plot and characters that are never developed or really significant at all to the story. You see this big name cast advertised, but for no reason whatsoever. Outside of Brolin and Clooney, practically no other characters are on screen for more than a couple of minutes, or are relevant to the story. Scarlett Johansson is completely irrelevant to the story, as is Channing Tatum. Jonah Hill phones in a bit part that had no point in even existing. The only supporting actor that really shines in their brief time on screen is Alden Ehrenreich, who is terrific. Sadly, he is introduced and then exits just as fast.

This film should be renamed Hail Cohen Brothers, for where would we be without the idiosyncrasies of those two that bring us the most splendid offering from all that Wood that is Holly. Hail Caesar is a segmented collection of paragraphs that slot together to make a whole story with the common denominator being Eddie Maddix, the studio boss who is holding it all together. Juggling the problems of all his stars, he is wrestling with his own demons as he is being head hunted for another job. As in all Cohen Brothers films it takes a while before the plot gels together and you are floundering around for a good half of the film before the light bulb is turned on and you begin to understand how everything is linked. A whole host of stars gather together for this production, including George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson and not forgetting that marvellous song and dance scene featuring Channing Tatum which was not dissimilar to Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in 'On the Town' combined with a little of South Pacific.

It is probably the funniest of all the Coen brothers' films, with unbelievably great comedic performances by Brolin, Clooney, Johansson, Fiennes, Tatum, Swinton, McDormand, Hill and literally all the rest of the cast.

"Another cast of characters, another task for Eddie Mannix.","Hail Caesar! is great fun, following the adventures of a group of characters all involved with the fictional Capitol Pictures first seen in the Coen brothers film Barton Fink(but, more than a decade later.) At a few times this is its greatest weakness though, jumping from story to story to story without returning to the last one for a long time. Not to worry though, as almost all of the stories coalesce together at the end.The stories are all linked by the central character, Eddie Mannix, a fixer for the studio who deals with potential bad PR and assorted other problems. Over the course of three days he has to deal with various troublesome actors, religious moral watchdog groups, a pair of nosy gossip columnists, an old studio scandal, and the main story the kidnapping of Hail Caesar!'s star. All of this while having his own problem of balancing his stressful job and a family at home.Hail Caesar! is a great look at the movie industry back in the waning studio days of the 1950's.

A great film!... and misunderstood by quite a few around here it seems.,"In Barton Fink, maybe the best Coen's movie so far, the introspective story of a screenplay writer in Hollywood's 30's is told. Coming from a totally different world, John Turturro's personage is engulfed by the pitiless machinery of the Hollywood industry.We move some 15 years ahead and we are there again, same place, and pretty much the same story, but told in an totally different way, with comedy prevailing over drama (many of the commentators here seem actually to have entirely missed this last part, I'm sorry for them), and several story threads going their own way or intermingling with each other instead of a straight symbolic story with just 2-3 personages like in Barton.The film is as much a homage to Hollywood as it is a sharp criticism. The number of references to classical Hollywood (films, actors, stories...) is uncountable, and only those who are true film lovers and have some background in cinema history, and actually history in general, will be able to fully enjoy it (might this be the reason why so many seem to be disappointed and delivering bad, and totally foolish, criticism...)The screenplay is one of the most intelligent in films about filmmaking. The comedy parts are great, but that's just an aspect of the film, which has a lot more to dig into, although often disguised as a comedy, which may have mislead many fellow commentators around here.Ave Cesar shows how filmmaking actually is, or was in retrospective back in the 50's; showing for instance the hard work behind a wonderfully crafted scene when we see it on the screen (someone here complained about the scared expression of Scarlett Johansson when role-playing an Esther Williams' alter ego!!!, is it possible he didn't realize that that expression was meant exactly to be like that???). This is just an example, but go see the film, and you will find lots like this. Then add a general tone of comedy, some crazy story threads like the one of the communist group kidnapping poor ""Messala"" (McCarthy was right in the end!!!), and you get Hail Caesar!, for sure one of the best films this year. But do not expect a plain comedy or you may end up disappointed.A last hint, pay attention to two scenes: the encounter of the Roman centurion with Jesus Christ, look at the color of Christ's hair... then the final speech of this centurion at the foot of the cross and the effect it has on the audience there (the technical staff working in the film)... there is a lot to dig into in those two simple and, apparently, just comedic scenes, as there is throughout the film, but you will have to be a bit insightful to fully enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A Pretty-Looking Dud,"The Coen brothers have done just about everything right for most of their careers. Their line of work is diverse, and fabulously off-beat. They find the humor and horror of both real and absurd situations. Hail, Caesar must be another hit, right? I sat through most of the film beside myself. It's a tribute to post-war, old-Hollywood, which is great and all.. but this was marketed as a comedy, and I never laughed. Where were the jokes? The irony? There is plenty of humor to be had at this bygone era, and the Coens didn't explore. The film relies heavily on perfectly constructed, whimsical set pieces and the pretty faces of it's all-star ensemble cast. Glitz and glamour only takes a film so far. If the story and characters are hollow, everything else will be. The critics adored this when it came out last year, which just goes to show you how much these old fossils love gushing over themselves and the industry they represent. This is not one of the Coen's finer hours. I guess if i didn't like this, I better never consider watching Rules Don't Apply? Yeah, sounds like a good idea to me.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar! Review","Hail, Caesar! (2016) Starring: Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, and Jonah Hill Written & Directed By: Joel & Ethan Coen Review LIGHTS, CAMERA, ABDUCTION When I first saw this film on people's most anticipated list or just on the internet I was like ""Meh"". But when I saw a TV spot for the film I was like ""Oh my goodness, I gotta see this."" I love seeing movies with ensemble casts when I notice them, and this one had more than enough actors, I liked with Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, and Jonah Hill a bunch of actors I liked so I went to see it just for these guys. Tells the comedic tale of Eddie Mannix, a fixer who worked for the Hollywood studios in the 1950s. The story finds him at work when a star mysteriously disappears in the middle of filming. The film pays way to tribute to 1950s Hollywood witch is my favorite aspect of the film and Brolins character Eddie is like the big boss making sure everything is alright so the pictures are scheduled to be released on time. It reminded me of how when I first started getting into 7 years ago I wanted to be an actor as oppose to a film critic. I'm giving Hail, Caesar! a five out of five for it's great direction, good acting, and writing.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Maybe we just expect too much?,"I, like many of you have all the Coen Brothers movie's. While I like and appreciate all of them for various reasons... This just was a bad movie. Regardless of who made it. I have watched a few times now, spread out over last few weeks and going in with an open mind and willingness to give it another try. Its not happening this time. The movie just seems like they phoned it in. Or its an imitation of their work by a lesser talent. There are times where you can admit something is bad, because it is and you're not saying their entire body of work is awful or they have no talent. That's ridiculous obviously. This movie just seems like left over scenes from Hudsucker Proxy type outtakes, put together and we love it because of who is in it. This, in my humble opinion is their worst movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Welcome Back- a brilliant effort!,"I was knocked off kilter by the last Coen Bros movie I saw, which was ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" .I panned it , even though the hipsters and the intelligentsia seemed to love it.Then I thought to myself ""It's probably because you're not as smart as those guys, you shouldn't get above your station in life"".Now the hipsters and the pundits are lukewarm about this one and I think it's just a cracker of a show.Because of this I've realized that I AM smarter than most of the other reviewers.Llewyn Davis was an aimless movie about an aimless character and if there were any subtleties in the plot they were buried so deeply that you had to be the writer to get them.This one, though, was a full blown satirical masterpiece, capturing perfectly the manipulative nature of the studios and the media of the day.Cheating, lies, and the aforementioned manipulation, have always been the order of the day in entertainment and politics. This film sends those traits up to perfection, managing at the same time to make hilarious fun of the political altruists of the time.(To think that some of us believed in that stuff back then).Brolin was fantastic in his role, the best performance I've seen him in since ""No country for Old Men"". Clooney too was brilliant and just as captivating as he was in ""Oh Brother"". Alden Ehrenreich is just too good to describe as he plays so brilliantly off Ralph Fiennes. Scarlett Johansson is also fabulous, milking the Hollywood star role for all it's worth. I could single everyone out but suffice to say that there isn't a bad performance.Tie together all of this stellar acting with a brilliant script and perfect cinematography and you have one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I must mention the music before I go, it is used very sparingly in this story but when it is used it fits so well that you appreciate the genius of the Director. Not to spoil anything, but there is a musical type song and dance scene that matches ANY scene from Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly, you will be enthralled by it! If you're as smart as I am (as I said already) you'll laugh and chuckle your way through the best couple of hours of entertainment you could wish for.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oh Coen brothers, what have you done.... and why?","I am a fan of the Coen brother's films in general, but they can get lost in an idea. This was definitely one of those films. When it ended, all I could say was ""What???"" Seriously, only one of the 'story lines' concludes with anything more thought out than ""Good enough, next!"" The only reason it satisfied at all was because it was the only one that involved the only actual character. This is yet another Hollywood jerk off. Don't waste your time.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
A misunderstood instant classic,"Many emotions came to me as I was watching 'Hail, Caesar!'. There was shock, laughter and confusion. Only the Coen Bros. can pull that off flawlessly and that's exactly what 'Hail, Caesar!' does.Just like Eddie Mannix says in the film 'Hail, Caesar!' is a prestigious film that dives into old Hollywood and shows a glimpse at the curtain of Hollywood movie magic. 'Hail, Caesar!' is the best movie about Hollywood in the 1950s since Sunset Boulevard.Hail, Caesar! stars Josh Brolin who plays Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood fixer, that has to find the biggest movie star Baird Whitlock, played by George Clooney, so he can finish filming the studio's biggest movie, 'Hail, Caesar!'. But that's not all this movies about. We have Mannix trying to figure out his life, fix a Hollywood actresses image and getting a cowboy actor to do a dramatic role. This movie is basically about everything. When I heard people saying that this movie was bad and complicated it reminded me of people's first reaction to Inherent Vice. But after seeing 'Hail, Caesar!' I can definitely say that this movie is pretty straightforward but can get weird, Coen Bros. weird. It's a really convicting screenplay with great direction from the Coens.The performances are great in 'Hail, Caesar!'.This has to be the most star studded cast of 2016. We have the Coen Bros. staples like Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton but we also have Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, Wayne Knight and newcomer Alden Ehrenreich. Ehrenreich gives the standout performance as Hobie Doyle. His character is an actor who's mostly in westerns and is out in a dramatic role where the director finds out he can't act. It makes for one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But the real standout is Josh Brolin. This is probably Brolin's best role since No Country for Old Men. His character has so many subtleties that make you want to know more about this guy. He has a great scene with a Priest and a Rabbi about the depiction of Jesus in the film that was honestly the best part of the movie.If I had to say any problems with 'Hail, Caesar!' it could be the ending. I personally liked the ending a lot but I could understand why some people could be turned off by it. It's a lot like other Coen Bros. movies where it ends very abruptly but they do it in a way that's almost genius. I've heard some people complain about some tone shifts but I think it was one tone throughout and it did its job spectacularly with that. It felt like the 50s and had great commentary on filmmaking back then and filmmaking now.While most people will go and see a weird attempt at quirkiness from the Coen Bros. others will see the genius that is 'Hail, Caesar!' It's a hilarious look at Hollywood and the film industry that will surely entertain.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A very disappointing Coen brothers movie,"The Coen brothers make a lot of movies and some are better than others. This one is among the worst. The satirical targets are easy, the jokes thoroughly predictable, the plot ... well, it's another kidnap, another ransom note, another fade out. I seriously wonder why they bothered making it when it so closely resembles what they have done before. I couldn't believe the repeated use of the old sword joke, and the scene at the foot of the cross. Was there anything that wasn't as old as the hills? It was the Coen brothers so the stars queued up for their brief appearances, maybe because they were so stereotypical the demands made on their skill were minimal. To be fair, the direction was as good as ever and there were one or two scenes that did impress but what a disappointment from such talent! Their movie making career is starting to resemble that of Woody Allen.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar!","Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) works for the fictitious studio hybrid Capitol Pictures, (that is the only fictitious angle about this film, however). Mannix is a fixer, the one responsible for repairing the issues of his acting stars, keeping the religious leaders happy with the morals of the films of his studio's, and securing the money stays in the right places for film production. Mannix leads a busy life, but he is sure to make time for his daily stop to his Catholic Church's confessional. Despite the Priest's urging that his practice is excessive, Mannix still shows up, desperate to make amends for his transgressions, also to work through his own issues with his faith. During a typical day of dealing with pregnant single movie stars, placating religious leaders, and casting dilemmas, Mannix is dealt an extreme blow that his biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped. Those responsible for the stars kidnapping, who refer to themselves as ""The Future"" promise the safe return of the studio's star in exchange for $100,000. Not only does Mannix have to scrounge up the funds to pay off the ransom, but he has to do it while keeping the situation out of the gossip columns running Hollywood public opinion. All of Mannix's problems may be solved, however, if he accepts a surprise offer in management at the Lockheed Corporation overseeing secret atomic bomb testing. Does Mannix really want to leave behind his chaotic role at the studio, or is such the profession exactly what he needs for the self-discovery he so seeks.The first and most obvious point to be made about the film is that it looks incredible. The use of color and the cinematography are works of art, leaping off the screen. It is no wonder the film was nominated for Best Production design, as the many large and elaborate sets were astonishing. Filming several movie sets is no small task. but the team behind Hail, Caesar! really pulled it off. Near the opening of the film, Brolin's character is discussing the depiction of Jesus in one of the studio's upcoming films with Priests, a Rabbi, and an Imam Khatib (maybe); this scene could come directly out of a joke, but it is complete perfection and timely in the film. It was a brilliant scene exposing, without a doubt, the faith-based journey the audience was about to take. What was an especially fun aspect of the film were the obvious caricatures of actors, directors, and producers from the studio era. As a fan of classic film, seeing such personalities as Ernst Lubitsch exaggerated on-screen was a true delight. There were also several notable supporting stars in the film it was a joy to see who would turn up next. Ever since I first saw Patrick Fischler in Mulholland Dr. I've wanted to see him in everything and was overjoyed that he briefly showed up in Hail, Caesar!. Typical of the Coen Brother's films, there was some brilliant camera angles to enjoy including wonderful low-angle, birds-eye-view shots and perfect shadow manipulation creating a beautiful film to look at. One of my favorite aspects of Hail, Caesar! was the frequency with which the audience gets to see the film from a perspective usually ignored. The camera is typically trained on the star of the film, but seeing the POV of an extra looking up at Baird Whitlock and all of his imperfections was a nice change. Whether it be a picture, a film, or anything else, I am always interested in what's going on in the background; what is it that is not being shown for a litany of reasons, and with Hail, Caesar! It is that background activity that gets such high regard, a refreshing angle for a film.My favorite aspect of a Coen brothers film is the subtext. Even if I am not always a fan of the duo's work, the fact that each of their films are riddled with subtext create, at least, an engaging film-watching experience. The takeaway from Hail, Caesar!, for me anyway is its subtext on faith and religion. It's clear that the character embodied by Josh Brolin is grappling with his faith throughout the film. He takes time out of his schedule daily to go to confession, he deals with the religious depiction in his studio's films seriously and even has a God-like job himself. Brolin's Mannix is responsible for removing problems and making sure everyone's life is as painless as possible all the while controlling the flow of money and output of his studio. People turn to him when experiencing problems, much like they turn to Christ to help cope. In the end, Mannix is offered a job to help protect the lives of the whole world, furthering his relation to an omnipresent being. Evaluating faith and religion in such a way was a serious strength to Hail, Caesar!. A deeper evaluation of faith and religion should be explored through cinema, as it is the medium with which art is nearly limitless. The Coen brothers, never to shy away from depth in their films, strike gold again with a thorough analysis of faith, and what it means to adhere to a religion. If you examine Hail, Caesar! on its own, rather than an entry in the filmography of the Coen brothers, a deeper appreciation may be able to be experienced for a wonderful film with a rich, much-needed subtext.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Not so funny,A Hollywood fixer exerts a tough authority upon all those who work in the studios slapping their faces inclusive. He has also problems with two lady journalists. This is supposed to be a comedy but it is not so funny indeed. It deals with earnest things such as religion and communism. Two excellent actors like George Clooney and Ralph Fiennes are ill-spent in this movie. I went to see it because I have read some favourable reviews on a newspaper including from critics I respect but frankly I don't know what they have seen in this movie that I cannot see. Some scenes are even ludicrous. The main story is about making a film about the life of Christ. We see also there shootings of other movies such as a musical and a western. The characters are faint and unconvincing.,4.0,Anonymous,Music
Hail Tilda!,"I just finished watching ""Hail, Caesar"". This is a new Coen Brothers film which pays homage to the film studios in their waning days of 1950s Biblical spectacle and Western singing cowboy flicks. It follows a classic one-day pattern of starting in the morning of one day and ending about 24 hours later in the morning of the next day. Tilda Swinton steals the movie despite only appearing on-screen for about four or five minutes. She plays feuding twin sister columnists, based on the rivalry between Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. TS is phenomenal, creating two completely individual characters using voice inflection, facial tics, posture, attitude, and costumes (including fabulous HATS, natch!). George Clooney does a sort-of reprise of his befuddled goofball from ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", but he is not as successful this time, IMO. Josh Brolin plays the main character, a grizzled studio 'fixer' who must deal with the disappearance of a big star in the midst of shooting the climax to the titular epic tale of Jesus Christ and a Roman soldier's conversion at The Crucifixion. Josh does a great job, capturing the rhythms of the Coens' zany dialogue and satirical tone, without going completely over-the-top. Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, and Alden Ehrenreich also do outstanding work in this loaded ensemble piece. Other notable actors appearing briefly include Clancy Brown, Fisher Stevens, Frances McDormand, Christopher Lambert, Ralph Fiennes, and Jonah Hill. I loved it, and I look forward to re-watches just for the pleasure of Tilda's acting.""Hah! Would that it were so simple!""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Hail, the Coen Brothers fail!","Hail, Caesar!, a so called ""screw-ball"" Coen Brothers comedy which doubles up as a way for the Brothers to showcase their love for all things old school Hollywood, sees the two esteemed filmmakers get lost in themselves in largely boorish fashion with a cinematic experience that easily ranks amongst their most average of films.This average experience stems from a film that is concerned almost exclusively with a narrative that has no real drive and no real reason to make us care and while loose narratives can work and have worked for the Coen's with gems like The Big Lebowski and to a lesser extent Inside Llewyn Davis, Hail, Caesar! has neither the wit, charisma or characters to make this seem like anything more than the filmmakers excuse to do a few song and dance numbers and play dress ups with their A-list cast.The plot, if there is actually such a thing harboured within the film, sees Josh Brolin's lifeless studio fixer Eddie Mannix stumbling around studio backlots and seedy Chinese restaurants whilst George Clooney's kidnapped actor Baird Whitlock converses with his academic captors over a few finger sandwiches. It's a plot that's not enough to hold our interest and a plot that never really allows any serious laughs in a film that should've had quite a few and while the film certainly looks lovely thanks to the to be expected great work of DOP Roger Deakin's and the newly announced young Han Solo Alden Ehrenreich shows himself to be quite the find, Hail, Caesar! just never gels into a cohesive whole and feels like an experience of the Coen Brothers parodying themselves into a corner.Hugely disappointing and entirely forgettable, Hail, Caesar! marks a low point in the Coen Brothers modern day repertoire and will surely go down as one of their greatest missed opportunities when all is considered from cast, setting right through to material that should've suited their unique sensibilities.Saved from the doldrums thanks to some sporadic scenes of life and colour and some neat cameos from the Coen Brothers extensive list of A-list friends, Hail, Caesar! is hopefully a rare blip on the usually stellar Coen Brothers radar.2 dangerously positioned scarf's out of 5",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Coen Brothers!","Hail, Caesar! is written & directed by Joel & Ethan Coen and stars Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.Set in the heart of 1950s Hollywood filmmaking, follow a day in the life of Capitol Pictures fixer Eddie Mannix, who solves problems for stars in the industry. When Baird Whitlock, the star of Hail, Caeser! goes missing, Eddie must deal with more than just the fix.THE COEN BROTHERS return with another beautiful piece of cinema. The 50s have never looked better on-screen with their incredible direction and charming screenplay. Roger Deakins teams up with the Bros. yet again with some of the most stunning visuals seen this year. It's unfortunate that this film has seen mostly bad reviews, and I can see where most people are coming from when I read through them. But as with all of the Coen Bros. films, the audience is split right down the middle. You either love or you hate, there is no in between. I personally found this to be a wonderful experience, I chuckled countable times throughout and whilst it's not the most complex story, there definitely is one present. I've seen a few people say it's just a lot of random scenes thrown together, but I didn't think it was like that at all. The best way to watch a film is to go in with no expectations. I saw this thinking it was going to be bad because I had read reviews but I came out with a smile on my face.Josh Brolin and George Clooney steal the screen with their ingenious and genuine performances, given the circumstances of the plot. The advertising may have you believe there's a lot of big names featured in the film - Jonah Hill is one of them - but they only have a short amount of screen time. Ralph Fiennes was brilliant in his scenes with Alden Ehrenreich, truly great chemistry and very simple writing, but the way it was delivered made it seem genius.Music by returning regular Carter Burwell was just as great as his previous work with the Coen's and approaches with huge choirs and orchestral movements. It feels aged and this is what is so brilliant about his work on this film. It blends in perfectly. Another beautiful score I'll be purchasing.The Coen's direct in such a complex way, that you can watch their films over and over again and pick up on things you may have missed the first time round. They capture the art of filmmaking in the 50s to a tee. It's a comedy satire, and it's extraordinarily good. The musical & dance numbers are also surprisingly catchy and fun to watch. Overall, it's not hilariously funny - but then it's not hilariously bad, either. It's a nice medium.My verdict; Hail, Caesar! triumphs in its old fashioned and simple storytelling and will not disappoint the fans. Spend a day in 1950s Hollywood and see this film in cinemas.Hail, Caesar!, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Hail the Coen Brothers!,"The weird and hugely wonderful Coen Brothers strike again with a movie that's as odd as it is dry. The movie focuses around film studio 'fixer' Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Any complication the studio has, he will suppress. Many burdens need tackling on this particular day; a star on their latest blockbuster goes, twin reporters working for different papers harass him, an insufferable actor who lacks talent, and an actress lacking romance. Brolin crosses the tees and dots the eyes, linking all the other film's participants into one erratic comedy. The dialogue flourishes, the farce entertains and the production's a blast to the past, with a few hidden easter eggs to boot.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A refreshing look at Hollywood's studio business in the 50s,"One of the first scenes shows a man sitting in a car watching a house in the distance, rain is falling, a voice from the off says something about the time 5 a.m. and how this is sleeping time for most people but for some it is working hours... With this tribute to the film noir such as ""The Naked City"" (1948) the mood is set. And so it went on with tributes to pictures and movie genres. Epic films like ""Ben Hur"", Esther Williams with synchronised swimmers, Western movies, dancing sailors that have Gene Kelly written all over it. It has it all. Someone had already made a reference to Woody Allens ""Radio Days"". I agree. This has a similar feeling. The Coen Brothers, however, look at it in a satirical, not to say critical way and show the square and bourgeois way of life in the 50s. Illegitimate pregnancy or homosexuality are fatal for a career in the studios, and there is of course a reference to the McCarthy era. It is a great joke, though, that the screenplay writers who had kidnapped the movie star (Clooney) are indeed upright communists. And Clooney, typically cast as the idiot in a Coen picture, ends up studying Marx' ""Kapital"" with his kidnappers. The comedy in ""Hail, Cesar!"" is rather subtle, and the actual story is not at all complex and quickly told. Instead there are scenes, such as the aforementioned dancing sailors, that don't drive the plot forward at all. Maybe that's a reason for the mixed reviews. It didn't bother me. I enjoyed ""Hail, Cesar!"". A lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Mediocre/10,"I've called the Coen bros. my favourite directors in the past, so in spite of some poor marketing I was enthusiastic going into this movie. That didn't really last. It's got its moments, sure, and there's nothing wrong with it on the technical, artistic or acting end of things, but... the plot is just... uncommitted? I said shortly after seeing it that I felt like it couldn't decide between having a main plot and being an ensemble comedy, so it winds up not really committing to either. It's got a main plot, but the film seemingly only remembers to address it every 20 minutes or so. There are also a few subplots, but few of them ever go anywhere. And then there's the padding. So.

Incredibly rewarding for fans of classic Hollywood,"A rambling shaggy dog story set in Hollywood of the 1950's ... a movie star (George Clooney) is kidnapped off the set of a Biblical epic he's starring in. There are a couple of distinct but related subplots, and all of it ties back to studio exec Josh Brolin trying to put out all the fires while considering a better job offer from Lockheed. Every once in a while, the Coens make a film simply because it amuses them and allows them to exercise their love of classic Hollywood. This is one of those. They stage multiple scenes from films being made by this studio ... musicals, westerns, comedies, epics ... and each is a meticulously recreated pastiche of a 50's film. If you're on their wavelength, it's immensely rewarding. If you're not, it's a bunch of stars gathered together for a plot that ultimately goes almost nowhere. I'm in the first camp ...

Nothing really happens.,"As a fan of the Coen Brothers work, I have to admit to being a little let down by this entry. To me, this film was love letter to Hollywood that seemed to forget to have an actual story around the various odes to classic cinema that surrounds it. There are some attempted funny moments, and the film sure is gorges to look at, as one would expect from something put together from Roger Deakins. It does for sure make itself highly respectful to that golden age Hollywood scene, capturing all the magic and the wonder that was in cinema at that time, and I always enjoy peeking behind the curtian to see the inner makings. We also have a large cast of good actors attempting to make it all work.Where this film falls flat is all down to the writing. Basically, there is no story to this movie, at least, not a very good or memorable one, it does not get above the flash, it always loses flair. There are attempts to make commentary on the red threat which was big in Hollywood at that time, but they really do nothing with it, and all the odes feel quite forced and shoved in. It is all very surface.This is a well made movie. A well acted movie. Basically everything in this movie works except the storytelling, which needs to be strong, to a certain level, for it all to bookend.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Thin slice, great body !","The film ""Hail Caesar"" is an excellent example how someone can take a very thin slice and give it a full body from attention to details embodied by underacting actors and make it very interesting... ...its an extremely thin slice (best way to describe the lack of plot), a story coveted by loose threads and unresolved anecdotes, but by the means of great direction and great actors forced into underacting, they manage to pull of something which is really really interesting... there is a Fargo'sk lack of ambition which eventually turns out to reach far higher than any ambitious act attempting to depict the same or more, the Coen trademark... a flick where the after-movie experience is just as great as the in-movie experience... highly recommended ! Casting alert: Josh Brolin is incredible as the underplayed main play... Spoiler alert: Clooney and Scarlett J. basically plays themselves while Tatum only plays two parts, the drunk, tap-dancing, singing & swinging, homo-erotic Sailor and the patriotic pet- loving Russian Spy... not sure if that says more about Tatum, the Coen bros or Clooney & Johansson... Second spoiler alert: The unfitting musical intermezzo featuring Tatum is actually well choreographed and should deserve a mention of its own... very odd episode, which really seems to have no point, its absolute disconnect from the rest of the story is provocative... perhaps a dozy period in the post-production or perhaps a stroke of pure psychological genius by the Coen bros as it comes at a time in the storyline which actually calls for relief... I guess only a F2F with the Coen fellas would help to clarify if this truly is a stroke of genius or just good luck...

Average...,"The Coen Brothers are geniuses. No two options on that. And sometimes, even the best of the minds around us, stumble & deliver something not very exciting. 'Hail, Caesar!' by the Coen Brothers, is their first downer in a long time, but with some really good performances & silliness, the one's a celebrated failure.'Hail, Caesar!' Synopsis: A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s works to keep the studio's stars in line.'Hail, Caesar!' isn't engaging enough & that's its biggest minus. The Coen's have a fun story to tell, but it doesn't translate on-screen as this big-fat tribute to the Golden-Age of Hollywood. The Characters are amusing, so are some of the dialogue, but beyond a point, the narrative just doesn't hold. The Coen's Screenplay is surely underwhelming this time around. Even their Direction, though passion driven, isn't remotely among their best.'Hail, Caesar!' has a tremendous cast & they all seem deliver. Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix, the protagonist, is reliably solid, delivering an arresting performance as the Fixer. George Clooney has never been this funny. He doesn't have a lot of scenes, but whenever he does get on-screen, he puts on goofiness with flourish. Alden Ehrenreich is an actor to watch. He's fantastic! Among the many cameos, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Christopher Lambert are truly terrific.

"The best Coen Bros. movie in a long while, but that's not saying much.","Hail, Ceasar! is the best movie the Coens have strung together in a long time, but despite all its star power and Hollywood setting, it's still not stellar. The Coens tend to have many more misses than hits (hint, the misses are their pompous movies) but I was genuinely delighted in watching Hail, Ceasar! for parts. It's a light comedy with a few clever moments, sets, and a plot, like Eddie Mannix's watch, that keeps tick-tick-ticking along.Venerated actors Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, and Ralph Fiennes are all here, it's great to see Patrick Fischler still weirding it up. Even Scarlett Johansson, who is *not* a great actress, delivers a solid performance as a loud, bossy chain smoker. Maybe she's playing herself or something, but future archivists of the boring will point to this film and say, ""Here! Finally! The proof that she wasn't *just* a curvy woman with big lips!""Also present is the gross, unfunny, weird ""comedian"" Jonah Hill. He has about 90 seconds of screen time and he says about three lines.Blink.A standout performance is Alden Ehrenreich. I've never seen him in anything before, but it's obvious he's a great actor. I was surprised with Channing Tatum as well. I always thought of him as being a meathead, but he's not GI Joe anymore. George Clooney is also back doing what he does best: playing an idiot. It comes so naturally to him! I also like that he gets slapped in the face towards the end. I had to TiVo that one.Is the film without flaw? No, no, no. Michael Gamdon (of all people) narrates the movie in intervals, like the cowboy character from The Big Lebowski. Although I love Gamdon, his entire narration was unnecessary. Showy, even. Maybe the Coens included it for the sake of rounding out their list of ""motifs"" (eg., plots revolving around stolen money, an ""unstoppable evil,"" casting the same stable of actors, pretentious narration, etc) but the narration ripped me out of the moment. I found it patronizing, even.Additionally, I didn't like the entire element revolving around Jesus Christ. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Jesus-freak: I just don't like making fun of faiths. At the film's start there's a roundtable discussion with a group of Christian priests and a single rabbi. Every character at the table, apart from Brolin's character, is a cliché. Additionally, the rabbi is the only sensible one there. The priests all act like (dumb) mystics.Christ's golden locks, multiple confessional scenes with bored priests, and the Crucifixion (featuring a a hapless extra strung up on the cross) are all depicted. Nothing too offensive, really, I guess... all tongue in cheek, all in good fun (I guess...) It just annoys me how Christ is the only religious figurehead that you can comfortably poke fun at nowadays. I think the Coens are showing ignorance by making fun of Christ, unfortunately.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Just Not Funny,"I have tried to watch this movie a few times, and I can never get through it.The first of the Coen 'noncomedies' to crash into the side of the mountain.Really bad casting of people who simply can't pull off that style of acting.I remember Clooney being funny.But the rest is horrible.I'm making it a 3/10, because I can see it maybe being up someone's alley; and quite frankly, there's 4s I'd rather watch.I must now filibuster for the minimum character congress:

"An Average Coen Brothers Affair,","Hail, Caesar is a mediocre movie with a mostly poorly developed plot, albeit a fantastic cast. The only thing that really holds it all together is the pure talent and charisma of the actors. Josh Brolin is suave in his performance, Clooney brings in laughs, playing yet another fool for the Coen brothers. Every cast member is complex enough in their performance that they exceed in both dramatic and comedic moments, which includes Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum.Its biggest weakness is its lack of a plot, it has one, very small story that does not consistently move forward, instead there is simply one sequence after another of films being made. Joel and Etan Coen clearly fell in love with the idea of recreating 1950s Hollywood that they forgot to tell a story that has a proper beginning, middle and end.It is also not very funny. I find the Coen brothers very hit and miss with comedy, I favour them using it subtly in their dramas. Full sequences that were clearly made with the objective of making us laugh did nothing for me, it became tiresome for me after a certain period of time as a result of how often the humour bombed.It is certainly a beautiful spectacle, even if there's not much more to it beyond that. Much more potential than it delivers, Hail Caesar is one you would be better off avoiding.A detective who specialises in Hollywood stars investigates the disappearance of a well known actor.Best Performance: Josh Brolin",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A highly entertaining and sadly panned comedy from the Coen brothers,"A Hollywood fixer in the 1950s tries to recover a leading star after a kidnapping. Of course, this is the Coen brothers so things won't be that straight-forward. Sadly, audiences seem to have responded really badly to this. The main reaction seems to have been what Ralph Fiennes and Alden Ehrenreich say repeatedly in one of the film's most hilarious scenes (And the scene which formed the basis for my favourite trailer of any 2016 film): ""Would that it were so simple?"". Hail, Caesar! is a complicated movie which goes in many unexpected directions and most of the actors featured prominently in the trailers only have cameos. Admittedly, HC is a somewhat incoherent movie and there are moments where the pace slackens. But it's still a genuinely good movie. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is very pleasing without being overly flashy and the script is full of clever humour and wonderful Hollywood homages. Like always with the Coen brothers it's never superficial and there's plenty of hidden depth beneath the surface here. It's a very enjoyable, light-hearted and fun movie which I enjoyed and everyone who I went to see it with enjoyed it as well. It may not be your sort of thing, but if you know what you're getting and if the film's admittedly self-indulgent nature doesn't bother you too much you're in for a fun time.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasantly Vanilla,"'Hail, Caesar!' was the first movie I saw in the theatre in 2016. Being familiar with 'The Big Lebowski' by the Coen Brothers in 1998, I was expecting something similar here (nuanced characters, satire, clever dialogue, humorous undertone). I found this film to be well put together. While there is nothing particularly memorable about it, I think the heart and care was definitely in there somewhere. I found it to be a thoughtful production with the clever dialogue I expected and humour, however there was nothing very interesting in the way of nuanced characters or challenging plot. I understood the overarching theme as a lighthearted ode to one of the ""golden ages"" of Hollywood, but I didn't walk out of the theatre with much memory of it. It had a mild flavor that lasts very briefly. Sort of like an avocado. Perhaps that was the purpose though.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Refreshing ,Without Filling","So, what do you want, for $7.50 ?

"From the writers of ""A Simple Man""","This is clearly a Coen Bros film, but a very tedious one. I laughed a few times, but mostly wanted many scenes to be over. It reminded me of my experience watching ""A Simple Man"": some few inspired moments, but it doesn't add up and overall is underwhelming.I understand that it is a meditation on religious worship vs cinematic celebrity, but just because a movie has a theme or symbolism doesn't mean that it is good. The narrative structure is rather poor, and some satirical scenes felt like padded extra time. I left with the impression that the Coens only had enough material for an inspired satirical short film about a 1950s biblical epic, but decided to expand it into a feature length film by making it a larger exploration of the dark side of classic Hollywood and the deification of celebrities. However, characters take center place, then drop off, re-appear into the story suddenly and without reason or narrative build up, and then the shift is back to the Clooney story, or Brolin's character.Coens' checklist:-a criminal plot that goes wrong: check. There's even a briefcase. -men in power sitting behind desks: repeatedly, check. -a main character gets punched/shot in the face: slapped repeatedly -morality and religious themes: check -literary and classic film references: check -a hit-man or bounty hunter: not really. Brolin's character is portrayed as a studio's version of a mob enforcer, but that's as close as it gets. -regular cast members: Mrs. Coen, Clooney, Brolin.Highlights: an inspired discussion between religious leaders over the portrayal of Jesus on film. The revelation of who the kidnappers are and their agenda. An over-the-top golden-haired Jesus. Discussion of the Jonah Hill's character, a professional fake person. Discussion of needing to distrust extras. The actor playing Jesus being asked about his cast status. It (almost) ends with a good joke, in the final scene about Clooney shooting a movie (although the momentum is lost). Alden Ehrenreich's character's date with a Carmen Miranda type. A few mildly amusing other jokes. Tilda Swinton's character had its moments, but this character has been done quite a few times before.Really tedious: almost every re-creation of movies being shot, and fresh cuts of the movies. They're impressively faithful, the actors appropriate, but they drag, have no pace, don't know when to end, and aren't funny. I am guessing that they were meant to be criticisms of those movies and how they were shot, to remove the glamour and holiness of 1940s/50s films, but they are shot in what appears to be a tone-deaf comedic tone.Out-of-place: the sub-plot of Scarlett Johansson's character.Summary: disappointing Coens. I would have preferred the shorter film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Hail, Caesar!Disgracefully, in the 1950s only white actors were cast for communist roles in Hollywood movies.Fortunately, this comedy offers some enlightenment on the cultural insensitivity of ""Redface"".Employed by Capitol Pictures to protect their stars from public scandal, Mannix (Josh Brolin) faces an array of back-lot indignities, including: a pregnant starlet (Scarlett Johansson), an inept heartthrob (Alden Ehrenreich), twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) and a leading man (George Clooney) who has been shanghaied by communists within the studio (Channing Tatum, Fisher Stevens).The Coen Brothers' ambitious but aimless attempt at lampooning the low-end genre pictures of post-war Hollywood and the escalating red menace therein, Hail Caesar does have some noteworthy odes to old Hollywood. Unfortunately, they never coalesce with the larger story, which seriously lacks the siblings' eccentric brand of humor.Besides, the best way to catch commie actors is to stakeout the pot of borscht at craft services.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Confusing,"Well, this was confusing. Somewhere underneath there is a smart story that is unfortunately buried under several plot threads and a revolving door of characters that come and go before you have a chance to know them. Even the main leads don't leave much of an impression on you and nobody's story is really fleshed out.That's my biggest problem is just how short this movie feels. It's like a 2+ hour film that got cut to just the basics of the story. It all feels rushed and hasty.But Hail, Caesar is not all bad. It's an entertaining film with great humour and many laugh out loud scenes. It has a story with some interesting metaphors about religion. An okay film, in short. But since it's the Coen brothers you naturally expect something more. At least something that isn't a confusing mess.I would only recommend this film to people who are already fans of the Coen brothers style. If you are one of them this film might of be of interest to you, but I'm not sure what it would do to anyone else. Overall it is a mediocre film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Cameo-fest. Not Entertaining,"In the 1950s Capital Pictures is making a movie about Jesus Christ called ""Hail Caesar"" starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Long story short, he gets kidnapped and Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), production executive, runs around trying to solve movie production problems with the stars and learns about the ransom demand for the return of Whitlock.The most exciting and entertaining scene in here is with Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehreneich) a cowboy movie star. While waiting for a starlit to take to his cowboy movie premier we see him practice with his rope and boy is he good. We could have watched him for a longer time, butThe rest of the movie is not as entertaining or interesting. Eddie Mannix solves problems on the run and do we care? No. Eddie is offered a big job with an aircraft company and he has a decision to make. Do we care? Not at all.Nothing is funny or even clever. Who wrote this? We do see different movie scenes as they rehearse for the real thing when the cameras do roll later on. Do we care? No. The Sailor dance sequence was okay, but was too long in this non-plot movie.The kidnapping leaves Whitlock with impressions that the movie capitalist system keeps the little guy down and he's on board with that. He likes what he hears This and the kidnapping itself takes care of the main plot, if it was a plot at all. But to be fair we are very impressed with Clooney's Whitlock when he talks about the Christ on the Cross in front of the Cross. Very moving and could have been used in a legitimate Jesus Christ story. Very moving.Notables that really don't add much to the movie and why they are there is a mystery because there wasn't much of a plot to get excited about: Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Robert Picardo, David Krumholtz.After watching this I have to ask myself why was this movie made as it was not entertaining, had no real plot, had no funny or even clever lines. It was more like a cameo-fest with no purpose. To put it frankly we didn't care about anything in this movie. Yes, the acting was good all around, but nothing went anywhere and oh, we just didn't care. See? (3/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Not too funny as its been said,"Hail, Caesar! is another Coen Brothers film and this film takes place during the 1950's. Described as a comedy, though this film's humor is very much subjective as most of what is occurring isn't quite funny. No laughs, but some decent scenes by the musicals and overall chemistry of the cast. Hail, Caesar may be considered one of the Coen Brothers more disappointing films as this film had much hype surrounding it leading up to its release, especially considering the cast.Though the highlight of the film is the character of relatively new comer and future star Alden Ehrenreich. The leads of Josh Brolin and George Clooney play their typical act. Scarlett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill don't have as much screen time as their names were advertised. It did not produce as well at the box office as the studios expected and it appears this film was not as successful or liked among movie goers. This is more of a required taste but one can understand why many reviews are saying it is boring and doesn't offer much of interest.

Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy.,"I like movies as much as the next connoisseur of film, but clearly the Coen Brothers like them more than I do. Specifically, they like the films made during the ""golden age"" of Hollywood: the 1950's. From action-packed westerns, to Biblical epics, to underwater choreography, to big-budget musicals, these films exemplified a Hollywood that was on top of its game. Unfortunately, as is the case with any great success, it can be hard to maintain over time. In what could be considered a ""love letter"" to a Hollywood of the past, the Coen Brothers bring all these films together in Hail, Caesar! (2016).While I could appreciate the references made throughout this film, many of them felt quite disjointed. Sure, there's the tie-in to real-life Hollywood fixer, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), but he merely acts as a link between scenes of grandeur meant to show how well the Coen Brothers can follow the homages of the famous films they're parodying. In fact, some of these segments are almost uncomfortably long, with little point other than to show off a well-known genre or style (or to beat a joke to death). As a result, the pacing of this film feels quite staggered and the plot on the light side.Admittedly, Hail, Caesar! is fun, with some good bits interspersed throughout. The ""red scare"" starting to gain relevance in the timeframe leads to quite a bit of comedy, the meeting to ensure nobody is ""offended"" is hilarious, and even some of the film segments are amusing as well. We do get to Channing Tatum's singing and dancing skills on full display in this film, but it's hardly enough to save it from itself. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated what the Coen Brothers were trying to do here (and it wasn't necessarily to poke fun at Ben-Hur (1959)), but it never felt coherent enough to be good.Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy, I give Hail, Caesar! 2.5 stars out of 5.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Just a little piece of Hollywood under the magnifying glass,"""Hail Caesar"" is billed as a comedy and mystery, but is mostly a satire of Hollywood. It has very little humor in the dialog, and unless one knows history, much of the plot may not make sense. That includes American history of the mid-20th century, and knowledge about Hollywood in the first half of the last century. With some knowledge in those areas, one can follow the plot and appreciate the humor in the exaggerated scenarios. An example of the latter is when some of the Hollywood communist cell take a small boat to deliver an agent and the ransom money to a Soviet submarine that surfaces off the coast of California.The film covers some of the culture of Hollywood at mid-20th century. But also omits mention of much of it that became known over time. Hollywood had many a scandal over drugs, crime and sex. In the main character, Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), the film tends to idolize the studio head. It puts Mannix on a pedestal for his 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, in which he holds the studio together. So, all of what Mannix does is whitewashed as essential to protect the stars, the studios, etc.One interesting inclusion is Tilda Swinton who plays sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker. They are supposed to be Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, who were not real sisters. They were the famous Hollywood gossip columnists since the early 1930s. The little stories that Mannix has to play them to print or not print pale compared to the real stuff that the two rival columnists produced, publicized, promoted or buried.Other things about Hollywood of the time are barely mentioned or not at all. The assaults and murders, suicides and mysterious deaths, adulterous affairs, alcoholism and drug use, car accidents and many other real troubles that actors got into and that Hollywood tried to covere up. There's no mention here of the sex exploits of some studio heads with young actresses that could determine their careers. Enough real news and exposes have come out of Hollywood since before the mid-20th century, to conclude that Hollywood was a sordid sector of society.So, that's a list of some of the usual goings-on in and around Hollywood at least into the mid-20th century. This film skips or skims over much of that, but not all. It does have a pregnancy out of wedlock that is covered up, with a twist so that it doesn't look exactly like a couple of real instances.Instead, the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, take aim at the mid-20h century. And specifically, the time of the communist scares and type of film output from Hollywood then. It's somewhat of a social agenda about Hollywood kowtowing to the politics of the day. This is where some knowledge of history helps one follow the script.The House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the influence of Communism in the entertainment field. The period was often labeled the McCarthy era, after Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy who said that communists infiltrated the U.S. State Department in numbers, and were gaining control throughout government. McCarthy had phony lists and in the end could produce very few names in support of his claims.But, public concern was fanned when real Soviet spies were caught or uncovered and Soviet individuals began defecting. This was happening in the U.S. England, Canada and other Western countries. A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain"" is the story of a Soviet code worker in the U.S.S.R. embassy in Canada who defected. He provided information that uncovered an extensive Soviet espionage network in Canada and the U.S. It had been stealing American atomic secrets since the end of World War II. In 1953, the U.S. executed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their spy activities for the Soviet Union. As with most events in history, some people thought the Rosenbergs were innocent or had been railroaded. But much evidence was uncovered in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union that detailed the great amount of espionage they had done for the U.S.S.R. 
 
This time also was at the height of the Cold War when tensions between the Soviet Union and the West were near fever pitch. At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe. So most of those countries were under communist rule and weren't free until after the 1990 collapse of the U.S.S.R. The nuclear arms race was on between the Soviets and the U.S. Those who lived during that time well remember the air raid drills in the schools. By 1962, the U.S. and Russia would be near a nuclear war when Pres. John Kennedy ordered a naval roadblock to stock the Soviets from installing nuclear missiles in Cuba aimed at the U.S.I can't imagine that people without much knowledge of history would find this entertaining or be able to make much sense of it. As one who remembers the political history, I found ""Hail, Caesar"" just somewhat interesting. It was a recap of some bits of Hollywood history. But, it gosed over the real scandals The plot with the studio magnate, Mannix, seemed somewhat contrived. Yet, one could see it was needed to connect the rest of the parts of the film. With very little humor, this movie soon becomes tiring. That's not a very good recommendation for any movie.The funniest line in the film was by Hobie Doyle, the Western star, played by Alden Ehrenreich. Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) asks him, ""How did you get into pictures, Hobie?"" He replies, ""Got roped into it.""",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you love old movies, you're be disappointed by this","Hail, Caesar! fails to deliver on its promise of a send-up of the filmic confections of Hollywood's golden age. There are two fundamental problems: pacing and performance.For an homage to rise above pastiche, the actors need to believe in their roles. They can't mock, they need to be who they are mocking. Most of the actors here seemed to be phoning it in. ""I can do a pretty good Gene Kelly impression."" ""You want '40s dame, I can give you '40s dame."" Impressions don't work in a movie. No one cares about an impressionist. And here's the thing: if you're doing Gene Kelly in ""On the Town,"" you need a better dancer. At least the chorus should have been better dancers. No shame having the background outshine the leads in a big musical number, in fact it's a grand old tradition (see John Brascia in ""White Christmas"" - since Donald O'Connor was too busy and his role went to Danny Kaye, there was no male lead of Vera-Ellen's calibre for the dance numbers). If you watch the actual movies from this era, you'll notice that every dancer is *on*. Every last member of the chorus is giving it 110% every minute that they're on screen. Not a single sailor in Channing Tatum's big dance scene - including Channing Tatum - seems to be enjoying himself. They all look like they're worried about putting a foot wrong. Periodically flashing a smile on cue, but generally a bit serious and glum.One could argue that Tatum's character seemed distracted because he was actually embroiled in a communist plot, but in that era, no minor or major crisis would stop you from giving it all on screen and smiling regardless. Just ask Judy Garland. George Clooney got it; he bought his character. What he did in the crucifixion scene is what they should have been trying to do the whole film - the performer buying it whole hog and giving a million percent, despite his own apathetic and mercenary feelings about the whole business. And sweeping everyone up in that magic.And the dames. Tilda Swinton didn't even try. And where was wardrobe? Her clothing could have been amazing if it fit properly, or was at least properly steamed and pressed - especially since the ""lesser"" twin looked more put together. Why was Scarlett Johansson's Deeanna character even in the film? As yet another crisis to make Eddie's day worse? She didn't seem interested enough to care, or make anyone else care. You have to wonder if there was more to this story, if it was initially connected in some way to the plot, but was cut because the story was dragging.And it was dragging. Oh how it dragged. At some point around the two-hour mark (or so it felt) it occurred to me, all of this is happening in one day. Why doesn't it feel manic? Why is there no pace to this film? It's as though everyone took a Valium on their way to the set. This was especially glaring in the un-snappy '40s dame dialogue - didn't they make the actresses sit down and watch a few Barbara Stanwyck movies for research? They should have. Or, they should have gotten the amped-up court drummer from Danny Kaye's knighthood scene in The Court Jester to come in and get everyone to just speed things up a whole lot. Yea verily yea! If they had picked up the pace, given it that manic sense that was totally lacking, fleshed out the Deeanna story a bit so it was relevant (and fast-paced), that would have also allowed for more contrast with the slower parts of the film - Eddie going to confession, Eddie at home with his family. As it was, it all dragged on with the same lumbering gait.There were other little annoyances. The makeup wasn't too period (I guess none of the actresses wanted their eyebrows messed with?) although that is certainly also true of period films of '40s and '50s. The ill-fitting wardrobe was pure carelessness on behalf of the filmmakers. The Roman soldiers couldn't march in step. All of these little details seem petty to complain about, but each one takes the viewer a little farther away from the picture.And there were good moments, too. Heather Goldenhersh as the secretary, and most especially Alden Ehrenreich as cowboy crooner Hobie was brilliant. He looked the part, he acted the part, he believed what he was doing. And apparently he really did learn how to make a lasso out of spaghetti.Overall, it felt like a series of set pieces. Let's do an Esther Williams number. Let's do On the Town. I swear, every single character seemed lifted from somewhere else - even the cabal of communist writers seemed like a pale echo of Billy Wilder's gang of academics in Ball of Fire.If you love the old movies, this will leave you feeling let down. Skip it and re-watch Singin' in the Rain instead.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
What is the movie about ?,"A movie about making movies with conspiring communists abducting Baird Whitlock to get a ransom. That's the plot as it seems and Everything in between the film is just random but with a tribute to the different types of movies made back then. That's the part that got me enjoying it. And very minimal comedic scene but were funny. Not the type that gets u teary funny though . I have to admit the ending was confusing to me . Francis mcdormand got me smiling . Loved the accent scarlet Johansson used , was a genuine 50s accent. Channing Tatum gave an interesting dance and Jonah Hill was soooo not funny but in a funny way , don't know if U know what I mean .

Communism or capitalism?,"The Coen brothers, the directors responsible for films such as The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Fargo. In their latest film Hail, Caesar! we follow a movie producer played by Josh Brolin, who during the 50's struggle to make films and at the same time handle difficult actors, directors and journalists. The film has a comical attitude much like their earlier film Burn After Reading, which I didn't really like. My expectations before watching this film, was that the brothers would find their way back to the fantastic comical timing they had in The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Unfortunately they didn't succeed in doing so.Films about old Hollywood and its filmmaking are interesting and funny because they usually contain a lot of hilarious tributes to people in the industry. Here the Coen brothers makes parody on the likes of Charlton Heston, Gene Kelly and the successful director Vincente Minnelli. Hail, Caesar! fires wildly in all directions. Angry journalist threats, unwanted pregnancies and the constant communist menace. The problem with this is that I don't really know in which direction the Coen brothers wants to go, or what they really want to say. Communism versus capitalism and that not everything is black and white? I guess you should also see it as a sort of parody on Hollywood's paranoia towards communists during the 60's and 60's.Hail, Caesar! is a fun film. The production design and construction of Hollywood in the 50's is very nicely done. It also takes another turn when George Clooney's character in the film is shooting a picture of the old Roman Empire and also draws parallels to communism. I do however doubt if the Coen siblings really meant for it all to blend together in the diffuse way it did. I wonder if they actually had a more clear plan from the beginning. It probably would have raised my grade for the film if its focus and direction were better. However, I still think it is an interesting and funny picture and therefore I still grade it a six.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

A funny and clever satire about the film industry,"A great movie.Within this medium of feature films, almost every year we see many satires, parodies, that use references of other works or situations to build their, always around, jokes about such work.In this, we almost always see productions that may even be funny, but in 99% of cases they are just that, with no other ""layer"" behind everything, and ""Hail, Caesar!"" Is not one of those cases!The story of the film basically shows ""one day behind the scenes of a studio,"" with a parody of various elements of the film industry, from the life of a producer, decisions made within a studio, and how they can influence the future of production , And etc, always with an intelligent humor, that at the same time makes fun of the situation, showing them in an exaggerated way, also makes a criticism.Stuffed with great actors, the performances of the film dispense with comments, with impeccable direction at that point, and a script, which, as I said above, is intelligent and very well written.In summary: ""Hail, Caesar!"" It's a great movie. Smart and funny. And it portrays in the form of satire the backstage of the world of cinema, as well as exploring countless clichés (like communist villains) from the industry's own films ever since, in order to make jokes yes, but also in a way to say something to About it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Coen Brothers' take on old school Hollywood!,"As everyone is referring to till now this is a love letter to 1950's Hollywood. Written and directed by the Coens the story involves a producer who is trying to get everything right in Capitol Pictures, and is faced with a major problem: His star has been kidnapped by an organization called The Future. What this movie is trying to show through the lens of the amazing Roger Deakins is the beauty of filming that was all shot back then in studios. We passed by almost most types of movies: Musicals ""Kelly Style"", Drama, Western and of course the main set was the Hail Cesar one, the kind of epic ""Ben Hur Style"". The movie is full of cameos of very talented actors that were given a screenplay of pure and smart comedy lines directed in a crazy and fun way by the Coens! Josh Brolin took the lead by giving an awesome performance as the producer. What people didn't enjoy in this I guess is those smart comedy moments and characters that maybe only a true Coen fan can enjoy! Not the best Coen, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was by far better but I really suggest it for all cinema lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The dust never settles,"I saw the trailer, I saw the cast, I saw who the directors were and I was interested to see how the whole plot plays out. The plot is pretty simple. Eddie Mannix(Josh Brolin) is the head of the production company Capitol Studios. One of his lead actor, Baird Whitlock(George Clooney) gets kidnapped by script writers who wants payback for the stories which they have not been paid for by the production company. Now to every simple plot there has to be a to and fro to keep the audience interested, but the to and fro shouldn't move away from the heart of the story. Here there is so much motion and that the movie never settles. Too many loose ends. Personally for me that was a major problem. My mind never settled. Probably, it was the intention of the directors to not let your mind settle so that we can feel the rush felt by the producer. But it didn't quite work for me.No complains about the cast. Though, Channing Tatum should move his facial muscles a bit more. It was unclear what he was going for. It is nice to see Jonah Hill starring in movies with such big names in it. George Clooney plays the gullible Baird. You almost begin to sympathize with him at the end. I have always liked Josh Brolin. No complains. Other than them, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton have extended cameos. Due to which none of their characters settle down. Alden Ehrenreich is pretty good as the person who is a cow-boy on and off screen.The tone of the movie is well held throughout. It clearly shows that all that glitters is not gold. We only see the final product but we always don't get to see the cogs in the wheel. The hustle and bustle makes you dizzy and that is why we love the world of cinema",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The Coens movie about Catholicism.,"I've been waiting 6 years to watch this movie. Always had it in my checklist but i could not do it for one reason or another. The Coens are among my favorite american directors, after a while i've come to see all their films have the same type of structure and arguments, and this one is no exception.Watching ""Hail, Caesar!"" in 2023, a very lively depiction of hollywood and a very compelling set of characters that puts catholicism in the spotlight. Yes, this movie is ABOUT catholicism. It portraits the ins and outs of the film industry, yes, but at heart it shows the contradictory character and values that America stood for in the 50's, right before the liberal awakening of the next decades.There are a few easter eggs that demonstrate how well thought out this movie is: The inclusion of Herbert Marcuse (real life marxist writer) as a cult leader, the complete babysitting star treatment from the main character -Mannix- is more than realistic, it is poetic as far as patriarcal figures come. The acting is funny and heartfelt.This movie is an interesting essay about art and religion, and i found it delightful. 2016 also had ""silence"" by Scorcese for a great depiction of catholicism. But here the characters relate so well and are so well written and acted that you really get to feel the morale of the story: the outdated, systematic, dutyful, and ultimately hypocritical contradictions of the religious man as a leading man.This movie is so essentially Coen brothers that it becomes hilarious for exactly that reason. There's your suitcase filled with money, there is your kidnapping scene, there is a noir storyline that tries to tell a story about 50's Hollywood, nothing more, nothing less.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Delicious,"Probably not the best of the Coens, but even a relatively ""minor"" Coen is still more interesting than 99% of the rest of cinematic production...The film has some faults for my taste, humour that is not always successful and certain musical or visual numbers that are too long, notably the one with the sailors, even if this is totally within the purpose of the film which highlights the crazy and neurotic brilliance of Hollywood.

Breakfast On Golgotha,"Jesus Christ and a scooter, sometimes one wonders how it can possibly happen, amidst so many Marvels, that a movie has the guts for a ""But far away in Palestine (Divine presence to be shot)"" card. Welcome to the Billy Wilder forties, with the brightest imbecile in the room, namely George Clooney, the royalty Hollywood does NOT deserve, playing movie star Blair Whitlock playing Caesar in some prestige Christian epic.This movie is hilarious, and its comic range is so impressively broad that telling the tale would spoil the viewer's pleasure. Blair Whitlock is abducted from the sound stage and studio fixer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), having a crisis of faith as in any Coen movie, has to get there back on time for his Oscar moment. That will prove difficult and desperately simple in equal measures. Enough said about the plot.With ""The Future"" being a recurring theme of an intrigue set in the past, the movie has a thing or two to say about the present. From an cumenical meeting featuring the various confessions the movie in production may or may not offend (""The Nazarean was not God!"" tersely states the rabbi), to rumour-mongering gossip columnists (SWINTON, larger than life and twice as funny), the Coen spotlight is merciless. Did things change that much in 70 years?Wonderful comedy moments erupt from scene rehearsals, with lobotomised extras waiting their cue for the next take of Merrily We Dance, the parlour piece painstakingly shot by Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes). Scarlet Johansson has a deliciously vulgar turn as a pregnant Esther Williams. To one's astonishment, Channing Tatum steals the show as a sailor doing a flawless Gene Kelly routine filled with gay innuendo, singing ""We might see some octopuses"", in a bar/brothel called the Swinging Dingy, no less.The nefarious plot concocted by Hollywood's communist writers (all nine of them) is based on ""accelerating the dialectics"", something of a Coen brothers' trademark. Things get hectic by way of a near-death by Moviola, a lasso demonstration and a make out scene that so far only Walt Disney's The Lady and the Tramp had managed to pull off. Lord, they even manage to sneak in a Dutch angle, which made one spit his drink.Gloriously ending on the stupidest possible scene involving a Soviet submarine, a lapdog and an attaché case full of dollar bills, Hail, Caesar! is a non-stop giggling feast. Caesar finally delivers his Oscar monologue on Golgotha, but he blanks on the last word. This last word – or the lack thereof – wraps things up ideally. Bravo, bros!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hail, Caesar! Boo, Octavian (or something)","Having rewatched this movie, I came to the inescapable conclusion that this is my least-favorite Coen brothers movie (out of 11 watched, soon to be12 once I get around to watching A Serious Man.) Which is absurd, given that I still rate it an 8. The Coen's are masters of their craft.The humor and situations are broad enough that a viewer can pick up on the general references and semi-inside jokes fairly easily with a passing knowledge of Golden Age Hollywood, but much of it still feels like a love note to other film enthusiasts and cinephiles from the Coen brothers, which made it feel a little inaccessible at times, as though we were supposed to find certain aspects hilarious but, without the grounding, we could only muster an awkward chuckle. The extended song-and-dance with the sailors, for instance, seemed too long and elaborate to justify the apparent punchline at the end, so I was left scratching my head, wondering if there was more to it, or if the Coens just wanted to a long musical number for its own sake. Granted, the Coens do riff on lots of genres and cultural eras over the course of their filmography, so this movie neither surprising nor out-of-character. Nevertheless, it felt more like a straight-up comedy of errors that relied on an intimate understanding of the era to bridge the gaps rather than a particularly cohesive narrative set in the period, with big-name stars relegated to what amounted basically to cameos with promises of plotlines that never really stuck.But, dammit, it's still a Coen brothers movie, and better than 90% of the movies out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"HAIL, CAESAR! is One of the Funniest Movies of 2016","The Coen brothers bring us back to the golden age of the Hollywood studio system with their 2016 comedy HAIL, CAESAR! On the scale of Coen comedies, I find this one is more entertaining than BURN AFTER READING but never reaches the heights of their (in my opinion) best, THE BIG LEBOWSKI. It's an easy watch with a relatively simple story that relies a bit on the viewer having either nostalgia for 1950s era Hollywood movies or an appreciation for the studio system of decades ago. I fall into the latter category, loving this frenetic voyage back to the 1950s where we're to tag along with studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to witness a day in his life as he juggles problem after problem. Mannix is an honorable man with boundless loyalty to the studio but the stress has taken its toll on him. As the film begins, he receives an order from the men above him to move famed musical cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to the studio's latest period drama, much to the classical director's extreme dismay. Meanwhile the studio's star synchronized swimmer DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) has become pregnant out of wedlock, which could become a PR disaster, and the lead actor (George Clooney) from the studio's biblical epic, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, has gone missing. Mannix races to solve these problems while fending off twin Hollywood reporters (Tilda Swinton in a dual role) eager to break a story that might damage the studio's delicate reputation.I found this movie to be indescribably fun. It's got a manic pacing that races you through from start to finish and encourages further viewings to catch jokes you might've missed the first time. It's a bright, colorful adventure through the eyes of the over-worked Mannix who moves from issue to issue without missing a beat. It's full of fast-talkers and oddball characters. If I were to complain about anything, it would be that there's so many interesting scenarios playing out over the course of the movie that we didn't get enough time to thoroughly dig in. The Hobie Doyle issue, where a simple cowpoke finds himself tossed into the stiffest of dramas with an auteur director (played by Ralph Fiennes) who is equally panicked at having to somehow teach his new star how to show some class, has some of the funniest moments in the movie but it's relegated to a secondary plot. I could watch an entire movie on that situation alone. Give Ehrenreich and Fiennes a spin off film documenting the making of that movie-within-a-movie. The primary plot thread, obviously, is the abduction of the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock from the set of HAIL, CAESAR! Clooney can play aloof with the best of them and he's got a comedic timing that isn't put on display nearly often enough. His Whitlock awakens from his abduction in a gorgeous seaside home surrounded by strange men and, not only rolls with it, he comes to believe in their mysterious cause.Much of the film's fun comes from the madcap journey behind the scenes of the movie studio system of the 50s. Mannix's business takes him behind the scenes of a massive synchronized swimming sequence (a relic of decades past) and, more interestingly, a Hollywood musical. We get an entire song and dance sequence featuring Channing Tatum as the star of an old Navy musical where he and a team of sailors lament their future lack of dames on the high seas to an upbeat tune. I thought it was interesting to see what sort of stuff went into the choreography and camera blocking. It's fun. Everything about this movie is a blast and it's a shame to see it didn't receive a whole lot of love from audiences. I guess you need to have at least a passing interest in the subject matter to find the entertainment here, otherwise it must come across as a lot of fast-talking gibberish laid over a scatter-brained plot that can't seem to find its focus. I wholeheartedly disagree, as I've found HAIL, CAESAR! to be massively re-watchable and I've yet to find myself bored with it. It has a contagious positive vibe in this love letter to a Golden Age of film. Coen fans should find plenty to appreciate here and I hope more casual fans or less-informed mainstream audiences will give the film a chance and find something to enjoy as well, whether it be the performances, the production, or the sense of humor.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Later, in the company of close friends, I was asked about the movie, and I let the laziness get out and just said it was rather moronic.As I've been thinking about it more and more, I want to say it was amazing in many respects.

another solid Coens brothers effort.. just not quite a classic yet,"I love the Coen brothers. They are responsible for some of my favourite comedy films including The Big Lebowski and Fargo so naturally i had high hopes for Hail, Caeser! Amazing star studded cast, interesting premise and a brilliant trailer. The film isn't quite to scale of those classics but it is a very solid film and i did have a lot of fun watching it.Hail, Caeser! Is the name of a film within a film that provides the backbone of the movie. Josh Brolin is a top Hollywood screenwriter, Ed Mannix and George Clooney plays his leading man Baird Whitlock. When Baird is kidnapped from the set Ed wonders to himself why?! And that is about all i can say because the trailers are vague and i want everyone to go into this film not knowing too much because i guarantee you will have a better time. Now i did mention the cast is star-studded but by that i mean they all have very small roles. Clooney and Brolin are the only characters who get a huge amount of screen time and the story very much revolves around them, which is fine because they both shine. Especially Clooney walkibg around in an amusing roman get up. Scarlett Johansson shows up and does well as always but for a very limited and almost pointless time. Jonah Hill, he is just a cameo. I was excited to see how Jonah Hill would fare in a Coens brothers film but he appears for probably 30 seconds or less. Channing Tatum is great too though, he adds comedic flair but also has a big role to play in the main storyline.Can i recommend Hail Caeser to a variety of audiences? Yes i can. Fans of the Coens will have a good time, media students like myself and screenwriters will have a good time and i believe general moviegoers will enjoy themselves too. There are a good few laugh out loud moments and it is a lot of fun unravelling the bigger picture.

"Very enjoyable mish-mash, but there is something missing despite the stellar cast","I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I have owned it for a couple of months but did not sit down to watch until now. It is an excellently crafted film - the acting is superb (especially from the always brilliant Josh Brolin, from Alden Ehrenreich when he pretends to be an actor who cannot act, from Ralph Feinnes as he pretends to cope with an actor who cannot act, and from George Clooney), the visualisation of 1950s Hollywood is lush and has a certain largesse, BUT there is something missing - I cannot quite put my finger on it.
The concept in itself is enjoyable - the whole film revolves around a Hollywood fixer (Brolin) who is caught between his loyalty to his present employment and a more lucrative and more family-friendly role with an aeroplane manufacturer (go on, guess which one). He is currently dealing with a film concerning the life of Christ (hence, Hail. Caesar, the name of that film) and has to ensure that no-one in the American market will be offended (watch out for the brilliant scene with an Orthodox priest, a presbyter of some form, a rabbi and a Catholic Priest deciding if the script is offensive). Then suddenly the main character (Clooney as a Charlton Heston-style Roman tribune) is kidnapped by undesirables. That, essentially, is the plot and how it develops is the story. It lacks oomph, but is brilliantly played - it is memorable, but what exactly is the message that comes out through it all? There are several lovely moments, especially in the editing suite, and the score blends in so perfectly that it almost unnoticed. I laughed to notice that one of the first prizes awarded was for the hairdressing involved.
The acting and visualisation are both superb, so I have to give it 8/10, but there is something indefinable missing that stops it being a 9 or a 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Humorous send-up of cold-war Hollywood,"This Coen Brothers' movie has a lot of detractors but I found it quite funny, as various stereotypes from the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Age deal with personal problems (usually involving 'vices'), production problems (trying to wrap a mega-budget ""Sword and Sandal"" epic) and the Communist scourge (including a dog named ""Engels""). Interspersed are satires of the era's great flamboyant excesses (including an Ester Williams style water-ballet, a Gene Kelly style song and dance routine, and an over-the-top singing-cowboy Western). These 'films-within-film"" are (IMO) the best part of ""Hail, Caesar"", although I found the thin 'plot' tying it all together to be entertaining as well. I would have thought that the film would be great fun for any movie buff, but judging by the IMDb reviews, my enthusiasm is far from universally shared. Worth starting anyway - you'll likely decide which camp you're in pretty quickly (but I recommend that you stay long enough for the 'Swinging Dinghy' musical number).",8.0,Anonymous,Music

This time there is actually a plot (something that's often missing from a Coen movie): We follow top notch movie exec Eddie Mannix through 27 hours of his extremely busy schedule. Although he has lucrative offers to switch to a real company, one which builds bombs and planes rather than make razzle dazzle movies, eventually he decides to stay on.There is a plethora of plots underway, most importantly the star of sandals epic ""Hail, Caesar!"" (about the life of Jesus Christ) gets, well, kidnapped by Hollywood's communist conspiracy writers. Joe McCarthy tried to warn us of these SOBs, Arthur Millar tried to warn us of a supposed modern-day witchhunt, but the Coens finally managed to capture them all in full glorious detail. Nothing witchy about them. They love Joe Stalin, they are portly intellectuals who could bore the hell out of a dead sloth, and they conspire against the US of A. Thanks for the heads-up, Coens! I had great fun. Many scenes are brilliant, unknown actors star, stars appear in bit parts. Again, an excellent movie. If you don't like it, you probably never liked their movies in the first place, so stop whining about how disappointed you are.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Coens' Love Letter To Classic Hollywood Cinema Is Unexpectedly Underwhelming,"From the duo filmmakers whose works span numerous genres & styles, and include some of the boldest American films released in the past few decades, it's no surprise that many were expecting Hail, Caesar to be an instant classic and although it does have all the hallmarks of a Coen brothers film, it isn't as laudable as their finest efforts.The story of Hail, Caesar! takes place in the 1950s and follows Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood fixer for Capitol Studios whose job is to keep the scandalous private lives of celebrities out of the press so that their public image isn't harmed. However, when the lead star of the studio's major production is abducted, Eddie ends up dealing with a lot more than just fix.Written, produced, edited & directed by Joel & Ethan Coen, Hail, Caesar! is a wonderful throwback to the Golden Age of Hollywood as the movie skims through productions of historical epics, period dramas, westerns, musicals & what not while narrating its own story, which doesn't pack in enough strength to capture & hold one's attention, and fails to stimulate the senses.There are a few good laughs here & there but for the most part, it isn't as amazing as its previews suggested. Only one character's arc is fully-fleshed, and as for its numerous homages & parodies, it not only includes the old classics but also many sub-par films of the bygone era. Nostalgia runs high here but the film's main premise doesn't have enough flesh on the bone.However, the technical aspects are brilliantly executed. Production design team does a terrific job with the set pieces, each exquisitely carved & meticulously detailed, and also succeeds in creating an authentic 1950s film production studio ambiance. Cinematography further enhances the whole imagery with its deft use of warm colour palette, the pacing is steady while the score & songs sync nicely with the unfolding events.Coming to the performances, Hail, Caesar! has quite an ensemble in Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Scarlett Johansson, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & others. Brolin stays true to his fixer character and delivers a strong performance, Clooney is funny as expected, and Tatum deserves a mention for steering through that ingeniously choreographed musical number with stunning effortlessness.On an overall scale, Hail, Caesar! features many idiosyncrasies that one has come to expect from the Coens but the laugh-out-loud moments here are few & far in between. Neither the plot nor the characters are compelling enough and there isn't much to ponder once the credits start rolling. It does work as Coens' love letter to Classic Hollywood cinema but as a comedy & mystery, it's quite stale & stays on the same level. In a sentence, underwhelming.",,Anonymous,Music
good if you aren't a drooling chimp,"Pretty accurate representation of the early Jewish marxist takeover of the film industry, in lighthearted and funny fashion.Most of the poor reviews from this movie are from people simply far too stupid to understand it... maybe the next Michael Bay movie will be more to their tastes.",,Anonymous,Music
Hail Coens!,"In spite of what many naysayers have written here, this is not the Coens least successful film at the box-office (which is the also misunderstood Hudsucker Proxy). It is a different type of film, and thank heavens for the Coens' courage to keep trying new things. A subtle look at philosophy through the lens of a second-rate 50s movie studio, this is actually 5 or 6 movies in one (depending on how you count them), and although humorous at times, it is not a comedy. If a strict, linear action plot is your forte, skip this film. If you are interested in 1950s politics, philosophy and pop culture (with more than a few bible references) and how it all interacts, this is the film for you.",,Anonymous,Music
Incredibly boring...,"After 45 minutes of mind-numbing boredom I couldn't watch any longer, so I didn't. I only wish I stopped earlier so I didn't lose as much time. I want my 45 minutes back...This movie's directing is all over the place, and I couldn't understand where the heck they were going with this. More importantly though, it was extremely boring, and not funny at all. If this was a drama I would consider this movie pretty poor, but if this is supposed to be a comedy, then it is atrocious. It's incredibly slow in some scenes too. This must be one of those ""intellectual"" movies that critics like, but the normal man doesn't get or enjoy (while other movies that everyone else likes, the critics hate...go figure...). I won't cast a numbered vote, since I didn't finish the movie, but I'd advise against wasting time on this one. I saw George Clooney, whom I consider to be brilliant, on the cast list, and figured this might be a good watch. What a mistake that was.",,Anonymous,Music
