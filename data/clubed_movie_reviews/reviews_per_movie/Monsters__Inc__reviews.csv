Nothing To Criticize Here - Very Solid Animated Film,"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too.Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The animation even holds up at times.,"I was recently gifted a ""100 movie advent calendar"" for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Monstrously clever and funny early Pixar CGI feature,"Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Adorable, funny, perfect voice casting for the lead roles","I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.And the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don't get why ABC couldn't give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Now here's a story children and adults can relate too.  Monsters in the closet.,"While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart.  Her job is to keep him out of trouble.I give Monsters, Inc. a ten.  It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It makes for great family fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Does For Monsters What ""Toy Story"" Did For Toys!","Monsters, Inc.We were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.John Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum.But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Adorable movie with top class entertainment.,"The best way to describe this movie in one word is; fun! ""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life.

"touching, emotional, original and hilarious masterpiece","I only watched it on DVD, but I wish I was at the theater, when Monsters, Inc. was released. Anyway, I was blown away. Sometimes I was rolling on the ground while laughing, sometimes I couldn't hold back my tears. Simply amazing, marvellous filmmaking.The animation is picture-perfect, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is truly original. Pixar's finest, I think, it's way better than Finding Nemo. A cinematic masterpiece, which is full of emotions and laughter. If you haven't seen it yet, then GO, RENT IT! You won't be disappointed, I guarantee it.Boo is the cutest animation movie character EVER.An obvious 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...","... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!I actually bought a ticket for this last night after finding to my dismay that another premiere, ""From Hell"", was already sold out by the time I arrived.  These are certainly two distinctly different films in theme!  I was slightly grouchy, because, coupled with that minor disappointment, I'd had an argument with a friend on the way over to the theatre, and was now proceeding solo.  I wouldn't say that ""Monsters Inc"" made me glad I missed ""From Hell"", but I still got a solidly entertaining film for my money.  I just hope I don't miss ""Ocean's 11"" next week...For every plus-point to the movie I can also think of a criticism, but on the whole the good points JUST outweigh the bad.  The setup may be a little too complicated for younger audiences and the supporting cast of voices is wasted.  There was definitely not enough Steve Buscemi, whose bad guy just seemed like an afterthought to all the Keystone Cops esque capers of trying to get ""Boo"" out of Monstropolis.  The script is pitched at a much younger level than ""Toy Story"" was, and so as a result adults may be bowled over by the animation, but slightly starved in the belly-laughs department.  That said, there are still a couple of moments guaranteed to have older patrons guffawing heartily, just not enough for my liking.  Even without laughter, the story is still diverting and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily.  The movie really comes into its own when the kid is introduced, as thereafter the action rarely pauses for breath.Good as the voice talents of Goodman and Crystal are, it is undoubtedly youngster Mary Gibbs who inadvertently steals the show.  Her cute gurgles and shrieks are enough to put a smile on most people's faces and warm their hearts.  The job the team did on collecting all her voice samples for the finished movie is nothing short of amazing; indeed, just like the animation achievements were as well.  Goodman excels in his voice acting, making ""Sulley"" a truly memorable character.The animation is wonderful, and at times will make you unable to do anything else but gawp.  Techniques in this arena seem to be moving at lightspeed, and in just a few years will make the graphics seen in ""Toy Story"" seem unremarkable.  Just for this factor alone, ""Monsters Inc."" deserves to be seen, but the likeable (if not always best used) cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time. Nowhere near a ""Toy Story"" beater for sheer polish and appeal to all ages, but a commendable effort nonetheless.  Well done!Altogether now...

"""We scare because we care""","Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley finds his world disrupted.Monster's Inc explores childhood fear, the fear of looking under your bed or looking at your open closet thinking a monster would pop out. Pixar of course wouldn't make it fearful, but brought lightheartedness to it and made a highly imaginative tale of a fictional world where monsters scare children to power their city. This film is illustrated with creative monsters and styled with classy/jazzy music. The feeling while watching this is amazing and the emotions you feel for the monsters is just magical. Pixar has once again OUTDONE their-selves with every project they have thought of. Monster's Inc is definitely one of the top Pixar movies and also one of the most creative. If you can outlook the childish themes and look deeper into the movie's heart and soul, you will definitely be immersed in Pixar's movie-making magic. Most people would complain about the animation because animated movies have this thing when where one sees one, it's automatically horrible and childish. If one is made by Pixar, I highly recommend you sit down and see what they can do to animations; you will be amazed. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Goodish children's movie,"Goodish children's movie.In the city of Monstropolis, a company, Monsters Inc, harnesses the power of children's screams to generate electricity. Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the most endearing animation films created,"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Boo & Kitty & All Those Blasted Closet Doors,"When it comes to ""coming-out-of-the-closet"" (Ha! Get the pun?), you can be sure that a star ""Monster Incorporated"" employee, such as Sulley or Randall, are the type of monsters who don't mess around. No. These guys mean business when they step out from behind a child's closet door.For the most part, I enjoyed Monsters Inc. and found it to be quite imaginative as it told its cute, little tale of forbidden friendship and defying authority.Set in the make-believe world of Monstropolis, where everyone's a literal monster (but usually a nice monster), we find that this urban centre's electrical power is generated from harnessing the screams of human children who are, nightly, scared out of their wits by the hideous, growling creatures who emerge, like demons, from out of their darkened, bedroom closets.As we soon discover - A monster is, of course, forbidden to ever come into direct contact with a child, as the touch of these beings is both more toxic & deadly than any plague or disease imaginable.Directed by Pete Docter (writer of Toy Story, Wall-E, Up), Monsters Inc. is a delightfully colourful, CG animated tale which tells us, plain & simple, that laughter is, indeed, 10x more powerful than a scream.2 thumbs-up to Pixar Studios for delivering this good-natured, little gem that's sure to entertain audiences of all ages.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"`Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great `Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic.  I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in `Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets.  It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel `Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning.  For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature `For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.The short trailer for `Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.`Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will. (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My personal favorite Pixar movie,"Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.I'm a doodler myself, and wan't to be an animator someday. And I love drawing monsters. Weird looking, many armed, strange-eyed creatures. That may have been the 1st reason Monster's Inc. appealed to me. So many of these creatures looked like something I would draw, and I spent much of my movie time looking at the creatures in the background.I also was captivated by the world that was created in Inc. A big problem for me in Pixar's newest movie Cars was lack of real explanation for their universe, like how they built their buildings. In Monster's Inc. the monster world is explained so much more in depth, and we really believe this world could exist. There's a beauty in watching the thousands of closet doors zoom around and I always get goosebumps from watching the ""scare montage"", because I now know the mechanics of the world these creatures live in.The characters in the world are also incredibly well realized. Mike and Sully both are easily relatable to, and even small characters have feelings and motivations we can understand. ""Boo"" actually behaves like a young child would, and that helped me believe she had real emotions. But the creature Randall is what stole the show for me. With his many arms, chameleon-like ability and sheer voice presence, it was hard for me to keep my eyes off of him. But what really made me love this movie so was the characters. When it comes time for the ""sad part"" of this movie, I was sad. I was actually seeing an animated cartoon that managed to make me feel for these animated creatures without being emotionally manipulative. And I'm not afraid to admit that I cry 4 out of 5 times at the ending.So, in the end, I can't recommend this film enough. I think this stands above all other Pixar productions and is definitely one of the best animated films I've had the pleasure of seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Excellent in nearly every way,"The premise behind Monsters, Inc. isn't something that we haven't seen before, but it is one that allows for a lot of creativity and one that the film takes full advantage of. Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.The story itself allows for a vast amount of creativity with the concept of monsters having this kind of job, all the unique designs and the fact that they are terrified of children. It is also great how detailed the story is, because you simply never know where it's going or how it's going to end up and its constantly gripping as a result of that. The two leads are vital to the story and thankfully they are both great. Sulley is the company's top scarer, yet on the inside he's just a big teddy bear and there is something so endearing about him. He's a really warm screen presence and seeing his relationship with Boo grow throughout the film is strangely beautiful. Mike is much more of a wise-cracker and somewhat neurotic, which actually makes him a great contrast to Sulley. He does provide a lot of laughs and the friendship with Sulley feels very genuine. In fact both John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve praise for giving such excellent performances.It's also impressive how well Boo is handled. Usually very young children can be annoying or plain boring, but she is the right balance of curious and gentle whilst still having enough funny moments. The fact that she speaks in a muddled sort of baby talk is another positive and actually makes her more endearing. Most notable is her relationship with Sulley, as it is build up just perfectly and their final moments together are incredibly touching. That emotional core between is a real strong point of the film. The films comedic moments are very well done too. Mike relies much more on his witticisms and anxious behaviour to get laughs which works surprisingly well, while the other monsters ineptitude when it comes to scaring also provides a great number of amusing moments.With that said one of the films few weaknesses are its villains. They're not bad, just a little one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Randall is a typically snide and aggressive rival, we don't learn anything about him and he doesn't really do much but try to hunt down Boo. He either needed to be funnier or more threatening to leave an impression. Waternoose also turns out to be involved in the plot despite his initial loyalty to Sulley, his conflict does make sense yet he is also a little underused. Despite that he does have a good design and James Coburn does a good job vocal. That said their actions do lead to a spectacular climax. It basically has Sulley and Mike frantically searching for Boo's door in what is effectively a gigantic room of doors. It's fun, it's exciting, it's tense, it is exactly the type of big climax you'd want the film to have.The animation is excellent once again. The fact that its set in a world of monsters allows for some really interesting and colourful designs, the majority of monsters look unique and are memorable as a result of that. Just looking at Sulley, the amount of detail put in with all his hairs is so impressive. We don't see too much of the monster world, but the factory is an interesting setting and still permits plenty of creativity. The side characters are a bit hit-and- miss, although the Abominable Snowman (Pixar regular John Ratzenberger) gets some really good lines and the cranky receptionist Roz is enjoyable. Randy Newman's score has an effective light, jazzy feel to it and it is brilliant. Not only does it suit the tone of the film, but it also adds a nice energy to the more action packed scenes and provides some wonderfully emotive melodies.So on the whole Monsters, Inc. is another big success for Pixar. I think that it works so because it gets the key areas right. The premise is interesting, the two leads are a great pairing, the main conflict is gripping and there is a strong emotional centre to the film that makes it even stronger. It is easy to care about these characters and want to see them succeed. I do think the villains are a bit weak and maybe the conspiracy is a little unneeded, but neither does too much damage to the overall product and that is because its central focus is so good. Added to that the animation, score and comedy all work fantastically to the best effect. It's a film that is funny, moving and engaging in all the right ways.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What a creative masterpiece!!!,"This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies.

Fantastic,"This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not Pixar's best, but a fun and likeable family movie","'Monsters, Inc.' is one of Pixar's best known and most widely popular movies - an endearing and highly likeable family movie bursting with ideas and imagination. Though not one of Pixar's best and not a personal favourite of mine, I did get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, especially the characters, which are all brilliantly unique, entertaining and genuinely funny.The storyline, as enjoyable as it is, is not on the same level as the likes of 'Toy Story' and 'Up'. I always get the feeling I'm watching something special with those movies, but I think 'Monsters, Inc.', for all its creativity and likeability, lacks that special quality to put it up there with the very best animated pictures. That said, judging it on its own merits, this is a great animated family movie and one of those movies that is just impossible to dislike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Nothing funny, with no surprises.","This movie is often compared to Shrek.  I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes.  I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is.  The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence.  The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore.  The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek.  I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.There's not even one good line in Monsters Inc.  Remember from Shrek..""Yes. The ginger-bread man!""..gurgle gurgle..  Shrek set the barometer for the future of animated movies with stories.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An instant classic,"MONSTERS, INC. (2001) **** (Voices of: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Mary Gibbs, Bonnie Hunt, Bob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz, Steve Susskind, Jeff Pidgeon, Sam ""Penguin"" Black, Daniel R. Gerson. (Dir: Peter Docter/Co-directors: David Silverman, Lee Unkrich)There's something undeniably magical about a Disney movie that brings out your inner child and the streak continues to manifest itself in the latest with its fine track record with upstarts Pixar (the ""Toy Story "" films) in delighting children of all ages in one of the year's funniest (and most fun) films.The childhood phenomena of imagining monsters lurking in one's bedroom closet or under the bed is in actuality a reality that exists solely for the world of the monsters to use all the energy extracted from a child's screams as their natural resource to power their communities and subsist in their parallel universe. Specifically Scream Heat (""We Scare Because We Care""), the corporate entity that harnesses the youngsters' reactions to its hard-working crew of creatures including our heroes James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (marvelously voiced by Goodman) and his best buddy Mike Wazowski (ditto Crystal). Sulley is a bear-like, blue and purple hairy and horned monster and Mike is a cyclopean lime green M&M clone. The two couldn't be more different yet both share their passion for their vocation and the only thing getting in their way is their rival colleague Randall Boggs (Buscemi, at his oiliest menacing), a reptilian nasty who wants to beat Sulley for the all-time factory record of most points racked up in a single day on the job  at any cost. Watching the proceedings is Sulley's father-figure boss Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn) – a cross between a crab and Edward G. Robinson – whose main priority is avoiding any ""rolling blackouts"" (in one of the film's subtle jabs at the current climate in our nation). Mike is in love with cutie pie receptionist Celia (Tilly) who also sports one eye and is afoot taller than him, with a hairdo sporting a Medusa twist (snakes sit atop her head) who wants something from him besides excuses to their frequently put-upon dates together. One day after work Sulley accidentally lets into their world a tiny 4 year old girl – a big no-no – legend has it that one touch is toxic and fatal! – which causes mass havoc wreaked upon the populace as the authorities attempt to corral the tyke while decontaminating the infected workshop's workers (a running gag has the SWAT like DEA agents popping in at a moment's notice whenever a sign of human contact – i.e. a small cotton white sock attached to an unsuspecting monster – makes its ugly presence known!) Mike is in a panicky sweat that they will lose their jobs and tells Sulley he can't hide Boo (the nickname the big guy dubs the adorable tot) and they must return her to her bedroom. Easier said than done when Randall gets wind of the partners abetting the unsuspecting crime and he too has his plans to use Boo for his own selfish endeavorsat any cost! The film is a laugh a minute romp and an incredible mix of state-of-the-art computer generated dynamics that truly enhance the candy-colored world of Mike & Sulley with its picture perfect depictions of moveable hair (see how Sulley's locks sway to and fro so naturally! A first for CGI imagery!) and expressiveness given to the one-eyed Mike who works his brow into a real sweat. Never before has voice talent been so perfectly matched and acted to a t than in the comic team of Crystal and Goodman with their characteristics smartly enhanced into their characters with Crystal's liberal use of his ""SNL"" Willy the Masochist (""Oh I hate when that happens!"") and Goodman's burly, awshucks demeanor fits his soft-hearted meanie like a golden glove. Sulley is the true star of the show with his emotional overload not unlike a kid learning to make a new life transition as he discovers there's more to his existence than meets the eye (same for Mike; pun intended). When he realizes that Boo (by the way, nice job by the producers to use real-life 4 year old Gibbs, in easily the cutest turn by a child performer ever without making an audience gag) is not threatened by his hulking presence. The laughs are largely thanks to Crystal's myopic M&M who is always one-step behind his behemoth buddy and slow on the uptake as the plot proceeds with his sly one-liners, sudden bursts of unrestrained anger and confusion, and slapstick antics leads the film into uncharted territories of hysterical laughter and a great breakneck roller-coaster ride with Mike & Sulley attempting to find Boo's bedroom door with Randall in hot pursuit gives the film a giddy headrush of adrenaline. The film is witty, bright, upbeat and has its shares of incisiveness (I loved the use of HarryHausen's as a local chic eatery that all the monsters are dying to get into; in case of those who don't know Harryhausen, Ray Harryhausen, is the premier stop-motion animator pioneer who gave life to scores of sci-fi creatures including the fabled ""Sinbad"" flicks of the 1960s and 1970s among others) that will undoubtedly have its constituents clamoring for a sequel pronto. Arguably one of the best films and funniest of the year; I loved it and so will you (and your kids if you have any; if not all the more to see it again) An instant classic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Definitely one of the best  films of 2001!,"This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Still magical.,"Monsters have one job, to scare children, and to make them scream, a task that should be relatively easy.It's been a long time since I first saw Monsters Inc, possibly about twenty years, so watching it randomly last night, I couldn't believe how well it's aged, it still looks and feels great.The jokes haven't diminished with time, I'd actually argue it makes newer releases look pretty feeble, lacking in the creativity and imagination that was clear for all to see here.It's cute, it's funny, it's certainly moving, a time when Pixar really did produce the best films, this and Nemo are streets ahead.Billy Crystal and John Goodman do the most terrific jobs, they just somehow suit the characters perfectly.I still have a Mike hot water bottle, I never intend growing up.Almost twenty five years on, it's still a masterpiece.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.

"Colorful images and great imagination, but one heck of an annoying character. *** (out of four)","MONSTERS, INC. / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:When I was a kid, I imagined a world of monsters just like the one in ""Monsters, Inc."" I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of ""Toy Story"" give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Toy Story 2."" From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details.The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing.One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy.""Monsters, Inc."" works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another.This has worked before. In ""Baby's Day Out"" we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet ""Monsters, Inc."" insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor.Despite this parasite of a character, ""Monsters, Inc."" still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, ""Monsters, Inc."" does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex.But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Superb animation, a most inventive story, fun for the whole family.","""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in.First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real.Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk.You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer.

Gates Again,"This is a resubmitted comment, the original was removed by a complaint from some anonymous aggrieved party. Let's hope the edits are sufficient this time.You already know that this is the usual Pixar fare, which is to say that it is excellent, better than any non-Pixar animated film. Sure, you also know that and you probably know the usual reason given: that Pixar spends more time on basic storytelling values than anyone else.Here are two elements of this that may deepen your appreciation. The first is that Pixar recognized early that 3D animation software allowed two types of advance in the third dimension. The first is obvious, that everything has depth and reflection and shadow more or less like reality.The second is that once these objects and scenes are defined in the computer, it is no extra work to move the camera anywhere. it can loop and swoop in ways that we never could have before. Pixar decided to exploit this in their storytelling here and later in ""Nemo.""Nemo was set in an environment where there was no horizon so the camera could flow and the watery feel of the place could make the unfamiliar fluidity of the camera seem more natural. Here, is where they tested some of those perspectives in the three dimensional door warehouse and the extra dimensions of going in and out. Those scenes make this for me.The second interesting thing is some competitive background. In those days, there was a shooting war between Bill Gates, financier of Dreamworks Animation (and leader of Microsoft) and Steve Jobs of Pixar (and leader of Apple). This was in the heyday of Gates' dirty tricks and he was intent on burying Jobs forever. Pixar depended on the success of ""A Bug's Life"" their followon to ""Toy Story,"" so Dreamworks rushed ""Antz"" -- a cheapy -- to open a week or so before to steal the market.""Bugs"" prevailed, sufficiently at least, and Pixar ramped up for their usual three year development of ""Monsters."" Dreamworks, getting wind of this, went all out with ""Shrek,"" their ""monster"" movie that could be released six months earlier. It only took a year because the animation is less perfect. But they were overt in their attack this time: ""Shrek"" made literal fun of Disney, the Pixar partner. The head guy at Disney was the model for the blowhard King who reigned over a fairytale kingdom populated with -- can you guess? -- all the old Disney characters.Pixar/Jobs would never do something so spiteful. But perhaps they did subtly appreciate the use of windows and gates to the future that always seemed to go wrong. And now you can too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film.

"Good, but it is no ""Toy Story""","Seeing this film with my kids, I noticed something that was quite different than the experiences of the ""Toy Story"" films and ""A Bug's Life"": The kids were having a better time than I was. That was really too bad, because I wanted to have the fun too, but I could not find it.Maybe I am not as dazzled as I was with ""Story"". Computer animation is fantastic, but movies still come down to one thing: story. I just did not feel that the ""Monsters, Inc."" tale was as good as the previous efforts of Disney/Pixar.Before I go into a long talk of the failings of this film, let me first state that kids do enjoy it. From their standpoint, taking in an average of the 3 of my children, I would rate it ***1/2 out of ****. I know they will go to school, tell all their friends to see it, and there will be ""Monsters, Inc."" toys under the Christmas tree this year.So much for the kid review. From my viewpoint, this film tried to appeal utilizing many of the same methods of the ""Toy Story"" movies. Unfortunately, those films were better. ""TS"" gave us the idea of lives existing somewhere that we can't see. And, instead of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, replace them with Sulley and Mike.In ""TS2,"" Woody gets the girl and Buzz is the one driven to fulfill the mission. In ""Monsters,"" Mike gets the multi-legged girl and Sulley focuses on the job. There is even that moment between Sulley and Mike where they have an argument and go their separate ways. Seems very familiar.I guess I hoped for something funnier. This one has funny moments, but it seems to be going more for the ""Cute"" factor. The little girl, Boo, has a very cute face that can evoke many emotions. Sulley and Mike, voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, are quite good too.Walking out of the theater, I had the disappointing feeling that I wished the movie could have had more.

Entertaining and imaginative 4th film from Pixar,"Monsters Inc., another fine animated movie from the folks at Pixar takes a turn from toys and bugs and goes for something most kids and adults can identify with (adults may have to reach back in time though for that one), being afraid of what's behind the closet at night.  It turns out, in this film, that monsters do lurk behind the closet, and they scare kids as a power resource to give electricity to Monstropolis where the monsters live. 2 of the scarers include Sully (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), who have it good in their job until a mishap occurs- a little child crawls through to the other side and creates a different type of adventure for the two monsters.Incredibly imaginative and colorful computer-animated, Moster Inc. is definitely one of the best family films of the year by giving genuine entertainment to kids and adults (an added incentive for adults to see the movie: Crystal does a little of his old stand-up near the end) just like the past pixar movies.  The biggest liability: the plot seems structured in the same way as Bug's Life and the Toy Story pics and seems typical for the genre.  Otherwise, quite the see.  Other voices include James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Bonnie Hunt and Frank Oz. A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I can't wait to see it again!!!,"This movie is great!  Technically its amazing but the attention to realistic detail makes the movie.  It is obvious that one of the animators has a small child running around the house. Boo's mannerisms are dead-on.  The story itself is well told, too.I am not really a big fan of animated movies, but this one is definitely one that I will see several times in the theatre and own when it comes out on video.  Its not just a children's movie!  >)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another excellent production by Pixar to watch as a family.,"There are many people who think that this movie was one of the best produced by Pixar. Well, my personal taste differs a little, there are some other films from this studio that I prefer and that I like more (Inside Out, Up and Wall-E are some of them), but that is a matter of personal taste and not properly a matter of merit. It's a great movie, worth watching as a family.The script couldn't be better: the film takes us to a world parallel to ours, where the monsters of our childhood nightmares live. They have found a way to get in and out of our world through a machine, and harness the energy of frightened children's screams to generate electricity for their world. Sullivan and Mike are two monsters who share a good friendship and work together on this task, with Sullivan holding the record for scariest monster. However, things get out of hand when a human child ends up entering the world of monsters (they think children are toxic, and they poison everything they touch) and become very fond of the two friends, who now need to get rid of her.The film has a very good cinematography, full of color, light and movement. The digital animation is excellent, creative, original (the details are the key to understanding the originality of the whole set) and very well done. As is the hallmark of this studio, very good actors were chosen to voice the various characters, starting with John Goodman and Billy Crystal. I also liked the participation of Steve Buscemi, who gave life to the villain, Randall, and Jennifer Tilly also deserves praise for her work here. The soundtrack, honestly, didn't add that much to the film, in my opinion, with the exception of a few occasional jazz tones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best for the kiddies,"I have to admit, my main motivation for seeing this film was Billy Crystal. I'm a big fan of his, so when I saw the previews and saw that he was doing the voice of the main character (and I was able to spot Billy's voice in an instant), I said to myself ""I have to see this film.""  Then I found out John Goodman and Steve Buscemi were also doing voices, and I said ""Even better."" That's how you can tell you're getting old:  You're watching animated flicks for the voice-overs...LOL.On the surface, the plot seems creative.  A world populated by monsters, where the sight of a human being scares the heck of them?  Sounds good so far.  But the idea wasn't very well-executed.  Each of the monsters would go through a door, leading to a kid's bedroom, and scare them.  Supposedly, the energy in Monstropolis--where they live--is powered by human screams. That I just found silly.  And I know they were trying to make the grown-ups laugh with such one-liners as ""Kids just don't get scared the way they used to,"" but it just didn't work.  The idea was too silly!  Again, filmmakers undermining the intelligence of young boys and girls.Throughout the film, I couldn't help but anticipate the next thing Billy Crystal's character would spurt out.  Why?  Because he's Billy!  But he never does say anything terribly funny.  Is it because it's a kid's film? Hell, that didn't stop Robin Williams from cracking us up as the genie in ""Alladin.""  Instead, Crystal does a stupid gag where he was tries to cover up the fact that a kid has invaded Monstropolis by performing and song-and-dance number, ""Put that thing back where you came from.  So help me!  So help me!""  Now, if that were not in a kid's film and let's say that gag was in a live action film where Billy was doing the same song-and-dance number critics and audiences would look at him and say, ""What kind of lame crap is he pulling?""The animation is good, but I think if they're gonna spend a couple years arduously animating a film of this sort, you may as well make sure you have a good, solid idea!  Like ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2.""  I was trying to keep myself awake during part of the film.  It just bored me.  I'm only gonna give in a halfway decent review because of the animation.My score:  5 (out of 10)",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"There's more for kids than adults, but it's still got plenty of laughs for adults","Monsters Mike Wazowski and Sulley are the best scare team in Monsters Inc. The company catches the screams of children to power the city of Monstropolis.  However Sulley's main rival, Randall Boggs is up to no good and is working the rooms after the factory is shut.  Sulley stays late one night to find a door has been left open and that a highly dangerous little girl gets trapped on the wrong side of the door.  With the contamination unit closing in on them, Mike and Sulley must get the girl back into her room and uncover Randall's plot.From the Toy Story producing Pixar comes yet another child/adult cartoon. The story here will satisfy adults and children but it feels like an excuse for things to happen rather than a story in itself.  Where Toy Story had layers of story this is quite straightforward.  That's not to say it's not good, but it is more aimed towards the children than the adults.Similarly the majority of the comedy is aimed at children.  The only consistent laughs for adults come from the original `one-eyed monster' (where was that joke!?) Mike - he delivers plenty of funny lines and his musical over the outtakes is the funniest thing in the whole film.  The problem is that it doesn't have Toy Story's spread of backup characters to deliver one-liners, here we have the three main characters and a couple of baddies, other than that there are no really good support roles - even Celia is wasted as Mike's love interest.There are still more laughs than many real comedies!  But it's unfortunate that it's only left to Mike to carry the adult humour.  The animation here has really advanced from Toy Story - just check out Sulley's hairy coat to see the detail.  At times you forget it's a cartoon - the characters and backgrounds just look so very real.  The final chase through the many doors of the factory is really exciting visually and is pleasing to all.A great voice cast includes Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, Buscemi, and Tilly all do well, but Crystal is the only one that has much to do and he comes away with all the praise.Overall it is aimed more at kids than adults and it's not near the heights of Toy Story.  However there is still lots to enjoy for all ages.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward,"First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Worth Buying,"I purchased this movie over online as a DVD pair, the only movie I have ever done this with. I liked Randall Boggs best and found myself sympathizing with him more than I ever have a villain before. The plot twist may have been foreseeable to some reviewers, but I was taken completely by surprise when I first saw it, and even seeing it again do not have any inkling about what it will be until it is revealed. The relationship between Sully and Mike is right on target, and the storyline is excellent. I did not see this for the humor, but for the plot and setting, and at these the movie is superlative. The only problem is that we do not have a PG-6 rating level, since it really doesn't deserve a PG-13 yet might be too scary for very small children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Its heart outshines its technical achievements... as it should,"""Monsters, Inc"" is essentially about embracing your fears, andlearning to laugh at them. A very timely message, don't you think?It's true that the little girl is absolutely adorable (but notsaccharine), but the heart of the film is the growing relationshipbetween Sully (big furry blue monster, voice by John Goodman)and this pre-verbal little girl he calls ""Boo."" At first, she's sort of apet that he's apprehensive about. Predictably, she becomes much,much more to him. Sully learns to be a father.This movie made me cry. And laugh. It does have some laggingmoments, and isn't quite on par with ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Toy Story 2,""but it's darned good. (I've never been a big fan of the original ""ToyStory,"" which seemed more concerned with ""gee-whiz-look-what-we-can-do-with-computers,"" rather than storyand character, at which the subsequent Pixar films have excelled.)Technically, it's years ahead of ""Shrek,"" which, in my opinion,offered nothing beyond lifelike-looking characters (whonevertheless do not move in a lifelike fashion) and a dash of hipcynicism. Watch this movie and notice that the characters move ina completely convincing way, that fur and hair behave as they do inlife, but that the movie does not call attention to it. ""Monsters, Inc.""is concerned with more important things.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I loved this movie...and I don't even like Disney.,"One of the ways that I rank a really good movie is one that gives us a new perspective on our own world. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one such movie. Set in Monstropolis, the movie shows that monsters are in fact not much different from humans. The two main monsters are one-eyed, diminutive Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and furry behemoth James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman). They work at Monsters, Incorporated, where everyone's job is to go into children's bedrooms, roar at them, and record the screams - which they use to power the city. When a little girl accidentally gets into Monstropolis, they not only have to do everything possible to hide her from the authorities, but they discover a bizarre conspiracy.One of this movie's most interesting aspects was it's timing. Released less than two months after September 11, 2001, it was sort of reminding us that human nature is in fact good - even if they had to use monsters to show it. Also, the scene where a monster walks back into the factory with a sock apparently reminded some people of the anthrax attacks. Oh well. Life goes on. With some absolutely hilarious lines, ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the best examples of a movie. I'm even someone who doesn't like Disney and I'm saying this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a dynamic duo throughout the entire movie, Steve Buscemi gives a great performance as the villain Randall.

"Beautiful, but Soulless (6/10)","(I saw this in the theater, YMMV)Let's start with what makes this movie stand out from the crowd -- Pixar's rendering of the big blue furry monster, Sulley.  I am in complete awe of what Pixar has accomplished with rendering Sulley.  My mouth fell open and my head spun during a scene where Sulley is lying on the ground in a snowstorm.  Lying in the snow with all of his fur waving in the wind and the snowflakes flying by and getting caught in his fur.  Spectacular. Amazing. Probably took months of the entire processing power of every computer on the west coast to render that scene.Other than that, there ain't much else to recommend this movie.  I didn't care one whit about any of the characters in this movie.  None of them, not even Boo, the little girl.  She was soooo precious and soooo fearless that she was completely unbelievable.  In addition, there is seemingly a new rule mandating the use of a rollercoaster-like scene in every computer animated movie.  If you like that kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed.  The rollercoaster-like scene in Monsters, Inc. seems to go on forever, and starts to feel like just another gimmick to show off how smart those programmers are.Monsters, Inc. is a wonderful demonstration for the technical wizardry at Pixar, but it just never quite makes it as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Typical Low-brow yuk-fest,Well maybe not. It didn't even have many yuks.

Funny and creative,"This film had really cool, imaginative animation.  Plus the plot was entertaining.  I liked the idea of children's screams powering Monstropolis, cute and funny.  The little girl, Boo, had such a funny, little laugh.  I liked how all the monster characters had their own personalities.  From the striking colors to the way the hair moved on Sully to the snow blizzard, the CGI was great.   I also liked the expected chase scene because it was  a little different in this movie. Here, Sully, Mike, and Boo travel through doors and come out in different places and out of different doors as they are being chased by the evil Randall as they search for Boo's door.  I just really liked the uniqueness of these scenes.  Also, the final scene was touching, and we get to see how Sully's character transform from a scarer to someone who just wants to make kids laugh.FINAL VERDICT:  I highly recommend this for kids as well as adults. It is entertaining, cute, and funny.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best Pixar effort so far.,"I know. That's a pretty bold statement. Don't get me wrong, ""The Incredibles"" is certainly worthy of mentioning in this post as is ""Toy Story"" & ""Finding Nemo"". Hell, there hasn't been a weak Pixar film yet. ""Cars"" is definitely my least favorite, but was still miles ahead of anything Dreamworks has done.But for me ""Monsters Inc."" is just the complete package. Obviously the animation is stellar. That pretty much goes without saying for this company. But the animation isn't even the greatest strength of this film. Like ""Toy Story"" before it, the characters in this movie possessed depth and personality, as much as any live action film. Whoever didn't fall in love with Boo upon first introduction, is either heartless or a robot. And furthermore the relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is absolutely touching, while the dynamic of Mike and Sully's relationship is complex and anything but uninteresting.And then there's the real accomplishment of ""Monsters Inc."" which is the originality and creativity inherent in every aspect. This film has such a rich imagination that can be found in everything from the Characters to the films sense of humor. And the plot is one of the most original pieces of screen writing I've ever seen. The first thing I thought after seeing this movie for the first time (And I went to catch the Star Wars: Episode II trailer, not expecting too much from the actual movie!) was ""How in the hell did they dream that up?!?"" I always admire when a movie provides a story that you know was given the utmost thought and attention, and this is no exception.Upon further viewings I began seeing it as timeless fairy tale. Like a household bedtime story that's been around for centuries. I was certain it would have at least an 8.0 rating on this site and was a little confused to see otherwise, especially with other Pixar works in the top 250. But alas I know that this is all just my own opinion and not everyone agrees. Is there anyone else that feels so strongly about this movie? Am I crazy? Dellusional? Maybe all of the above.But at the end of the day this truly is a great piece of film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and walk, no run... you know what take your time, but get somewhere that has this movie and watch it. Alright, you know what?

"Fun and Entertaining, but Not a Classic","Pixar has released its first mediocre film with Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But it lacked the sense of wonder of Toy Story, the character strength of A Bug's Life and the zest of Toy Story 2. This movie has some great scenes and fills the screen with wonderful images, but it falls short of its predecessors.Maybe living up to the first three Pixar features is an impossible task.Monsters Inc. has a wonderfully original premise. Monstropolis, the land where monsters live, generates its power from the screams of children. Monsters Inc. is a power plant where the most talented ""scarers"" pop through closest doors though a portal into a child's bedroom anywhere on earth. They scare, the kids scream, the monsters leave and Monstropolis has their power. A problem arises - kids just don't scare that easy any more. Only the top scarers are getting results. (As the ads say ""We scare, because we care."")There are two masterworks of animation in this film. The first is Billy Crystals character, Mike, who is essentially an eyeball with legs and arms. But even with these limited features, Mike still has phenomenal body language and facial expressions. The second is Waternoose, the boss at Monsters Inc voiced by James Cockburn. Waternoose is this giant, multi-eyed thing in a business suit that creeps along on crab legs, but projects the image of ""the boss"" while still being creepy. Amazing.I found Randall, the villain, just not bad enough. To be a Disney villain, you have to live up to the standards set by the likes of Ursula, Uncle Scar, the Wicked Witch and Jafar and Randall just doesn't cut it.Still a strong recommendation for this film. There are some fabulous visuals, most notably the wild ride through the warehouse of doors, and it sports a very original premise and works it well. I will never think of the number 2319 the same ever again.***1/2 out of ****.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Enjoyable well created compu-toon. Some flaws, but still highly entertaining","The latest compu-toon from the Big Mouse is a highly entertaining one, which is a step further in computer animation. Released about the same time as Dreamwork's `Shrek' and 20th Century Fox's `Ice Age', this proves that Disney is still as strong as it was 60+ years ago.The story is set in Monstropolis as big-time scarer Sulley and his one eyed friend Mike work for Mr. WaterNoose at Monsters Incorporated. They use children's screams to produce electricity for the city. But when a human child accidentally gets into Monstropolis, Mike and Sulley must try to get it back into the real world, all while avoiding rival monster Randell.As you can see, it's very imaginative and has a fresh concept. For the most part, the vocal talent is very good. John Goodman is easily recognisable and suitable as the big monster, Sulley. Billy Crystal is really good as well and his cynical, sarcastic sense of humour helps liven up the film and give it a sharper edge. Jennifer Tilly is also good as love interest Celia and has great chemistry with the rest of the characters. The only one who didn't work for me was Steve Buscemi as the film's villain. He seemed inappropriate for the part and didn't have enough characteristics to be evil enough, mind you he does get a good come-upance.One of the film's main flaws was its style of humour. Much of it is based on the monsters over-reacting to very mild situations. This is OK in small doses, but it's been cropping up in many Disney films as of late. But the character humour helps make up for this. Some scenes in the film are a bit sugary and bring down the film's momentum. Most of those scenes between Sulley and Boo will be a letdown for adults.But the stunning visuals and good script should make up for these flaws. It lacks the dry wit and consistent entertainment of non Disney films such as the PG rated `Antz' and `Shrek', and the overall shape of the similarly themed `Ice Age', but it's imaginative, creative and a very welcome addition from Disney.By about an eyelash, it's the least of the three compu-toons released almost simultaneously but it's an excellent movie for children and adults alike. 7.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Good. . . but Not Great!,"Pixar can do no wrong, in my opinion.  In MONSTERS, INC., they did no wrong; they just didn't do enough that was right!  I liked the movie, but I didn't love it.  There was just something missing and I'm not sure what it was. Maybe it was the fact that there were no really well-developed supporting characters.  It was ALL Mike and ALL Sully.  And that wasn't enough! Randall was a good villain; he just wasn't villanous enough! Maybe the monsters weren't scarey enough. . . or cuddly enough.  They seemed to be mostly potatoes, slugs or sausages with an unusual number of eyes. And the boss monster was a rip-off from one of the mutant toys in TOY STORY. Maybe there weren't enough in-jokes to keep adults entertained.  Oh, sure, I liked the STALK/DON'T STALK crossing light.  And I saw the TOY STORY doll but I'm not sure whether it was Woody or the cowgirl.  And I caught the Oscar Meyer jingle line.  But I wanted more. Maybe I was waiting for a song and dance number.  Randy Newman wrote the music.  Why can't we have more than a sing-along over the credits? And where were the Pixar out-takes at the end? I'm not sure the kids in the audience liked the movie so much either.  The kid sitting next to me knew who all the monsters were; she shouted their names out to her dad who was sitting down the row.

Monsters Inc.,"Monsters Inc. is another Pixar classic, originated by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton & Joe Ranft, while shooting for Toy Story. Pete Docter took on the role of director, being his first gig as a director for a major production, while Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter & Darla K. Anderson produced.Monsters Inc. was a very well told story. The narrative didn't just focus on scaring; It had a few sub plots, of friendship and maturing, but Andrew Stanton, Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, Ralph Eggleston & Daniel Gerson balanced every subplot so well, that it flowed just right with the story. The writers stood true to the G rating, and kept everything pretty sane, with a lot of well rounded comedic tone.John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton & Joe Ranft, designed these extremely detailed & creative looking characters, with their own personalities, sounds, and appearance. Mike is one of main protagonist, who plays the smart guy, while Michael ""Sulley"" Sullivan, who is our other protagonist, is like the Tom Brady of Monsters Incorporated. Mike & Sulley have this tremendous chemistry, you can only really dream to have with a friend/co-worker. For someone who didn't have much to say, that we can really understand, Boo tests Mike & Sulley's friendship to different levels! Her character is so cute and charming, carrying a lot of weight for someone who couldn't sit still during voice recordings. Steve Buscemi does a great job as the voice of Randall, but he isn't the smartest of the villain bunch. If you really watch what he does, he's pretty oblivious, and his outcome is pretty pathetic, but comedic gold on our end.Needless to say, the animations were beautiful, with great detail, and textures. The score and music by Randy Newman was fantastic. It was so much fun, that it won an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song.Overall, Monsters Inc. belongs at the top of the pack, because of all the heart, and wit put into this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Frankly, it wasn't that funny and moved kind of slow. And of course was totally predictable.   My 5 year old about 30 minutes into it kept saying 'daddy, this isn't funny'.There were a few cute gags, but not nearly the laughs of either toy story.Sorry, cant go over 6/10 on this one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You won't believe your eye.' after watching this Pixar masterpiece!,"After you have seen Pixar's Monsters, Inc.' two things are apparent about monsters. One is that humans think monsters are scary, and two, is that humans really scare them! I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a cartoon or a movie so much. I know that Pixar has had great success with many animated movies in the past. However, I feel that Monsters Inc.' out-classes such titles as, Toy Story', Shrek' and A Bug's Life' by far. With its funny story, great characters and wonderful voiceovers, Monsters, Inc.' will be a tough act to follow in the world of movie animation. Take a look at the monsters who say We Scare Because We Care'.Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world. The top kid scarer is James ""Sully"" Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant and best friend is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, feisty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job, monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can be found the factory's crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns Mike and Sully's world upside-down.There is so much to like about Monsters, Inc.'. The team from Pixar really give great attention to detail when they bring out an animated feature. I really like the computer animated graphics, as many of these characters to me seem to be real. The many facial expressions these monsters have are just wonderful. They were so funny, that they made me laugh many times. The sounds used in Monsters Inc' were of the finest quality and help to define the monsters and the world they live in. I also like the story that Pixar made for this film. Having doors between the monsters world and ours is clever. Also having the story follow the fortunes of Mike and Sully is good, as it is never dull or boring when it come to those two characters. Add in the what Boo does to the story, I feel it makes for the perfect script. I enjoy how this story ends, as it made me feel very satisfied for watching.The characters that were invented for this film are some of the best I have ever seen. My favourite is the simple, but idiotic eyeball, Mike Wazowski'. Almost every time I saw his eye appear onscreen, he would make me laugh. Mike's best friend, is James Sully' Sullivan, and scaring kids is what he is really good at. Mike and Sully are a great team. There characters show the audience that real friends stick together through thick and thin. The other good characters include Mike's love interest Celia. The nicknames the pair call each other are hilarious. I cannot forget to mention one of the main stars of the show, Boo (Mary Gibbs). She is the little child who manages to make her way inside Monsters, Inc.'. I love her funny cry of Mike-Wazowski'. Yet with the good comes the bad. The meanest monster in Monstropolis' is a snaky chameleon character, called Randal Boggs. He is trying to become the number one scream collector at Monsters, Inc'. Another character not be trusted or liked at Monsters Inc' is Henry J. Waternoose, the CEO of the plant. He is a cross between a crab and spider, and only wants his employees to scare children and make him successful.The voiceovers used in this film were out of this world'. Having stars such as Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, James Coburn as Henry and Steve Buscemi as Randall, were all perfect choices to voice each character. You can actually picture Crystal as Mike, the talkative sidekick and Goodman as Sully, the big cuddly blue Monster, who really does care about everyone. I love Roger Ebert's cheeky comment in reference to Jennifer Tiley's character of Celia, `What she (Celia) sees in him (Mike) is beyond me, although if there is anyone who can figure out how to have sex with a green eyeball, that would be Jennifer Tilly. I can imagine her brassy voice: 'Blink! Blink!'.'There are some great scenes in Monsters, Inc'. I like almost every scene with Mike, as he is crazy, funny and stupid. Sully's introduction with Boo is also a highlight, as we all see what a little child can do to the number one scarer'. Then what follows is the funny scene where Mike says the silly line of `This is for the up-coming company play put that thing back where it came from or so help me'. Watch out for the play on the DVD, it is a classic extra feature. Another entertaining sequence in the film is the rollercoaster chase that Mike and Sully have to do, contending with hundreds of conveyor-driven doors to make sure that Boo is safe.I recently had the chance to compare the other animated film which has been released at the moment, Ice Age'. While I know it has had good reviews from many people, I found to be nowhere near as good as what 'Monsters, Inc.' was or is. Pixar is truly talented at bringing us movies, which are normally thought to be just for children'. However, this movie can be enjoyed by many different groups as its genre suggests, such as the whole family'. I know being a kid helps me for starters, but if you cannot like Mike and the gang' then there is something wrong. I wait in anticipation for what Pixar brings us next. If you are a true movie fan, then do yourself a favour and show that you care' by watching this animated classic.CMRS gives 'Monsters, Inc': 5 (Brilliant Film)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The Laughs keep on coming,"Though I slept on the couch throughout my life, I never really experienced sleeping in my own bed until I got older; and yet, I never figured out if monsters ever lived in my closet or better yet, wondered why there would be a monster in my closet? Monsters, Inc. is about a company in Monstorpolis City (hence the title) that has monsters to scare kids as a way of their energy of keeping the city alive. It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey). Sulley's competitor is Randall Wallace (no relation to the director and is voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do anything to win and be number one.The rule that Monsters, Inc. has is not to get into contact or let a child touch them. In one scene during the big scream fest, a big blue monster screams out of a closet crying saying that the child wasn't scared and that it touched him. The other monster replies, ""She was only six!"" When Randall tries to cheat in the competition while every monster is away, Sulley sees a door with flowers on it and opens the door. He hears someone messing with his tail and sees a little girl playing with it. Sully does not scare her, but he's reaction lead into a chase where this time it's the other way around; the little girl is chasing the monster. The city finds out that there's a little girl on the run and afraid that they'll get a disease from the child. Though the film is a buddy picture, the main characters are the little girl (Boo) and Sulley as he watches over her making sure that she doesn't get hurt. Most people would consider ""Shrek"" a better cartoon because of its cruelness and ethnicity, but I also like ""Monsters, Inc."" because it's cute in a way of curiosity and realizing that monsters have lives too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I predict this being an animated Classic one day.,"MONSTERS INC - 2001Directed by ​Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich & David SilvermanStarring Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve BuscemiPlot Overview: ​Monsters Incorporated is the largest scare factory in the monster world, and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is one of its top scarers. Sullivan is a huge, intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a green, opinionated, feisty little one-eyed monster. Visiting from the human world is Boo (Mary Gibbs), a tiny girl who goes where no human has ever gone before.This movie is a definitive representation of Pixar Standard, back in their golden age. I am confident it will become an animated classic, and rightfully so. It is rare for a movie to come out that is so original, creative and imaginative. The voice acting is amazing, especially from Crystal and Goodman. The animation is great. My main flaw with the movie is how awful the plot is.It's a paper thin plot that features way too many 'twists and turns' to make it interesting. I don't know a SINGLE person who says they were interested by the plot of this movie. I don't. My adoration for this film stems from the colourful characters, not an overly complicated plot about power shortages.Two things that are kinda plot related that I do like, however, are are the climax and the final scene of the movie. The climax for this movie is an insanely fun ride and it is just so creative in how it is handled. Then the final scene of this movie. I mean damn it is a punch to the stomach. I'm not spoiling anything but I mean, damn Pixar. Why. Don't do this to me.As far as performances go, this movie is very strong. Billy Crystal gives one of my favourite Pixar performances as Mike Wazowski and is the standout of this film. He is consistently funny and Crystal showed some impressive range in emotion delivered. John Goodman is also excellent as Sully and provided as strong, authoritative presence to the role. Steve Buscemi is great as Randall and makes him one of my favourite Pixar villains, easily. James Coburn was alright as Waterloose but I really did not find his character interesting in the slightest. The design on him was amazing though. Boo is a cute character and serves her purpose so I can't really praise nor fault her.For the time of this film's release, the animation is exceptional. Seriously, it looks fantastic for the time. I absolutely love the character design for all the characters. Each and everyone is unique and hints at the characters personality without requiring them to speak much at all. One minor flaw with the animation is that Boo looks like a plastic doll. She doesn't look human at all. I understand there were limitations at the time but it is sill a flaw. It is a well shot and edited movie.Comedy wise, this is probably one of Pixar's funniest. The humour is genuinely good and that primarily comes down to Crystal's impressive performance and vocal talent. As far as emotional payoff goes, this movie also succeeds. The last scene is all I need to refer to because that scene is Pixar punching me in the stomach continuously. It is very well done.This movie is a prime example of what Pixar is capable of. It is funny with good emotional payoff, it has great animation, great vocal performances and a fantastic premise. It truly is an exceptional movie.

Animation becomes ordinary,"Whereas much of the success of films like `Toy Story' or `A Bug's Life' is a result of the fact that the phenomenon of entire computer animation was a fairly new genre, now gradually this plus gets lost. More and more frequently, computer animated movies about various cute creatures are made and audiences aren't surprised any more about the endless possibilities of computer techniques. Moreover, I believe that with `Shrek', the genre already reached its climax as well as its ironic turn. What could follow?`Monsters, Inc.' provides less laughs than `Shrek', it doesn't have the sensational character of former computer animation features. Of course the monster world and its population are nice and imaginative, but the story started off a little too complicated. It is becoming harder and harder to fulfil the task of creating `human' situations in a world of non-humans, so the basic structures are getting more and more far-fetched. However, there were some surprising features, especially towards the end, which made this (children's) film something special, also for adults: the ice sequence for instance, and that magnificent door-machine.

"A Hilarious, yet Heartfelt Experience","Monsters Inc is an amazing concept fueled by a common disbelief by children that a monster lives in their closet.

Monsters Inc is also a very heartfelt and emotional film. The ending, while being sad, feels like the right thing to happen. However the very last scene gives us hope for a happy, satisfying ending to the story.

"Not one of Pixar's absolute best, but still really good","Monsters INC is the fourth feature film released by Pixar, and while I think it falls a little short of being a masterpiece, it still holds up as a classic, or close to it. It was released during Pixar's golden age and is a worthy addition within Pixar's classic run.A big part of its success comes from Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the lead voice actors, as they give the characters so much personality (as does the rest of the cast.) It's a bright and colourful movie, and fun to look at, and rewatching all the Pixar movies in order, I like seeing the animation get better bit by bit over time.There's a lot of imagination that's gone into the unique world in Monsters INC, and the whole concept of travelling through doors to the human world is really cool, and makes for a great climax.That being said, there are other parts of the final act that feel a bit rushed. Maybe it comes together a bit too quickly and neatly (how did Mike get back from the Himalayas almost as quickly as Sully?), but it's not a dealbreaker. And emotionally it's not as hard-hitting as Toy Story 2 or Finding Nemo or some other great Pixar movies, but when it does try to pull its audience's heartstrings, it does a pretty good job.It's a great kids movie overall though, and for many other animation studios, it would probably be their best film (not Pixar though, and it's a testament to their talent back in the day that Monsters INC wouldn't even come close to cracking my personal top 5).",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Lots of Fun From Pixar,"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley (John Goodman) finds his world disrupted.With the additional voices of Steve Buscemi and John Ratzenberger (as the Agreeable Snowman), this is a great story of monsters in the closet... turned upside down. In this version, monsters only scare children because it generates electricity, and the monsters actually fear children, believing them to be toxic.Of Pixar's films, this is definitely one of the more iconic and memorable, right up there with ""Toy Story"".

The Britney Spears of CGI - Oops! Pixar's done it again...,"10 reasons why ""Monsters, Inc."" was robbed by ""Shrek"" at the Oscars:1. The writing holds together better - there isn't a single wasted bit in the movie, from the simulation at the beginning to the seemingly pointless croaky-voiced martinet for paperwork who turns out to be... but that would be telling.2. The humour is less scatological and more character-based.3. The animation is so effective that it's hard to believe it's animation (two highlights are Sullivan's sleigh ride down a snowy mountain at night and the door chase climax - door chase? Just see the movie)...4. ...but the movie never gives you a chance to just wind up being amazed at how it looks and forget about how it feels.5. It doesn't try and impress you with its pop-culture references and how clever it is generally (there is a restaurant called Harryhausen's, but that doesn't really count).6. The voice performances; one of the tests of a cartoon is if the voice cast isn't distracting, and save the Abominable Snowman (voice of John ""Cliff Clavin"" Ratzenberger) that isn't the case. Kudos all round, but particularly Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, and Bonnie Hunt as the aforementioned martinet (see #1).7. Only one ""proper"" song, and even then it's by the great Randy Newman.8. The relationship between Sullivan and Boo (the little girl who gets into Monstropolis) is genuinely touching.9. The end credits not only feature always welcome ""outtakes"" but also follow up a plot strand from the movie itself.10. No DreamWorks tit-for-tat pokes.But then, they don't need to - movies like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and this one speak for themselves.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"When a little girl is released into an unknown world, chaos ensues...","Pixar have, it seems, done it again. Coupled with breath-taking animation and a superb storyline, Monsters, Inc. has achieved something truly incredible- a film able to entertain not only children, but those 'over the hill' too.The basic plot is that there is another universe, full of the monsters that one sees in childhood hiding under your bed or in your closet. These monsters go to all different parts of the world through portals in the doors to be able to scare the children, and in return collect the children's screams, as it is, for them, a form of energy. But chaos ensues when a little girl is accidentally let into the Monster World, and a more sinister plan is revealed...The voice acting, for one, is superb, with each character's personality shining through magnificently. The actors were chosen well, with John Goodman as the cheery James P. Sullivan, and Billy Crystal providing the voice of the marmite-esquire character Mike Wazowski. (Marmite because you either love his quirky jokes, or hate his boastful nature.) Also, a kudos has to be given to Steve Buscemi for playing the sinister, yet, in my opinion, weirdly lovable character of Randall Boggs- his voice fits perfectly.All in all, this film is definitely not one to be missed, and deserved all of the praise it has received.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Laughs + Heart = Fun,"Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the ""funny + heart"" formula. ""Monsters, Inc."", while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.For a basic plot summary, this movie poses that the ""monster in the closet"" you were scared of as a kid was indeed real and just trying to scare you to collect your screams, which powers their entire industry. One ""routine day at the Monster scare factory"", however, top scare-er Sulley (John Goodman) and pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) bring a small girl back into their own world, wreaking havoc along the way and learning a pretty valuable lesson in the process.To be sure, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a great animation effort. It is witty (for both adults and children), full of action/adventure, and has a lot of heart/emotions weaved into the proceedings. Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.The only reason I give the movie four stars instead of five is because, unlike the top tier of Disney/Pixar efforts like Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and Up, this one shies away from the take-home message when it could have embraced it. For example, and I'll try to be as spoiler- free as possible here, towards the end of the movie the two leads make a discovery (which is hinted at throughout the film) that will change the ""Monster world"" forever. Instead of really delving into the consequences of that revelation, however, the producers choose to ""keep things simple"" and not get too deep. I think they could have gone a little deeper and doing so would have vaulted this one into the upper echelon.Overall, though, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy. While it may not be the absolute best of its kind, it is still easily better than most.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I liked the bond that was formed between Boo and Sulley when Sulley realised that Boo was no harm to them.It is not as good as Toy story as the story line is not as strong but still very watchable.The animation in this film is wonderful, the characters are well designed and have well developed personalities, particularly the two leads.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Starts Good But Ends Up Being A Poor Toy Story Wannabe,"Plot: In Monsters Inc. monsters must enter a parallel universe where human children sleep and scare them. This must be done in order for them to collect screams, which can be then converted to energy. However it is a tough job since children are considered highly lethal so when a child hops into their world all hell brakes loose.You'll love Monsters Inc. if: You like good animated movies that bring out your inner child. Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. deals with quite an original concept by bringing to life an imaginary aspect of most people's childhood. The movie has very good visuals and sound, its Pixar after all and it has some very good voice actors, (excellent choice on the main ones). Monsters Inc. while not the greatest animation of all time will entertain you the first or second time you'll watch it.You'll hate Monsters Inc. if: You expected to laugh more or if you expected some originality in terms of story progression. While the main concept is VERY original, the execution is quite typical. What starts as something very interesting ends up being a boring good vs. evil chase, where everything is predictable as hell. Most importantly though I didn't laugh that's my main problem the film just wasn't funny. I always watch animated films with my girlfriend since we both love them and all that happened was: Me snickering in the first 10 minutes of the movie and my girlfriend laughing each time that cute 3-year old girl would do something cute and adorable this isn't comedy, it was just an entertaining movie to pass the time.FINAL VERDICT: Toy Story Knew Better (6.3/10)[+] An original concept.

Less than Toy Story Better than Most,"Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Awww...Real Monsters,"""Monsters INC"" is a terrific Pixar film during a run where the company was making nothing but bangers. It is easy to look back and just see it as just another good film in Pixar's line up. But, at the time, this was the first truly great Pixar movie not starring Woody and Buzz. This was the movie that made the company of Pixar synonymous with quality and not just ""Toy Story"". It was among the first group to be nominated for the new Academy category: ""Best Animated Picture"".The story has a very clever premise. There is a world of monsters who enter our world through children's' closets. And the monsters bottle kids' screams and use it as electricity. In, what has now become a Pixar staple, they explain this high concept in a manner that audiences of all ages can understand.The animation is great. The character design for the monsters are all varied, unique and charming. The voice acting of John Goodman and Billy Crystal create an excellent back and forth. The story builds to an exciting finale. The characters go through major emotional arcs. And the whole thing has a delightful sense of humor to it.There are a couple of character moments that feel a bit forced. But overall, this is a great movie for people of all ages. My only other complaint is the name. ""Monsters INC"". Would that be like calling a company here ""Human INC""? Do they see themselves as ""monsters""?

Shriek Business...,"Furry and scaly creatures from Monstropolis, a city powered by the screams of terrified children, attempt to nab a carefree youngster who has infiltrated the factory, taking an instant liking to amiable partners-in-fear ""Sulley"" Sullivan (a gorilla-sized daddy with blue fur) and Mike Wazowski (a one-eyed, dodge-ball-shaped wisecracker). Another hectic bit of computer-animated whimsy from Disney/Pixar takes a while to get its story ironed out, though the plot culminates wonderfully in a brilliantly-designed chase sequence. Long at 92 minutes, and perhaps too sticky with sentiment, but children probably won't mind.

Cute and that's a good thing,"Pixar strikes the imagination mother lode again with ""Monster's Inc.""

You'll see it but won't like it.,"What a disappointment! We've come to expect a lot from Pixar and the earlier films have not failed. Monsters is a failure. The story line, while novel, is weak and thin. The pace of the movie is a keen to a Saturday morning Bugs Bunny 3 min short. Nothing sets in and most of the film is spent in a chase scene of various sorts. Next is the lack of characters, Mike (the green ball) frankly isn't that interesting, he's almost cute, almost really funny, but then not. Sully (the furry guy) is the haphazard hero. The duo reminded me of the Lewis/Martin act. After these 2, nothing, zip, nada worth while.My kids are normally glued to any Disney event, but even at 90 minutes they were bored after 30. Nice try. BTW .. the little mini Birds shown at the beginning is excellent, unfortunately, it goes downhill from there.Regrettably, you'll see the movie because you have to, but save your money and go during the bargain hours.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not much here for grown-ups,"Coming to this film late (I missed it the first time round) I'm afraid found myself rather underwhelmed. Shorn of the 'wow-look-at-the-fur' novelty rendering factor, what remains is a rather thin piece of slapstick with additional heavy-handed sentiment; the level of humour is distinctly juvenile, epitomised by the 'yellow snow' jokes, and the moral message hammered home with a twenty-foot mallet.Compared to films like ""Wall-E"" or ""The Incredibles"", this has little to offer adult viewers -- the whole lengthy opening sequence revolves around what is basically a single role-reversal concept, that the monsters are in fact terrified of the children they scare, but this idea is worked to death long before we actually start to care about the characters, with resulting tedium. The film picks up in interest later on, but it then descends into a long chase sequence, while I did find the sentimental sequences grated with excessive repetition.'Mike' is a typical Annoying Disney Sidekick of the type I've never cared for, but the little girl is charming (and her pre-verbal sequences conveyed in what amounts to silent film technique, an interesting precursor to the long wordless introductory sequence of ""Up""). Other characters, including Sulley, I found 'all right' but nothing very special.I suppose I'm unduly disappointed in the film because Pixar have established the boundaries of expectation so high; but this picture is to ""The Incredibles"" as ""Flushed Away"" is to ""Chicken Run"" -- for an Oscar-winning Pixar animation, it was rather more generic and less inspired than I was hoping for.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar delivers a bland comedy,"Although this movie was hardly as entertaining as the previous Pixar films, Toy story and its sequal Toy Story 2, it still contained fascinating humor that little kids as well as adults could enjoy.  What made the movie worth viewing in theatres is the mere fact that the trailer for episode 2 Attack of the Clones was beforehand.  After seeing a movie trailer of that magnitude brings down the entertainment value of the movie, well at least for myself and every other Star Wars fan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Monsters, Inc., A quirky twist on the interactions between monsters and humans","This family-friendly animation takes place in the world of monsters. At Monsters, Inc., the monsters enter doors, leading to the closets of children on a quest to scare as many of them as possible to fill up energy tanks that help keep their city powered. As with many companies, Monsters, Inc. keeps track of top performers, thus invoking a competitive spirit amongst the monster employees. Things change when Sullivan, also known as Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) stumbles upon a little girl named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) and is forced to face and perhaps overcome his fears.Sulley is the top scarer and has been for many months. His best friend Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) stays close by helping him stay in top performer shape, though he sometimes gets sidetracked by his romantic interest, receptionist Celia (voiced by Jennifer Tilly). Sulley's fiercest competition comes from Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do whatever he can, with some help from his sidekick Fungus (voiced by Frank Oz), to snag the top spot from Sulley, including cheating.Humans, primarily children, are a feared species, so when Boo, who Randall has a lot of success frightening, enters Monsters, Inc., it changes Sulley's life forever. Initially, Sulley is afraid and does everything he can to get rid of Boo. As Sulley gets to know her, over the course of time, he becomes less fearful and even turns into Boo's protector. Eventually, Sulley learns that his fear, along with the other monsters, of children is misguided and over exaggerated due to lack of knowledge. This makes me think of the movie Inside Out and how our emotions can lead us astray if we don't keep them in check. Once Sulley gains some insight, his new awareness ultimately leads to a delightful change in how business is conducted at Monsters, Inc.There were shadowy effects throughout the film which added a sense of suspense. However, the lighting on Sulley is soft, which gave warmth to his character, even though he's one of the largest monsters. The transitions from scene to scene were smooth. The music effects are suspenseful, happy and playful in the right areas. The attention to detail in all sectors made the movie thrive.I really enjoyed Monsters, Inc. I would rank it as one of my favorite animated movies. The writing is funny and witty, and the props are clever. I look forward to watching it again. It was a nice spin on overcoming fears and not judging a book by its cover. Two lessons that are universal and relatable to all ages, races, and genders.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar (mostly) do it again,"There's very few movies that I'd see based solely on a name attached to it. One of these would be a film by David Fincher and another would be a film by Pixar. Pixar produced ""Toy Story"" and, funnily enough, ""Toy Story 2"". Anyone who has seen those classics will realize that that is more than enough to make you go and see ""Monsters, Inc.""How does the movie live up to the legacy of Pixar? Mostly pretty damn well. Firstly it looks wonderful - animation in movies is constantly improving and here we can see how Pixar have been able to enhance details such as the fine movement of hairs on Sully's body. At the same time the movie is able to feel like an animation - it has no pretensions about trying to be real as the characters are animated with extra-large-wide eyes, disproportionate heads, etc.The characters in here are not as good as in the ""Toy Story"" series. That's the film's biggest flaw. They're not as cleverly drawn or as diverse. Certainly we have no cynical Woody with whom the adults of the audience can relate to. Sully is the gentle-lovable-lug and Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is the wise-cracking-side-kick. It's an old and popular formula because it works. The villain of the piece is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) and he's about as one-dimensional as they come which is no more than you'd expect for a movie aimed for the child's market. Boo - the child of the movie - is adorably cute without every being irritatingly so. You can't help but love her and she's the nicest piece of the cast. However in the end I found the cast somewhat unmemorable and the voice-over talent weren't used to their full capabilities (Buscemi could certainly let rip as a cold, calculating villain had be been able to).However a comedy lives and dies by it's script and here ""Monsters, Inc."" is very good. Some comments here suggest that the humour is aimed for children and is thus a hit-and-miss affair with adults but that's a load of cobblers - I was in a packed theatre and every single person was laughing. The humour really kicks into key when Boo - the child who accidentally stumbles into the world of ""Monsters, Inc."" - arrives on the scene and causes havoc by merely wandering around. The concept of the movie - that their world is powered by the screams generated by the monsters that come out of the cupboard to scare children - is wonderful but the final plot resolution is painfully obvious (I know, it's a kids movie but even so...). The script is very well paced and there's plenty of diverting action. Admittedly the humour isn't as clever as ""Shrek"" - there's none of the sly referencing or winks to the older audience - but it's still pretty quick and the out-takes over the closing credits are fantastic.""Shrek"" is the only recently comparable piece to ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"" slightly wins out by virtue of acknowledging it's older audience and having slightly better characterization. That aside ""Monsters, Inc."" is the best comedy I've seen released this year by a long shot and is well well *well* worth seeing. A very firm 8.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Polygon characters with more emotion than human actors.,"How do the wizards at Pixar do it? How can they?That's the only thing I could think about when I watched ""Monsters, Inc."" yesterday. And realized that, no, nothing I had seen there existed. It's a lot easier when watching traditional animation not to get too immersed in the scenes; after all, you are always aware ""this is not here"". But CGI is making tremendous advances every day.Furthermore, it's not only the realistic animation what impresses the most. It's the heart and soul Pixar embed in each and every of its films. Witness ""Shreck"", a very good film on its own right, for example. It was a major hit when it was running on theaters, yet it's seldom talked about nowadays. Now, think ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Toy Story"". Both were movie milestones, and definitely are destined to be classics in a couple of years (dare I say both are ""instant classics""?).The secret, or reason, is in the powerful dose of humanity Pixar gives each and every one of their creations. They all have so many human traits it's very hard not to end up liking (loving?) them as if they were real. In a sense they are, being perfectly well rounded characters in perfectly recognizable situations. The fears and hopes of human beings are indelibly etched in every character (fear of death, fear of loneliness, fear of failure, etc.), which makes them even dearer to our hearts.From the animated short that's shown at the beginning of the movie (the ""Birds"" featurette, a very similar concept to the ""Carnival of the Animals"" section of Fantasia 2000... very funny) to  story development, ""Monsters, Inc."" works like a charm all the way, all the time. Steve Buscemi, John Goodman and Billy Crystal are always having a ball, with a tremendous sense of chemistry between them. Couple that with the prettiest, best CGI character I've ever seen (Boo), and you have a group of superb people playing their parts perfectly well, in a story that is funny, very sweet, and that will leave you filled with love and laughter.Still... I think this movie comes *this* close to being another Toy Story 2. It's not that it is a bad movie; it's just that TS2 is a landmark; not only the best CGI movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made, period. TS2 most enduring quality is that, to a certain degree, it can soften the most hardened soul with its sweet, beautiful message, while ""Monsters"" is a bit less complex in its underlying theme. The fact that it managed to retain so much humanity throughout it, though, is a testament that the wizards at Pixar still have that magic touch that eludes so many famous ""live actors"".I want more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar keeps rolling,"""Monsters, Inc."" did a great social service. While not the best animation I've seen, it is still praiseworthy.

And what better child social service could they have done than having the monsters try to get kids to laugh instead of scream and cry to power their city.

Very Creative,"I had heard a lot about this before I went (which I hate), but it was still a pleasant surprise. What I loved was the workaday world of the monsters with their factory, their doors, their business, so like the corporate life of the non-monster world. The character's have gentleness, commitment, and a positive view of the world. While some of it is scary (the whole premise of monsters in the closet is scary anyway), it walks a nice line between being too saccharine and too violent. There are some great lines, and the imaginative world created and based on the scream/energy concept is quite clever. For those that take three year olds to movies, I don't know many that don't have something that would upset someone this age. This film is about monsters. They can't be too tame or they will lose their monsterness.While there are harsh things, the closing scene is done with great sympathy and on terms that we can all live with. It is also about risk taking to do the right thing. This is not Citizen Kane but it sure ain't bad.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I prefer ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredables"". This was more aimed at the kids if anything, which I know was the main audience. But Pixar does try to add a little adult humor, which I felt that we didn't get enough of. That's my only complaint. Because I didn't laugh a lot like in ""The Incredables"" or ""Ice Age"".

Top Ten?,"I can't see any reason why this animation should be in the top ten of the IMDb list. Having watched it about three, four times yet I haven't found anything that I particularly LIKED about it - maybe it's the way the characters are so-predictably handled, maybe it's the same old Disney-style hero-villain plot, maybe it's just because MI's something that goes in and out of your head so tastelessly it doesn't even leave a trace (I've got the same feelings when I watch Disney's films - but at least sometimes a soundtrack make a little impression - this one doesn't even have a good one).To say the least I've always treated animes with more respect than American animations - maybe because after all you'll see that American producers have but one way to express their theme. Having excellent CG doesn't cut it, unless, of course, if you're just after the huge budgets. MI just like most American animations on this ""top 50"" is after the ""cool"" look, and no-content.

See what really happens on the other side of the monster closet.,"The events of this film, Monsters, Inc., follows that of Monsters University, even though Monsters, Inc. was released first. Here, monsters Mike Wazowski and James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan work at Monsters Inc., the utility company that powers the city from the goose bumps of children they scare after entering their bedrooms at night through their closets. Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world, causing chaos for the monsters since children are actually toxic to them.Like Monsters University, it is filled with humor, adventures and funny characters. The animation was great and I enjoyed watching the interaction between the monsters in their world and what actually happens on the other side of the closet door before the monster steps out into the child's bedroom. It certainly gives the audience a new perspective and meaning of the ""monster in the closet."" Even for a monster-themed film, Pixar makes it both exciting and family-friendly, keeping in with the tradition of Disney. The voice actors, particularly that of Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the lead roles, were great. They give Mike and Sullivan just the right touch of love-hate friendship, though I thought Mike went just a little overboard with his over-zealousness and frustration. And, the portrayal of the little girl was cute and innocent, but I thought was too annoying as the five year-old who runs into trouble all the time and displays just about every bad quality of a misbehaving child: moaning, crying and being mischievous in every possible way. But, the overall chemistry between her and Sully is quite touching.Overall, the story was pretty intriguing with an adventurous second half.

Introduced a major talent,"Pete Doctor would go onto helm several other Pixar projects-Up, Soul, Inside Out etc.-most of which are absolute top tier Pixar. I would go as far as to say that Doctor has a stronger filmography than Lasseter. His work is truly multifaceted and conceptual. Monsters, Inc. is no different. The film can be read in several ways-as metaphor for the fossil fuel crisis, a cautionary parable about capital's greed or abstract musing the relative power of emotion fear, angst vs. joy laughter. The story is endlessly inventive in its genre and blurs the boundary between fantasy, sci-fi. It's a buddy comedy, a heist plot, a fish out of water story and a coming of age tale wrapped together in some of the fastest 90 minutes in cinema. It is funny, charming, and delivers even a few scares.The animation-like always-is breathtaking. But of the early Pixar films this one has the strongest design. The denizens of the monster world straddle the line between scary, playful which is perfect for the plot. Randall is a great slimy villain and Mike is literally a goofball. The film somehow manages to feel very 1950's without being dated, creaky. There are so many visual jokes I pick up a new one now and then despite seeing the film dozens of times.But above all it is the two relationships the film is built around-Mike & Sully, Sully & Bo-are fully realized.

But, don't think that it actually WANTS to scare you.  It's not mean, it's just doing it's job.  See, that monster works for Monsters, Inc.  Monsters, Inc. supplies all the power to Monstropolis, and your screams provide that power. Sadly, you haven't been doing your job lately.  You're growing up too fast. You don't scare easily.  And, because of that, Monstropolis is in an energy crunch.  So, when that big scary monster shows up tonight, make sure that you scream really, really loud.  Just don't touch the monster.  Children are toxic.  You don't want to hurt the monster, do you?You might want to take a quick break and calm your children down now. Reality is tough.Much like the Toy Story franchise, Monsters, Inc. presents us with a look into a secret world.  A world of monsters.  Guess what?  Those monsters are just like us, but not in a Twilight Zone episode kind of way.  More like the going to work, having friends and families kind of way.  Unlike most of us, however, the monsters are computer generated.Synopsis time:  Monsters, Inc. is roughly a day in the life of James P. `Sully' Sullivan (Goodman), and his friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal). They're best friends, roommates, and partners at Monsters, Inc. (`We scare because we care.')  Sully does the actual scare-jobs, while Mike is, for lack of a better term, his crew chief.  Mike handles the logistics, the paperwork (poorly), and everything else not involving the actual scaring of the children.  Sully is the top scarer in the company, followed closely by Randall Boggs (Buscemi)  a sort-of cross between a gecko, a chameleon and a snake.  The head of Monsters, Inc. is Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn), a crab thing.  Waternoose is concerned both about the current energy crisis and about the quality of the new scarers.  They're just not all that scary, and tend to be just a little stupid and/or clumsy.  Waternoose wants Sully to help train the new recruits, Randall wants to be in first place, and Mike just wants to make Celia (Tilly), a mix between Medusa and a cyclops, his girlfriend.  Mike is in a hurry to get on his date with Celia and, once again, forgets to file his paperwork.  Sully decides to do it for him. Mike left the paperwork on his desk on the Scarefloor.Now, the mechanism by which the monsters emerge from a closet is this: a child's ID card is scanned into a computer.  An automated system then summons up the other' side of the closet door in that child's bedroom. The door is inserted into a slot on the Scarefloor, power is applied to the door, a storage battery is attached to a receptical next to the door, the monster goes into the door, scares the kid, and comes out.  No doors are supposed to be on the Scarefloor after the end of a shift.  But, guess what Sully finds?  He peeks into the bedroom, to make sure no monsters are present before he shuts the door down (so he doesn't trap the monster). But, a big problem arises  the little girl (Biggs) that has that closet comes out, and into Monstropolis.  This is not good.  This is one of the worst things that could happen.  And, she really likes Sully, whom she renames Kitty.  Her name is Boo, at least according to Sully.  Begin wackiness in T minus 3... 2... 1... make audience laugh now!Overall, Monsters, Inc. is very well done.  Then again, it was done by the same people behind the Toy Story franchise and A Bug's Life.  And, it's certainly in the same vein.  The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect, and the characters are entertaining.  Most importantly, it won't make grown-ups stupider or bored.  There are times when the movie is a bit dark in tone, but not too much, and certainly not too intense for kids.As far as the animation goes, well, it's PIXAR, for the love of pete!  It started off as a subsidiary of Industrial Light and Magic.  Of course it's going to be outstanding.  However, the competition is tougher in 2001 than it was in the late 90s.  Square Pictures Final Fantasy raised the bar considerably in terms of what can be done with computer animation.  Sully is a hairy monster.  Hair all over.  It's so close to being done right that you can just feel it, but it's not perfect.  It's not distracting, but it's not quite perfect.  Yet.  But, in terms of the light-sourcing and the physics' that the monsters obey, it's dead on.  Same with the facial expressions. Even though Boo looks like a plastic toy (this could be by design, of course, since it's intended to be cartoony, while Final Fantasy went for realism), the range of emotions she's capable of displaying is amazing. Then again, PIXAR was able to make a desk lamp convey emotion (in the groundbreaking Luxo, Jr.).  You're not going to go wrong with seeing Monsters, Inc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Another Good-Natured Pixar Romp.,"Pixar is among one of the best things to happen to the Disney Studios in years.  From ""A Bug's Life"" to both ""Toy Story"" movies (and even their shorts, if you've had the chance to see them), their outings have been a lot of fun.  ""Monsters Inc."" was no different.The movie felt a bit ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to me in that the ghoul's and monster's fright-making was simply just their ""job"" for them.  When not scaring and causing frights, they led ""regular"" everyday lives outside of the haunts.  Kind of a ""behind the scenes"" look at the monsters under the bed (or in the closet, in this case).  It's a fun concept, and John Goodman and Billy Crystal pulled off the characters of Sulley and Mike very well.While I still believe that the best CG animation I've seen this year was ""Final Fantasy"", the range of emotions for Mike, Sulley, Boo and the others display went much, much farther.  Boo was a cute character.  Funny, easily distracted, vulnerable... she represented the average child (about 2-3 I'm guessing) for her age.  And again, while ""Final Fantasy"" was just jaw-dropping in terms of animation, ""Monsters"" had its own wonderful set of effects, lighting tricks and surprises to be found.The humor in it was very funny.  Everything from physical gags to self-reference and in-jokes, the film has something to offer on every level (the Yeti being my personal favorite ""Don't worry, it's lemon!"")  It also had its fair share of action scenes that offered a fair share of ""wows"" and fast pacing.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack didn't really stick in my mind, as I can't remember, much less whistle any of it after the film being over. But that is a rather moot point in a movie that was supposed to be mainly slapstick with a message about how children see their fears, and laughing produces more results than scaring.  A nice little message for times like these.But the one moment that got me the most about the entire film took place in the last two minutes: Sweet natured and simple, but not sappy with a huge musical score swelling in the background to force the viewer's emotions. I honestly don't think they could have ended this film any more perfectly.An enjoyable film.  Too bad I didn't see any ""outtakes"" at the end like Pixar's other efforts.  Maybe there will be something for the DVD. A good watch for 2001.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A heartwarming tale with a monstrous twist,"""Monsters, Inc."" is a delightful Pixar film that combines humor, heart, and innovative animation. The story follows best friends Sulley and Mike, employees at Monsters, Inc., where their job is to scare children to harness their screams as a power source. The twist? Monsters are just as scared of children as children are of monsters.The animation is top-notch, bringing the vibrant world of Monstropolis to life with rich colors and imaginative character designs. The dynamic between Sulley, the gentle giant, and Mike, his one-eyed, wise-cracking partner, is both endearing and entertaining.The film's plot takes an unexpected turn when Boo, a little girl, accidentally enters the monster world, turning Sulley and Mike's lives upside down. Their efforts to return Boo to her world while uncovering a conspiracy within their own company add layers of excitement and emotion.""Monsters, Inc."" stands out for its clever humor, engaging story, and heartfelt message about friendship and overcoming fears.

clever yet boring,"There are great aspects to this movie: the animation is great, the concept is good and there are a lot of clever or funny details. However, this movie lacks interesting main characters and heart. The main characters (Mike & Sully) aren't as memorable, funny or touching as supposed to a Woody or Buzz Lightyear. I can't seem to care about them, really. There's a lack of clear identity and personality that other animated movies seem to have. I've watched this movie 3 times and I still don't like it.

OK for kids,"My opinion is Monsters, Inc. is a shuffle if not a step back for Pixar.What's good in the film:1. The idea of monsters living in a parallel world that exists by scaring kids.2. Character animation is impecable.What sucked in the film:1. The storyline. Unlike A Bug's Life and Toy Stories, Monsters, Inc. is just another typical primitive, boring, sentimental Disney film.2. Character and sets design. Nothing original here. Pixar is repeating itself. The baby girl Boo is cute though.3. Dialogs are supposed to be funny but they are not. Not a single laugh in the audience. No applause in the end either. That's on the first day of screening.Bottom line - kids would like it anyway but Pixar can do better than that.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good, but not great.","That about summed it up for me. The movie's plot moves away from the childish simplicity of the Toy Story movies, and as such there isn't as much room for heart and charm. The plot is more complicated than either Toy Story, so there's not as much room for freedom in having the characters mess around from point A to point B; everything feels a bit rushed.The CG was, as expected, stunning (especially the ""door room"" towards the end... You'll see what I mean.) I got a weird feeling watching this movie, like Pixar was trying to force John Goodman and Billy Crystal to have the same sort of Woody/Buzz chemistry that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks have, but it just falls short somehow.Highlights of the film include the Star Wars: Episode II trailer shown beforehand (which was also good, but not great), the short film ""for the birds"" which also ran before the movie, and some of the more incredible visual effects...

Helps teach kids not to be afraid, without being too over the top. Not scary at all. Pixar may not be able to top Toy Story, but this movie is another excellent example of what they do best; sweet, relate able, family films that transcend age groups and reach out to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Strangely unsatisfying.,"Monsters Inc is unfunny and lacks cast support.  It has a few cute moments and one horrible scene involving a ""scream extractor"" which should have earned a PG rating.  Not sure why Billy Crystal is even in it, as there are no opportunities for humor.  Sulley is sympathetic, but there just isn't enough substance or plot detail in this film to make it captivating.  The ending is nice but this one just kinda left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling.. Like wanting pizza but forcing yourself to go to the salad bar, maybe?  None of the charm and intricacy of Toy Story, and it seemed too long.  ""For the Birds"" is the prelude short, and way funnier than anything in ""Monsters Inc.""  I will probably rent it and catch the outtakes, but I have no particular desire to see this film again.  'A Bug's Life' had many of the same pitfalls, but it's a better movie than 'Monsters Inc.'

Pixar Fails Its Own Legacy,"Disney and Pixar are at it again.  Inspired by their own sales figures of Toy Story action figures and lunchboxes, the two companies have collaborated once more for Monsters Inc., a film that would be flat-out charming if it wasn't so disappointing and lacking in the qualities that made Toy Story a good film AND marketing device.The best thing about Toy Story was that the story didn't just focus on Woody and Buzz.  There were all those supporting characters, and every one, from Rex and Hamm to the aliens in the vending machine, had just as much personality and were just as funny as the main characters.  In Monsters Inc., with the exception of all-too-short scenes involving the Abominable Snowman and Mike's girlfriend Cecilia, there are no supporting monster characters at all; we're stuck with Mike and Sully the whole time.  No offense intended to Billy Crystal or John Goodman, as both are perfect matches for their characters, and put in a valiant effort, but neither of the leading monsters has any good lines (even Mike's ""Sure, blame the little guy with his ONE EYE!"" line from the trailer has been cut).  There really doesn't seem to be much humor at all, not even any toilet humor for the immature kiddies.The other major problem with this film is that it reeks of unoriginality. The concept is brilliant, and the explanation of Monsters Inc.'s premise and why monsters scare is innovative and suggests what could have been; unfortunately, like many recent Disney films, the film is totally formulaic and predictable, all the way up to the obligatory ""heroes in peril chase scene"" that is thrilling, but will also no doubt inspire Disneyland's next attraction.  There wasn't even a trademark Pixar ""bloopers reel"" during the credits (although I will admit the film's opening credits were very classy, and reminiscent of the Pink Panther).So what are Monsters Inc.'s saving graces? Well, it has the Pixar name, and a bad Pixar film is still better than the average bad family film (and really, since Pixar currently has no competition in the computer animated feature film market except Shrek, they can set their own standards for quality).  If nothing else, it's amazing to see the hypnotic realism of each individual strand of Sully's fur blowing in the wind.  There are also some slick inside references to Ray Harryhausen, California's recent power crisis and Toy Story, and a great bonus short included before the film that I actually enjoyed more than the feature film (just like in Bug's Life... am I noticing a trend here?).  On the whole, however, I guess I just expected too much from Pixar and took for granted the unique creative and critical success they had with the Toy Story films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Disney and Pixar hits a home run again,"Another great movie from the Disney/Pixar team.  It has the unique story which is great for both children and adults.  All the little touches throughout the film depicting the Monstropolis world are inventive and fun. It did not go for parody overload like Shrek did, but instead went with understated quality.  These things were not flooding the screen, but were placed here and there so that it would reward one who catches them.For the story to be an offshoot of children's imagination and expand to a whole world based on that is very imaginative.  The rest of the film has it all, being clever, witty, heartfelt, edge of your seat action and suspense.Another inventiveness is the the musical during the ending credits, which is the off-shoot of what Wazowski and Sully made up during their cover-up, as opposed to Shrek's kareoke after the movie, which has nothing to do with the film.The other great part of Disney is that the personalities of each character takes on the being they are portraying.  Although this film cannot follow that format since almost all the characters were monsters and we could only assume how they act in real life (as opposed to a caterpillar or a fish.) But it also allows the animator to be limitless in their interpretation of the monsters physical attributes and the way they act, although in some parts, Billy Crystal has to be Billy Crystal.  On top of that, Boo character just stole our heart.In all, a great movie for every member of the family to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I also liked Randall Boggs and I think he's my favorite Pixar Villain along with Hopper and Syndrome. I loved how he could make himself invisible and I liked how he got banished to that trailer and got beaten up mistaken for a gator! That was hilarious!

Now put that thing back where it came from or so help me...,"Running out of power forces out of the box thinking.This is set in a universe where everyone is a monster, and the top job is being especially good at scaring human kids, since their screams of terror are a potent energy source, and they have technology that allows teleporting into the closet of any bedroom. There's also the really funny notion that they are just as scared of us as we are of them, allowing for some excellent commentary on fear of the unknown. And they love being as disgusting as at all possible. Where we have deodorant that makes you not stink, they have the exact opposite. This is of course an opportunity for significant creativity and they really hit it out the park. The climax in particular - wow!Any kind of creepy scary creature appears somewhere in this *and* they have some quality jokes with them. One of them has multiple heads, and each of them has a hard hat. Medusa considers getting a haircut, much to the dismay of the snakes. As usual for Pixar, there are jokes for grown-ups in addition to the one for the kids, there's a great takeaway message and the talented cast all deliver. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn are amazing. One of the main characters has fur and the animation is incredible.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Monster laughs and nothing but praise for this Disney-Pixar effort.,"Without giving the name of the author, Canadian social commentator Mark Steyn cited a piece of writing during a 2012 interview with an American cable-TV company which was about how children perceive the world around them through the fiction they're exposed to early on in life. Principally, he cites an analysis made by a fellow-Canadian on how creatures, or 'monsters', on television, or in cutesy books, were damaging to kids - it imparted the idea that monsters were just cute, cuddly friends that needed taming or befriending. Steyn seemed to prefer 'classic' children's literature in this respect, because there you garner a '...far greater sense of the realities of life from the Brothers Grimm than you will from the Cookie Monster.'I wonder what either of them thought of ""Monsters Inc."", where the one infant character in the film is completely unafraid of precisely the sorts of post-Sesame Street monsters the article cited, yet is a character in a piece imparting the idea that cute and cuddly is good. To some extent, Disney's 2002 animation plays like a kind of animated therapy for young children, who will of course love the colour; vibrancy and sense of adventure infused throughout ""Monster's Inc."", but will also have one of their fears exorcised - that of the dark bedroom at night-time and the idea a creature might lurk beyond a visible realm.At the core of the film is a quite brilliant idea: in an alternate world running parallel to our own, there exist actual creatures, hideous in physicality, desperately in need of the terrified screams of young children so as to run their civilisation. In order to do so, they appear in bedroom closets around the world late at night (the only gateway from our own universe to theirs); do what they have to do to induce sheer panic and return home again having captured the noise in a canister. One of the film's best jokes, in fact, doubles up as a devilish social commentary on how much harder it is these days to truly frighten children, given what they are often exposed to on TV and in video games.The scream-drive is propelled by two monsters called Sully and Randall, whose physical characteristics are cleverly echoed by their voice-talents: Sully, like John Goodman, is big and huggable and has a dopey voice, whilst Steve Buscemi's lizard-like creation is more slender and bug-eyed. Sully is the consummate professional who goes through the same process every morning: exercising and scare routines with his flat-mate and floor-work partner Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). He blindly trusts the corporation, epitomised quite cleverly in the arachnid-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who sports a waist-coat but is tragically missing a monocle. Children are Sully's worst enemy, believing them to be potentially toxic. Regardless, he puts his life on the line every day for his society - the moral justification for all this lies in the company's motto: 'We scare, because we care'.As each of the monsters in the company lumbered with this responsibility walk to their posts in slow motion, the film invokes Michael Bay's 1998 film ""Armageddon"", which infers a sense of doom or catastrophe if these brave souls were to fail in their duty: these people are the guardians of civilisation. Civilisation does not quite crumble, but disaster strikes when a young American child manages to make its way out of our world and into the monsters' own - enough to have Sully and Mike worried their days are numbered as previous misnomers have led to other monsters banished to our world, cleverly accounting for Bigfoot and the Yeti. In a panic, the twosome concoct a plan to return it to where it belongs, but that becomes problematic when Sully becomes attached to it.""Monsters Inc."" cracks along at a fantastic pace and works so wonderfully well because of a number of things. Principally, the stakes are incredibly high, so there is always this rapid, even nervous, energy pulsating through the film once the 20 minute mark elapses, and the film does such a wonderful job in bringing the two personalities in the form of its heroes to life in such a short space of time that we are hooked on their adventure the whole way. Furthermore, the characterisation is superb - these are rounded characters with lives; dreams; goals and even girlfriends - they possess different attitudes; physical appearances and characteristics. The world it creates, that of one parallel to our own, is extraordinary from a design perspective - the way they echo one another in the form of a daily commute; workplace rivalry; a relaxing meal after work and generally the things you see out and about is marvellous.What directors Pete Docter; David Silverman and Lee Unkrich later pull off is the incredibly tricky transition the film needs to make from being a double-act comedy about getting rid of something which doesn't want to leave, to being a film about foiling a corporate conspiracy. One cannot laud the team enough. Laudable too is the character study - this is Sully's film; a character who blindly trusts the machine at the beginning of the film but undergoes his own journey to find out that kids are not toxic; corruption might come from anywhere and even tackles the moral dilemma of how to power his world. Irrespective of age, and with whomever you see it, ""Monster's Inc."" is a genuinely infectious and wholesome piece of animated entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of the very best films of the year.,"Released almost back-to-back with ICE AGE, both films had basically carbon copied plots of each other. I doubt they did it on purpose, but they are almost the exact same thing. The two short films included on the VHS and DVD, MIKE'S NEW CAR and FOR THE BIRDS were not very good, but MONSTERS, INC. was truly a masterpiece.While I wouldn't go as far as to call it one of the top 250 movies, it was still very good. There was a lot of adult humor in the film, which made it easier for me to watch the movie, but this is still aimed more for kids. I usually enjoy Pixar movies because they usually try to include a little bit of everything in their movies (and thankfully they leave out the stupid, annoying songs included in so many kids' movies). TOY STORY was their first movie, and then they dished out A BUG'S LIFE, TOY STORY 2, and most recently FINDING NEMO. Their main big plot of almost all of these films though, is getting old. It is amazing that kids haven't noticed that all of their favorite Pixar films have the *exact* same plot in all of them. Dreamworks's SHREK was a change of pace only because it was a parody, but almost all of Pixar's flicks are about some friends trying to get somewhere to rescue somebody or something almost exactly like that. Either way, MONSTERS, INC. was still a very good movie as it did complete the one major feat that a lot of films are not able to do nowadays: Entertain people.MONSTERS, INC. gets 5/5.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Not much new to chew on here.,"I have been heard to mention my anticipation of this title in recent weeks. Now that I have finally got my peepers on it, I have to say that it wasn't really my cup of tea. I have a three-year-old son who is difficult to please as far as his entertainment is concerned and, suffice to say, he lost interest in this within half an hour. He adores Toy Story 2 and Tarzan, and can watch them (and has) repeatedly. The fear that a large proportion of ticket-buyers have come to view the now obligatory Attack Of The Clones' trailer is well founded it seemed, with large numbers of the audience leaving before the commencement of the movie. This may account for it's auspicious first weekend record-breaking figures. Anyhow, Star Wars aside. Monsters Inc is very pretty, very cute, very Disney, very Pixar. I first heard about it after buying the Tigger Movie DVD for my son. It seemed quite brilliant at the time, what little I gleaned from the all too brief trailer. I won't ruin the plot for you, but it is basically Toy Story with different characters. Instead of toys that secretly lead a life away from their owners, we now have monsters that are thought of as figments of the child's imaginings. They survive off the screams of children and around the clock they sneak through children's closet, and scare the bejeezus out of them. (Some have more success than others) Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent as the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are second rate and fail to inspire any feeling about them. There is a scene reminiscent of Toy Story 2 (Sorry to harp back to this again, it is difficult not to when both films or so similar) when Woody and the gang are trying to save Jessie at the Airport, jumping from suitcase to suitcase. This time we have a countless collection of doors which are used to enter the bedroom of the children the monsters scare, thousands of them hanging from conveyors. This makes for an entertaining chase, but it's been done before, as has most of the movie really. Perhaps some insight from Nick Park or the rest of Aardman Animation would be of some benefit, as their films are quite astonishing in their originality and timing. A picture that is immense fun, but as a wisened old Disney buff, I feel it is more of the same immense fun that we have seen many times before.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Timeless and Endlessly Rewatchable,"What's not to love about Monsters, Inc.? The animation is excellent (just look at Sulley's fur), the voice acting is immaculate (Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, etc.) and the concept itself is brilliant.Many modern animated films (i.e., TMNT Mutant Mayhem) are packed full with 2023 slang and references which will date the movie. Monsters, Inc. Does not have this problem. The story is timeless and endlessly rewatchable.The evolution that the characters go through is masterclass. Their changes ultimately culminate in one of the most tear-jerking final moments in film history (honestly, think about it). I adore Monsters, Inc. And it is in strong contention for my favorite animated film of all time.Best Character: Sulley (and Boo)

Definitely one of Pixar's greatest movies,"I loved this movie throughout my childhood and thought it was a bit underrated because it's not aired often on TV here in Italy (and in fact I own it in my collection). Last July I finally re-watched for having some nice nostaglia trip, and it did it well. Since everything that has to be said about this movie has been said, I won't be that long.The film is set in Mostropolis, a city where monsters have their energy for the houses thanks to the children's screams. Our story is mostly about Mike Wazowsky (voice by Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (voice by John Goodman) that work like many other monsters at the MONSTERS INC where through the doors go to scare kids and they always beat Randall Boggs (voice by Steve Buscemi) who always wants to be the best. One night however, a door was left open and the child who lives there ends up with Sullivan (who names her Boo) and he takes her to the sushi restaurant where Mike is having a dinner, and after the kid goes free, chaos ensues and the restaurant is put in quarantine. Now Mike and Sullivan have no other choice than to hide Boo in a costume that makes her look like a monster, and will also stop Randall's evil plan he hatched along with Waternoose (voice by James Coburn). After all this, the monsters will make the kids laugh for having the energy necessary.The CGI is great, no more words needed. The voice was great especially by Goodman and Buscemi, and I really loved their characters. And the story, while typical for such a movie, gives a great message: to not hate who is different. And there are many funny moments as well.Not to be missed if you still haven't seen it, and among the best family movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely average,"The story: In Monsterworld, energy is produced by collecting kids' screams, which are then converted into electricity. ""Monsters, Inc."" is the leading energy producer, and it operates by sending monsters into kids' closets and under their beds, and scaring them. Each kid has its own biggest fear, and the company specializes in delivering just the right monster to the right kid. There are, however, two problems. First, kids are getting harder to scare, watching all those movies and playing all those videogames - which causes an energy crisis. And second, human kids are considered to be toxic to monsters - the most memorable scene occurs when a monster returns from his job with a sock stuck to his fur.... So it is easy to imagine what mayhem may ensue if a kid manages to get into Monstropolis...The story follows two nice monsters, Sullivan, the most successful scarer, and his side-kick Mike, as they try to get rid off, hide, play with and protect (in that order) a little girl that finds her way into their world. It also features an evil chamaeleon monster and a cast of many very inspired background monsters, including a love interest for Mike. Watch out for her hair: It is one of the better ideas in the movie.However, as nice as it sounds, this movie is strictly for kids only. Adults might chuckle every now and then, but in the end I walked out thinking of all the wasted talent. Why cast comedians like Billy Crystal and John Goodman as voice talents when the best comedy is restricted to a very small number of slapstick scenes? Also, the movie is very very obvious about its story and the surprise (or not so surprise) ending. It is made with kids in mind, so every lesson is repeated about five times. And, of course, it is about friendship, the power of being nice and all the other typical Disneyfied lessons in life. You might also notice this Pixar trend of only producing movies that are very very merchandiseable. Toy Story? Think plastic toys. Monster Inc? Think big Sulley-shaped fluffy animals...There is one point where this movie is hard to beat, though: The animation. The fur of Sulley is incredible, and when he is hit by a snowball, it is most impressive how real it looks.All in all it is very average. Not very funny, a bit repetitive, but entirely feel-good. Personally, I preferred the short movie that preceded it. It was short, funny, cute, to the point and it had all the qualities Monsters Inc lacked. Make sure you aren't late for this movie. You might miss the best part.... Also stay for the credits. Some of the fake outtakes are funny, especially the guest appearances of other Pixar characters...5/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Excellent Entertainment,"Monsters, Inc. is another example of very cleverly-written and multi-levelled animation that appeals to young and old alike. The basic plot is instantly ingenious enough to appeal to even the most simple-minded of viewers, and it is a delightful satire on humankind's timeless fear of monsters. My favourite in terms of satirical tools is the two pimple-covered adolescent monsters who are so 'in awe' of Sullivan and the other 'scarers', which just puts that brilliant twist to the whole idea. The voices are excellent: Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi are all perfectly cast in their roles and they combine well with the very brilliant animation and clever scripting to produce a very likeable and entertaining film. This is not just one of those animated movies that attempt to lure adults through the use of well-beloved actors (Meg Ryan as Anastasia, one example). It really is enjoyable for the whole families. However, the basic warning that some scenes may frighten younger children I believe is well-justified and it is really the only criticism you could possibly have of this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Jon Monsarrat review:   good but not ""Toy Story""","""Monsters, Inc."" is a solid animated comedy that will be great for kids, and acceptable for adults. Mostly, I think that Billy Crystal needs to find a more funny and less annoying schtick. Ever since Abbott and Costello there have been teams with a big straight-man problem fixer and a short, annoying but lovable troublemaker who talks too much. It doesn't work nearly as well here as in ""Ice Age"", although it comes nowhere as low as Jar Jar Binks territory (""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"").Despite all that, and the sort of generic plotting you expect in kids films nowadays (if you're over 30, aren't Disney flicks all starting to look alike to you?), I enjoyed it and can recommend it also to adults.Who should see this film:-- Kids (and their parents will have fun, too)-- Comedy lovers who've already seen ""Toy Story"" or ""Antz"",and don't mind seeing a kids film from time to time.I'll give ""Monsters, Inc."" a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Fun for all ages,"This is another enjoyable animated feature from the Pixar studios and one of the reasons they can entertain a more older audience is the subtle references that they make from other sources. The story is about a world called Monstropolis where monsters live and their world is powered by the heat of childrens screams. Monsters go through doors that lead into the closets of children in the real world and its the monsters job to frighten children so that their scream can be harnessed and used for power. The top scream collector is Sulley (John Goodman) who is a big hairy monster and he works in the factory that builds the doors and where collectors are to pass through. Sulleys best friend is a big walking eyeball named Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and they discover that a human child named Mary and nicknamed Boo (Mary Gibbs) has passed through into Monstropolis and together they try and get her back but the alert has gone out and the monsters of Monstropolis think that humans are toxic and can kill you. Its always fun to watch these films and its because the computer animation that Pixar does is so detailed and intricate. Each hair on Sulley seems to have a life of its own. The stories are engaging as well as they seem to be about simple things that we can all relate to. Monsters waiting in the closet, we have all grown up thinking about these things and its fun to watch these old phobias come to life. One of the subtle references I was talking about is where Mike is eating in a restaurant called ""Harryhausens"". This is of course in reference to the great Ray Harryhausen who is a pioneer in special effects for films. This film also has the Oscar winning song ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman and he has become a Pixar staple with his music.

From the opening title scene (which is one of my favorites in all of film) you get a feel for the wackiness you'll experience in this movie.

My entire childhood,"Monsters Inc. was basically my entire childhood. It was made a few months after I was born, so I kind of grew up watching it. It's cute and sweet and I've watched it more times than I can count! Excluding spoilers, it's about a change of heart between two unlikely friends. A monster and a toddler. The monster, Sully, has the job of scaring children. However, Sully develops an attachment to Boo. Boo is the toddler that changes the way he sees human children. The movie is definitely family-friendly. Some people also believe that this movie contributes to the wild ""Pixar Theory"". Overall, it's a cute movie to watch even as an adult.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Pixar Masterpiece that Transcends Generations,"We all used to be afraid of the monsters under the bed, the shadows in the closet, and the strange noises outside. I remember thinking that there were all sorts of monsters in my room, not so much under the bed, but more in the closet. Pixar, once again, plays with the memories of adults and the dreams of children, making it equally enjoyable for both.John Goodman gives voice to James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to his friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal plays Mike Wazowski, his witty, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by children's screams. This is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. Monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms through closet doors and scare the children, capturing their screams in little yellow bottles. Sulley is the top scarer, capturing the most screams. But Randall, a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley and will do anything to get more scares, even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose and others find out about the incident.""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum.But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is a confirmation of Dreamworlds superiority,"As having done some aninimaton for myself there are some things that struck me as awfully wrong with this film. For example: feet move when they should be fixed, lipsync is like watching Schwarzenegger sync'ed in Italian (quite funny), textures with not enough resolution, sloppy, staggering animation.... etc.etc. Apart from this with wich I could live with, the story is as thin as any of Disney's films. Its a shame they did not use the full potential of the elements of this story that where original, but focused instead on yet another standard plot.

Lively and fun,"'Monsters Inc.' is a Disney (or at least, a Pixar) film. Which means one has a corporate satire made by one of the world's most powerful corporations; and a tale where two friends (one talkative, one cute) argue but always get together in the end to ensure that everyone lives happily ever after. If the template is familiar, the film also marked a move away from the realistic animation of 'Toy Story' (the first wave of computer animation) back towards something more obviously cartoony. It also lacks 'Toy Story's bleak undercurrents, but it's generally fun and inventive, even if you can spot the end coming a long way off.

"Parts of a Lazily Adapted, High-Concept ""What if...?"" Idea for 90 Minutes","I was the target audience when this came out and saw it in theaters. I recall just kind of tolerating it, whereas I watched Toy Story countless times, but never returned to this one. I checked it out recently and now I know why. Don't think because it's retro that it's good. Early '00s Disney was rough, and even Pixar wasn't safe.Sorry, but even at the time I didn't care for Nemo either. What Pixar is doing today is just a continuation of the low quality storytelling that has plagued them since this movie, which is their fourth overall and third original.This movie feels like the notes for the ideas were used as the shooting script. It starts off explaining the premise in a training scenario, and what follows feels too audience-aware. You see the main duo in their morning routine and walking to work, which establishes the monster world -- again the movie explaining itself uncreatively.All the slapstick throughout is like Looney Tunes, and not up to Pixar or Disney's standard. The movie relies on it as the main source of comedy. That and the characters making stupid decisions. The characters here are just not earned. The audience is not given the chance to make heads or tails of them, you're just kind of thrown into this premise that doesn't go any farther than ""John Goodman and Billy Crystal as monsters running around being silly.""You see how the corporation responds to a single article of clothing as a contaminant, so what are they going to do to a human? The implications are disturbing at worst and not well thought out at best. A lot of movies don't have conventional plots, which can be appealing sometimes, but this one REALLY has no plot.You get explanatory exposition and then the rest is just characters running around and some emotionally-manipulative nonsense thrown in towards the end when it's time for the little girl to go home. It's all so tiresome and paint-by-the-numbers, and the way the outcome influences the company's change in operation is just stupid. Any child would still be scared to death by a monster entering their room, even if they were there to fall down. (I'm telling you -- they really go all in on slapstick.)This probably would have been more effective and interesting if it had been done with a more supernatural sensibility. It just doesn't make sense and you don't even get to see much of the monster's world/a variety of locations. They created a world so we could see three locations that resemble real life (a factory, an apartment and a restaurant.)It all feels so small and rushed.

"Very good, careful with little ones","Monsters, Inc. was a very good movie, though not as good as either of the previous 2 Pixar ""Toy Story"" movies.  I also felt the target age of this movie was higher than of any of the previous movies. There are explanations in this film, central to the plot, about things like an energy crisis and how the company, Monsters, Inc., provides the energy, by causing screams and bottling them (?).  There is adult dating, and funny references to things you'd hear around the office (ie. not around the elementary school). There is a complicated system by which the Monsters actually GET to the rooms to scare kids.  Easy concepts for adults, tough for little ones.One other thing that tripped me out a little was that there were also many references and demonstrations of how monsters pop out of closets or out from under beds and scare the bejeezus out of poor little kids. This can be a little traumatic for little ones.  Along these same lines are a few scenes involving a walk down into a dark, very scary looking dungeon-like corridor, and a few of a type of torture machine that slowly wheels up to a captive victim, who is held immobile in a special chair.  Relatively short scenes, but they scared both my 6- and 3-year-olds.  I was not expecting this and it kind of irritated me.On the whole, it was an enjoyable movie.  To be honest, the most enjoyable part for me was the short animated film that preceded the main attraction, a VERY cute and funny short called ""For the Birds.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What's behind the door?,"It's such an odd premise for a movie, but yet it works so well. What if the monsters hiding in your closet are real and what if they have a society of their own, behind that door. What would that society look like and what part the scaring of little children would play in it.You can definitely build a movie around that and Pixar does so beautifully. In the process we get introduced to James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, the top scaring duo Monsters, Inc. has ever seen. Things go well, until a little girl child, adorably and promptly named Boo, slips through the door. Hijinks do indeed ensue.The movie has a strong idea and some topnotch characters going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Sully and Boo. The rest of the cast are voiced by some really talented people and all of the main cast have really great designs as well. I especially enjoyed Henry J. Waternoose III, the CEO. The side and background characters looked a bit more generic and blobbish in contrast, which is a shame, but then again they're not the focus.The only real flaw the film has is the story. It's not bad by any means, but it is not as strong as the other elements. Status quo is king, something upsets the status quo, hijinks, solution. No real surprises, no great stakes. I would have liked to explore the world a bit more or move beyond the obvious bad guy good guy setups.Still, a great animation film for all ages. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Entertaining and endearing,"Not Pixar's strongest work - for me that's Wall-E - but still a great proof that the studio has the ability to turn the simplest of ideas upside down and give us something that we haven't seen before. Like in this case where the simple idea of monsters hiding in the closets of little children is given a completely new spin by making those monsters part of industry. They're just punch clock workers trying to earn a living. Ingenious idea, really.And the execution supports and strengthens that idea beautifully. The whole world full of these hideously weird creatures is laid bare in front of us, but we quickly find out that they're just like us with their mundane lives, romantic relationships and bad fur days. And therein lies the strength of this movie and Pixar movies in general. The characters are immensely identifiable and sympathetic. The moment that you see any of these characters, the moment that they open their mouth and start talking, you get them. You start living their lives from their perspective. (Though I have to say that I saw the Finnish dub of this movie, in which the voice acting, while decent, wasn't anything special, so I think that the movie had already lost part of its charm at that point, because the English version is full of talented actors, so it's probably the better version of this film.)For me the best part of this film was the relationship between Sulley (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs). That little ninja girl is unbelievably adorable to begin with and then you add a ten feet tall blue hair monster cooing at her... It just melted my heart every time I saw it and made the ending even more precious to witness.If there's anything wrong with this film, it's that the story isn't that strong. It's your basic someone screws up and the status quo has to be restored without that someone getting into trouble, but of course something goes wrong and hilarity ensues. Nothing special there, but it was enjoyable to watch, so I wouldn't really call it a flaw as Pixar has the talent to work with simple stories. For them it's more about the characters and the details, not the story.So yeah, it's a good movie. Highly recommended for children and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Perhaps Pixar's best film; technically excellent animation, great color and music, and fun story!","""Monsters, Inc."" was a thoroughly entertaining, fun, and exciting film!  I loved Pixar's animation, of course, and the story was funny and interesting. There is a scene in the first two or three minutes of a monster's scaring a sleeping child (actually, a simulation at the Monster utility company), and a second scaring simulation 2/3 or so through the movie which some children as old as 6 or 7 may be disturbed by, but otherwise the film is great for all ages!The ingenious plot takes place at a utility company in Monstropolis, a world of monsters.  In 8-hour shifts, the citizen monsters go through bedroom doors of sleeping children; the screams that the monsters evoke are the energy currency of Monstropolis.  But even as they scare the children, the monsters themselves are afraid of humans.  What happens when a child accidentally enters an ajar door and comes into the world of the monsters?I found that I enjoyed this film even more than Pixar's earlier ""Toy Story"" or ""Toy Story 2"" (both also excellent films!).  ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of those few films that I left the theatre feeling that I would like to see the film again soon while it is still playing on the big screen.  I found the plot and animated characters (especially the main character monsters, Sulley and his sidekick Mike, and the so cute 4-year-old Boo - perhaps misnamed as she was, in fact, rather brave) to be captivating, the colors and music contributing to a fun ""retro modern"" style.  The humor could be appreciated by all ages, and I enjoyed catching a brief reference to ""Toy Story"", when Boo picks up a toy featured in that movie.  I loved the chase scene through the seemingly endless doors, and the scene with the Abominable Snowman, who was trying to be helpful (sno-cones, anybody?!).This film is certainly worth seeing again on the large screen and then owning when it is out on video.  The animation is rich; careful repeat watchings will no doubt reveal additional interesting detail, such as reading of all of the headlines in the scene where Boo is discovered in Monstropolis.Don't miss seeing ""Monsters, Inc."" while it's playing in theatres, so you can enjoy the rich colors and animation.

Monstrously Fun and Heartfelt,"There's a reason this one still holds up after all these years. From the moment it starts, it pulls you into a world that feels both imaginative and completely lived-in-a factory run by monsters who power their city with children's screams? Genius. But what really makes it work isn't just the clever concept; it's the heart, the humor, and the bond between its two leads that make it more than just another animated film.At its core, it's a buddy comedy, and the dynamic between Sulley and Mike is what carries the whole thing. Their friendship feels natural, their banter is sharp, and the dialogue is genuinely funny without trying too hard. Billy Crystal and John Goodman bring them to life perfectly, making every exchange between the two feel effortless. And then, of course, there's Boo-who manages to be adorable without being annoying, which is no small feat when it comes to kid characters. Her relationship with Sulley adds an emotional depth that sneaks up on you.The story moves at a great pace, balancing comedy, adventure, and just enough tension to keep things engaging. The humor works on multiple levels, with jokes that still land even after multiple rewatches. It's also packed with small details and clever world-building that make Monstropolis feel like a real place rather than just a gimmicky backdrop.If there's one aspect that has aged a little, it's the animation. At the time, it was groundbreaking-Sulley's fur alone was a technical marvel. But compared to modern Pixar films, some textures and movement look a little dated. That said, it never takes away from the experience.Even after all these years, it remains a near-perfect mix of comedy, adventure, and heart. It's rare for an animated film to feel this fresh and emotionally resonant decades later, but somehow, it pulls it off. It's funny, it's touching, and it's one of Pixar's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you.,"I haven't seen 'Monsters, Inc. (2001)' in years, yet every scene, every character, every piece of music, every moment is familiar to me. I seem to know the movie inside and out, with only a handful of jokes feeling new to me (likely because they went over my head before), but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate its each and every moment. It's one of those iconic pieces of cinema that's successfully made the transition from childhood comfort (I still have the dvd which I tore the front of through overuse when I wasn't much older than Boo herself) to genuinely great adult viewing. The movie is incredibly nostalgic for me, but it isn't good because of that (as so many childhood 'classics' reveal themselves to be).It did occur to me this time, though, that Mike's kind of creepy looking if you think about it, and that both Randall and Waternoose are quite scary when they start slinking or scuttling around. Despite the fact that the film is set in the corporate world and tackles themes of corruption, its villains are - rather surprisingly, I'll add - no less vicious and willing to literally kill than the meanest of movie antagonists.The well-paced picture perfectly balances its world building with its character work, its humour with its heart. It takes an outlandish concept and crafts something distinctly human from it. It's very well-written, feeling like a real movie with real characters and real arcs and real themes that doesn't talk down to its audience (sadly, a lot of family-friendly animation is designed to distract rather than enrich). It's funny, emotionally affecting, inventive, intellectually stimulating, and also really exciting (there are some great set-pieces in here, including a door-to-door chase that takes the baggage conveyer sequence from 'Toy Story 2 (1999)' to a whole new level).The feature looks and sounds phenomenal, with excellent animation that's constantly lively and makes excellent use of the creative character designs it has to play with. It also gets a lot of mileage out of non-human faces, often choosing to convey thought and emotion through expression rather than dialogue. The casting is perfect, with John Goodman and Billy Crystal bouncing off each other fantastically and Steve Buscemi wholly embodying his character's slimy sociopathy. James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly also turn in great performances which enrich the texture of the film greatly.This is just a phenomenal movie. It's a warm, fuzzy hug that's as amusing as it is touching. It's a supremely entertaining experience, and a lovely film all round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Shrek also creatively used conventional cinematographic techniques, Monsters Inc just showed you what was happening. The richness of expressions was also limited by the lack of development. Shrek made you feel Cameron Diaz beneath the digital expressions of princess Fiona. Sully only gave you cliches expressions-growl, surprise, sadness, resolution, endearment. You see what I mean?

Monsters Inc.,"This is a movie that just works, it does most everything right and nails its goals. The story is touching and heartwarming. The characters are fun though personally not as memorable as other Pixar creations. I can't say I came away really having fallen in love with the movie as some other Pixar movies do.Compared to other Pixar movies this didn't try to pull on my heart strings as much either. The messaging of family/human connection is more important than performance at work/work life is effective and it achieves it's messaging really well. Maybe it just didn't hit me as hard, but I think that this movie could be (even) more effective if you have/had children. For example Toy Story pulls on nostalgia, youth, passing of time and growing up, grief. Which just applies to a wider gamut of people including me.It's crazy to think this was made in 2001. The animation and mostly the image quality varies a bit, but most of the time it's once again a feast for the eyes. The voice acting is on point.

Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group...,"1st watched 12/29/2012 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Pete Docter & David Silverman): Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group with a simple story, but technically well executed. The story is about an alternate world where monsters gain energy for their existence by getting screams from children by scaring them after entering their world from their closet doors. The company, ""Monsters, Inc"", captures this energy and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, is the highest energy producer for them. His friend Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, is his assistant. The evil character is the runner-up color-shifting monster that is behind Sully in energy points, but is found out to be cheating by capturing kids and extracting the screams out of them with a machine. One kid, named Boo by Sully, escapes and Sully and Mike have to figure out how to get her back to her real world and expose the evil monster's doings to the company. They do a lot of retread simple ""TV show""-type of humor around this story which makes the movie not as good as it could have been, but the animation is superb and unique enough to keep you interested until the end. The 3D is good and not over-bearing showing the perspective and size of some of the animated sets where the characters work in. This is not the best of the Disney animated films because of the simplistic story, but there is the usual expert craftsmanship that has definitely gone into this like so many of the others.

Usually him and all the other monsters who work at monsters inc go through a door that leads them into a childs room once there they scare the kids and the children's screams are put into capsules and brought back and used as energy.

Be true to your self,"Who's the monster? Am I the monster? When these questions plague young minds, they usually seed doubt and sink hearts. Maybe, they can also grow courage and lift spirits.Another gem from Kore -eda, a story wrapped around these questions, inviting us to ask why/what is protagonist Minato hurting/hiding, as he struggles with growing up as an only child of a single mom, missing his dead father, school bullying. So many possibilities are revealed through a multi-perspectival narrative structure.The family is usually the safe haven in Kore-eda's work. Here, Kore-eda renders the usual safe spaces (family and school) as sites of fear and prejudice. Minato instead finds sanctuary in his friendship with fellow 'monster' Yori, in blowing his heart out on a trombone, and perhaps most of all in his (potentially) imaginary world (s).Beautiful worlds where Miyazaki-esque forests and lakes become the settings of playgrounds for the boys escaping from the heartaches of being ostracised. There, they find solace, and eventually salvation, 'reborn' with hopes for new beginnings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not Pixar's finest, but a good film nonetheless","Monsters Inc. carries on Pixar's tradition of fun, silly and extremely well-made productions. The animation and rendering is superb, and the voice-talent brings it all home wonderfully. Perhaps my only serious disappointment has to be the over-abundance of sentimentality, but this is what happens when you introduce little children into the plot.I did thoroughly enjoy it, but it failed to have the lasting impact on me that A Bug's Life and the Toy Stories had.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great movie by Pixar,"Monsters, Inc is a movie to see with your family or your siblings. It is about two monsters, Mike and Sulley, who work in a factory where their job is to scare children to have eletric energy. From here a fantastic adventure will start with a little girl, Boo, who will make Mike and Sulley understand that they don't have to act like they used to do in the past.

Laughs and Screams,"Monsters, Inc. Is a heartwarming and delightfully imaginative animated masterpiece from Pixar Animation Studios, released in 2001 and directed by Pete Docter. This charming tale brilliantly combines humour, creativity, and emotional resonance, making it a timeless classic for audiences of all ages.Set in the bustling city of Monstropolis, the story centres on James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman), a gentle giant and top scarer at Monsters, Inc., and his quick-witted partner, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). Their job is to collect the screams of human children to power their city. However, their lives are turned upside down when a curious and fearless little girl, affectionately called Boo, accidentally enters their world. As Sulley and Mike race to return Boo to her home, they uncover a dark conspiracy within their company.The chemistry between John Goodman and Billy Crystal is the beating heart of the film. Goodman brings warmth and sincerity to Sulley, while Crystal's impeccable comedic timing and wit make Mike an unforgettable character. Boo, voiced by Mary Gibbs, is irresistibly endearing, and her bond with Sulley adds an emotional core that elevates the story. Steve Buscemi's portrayal of Randall, the sneaky and sinister rival scarer, strikes the perfect balance of menace and comedy, driving the tension of the plot.The animation is stunning, showcasing Pixar's technical brilliance. Monstropolis is brought to life with vibrant colours and intricate details, creating a world that feels both fantastical and relatable. The film's iconic door chase sequence is a dazzling feat of imagination and visual storytelling, pushing the boundaries of what animation could achieve at the time.Randy Newman's lively and heartfelt score enhances the film's charm, with the Oscar-winning song ""If I Didn't Have You"" perfectly encapsulating the themes of friendship and loyalty that run throughout the narrative.Beyond its humour and adventure, Monsters, Inc. Delivers a powerful message about the importance of friendship, courage, and the transformative power of laughter. Its clever premise, rich world-building, and emotional depth make it a standout entry in Pixar's storied filmography.In conclusion, Monsters, Inc. Is a beautifully crafted film that combines humour, heart, and innovation into a magical cinematic experience. With its unforgettable characters, inventive storytelling, and touching themes, it remains a shining example of animated storytelling at its best. A true family favourite that continues to captivate and inspire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A fantastic, scary effort from Pixar.","One of my favourite films as a kid, I must have watched this twenty or thirty times by now. It still holds up, though I wasn't nearly as emotionally effected by the ending as when I was a kid. Still, a very creative concept. So creative that they have to explain it twice at the start of the film.The movie looks great, the voice actors do a phenomenal job, and the antagonist is Pixar's first great one. I do feel that this is the first their repertoire that I didn't love as much as when I was a kid, but it was still very enjoyable. Perhaps because the doors to all over the world isn't as exciting as it used to be, or maybe it's the logistical side of the monster's world not quite making as much sense to me now. Oh well.

"The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation. All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could. ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong. This is far better. And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow. It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful. What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie. ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way. The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city. But we never see things from her point of view. We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species. And they ARE. To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship). This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through. Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes. ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children. This is not to say children won't like it. Maybe they will. (Who can say?) Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect. It will make them less frightened of the dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Modern Animation Classic's Classic,"Monster Inc is, in an understatement, my favorite animation movie sans rival. So if you are looking for a critic, find a other review.First off, the concept and premise is refreshing. Its not a traditional fairy tale-based, superhero-based, or science fiction-based premise. The ""good guys"" look like ""bad guys"" so ARE ACTUALLY the good guys.Second, the graphics is amazing (for its time). I talking about the ""hair"" on the ""monsters"".

Not my favourite Pixar...,"There are things I do like about this film. I find some moments incredibly beautiful (such as one bit at the end), I like the selection of actors for voicing the characters (especially Randall), I like the CGI used and there are quite a few very good jokes. However, I just feel this is ""weaker"" than a few other Pixar films, such as Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, Cars and of course, Finding Nemo. I also find this a little bit too fast paced, for most of the film there is constant tension. Despite this, I do think that this film is well worth watching at least once and entertaining enough.The plot is pretty easy to follow. The whole film is about monsters who scare human children at night, coming from the closet. As the film goes on and the plot unravels, we meet Sulley and Mike, two monsters who help each other in this scaring business. We then find out the monsters do it because they it helps power their world (like electricity and batteries do to ours). Soon a large adventure follows involving Boo...I recommend this to children who do not mind constant tension and worry in animated films and for people who like other Pixar films.

Overall fun and memorable.,"Monster's Inc is a large piece of my childhood, and probably yours too. It is original, fun, and best of all a timeless movie. It knows when to create sentiment, or laughter at the right time and how to do it. It is basically defines what makes Pixar such an amazing studio. The movies main heroes are Mike and Sully, and even though they are children scaring monsters, it is extremely glossed over because they funny, honest, and do the best for a being close to alien to them. Besides this movie containing driven and interesting characters, it tells an interesting story that kids and adults alike could enjoy. But something that I believe the movie tries to get across is this: intelligent beings are scared of what they don't understand, and exploit whatever it is to get a resource vital to them and hurt it if they can to get the resource faster and more efficiently. For instance, the movies race of monsters are scared of the humans because they are of a different world and exploit the needed resource (the child's screams) subtly, and when Randall (one of Pixar's top villains) wants to exploit the resource faster he is willing to hurt the humans. Still , you don't need to understand Monster's Inc on a deeper level to enjoy it or love its originality. This is one of my favorite movies ever, and is great for one of any age and I highly suggest watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Every single voice is disgusting, annoying, and unfunny.

Brilliant and unexpected,"Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie. The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle. If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie. John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like. Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie.The animation however is far more brilliant than Disney/Pixar's previous CGI releases Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story II. The environments created for the characters is very cartoon-like in many respects, unlike the phenomenal realistic worlds created in this Summers hit Shrek. The animation is not as complex as Shrek was, but it is very obvious just looking at Sullys heavy fur coat to see the advances computer animation has taken since Jurassic Park rewrote the book on computer effects in 1993. All in all this movie is more geared to kids in the content of the dialog. Parents will find the movie enjoyable, but don't expect as much sarcastic wit and sexual innuendos as Shrek contained as this is a Disney movie after all. I recommend seeing this movie, you'll get a real kick out of the animated short film Pixar created for this release that precedes the movie called ""For the Birds"". It didn't hurt to have Lucasfilm release it's first trailer for Star Wars Episode II with this movie either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Underrated among the Pixar offerings.,"""Monsters, Inc."" is among Pixar's best because it constructs a clever, convincing world from the single childhood experience of being afraid of what lies behind the closet door. Pixar opens that door and plunges the viewer into a funhouse mirror of society with puns, inside jokes and pop cultural references (""Scare Different""). Goodman, as his name implies, was an excellent job as the voice actor for the talented but naïve Sully and Buscemi oozes menace as his foil. The plot is sufficiently frightening to drive the story forward and the laughs are high-brow enough for adults and slapstick enough for the kids. In short, one of the few DVDs actually worth owning.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The CU Film Critic takes on ""Monsters, Inc.""","Whether you love or hate what's been making its way out of Walt Disney Studios for the past four years or so, one thing's for sure.  Walt's gotta be rolling around in his cryogenic chamber.Since `The Lion King,' with the exception of the `Toy Story' films, Disney's animated films have been going downhill in a hurry, on a slippery slope to the pit where we find such cartoon masterpieces as `Rock-a-Doodle' and `The Secret of Nimh 2: Timmy to the Rescue.'That said, it would be nice for the folks at Disney to bring back the animated musical as we know it before Dreamworks' Jeffrey Katzenberg drops them with the film industry equivalent of a Stone Cold Stunner.THAT said, the newest computer-animated film by the geniuses at Disney/Pixar is the most fun I've had at the theatre since last spring.  `Monsters, Inc.' is a tale of blue-collar workers who just happen to be blessed with such distinguishing characteristics as purple fur, antennae, horns, etc.Apparently, in the world of monsters (which may very well be Greeley, judging from various hints we're given), electrical power is all driven by one source- the screams of small children.  If you've spent any time in a church-sponsored preschool, this concept won't come as a big surprise.  Of course, in order to harness this power, myriad creatures are employed at Monsters, Incorporated, to enter our world through childrens' closet doors and collect these shrieks of terror to be put to use at the power plant.As my fourteen year-old sister would say, `How cool is that?'We get the voice of John `Walter' Goodman as James P. Sullivan (Sully, for short), an enthusiastic ogre of sorts with blue fur, a big smile, and horns. Imagine Bigfoot after two weeks at Wonka's chocolate factory, and you've got a pretty good idea.Sully is the perpetual Employee of the Month at Monsters, Inc., spending all his free time boning up on job skills, and constantly breaking `scare records' with his patented system.  His best friend and manager is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed, green gumdrop with harms and legs. Wazowski is the monster equivalent of George from `Seinfeld,' slightly neurotic but goofy enough to be fun.When the two buddies inadvertently let a child into the monster world, catastrophe ensues.  Children, of course, are considered toxic to monsters, making the job of scream collectors even more hazardous.  This attracts the attention of the scheming villain Randall, voiced by none other than the devil himself, Steve Buscemi.Cartoons, computer-generated or not, don't get much better than this. Cartoons are all about fun, and you won't have more fun at any other movie this fall.  It's great.  The monsters' names are Mike, George, and the like. The animation is top-notch.  Shrek has nothing on this film.  I sat hypnotized for a good eight minutes of the movie, captivated by the incredible detail what was given to various clumps of blue fur.  A guest appearance by the Abominable Snowman made me roll out of my chair (upon presenting his guests with yellow sno-cones, he reassures them, `they're lemon.').Also, this is Disney, so keep an eye out for cameos by characters from other films.  I counted three.  See if you can do me one better.  `Monsters, Inc.' may not have been part of Walt Disney's vision, but I get the feeling he at least would have approved.  Want one more reason to go see this movie? Five words.  `Star Wars Episode II Trailer.'It's high time a family movie makes its way to the top.  I'm gonna endorse this one with an `A.'",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Yet another witty and wonderfully animated movie from Pixar.,"'Monsters Inc.' is one of the computer-animated successors to the brilliant 'Toy Story'. It lives up to the tradition of brilliant animated films both kids and adults can enjoy. It's even better than 'Shrek', and 'Shrek' was pretty damn good!The story follows Sully (voiced by John Goodman), a giant, furry monster, and his friend Mike Wazowski(Billy Crystal), a green eyeball with limbs. They're from 'Monstropolis', a city of monsters in another dimension and their job is to collect 'scream energy' by, you guessed it, coming out of closets (which, as we know from 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', are interdimensional portals) and making kids scream. However, there's trouble at work (kids are getting too hard to scare, rivalry with another monster) and everything really starts falling to pieces when a little toddler comes through a door into Monstropolis. Monsters are terrified of kids, whom they regard as toxic. Which is reasonable enough.The animation is gorgious, it's very funny (on different levels), fast-paced and not too sentimental either. Definitely one of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see.

Childish and uninspiring,"Monsters inc is often celebrated for its creative concept and colorful animation, but it falls flat for me. The humor is too juvenile, and the storyline lacks substance.

The characters, although charming to some, feel one-dimensional, and the plot, revolving around monsters scaring kids for energy, seems overly simplistic and repetitive.

"Better than Shrek, One of the Best Films of 2001.","Sulley (John Goodman) is a Big, Scary monster in Monster world and is the top man in his world.

Together, Sulley and Mike make one of the best pairs in a cartoon movie that i have ever seen.Monsters, Inc. is a movie people of all ages will enjoy because it has things for everybody and it has stupid and yet creative jokes. One of my favorite jokes in the film is when Sulley and Mike get to be on the cover of one of the Monster magazines and when they both see it, Mike's face is covered by a price tag and Mike freaks out because he can't believe he's on the cover of a magazine. That was a big laugh... but Monsters, Inc. was also sad at the end. I Cried when Sulley had to do what he had with Boo...  I'm not going to give away the ending for anyone who didn't see this film yet, even though they should have.My Rating: **** stars out of *****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Fun, cut and clever pixar film","I wasn't really a fan of this Pixar movie when it came out and just thought it was a okay watch. Didn't really stick as one of my childhood memories or anything like that but when I saw it as a kid is was a good watch nothing more. And didn't really watch it again until now because of ""Monsters University"". When we were kids most of us was scared of the dark or afraid of ghosts and monsters. Well in this world monsters do exist and they go around scaring kids by coming out of the closet for energy supply. But the thing is the monsters are as much as scared of the kids as the kids are to the monsters. But the main conflict starts when a kid comes into the monsters society. When it comes to kids in movies it can be a hit or a miss but in this case she is adorable. While having the kid demeanor and although the cause of the conflict and what drives the story but didn't really get annoying. And seeing it now I kinda enjoyed it more than when I saw it as a child. And as the story started to build although it's a very simple story it was fun, cute and kinda clever. To the people that saw this movie when it first came out, it's worth seeing it again even if it's for ""Monsters University"".8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Review for Monsters, Inc.","This was a film that I saw back in high school. I was telling my wife, Jaime, that I wasn't sure if I've seen it since then. Interesting enough, I would go see the Pixar films with my buddy Will and his family back then. Jaime put this on when I left one evening to see if our daughter, Mackenzie, would watch it. They got 30 seconds in, but we were able to convince her a few nights later.What is great here is that this sets up a world that feels real. In this one, monsters have a society, a large city and it is all powered by harnessing the screams of children. They go through doors into rooms, scare them and there are tanks hooked up. The issue here is that children aren't as scared as they used to be. There is an energy crisis. This is an interesting nod to real life issues that people have.The best team at collecting the energy is Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). The head of Monsters, Inc. Is Waternoose (voiced by James Coburn). He is pushing for competition and this makes Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi) enemies. There is one night where a door that should have been returned is in the machine. Sully goes in and a little girl comes through. She gets called Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) by him. In trying to get her back to her world, it creates major issues and even unveils a conspiracy.Then the only other thing here is that the monsters are scared to be touched by humans. They believe that something bad will happen and there's even a containment team. The time and care put into everything with this film is what makes it work. The world building where there are things we'd see in our world, just slightly different. That is what makes these films work so well.Sticking along with that, I love how these monsters coming to work is similar to going to a factory. Their conversations are like ones I've had or overheard. It also helps that Goodman and Crystal work so well off each other. They feel like they've been doing this for a long time. The comedy from that is good. Buscemi is great as the villain. That is a bit different from what I'm used to from him, aside from early stuff he did. Gibbs is adorable and by the end, I did tear up this time around. Other than that, Coburn, Jennifer Tilley, John Ratzenberger, Frank Oz, Bonnie Hunt and the additional voices are just spot on.The last thing I'll say is that even though I prefer the classic animation style, this looks amazing. Jaime and I were commenting on how good it looked on the 4K TV. The care and effort put into the fur of Sully or the Yeti (voiced by Ratzenberger) is just amazing. They bring this world to life and the things you can do by making this be animated is great. This is a film that I wouldn't be mad if my daughter wanted to watch more as there are enough adult jokes without going over the top. Would recommend it if you haven't seen it or it's been a while between watches.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great film,"I always loved going to the movies as a child.  When I was in fifth grade, I saw Toy Story for the first time.  I remember watching the movie and drinking in the computer-animated visuals and feeling the speed and urgency of the big chase scene at the end.  Toy Story was the movie that changed my life.When I saw Monsters Inc, I felt like I was in fifth grade again.  Pixar has gone so far since Toy Story.  Just look at Sully's fur as it moves because of the changing environment.  There are jokes for adults and children alike. And if you thought the chase scene between Sid's dog and the toys was amazing, you haven't seen nothing until you've seen the chase scene involving the roller coster of doors.  I would feel confident to say that that scene is one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Ooh, the sweetest thing","Quentin Tarantino once claimed (In a deleted scene from ""Pulp Fiction"") that there were only two kinds of people in the world; Elvis people and Beatles people. You could love both, but eventually you had to make a decision. Now there appears to be a new societal division forming- between ""Shrek"" people and ""Monsters Inc."" people. Now I love ""Shrek;"" it had moments of real wit and its target (the Disney empire) was long overdue for a thrashing. But ultimately I was left cold by it. The reason? It was afraid to be a fairy tale. It is true that young people nowadays would not respond well to fairy tales; Disney has transformed  fairy tales into something toxic and false, so new ways of telling them have to be invented. ""Shrek"" told a basic fairy tale story, but peppered it with post-modern references and nudge-nudge jokes to make it clear to is jaded and cynical young audience that it didn't REALLY believe in any of it, it was just having fun. That is, I think, the easy way out.""Monsters Inc."" (Which is officially a Disney film but is actually made by the far more innovative studio Pixar) chooses a harder route; to tell a fairy tale straight, but in a way modern audiences will appreciate. In this, they succeeded masterfully.The plot of ""Monsters Inc."" is well known by now. In the city of Monstropolis, which is pretty much like any city you know except that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes, children's screams are the only source of power. To obtain them, the power company Monsters Inc sends professional scarers through a network of trans-dimensional doors into children's closets around the world. The rules of the job are strict; no children or even children's clothing must come into contact with a monster, for there is nothing more dangerous than the touch of a human child. The company's top scarer is ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman), who with his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is in a contest with the number 2 scarer, the evil chameleon Randall Boggs (Buschemi, playing it smooth instead of whiny for a change) to break the all time scream record. However, Randall is actually engaged in a shady plan that involves one of his assigned kids. When that plan backfires and the kid ends up in Monstropolis, Sulley is left alone to deal with her, and with the utter chaos that ensues.There is so much to love in this film, but I must draw attention to the relationship between Sulley and the child, who he nicknames ""Boo."" Somehow, and truly I am at a loss to explain it, the scriptwriters, animators and actors pulled off the amazing feat of making the relationship touching without being nauseatingly sweet. Boo is the most adorable little kid in animaiton history, and I think the reason for this is that she was actually voiced by a real three-year old, and not by some affected adult (After all, what do adults really know about what it is like to be three?). The scriptwriters got her to say some incredibly funny things, but her innocence makes them funnier, since she is not trying to be self-aware. John Goodman is wonderful at conveying Sulley's gradually mounting affection for the little tyke, making it more humourous and moving by spicing it with some understandable aggrivation.I loved the reference to Tex Avery's legendary animated short ""Feed the Kitty,"" (Which must have heavily influenced the filmmakers; Boo also calls Sulley ""kitty""), and this film has plenty more to entertain- particularly some wonderfully designed snow sequences and a virtiguous closet door chase that is one of the best ever. ""Monsters Inc"" is a film I will watch again, and from me, that is high praise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
hi,I thought monsters inc was an amazing film i watched when i was a kid. They got the right actors to be in this film. I believe the actors in this film got along. Boo is my favorite character. I hope they do more films like monsters inc because they are really good. Randel was so nice in monsters university then he turned on mike that was so mean. I couldn't believe Ross was in Monsters university Monsters inc was way better then monsters university The animation in both of the films were so different I recommend you should watch it And make your own review I love watching movies so you should watch both of those films because they are good.

A Film With A Heart of Gold,"The first thing I said coming out of Monsters Inc. was ""Shrek? What's Shrek?"" Monster's Inc. is a fantastic effort from Pixar, one the features spectacular animation, great humor, and most importantly, a heart of gold. Rarely do anyfamily films hit such an emotional note as beautiful as Monsters Inc.'s final line. Even after leaving, just simply thinking about it gave me a familiar lump in my throat and watery eyes. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect. Enoughsaid. The best character in the entire movie is that of Boo, the child. She steals every scene she's in, even topping the two leads. Her big eyes and sweet voice just melts my heart. This movie, in my opinion, is superior to Shrek, in many ways. While Shrek was initially funny, the jokes got old. One thing I know about Monsters Inc. is that many jokes flew by so quickly, that a second viewing is essential to get it all in. After viewing Shrek for the second time, I realize that the jokes were only funny once. Honestly, go see Monsters Inc., with kids in tow or not. This one is a charmer for all ages and a healthy break from the usual summer and fall fare. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another gem from Pixar,"Man, I love Pixar. Time goes by and their movies have never disappointed me. Monsters, Inc was obviously not an exception. I really can't think of any flaw in this movie. The animation was beautiful. The voices were perfect, with a special mention to Billy Crystal, who gives voice to the funniest character in the whole story (in my opinion), Mike Wazowski. There are good guys and, of course, villains. The monsters are, in fact, no monsters at all; they are incredibly sweet and human. And of course, the script; funny, witty and surprisingly deep. At this point, I guess everybody knows that Disney films always (and I mean always) have an important message, for both kids and adults. Monsters, Inc is a tale about friendship, sticking together through the hard times and not being afraid of the unknown. 90 minutes of cinematic joy that I'd recommend everyone.

A great movie full of humor and intelligence,"With either John Goodman or Billy Crystal, you cannot go wrong. Put them together and you have a guaranteed success.

This shows in their dialogue throughout the movie; they never deliver a line incorrectly. Sometimes this movie is intelligent, sometimes it's very funny and other times it's both! The movie is stunning visually. The giant warehouse of doors is impressive. Sully's fur is a sign of how far computer animation has come since the days of ""Toy Story.""

"Monsters, Inc.(2001)","But out of all the monsters I've seen my favorite one as well as favorite character in this film is of course Sulley. The characters, the musical score, the song in the end credits, the story, the feelings, the intensity, the laughs, the truth behind the huge business of the whole city, everything about this film still amazes me even today. Mike and Sulley are yet another one of the most incredible and fearless pairs of best friends I've ever seen, sure they may seem a bit hesitant about a few new things they come across but they still march through them because they're best friends and when it comes to dealing with something they didn't even know was happening they still stick by each other and make things right again, that's what best friends do. The fact that Sulley was willing to do anything to protect Boo as soon as he started warming up to her is really so compelling that it reminds me of myself and how much I'm willing to sacrifice anything for anyone I love because that's what true friends do, when I was a kid I never really understood what Mr. Waternoose was really up to alongside Randall but now that I'm older I now completely understand what their plan really was and harvesting kids for their scream energy is absolutely criminal and cruel. The fact that even today there are still big businesses out there who also just go behind the backs of their employees and have secret ideas to make their own huge profits for themselves and not for the welfare of the community is just cruel and criminal and I'm hoping that the future of it all will be different. If you haven't seen this movie yet than you're completely missing out of something amazing, a film that will show you that not all presidents of big businesses can be trusted and that things that you thought were dangerous may actually be not so bad after all, maybe things that you thought were dangerous are not somethings to be afraid of because maybe they can be your friend and also this film shows you that the monsters you may have feared as a kid might not be so scary after all. It'll even show you that life really is no fun without a good scare and even a good laugh. Monsters, Inc. Is another one of the most classic and most enjoyable Disney films I've ever grown up with and will still never stop watching again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, Mike, Sulley and Boo will astound and amaze you just like they did for me all these years and they still do now along with every last wacky and wonderful and astounding surprise that this masterpiece has to offer.

"This Movie Is Good, Because It Cares","Monsters Inc is one of my personal favorite Pixar movies growing up.

The animation holds up a couple of decades later. The comedy is great. The characters are all memorable. And the heart really comes to the right place, especially with Sully's connection to a kid. I know it's something I'm gonna say constantly to a Pixar movie when they come out a masterpiece, but this is a movie you need to check out.

i cant count how many times i have watched this flick,"Nothing warms me more for laughs than anytime I get to sit down and watch Monster's Inc. This is one Pixar animation that I hold dear to heart, I loved it so much that I didn't desire for them to make a sequel, because I felt they will wreck what is already a masterpiece. This is the best voice casting I have seen in any animation, the story of Monster's Inc. is just warm to the heart, as we follow the adventures of a little girl in the monster world. You just can't forget the voices of the top scarer James P. Sullivan aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).The idea for the Monster's Inc. story was born during a lunch in 1994 between Pixars production team of John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the production of Toy Story (1995). Pete Docter thought it up, and after they were done working on Toy Story, he stepped aside to build the story, while others were working on other Disney/Pixar animations. When he was done with the first draft (which was far different from the final film) the name Monster's Inc was pitched in by longtime Disney animator Joe Grant (who worked on the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).The movie plot underwent numerous changes over its writing and production years between 1996 and 2000. Its final story is about how monsters scare human kids to get their screams. The screams are then stored, refined and used as power, power in the sense of electrical power and fuel power. The flip side of this is that monsters are afraid of human kids, because they are believed to be toxic and one touch from a human child can kill them. There is a company in charge of this scream collection and refinement in Monstroplolis, that company is Monster's Inc. There in Monster's Inc our lead Characters are Sulley and Mike, Sulley is the top sacrer and Mike is his assistant.One faithful working day, the lives of both Sulley and Mike would change and the faith of the monster world also, as Sulley meet a human child (Boo) in their scare floor in the Monster's Inc factory, panic broke loose and Sulley not knowing what to do and how to contain the problem allowed it to escalate to the point that all Monstroplois is aware of the existence of a human child in the monster world and the whole monster world is in a state of panic.Monsters, Inc. won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and it lost the Best animated feature award to Dreamworks Shrek. It was a financial success and it received high positive reviews and it is a must watch.A sequel to this wonderful movie is set to be released 12 years after the first, in 2013, and it will be a prequel to the original plot.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Everything about this is wonderful, from the essentially Pixar concept to the warm, sentimental relationships at its core. Even the animation has held up quite well, which isn't always the case with these early CG efforts: humans still look a bit wonky, but most of the cast seems drawn straight from the pages of a Caldecott winner and that kind of bright, absurd character works beautifully. John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two.

One of the five finest films of 2001.,"Exciting, humorous, longing, tension-filled, cute... Pixar's new ""Monsters Inc."" covers an enormous range of emotions in the course of its hour-and-a-half running time.  Frankly, it feels quite a bit longer than that -- the movie absolutely draws you in.John Sullivan (""Sully"" - voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Koslowski (voiced by, of all people, Billy Crystal!) are the top ""scaring"" team at Monsters Inc. -- a major company in another dimension, where the society is powered by the energy contained in kids' screams.  To ensure that there is power to run Monstropolis' everyday society, the Monsters need to keep scaring kids and getting those screams -- ""We scare because we care"" is the corporate slogan, showing that M.I. is the driving force behind that dimension's economy and society.Close behind Sully and Mike, though, is the treacherous Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a multi-limbed chameleon-like monster with a scheme to top Sully and Mike and keep the company in the black.  Naturally, things start to go wrong when a human child from the other side manages to get into the Monster's dimensions... particularly since common knowledge holds that kids are actually toxic and poisonous to monsters!You'll gasp in awe, you'll be convulsed with laughter, and you'll smile sadly at the amazing visions, witty humor, and brilliant storyline.  I cannot recommend this film enough; I'd go see it multiple times at full price in the theaters.(This is, of course, helped by the ""introductory"" animation -- a hilarious piece called ""For the Birds"".  *grin*)P.S. - my guess is that Pixar put together their standard run of ""bloopers"" for the film, to be run during the credits, but are holding the new credits back a month or so to get people to come and see the film again during the Christmas season.

That empathy is precisely the fate that takes hold of frightening monsters, who were once drawn to generating screams out of children, but then, after Boo, are transformed into heartwarming creatures to children. Monsters, Inc. is an ingenious and heartwarming family-wide experience, that offers beautiful visuals, fascinating concepts, as well as and the unusual, out-of-the-box portrayal of the relationship between monsters and children.

Really thrilled,"Monsters, Inc. Is a delightful and heartwarming animated film that showcases Pixar's signature blend of creativity, humor, and emotion. Released in 2001, it remains a beloved classic for audiences of all ages.The story centers around two lovable monsters, Sulley and Mike, who work at Monsters, Inc., a company that generates energy by scaring children. The twist? The monsters are just as afraid of kids as kids are of them. This unique premise sets the stage for a charming adventure filled with laugh-out-loud moments and touching emotional beats.The film's standout feature is its vibrant world-building. Monstropolis is a creative and visually stunning setting filled with imaginative monster designs. Sulley, voiced by John Goodman, is both imposing and lovable, while Billy Crystal's Mike provides endless comedic relief. The bond between Sulley and Boo, a human girl who accidentally enters the monster world, is the heart of the film, showcasing themes of friendship, compassion, and overcoming prejudice.The animation, even by today's standards, is impressive, especially in the detailed textures of Sulley's fur and the dynamic energy of the door chase sequence. The film also benefits from a beautiful score by Randy Newman, including the Oscar-winning song If I Didn't Have You.Overall, Monsters, Inc. Is a charming blend of humor, heart, and innovation. Its timeless message about embracing differences and caring for others makes it an essential watch for families and animation enthusiasts alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Animation at its finest,"Monsters Inc, like Toy Story is also a genius concept. The film works off the premise that children's bedroom closet doors operate as portals that allow monsters through them to scare them and obtain the energy released in the scream to fuel the monster world. I have no idea how this concept was thought up but it sets the movie up for a home run.These characters have fully realised and developed personalities. We see that their decisions have actual consequences and they feel more than one way about the events. We see internal conflict and for a movie animated ""lovable"" monsters, that is really impressive.The chase scene at the end is staged and paced perfectly. Great story telling and really entertaining watching. It made me fall in love with these characters and really get on board with what they were trying to do. It culminates to a denouement that is satisfying, well thought out and fully rounded.Monsters Inc is Pixar doing what it does best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
pretty,"Voice acting- Excellent....the best casting and acting you could hope for the characters as presented in the filmAnimation- Wow... What else would you expect from Pixar? Beautiful color scheme, great imagination, spot-on characterization.  ""Sully""'s hair is, in a word, incredible, as are many of the minute details Pixar pays attention to.  In my opinion, Pixar again sets the standard for a living, breathing, stylized 3D animated world.Plot- Good..... Paced well and wildly imaginative.With all the above accolades, you would think I rated this movie a 10, like I did Toy Story 2.  I love individual components of this film.  But I couldn't bring myself to.  Something's missing.  When I go to see a movie in this genre, I want to be transported back 20 years (I'm currently 29) and walk out of the theater with a stupid grin on my face. The somewhat complex plot (for this kind of film) and some scenes only an adult would get the subtext to keep me from rating it higher.  Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie, but I just didn't have the stupid grin on my face after seeing it.  Kids will love it for the characters, action, and color, but I just can't see a kid under 10 being fully engaged in what's going on.  Too simplistic for adults, too complex for younger kids, it's heart is pulled in different directions.  Still, I give it an 8/10 because it is a great movie despite my quibbles and it has tremendous production values.  If you're going to see it, do so on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A well crafted kids' story which will also captivate adults.,"Monsters Inc. is a very well produced kid's animation which can be watched by almost ""all the family"" - some elderly relatives may get confused by the pace of it all, but that's their fault.The movie breathes quality and I have no doubt it will ascend to same classic status as other Walt Disney pictures such as ""Snow White"" or ""101 Dalmatians"". Captivating moments abound, the entire film is *very* well produced, and the voice acting is superb. ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story"", while looking gorgeous, still have a computer animated feel to them - not so with Monsters Inc.The film's universal appeal and top film status is also due to the quality of animation, the original ideas in the story - like the doors or the CDA (Child Detection Agency) - and just the sheer fun ness of the characters and the vast backdrop of the Monsters' metropolis. The director's attention to detail and the film's novel and often hilarious concepts, suck you into the Monsters' world and enthral.If you're an adult, Monsters Inc. probably isn't as funny as ""Shrek"", but kids will get more laughs. Hopefully, if there is a sequel, some more adult geared jokes could be chucked in.Overall, Monsters Inc. is a tremendous film which will undoubtedly stand the test of time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pretty entertaining,"Well, this film is not quite Toy Story.  I found it very entertaining, but it seems odd that Monsters, Inc. is based on how many screams can be extracted from kids owing to their fear but that they turn out to be harmless.  Well, maybe this is not a problem.  But something nagged at me. Anyone else?  Well, apart from this I found it v. entertaining.John Goodman voices Sully, the best scarer in town and Billy Crystal does his best friend and partner, Mike Mozkowski.  They have been told that kids are dangerous, but when a kid escapes during a scare, Sulley learns they aren't.  Of course he has to keep the kid under wraps in order to avoid panicking the city.  This has some overtones that might disturb folks in the wake of Sept. 11.  So Sulley learns of a plot by his rival, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) to trap a kid and keep them in Monstropolis so that there will never be an energy crisis.  Boo, the kids that Sulley ends up with is caught in the middle of this and Mike and Sulley want to save her from the nefarious Boggs and the CEO of Monsters Inc.  Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who is incahoots on this plan with Boggs.  Sulley and Mike manage to get Boo home and avoid capture by Boggs.I was sitting too near the front of the theater to be able to honestly appraise the look of the film.  I still have a crick in my neck from looking up.  But it looked fairly dynamic and alive.  I thought John Goodman was terrific in endowing his character with a lot of kindness and gentleness. Billy Crystal's voice I hardly recognized, but he was great too.  There was great variety in the nature of the monsters.  Very cute.  I didn't find the story quite as compelling, perhaps for the reason I mentioned at the beginning of this review.  But nevertheless, this is still quite a lot of fun.  The look, the sound, the attention to detail, the sound, it's all there.  Another strong Pixar flic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar at it's best,Now i'm a big fan anything that Pixar produces and they rightly deserve all the praise they get because they are pure storytellers of the highest quality and this film is one of the best.The story is simple and told beautifully combining strong voice talent such as Billy Crystal and John Goodman with great visual imagery and animation. Only Pixar can tell a story about monsters from our closets in the way that they can and make the characters to endearing that we care for them.The sweet little Boo steals the show and Pixar tell her story with such heart that is rarely found in the films of companies like Blue Sky.This film fits well into not only the impressive body of work of Pixar but also Disney and is well deserved of it's place alongside other great works such as Snow White and Lion King.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Technically not as perfect as Nemo, but nicer story","I missed this Pixar movie when it was playing on the big screen, so my review is based on the DVD version. The computer animation works beautifully, but where the movie really shines is the story. Who would have thought that the monsters are afraid of little boys and girls, but they have to hide in closets and scare little kids at night because their screams power the electric utility company of Monsterville. With the help of a little child that is not at all afraid of monsters, our two heroes uncover a conspiracy of grandest proportions, but that's all I will tell you here. After all, you should go out and rent the movie for yourself. Personally, I like Monsters Inc. better than Nemo, it's in a close tie with Shreck, and only second to Spirited Away in the animated category.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need?,"Isn't it unfathomable that Monsters Inc. is now twelve years old? Even Pixar's first masterpiece Toy Story is quickly approaching twenty, which is equally unfathomable in any state of mind. Rewatching Monster's, Inc., in light of the upcoming prequel, I couldn't help but realize that Pixar hasn't changed a whole lot in their animation style. Little noticeable additions and upgrades such as lighting and texturing have been made, but changes like that are pretty much unnoticeable to the public. Pixar has been one of the few companies that has done little innovation to the overall layout and design of their animation since their breakout in 1995.Pixar, however, has to remain witty, original, and subversive in their material and story lines to remain the almighty, animation patriarch they've always been. In 2013, I'm proud to save I've never been letdown by a Pixar film so much so that I gave it a negative review. Even their lesser stories are better than Disney's average ones, and even a good Dreamworks movie is not usually the equivalent of an average Pixar one. Monsters, Inc. is a story that is cinematic bread-and-butter, combining the quirks and uniqueness of monsters and articulating their appeal to children wonderfully in a film. While the subject matter may have you thinking otherwise, this is a sweetly appropriate film for children over five, and unlike maybe some modern animated releases such as Hotel Transylvania this one doesn't segregate the viewer solely because they've seen more modern monster films than everyone in the audience.The plot concerns Mike (voiced by the lovable Billy Crystal), a stout, green, Cyclops-esque monster and his pal Sulley (John Goodman), a lovable, furry, blue monster and their duties at Monsters, Inc. The company is dedicated to frightening children of all ages after hours, and to do so, they use a series of doors, assigned to each monster. The doors look like they lead nowhere, but actually house a child's room behind them. When a monster walks back through the door, it is extracted from the ground and taken through an elaborate conveyor belt behind the scenes.Mike and Sulley always find themselves harassed by Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), who leaves a door on the floor, allowing a child to enter the premises so he can get them kicked out of Monsters, Inc. The child is two years old, unafraid of monsters, and thinks of Sulley as a lovable teddy-bear rather than a ferocious monster. The film follows Mike and Sulley as they try and hide the girl - who they nickname ""Boo"" (Mary Gibbs) - from their boss and try to keep their jobs intact.There's a surprising (and equally unsurprising) zealous energy to the material here. By having such a loose plot, the characters are free to roam in many different directions, trying to find a way to keep precious little ""Boo"" hidden from all the other monsters.Speaking of the other monsters, Pixar's creativity as a group seems to bleed through Monsters, Inc. as each character has their own artistic design and color scheme to go with them. No two monsters look alike, and none look anything like the classic movie monsters or basic retreads of them, showing Pixar's high creativity. Even if you remain unfazed by the story or the plot, the art design of the characters is something that will hold your attention for quite sometime.Monsters, Inc. is a charming affair that should be equally rewarding for adults as it will be their children. There's no reliance on immaturity, stupidity, or even blatant shallowness. There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need?Voiced by: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Mary Gibbs. Directed by: Pete Docter.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Quite a Delight,"An entertaining, surprisingly sweet, and all together funny animated film- Monsters Inc. more than holds up today, and proves itself to be an animated classic. First off, I adore the cast of this film, honestly one of the best cast of actors out there for a Pixar film to be honest. John Goodman excels at Sully, which is obvious, but the true standouts of the film are Crystal's Mike Wazowski and Buscemi's Randall. The animation is done quite well, and the world they built throughout is absolutely extraordinary and the exact kind of limitless imagination you would expect from such a classic Disney flick. The film is quite funny, and has its fair share of emotional and tender moments, both of which I rather appreciate. It isn't Pixar's best, but due to the talent involved, the incredible worldbuilding, and just a sheer sense of direction and fun characters- Monsters Inc. proves to be one memorable film, and one you never can get tired of, no matter how many times you watch it.

Pixar's Expanding Vision,"Every bit the equal of the `Toy Story' films but with larger vision, Pixar continues to explore the universal endearments of childhood; rather than have toys come to life, this time it's about the monsters that come out of the closet at night. Pixar's focus is not about scaring children but about the act of scaring children: it's a job to the main characters, portrayed as working-class stiffs trying to meet their quotas at an energy supply corporation that uses the kids' screams to produce power. It's a brilliant concept, naturally, but Pixar takes it further by creating a fully realized metropolis that exists as a sort of cross between the New York of the forties and the big city in any Marvel Comic, inhabited with pleasingly shaped creatures that complement the ambience and sleek lines of the settings. As in the `Toy Story' series there's as much for grownups as for children and repeated viewings seem almost mandatory (an inviting prospect); but this time around, there's a healthy skepticism towards corporations that's clearly adult.

Phenomenal,"I grew up watching Monsters, Inc., and I think I liked it a lot more than i liked Toy Story (and I really liked Toy Story).There was always something so different about Monsters, Inc. that sets it apart. At its heart, it's a story that explores the pain of being separated from the ones we love, and it does it in such a subtle and steady-paced way that it's almost easy to miss the fact that the message is even there. It's so smoothly executed that every scene runs together like a nice, big painting.Billy Crystal and John Goodman are fantastic as Mike and Sulley respectively. The characters work off each other well, and a lot of the humour in the film comes from the interactions between the two rather than the external factors that are introduced.As is typical with Pixar, this film serves a technological purpose. It's not a story that was told simply because the studio wanted to tell another story to make some money. This film takes everything that worked from its predecessors, adds its own elements and challenges and still somehow manages to create an entertaining and endearing film that never fails to warm and break hearts. It's a rare gift, and I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to grow up with this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of my favourite movies ever and even today I love it more.,"One of my favourite movies ever and even today I love it more.It's about something that is cute more than something that is required. We have most of things in our movies but here is a story who loves a kid, who indeed misses his the kids little things.The story is set in a Monster city where Monsters have to make kids cry or scare them rather. The scared kids screams produce energy that shall be used in the city. The premise of any PIXAR film, till I think UP was just so beautiful and nice till something went wrong.OK, so this movie has something that is cut and that is the little kid called ""BOO"" I love her so much and each time I see this, I love her more. The animation is wonderful here especially for her. And for me BOO is the cutest kid ever seen on a film.The animation quality of PIXAR is outstanding, from the hairs of James P Sullivan to the setup of the doors to the whole Monsters world, it is too very detailed and amazing. I wish I could see this in theatre but alas I couldn't. The characters are superb and if Mike Wozawski is comical then, Randall, the dragon is cunning and a dastardly villain.At the bottom of this movie, like in most other PIXAR movies is an underline text and that is a father-daughter relationship. Sullivan becomes the father who starts taking care of BOO. This very care and what he actually misses when BOO is not around or what he loves about BOO makes the crux to an extent.Thanks to the PIXAR team for giving such a wonderful film that can be shown for generations of Kids and most kids love it I hope.

Best Pixar Movie Ever!,"I saw this movie with my wife when it first came out in the theater. I remember we were running errands that day and just decided on seeing it spur-of-the moment. I don't regret that at all. I bought it as soon as it came out and a couple years later we had our first little one, a daughter (now two years old) who absolutely loves it. She lovingly asks for us to put it on all the time, she calls it ""Monsters"".There's lots to enjoy about this movie from the technology to music and of course the characters. You really can't say anything bad about it. First I gotta say that the voices were all very well picked. I get the biggest kick out of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman). Their musical number at the end is cute too.The one thing I personally enjoy the most about it is that it finds a happy medium that you don't always see in movies geared toward kids. By that I mean that it's not dummied-down so that ""kids can understand it"" but still keeps adults entertained. It also doesn't go overboard at trying to cram a message down your throat.

Pixar has done it again,"This movie lived up to its expectations. With great ease, I might add. It is slightly different from previous Pixar movies, the fact that it wasn't directed by John Lasseter might have something to do with it:), because I felt that there was less of that universal humor that anyone, be it a 5 year old child or an adult can find funny. But the lack of humor was replaced with a truly touching story and one of the best movie climaxes I have seen in a long time. I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice.

Now this is what a family movie is all about...,"Laughter, humor, a lesson to learn, an evil villain, a good guy, and his faithful sidekick. What more could you ask for in a movie? Oh, and there's even a romance! They have made a great show for family and kids alike, something that mom and dad can enjoy watching, but that the kids will find fun too. It teaches a lesson... good conquers evil, laughter and love and friendship is more powerful than evil, fear, and nastiness. Good friends stick together and help each other, and also that we shouldn't be scared of things simply because they are unknown to us. I think there is a subtle race/ethnicity lesson here too. The monsters are afraid of the humans... they say they are bad, evil, and can bring death and disaster. The monster leaders have made sure that all monsters know not to touch humans, because they are just BAD. But when one human child gets into the heart of a popular and well known monster, and the monster lives and is not hurt in anyway for caring for and touching and being friends with this human, the rest of the monster world learns a valuable lesson in that humans are bad just because they are human, and that a child's laughter is the most powerful force there is!

"Hilarious, Smart, and Heartwarming","It has a creative plot of monsters scaring children so that they can power their city and how they work in an office environment. The characters, animation, and said plot are great. My favorite characters are Mike, Sulley, Celia, and Boo. The humor is hilarious, the title sequence looks neat, Billy and John are great together, Boo is cute, the plot twist where Waternoose was the one behind Randall's schemes was really surprising, and the music by Randy Newman was excellent!There are some emotional scenes, like when Sulley scares Boo, and when they have to part ways. I know Randall is a funny villain and all, but he is a jerk in my opinion. Anyway, the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" was amazing, and there's more to laughs than scariness, which makes this a really fun movie.

an entertaining film for children of all ages,"Monsters, Inc. is the type of film Disney used to make.  Sure the computer animation is new, but the old Disney formula is the same here.  Great animation, lovable characters, a simple plot, and slapstick humor are what made Disney films like 101 Dalmations, Dumbo, Pinnochio, etc. all great childrens films.  Monsters, Inc, however has done what these films could not do by extending its audience beyond your standard 3-11 year old.The creators of Monsters, Inc. have paid enormous attention to detail in their work such that jokes like an ooze-generating monster mopping a floor, or an abominable snowman serving yellow snow cones (No, its lemon!) will entertain adults who normally don't find animation very interesting.It is fortunate that Disney (Pixar in this case) has chosen to veer away from the formula that made its animated cartoons go ""over the top"" in the past.  Yes, I mean the singing!  The music chosen for this film goes over well and does not steal the show from the principal actors (Billy Crystal and John Goodman) and features a duet from the two at the closing credits (Oscar nominated song ""If I didn't have you"".Crystal works well as the scare ""coach"" Mike Grebalski (spelling?).  Disney could have chosen ""over the top comedian Robin Williams for this part but wisely chose Billy Crystal whose comedy was light hearted and fun.  Goodman gave a stellar performance as scare legend ""Sully"", the scarer who falls in love with a little child.While there were some plot holes (how did Mike get back from the snow world?), I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone, especially to those with children.Buy Rating (0 = burn all copies of this  1 = good for USA network on Saturday night  2 = wait to come out on cable, network TV  3 = worth a rent 4 = buy it cheap on VHS  5 = buy it on DVD5 of 5 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

pixar has done it again!,"another animated masterpiece by pixar! i actually saw this movie recently when it was shown on the Disney channel, but this was the only time i saw it. unfortunately, i didn't get to see it when it was out in theaters. pixar has made several excellent animated films and monsters inc is surely not an exception. monster inc. is set in the ever famous scream factory where monsters access doors that lead into the rooms of little children in order to scare them while they are sleeping. the screams that result from these children is the energy that makes light bulbs glow and cars drive in the world in which the monster's live. however, trouble and madness ensues when Sulley, the number one frightener, accidentally lets a human child into the monster world. ironically, the monsters are extremely terrified of these kids that they scare routinely because of the belief that all of them are poisonous and carry loads of diseases. However, Sulley and his fellow monster friend, Mike, discover that Boo (the name which they had given to the child) is really very harmless. throughout the movie, sulley and mike attempt to keep boo hidden until tehy can get her back into her door and asleep in her room. however, this is not as easy as they might think!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Stunning, touching, funny.","Pixar have outdone themselves once again.  Everyone else is an also-ran.  I saw ""Shrek"" for the first time this afternoon on video.  Then I went and bought a ticket to ""Monsters Inc."".  First, this is the second in a disturbing series of coincidences where Pacific Data Images / Dreamworks SKG is first to market with a similar theme to Whatever-Pixar-Has-Announced.  It happened with Antz / Bug's Life and now it seems with Shrek / Monsters.  While not plagiarism, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising that the same theme (hero bugs and misunderstood monsters) ends up in both studios.  PDI/SKG's screens are crowded and rich, but can't hold a candle to Pixar animation - and their storytelling falls far short as well.  Originality?  To take a William Steig book and then completely remove any trace of the author's celebrated illustration style is disturbing.  And as for the characters, they all seem, like the ants in Antz, to be made of the same basic animation model, stretched and colored to turn them into the needed creature.  It's the cheap way out, and it shows. Pixar's animation techniques are visually stunning - see this in a theatre - don't wait for video/DVD - the fur on Sully alone is worth the price of admission.  Shrek had its moments - but that was the point - moments - but not a film that hangs together - gags, funny voices (you listen to ""Donkey"" it's because it's funny to hear Eddie Murphy in a home-boy dialect as a donkey, not because of the riveting dialogue).  The acid test?  I'm, far too old to be moved by a kid's movie - and I was, as with even some of Pixar's shorts - near tears near the end.  I wouldn't rent Shrek again - there's really nothing to go back to look at - but as usual, I'll likely go pay to see Monsters again... how can a character with one eye emote  more than most with two?  Bravo Pixar!  Memo to PDI/SKG - you don't go down in history for cutting corners & me-too.  Try again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great animation,"In a world full of monsters of all kinds, where all the power came from children's screams, a select few had the job of going into the human world to scare the little ones. Everything seems as normal as it can be for that place, until one day, a human child enters the monster world and is hidden by the two protagonists who don't actually know how to get rid of her fast enough before the authorities catches them all.It's a one of a kind story which presents the adventures of two monsters who worked at the power factory and unwillingly get a human child at their feet. Being seen as toxic for the monster world, the child must be sent back to her world as soon as possible before the two get into trouble. Thus a cavalcade of funny and suspenseful action sequences emerge in their desperate attempt to make things right. As you might expect, not everything goes according to plan as they're about to find out a big scheme which might put their lives into peril.As said before, it's full of action, thrill, emotion and comedy, managing to keep the bar raised throughout the movie. It looks great, it has a very good plot, it's very entertaining, so you'll definitely have a very good time watching it. It is also pretty unpredictable, thus being able to provide a satisfying finale. Everything is good and very good about it, but also not extraordinary, so it receives a big thumbs up and a great recommendation from my side.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Delightful fun by Peter Doctor,"Toy Story was one of Pixar's greatest films. It was very enjoyable, though not as funny as the other Pixar movies, it was better. Toy Story was written by a man named Peter Doctor. After Toy Story 2, what do you think that Peter could come up with next? Monsters Incorperated, was the next great film to come from the script of Peter Doctor and the studio of Pixar. Though Toy Story mas have been hard to even come close to, Monsters Inc may be even better than Toy Story, which most other Pixar films can't top. This is truly one of the best Pixar films I have seen.With funny characters, a unique storyline and a unique setting along with clever jokes and laughs added into the mix, I believe that Monsters Inc. is one the best by Pixar.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Funny and inventive, it delivers the Pixar mark","I've been wanting to review this movie for some time now, and that is because Monsters Inc. is already a beloved classic from the company that makes us dream like no other. With this movie it's no different. We are introduced to a world that is inhabited by monsters who are just trying to live their normal lives in a happy society. Our main characters are Mike and Sully, two creatures that work at Monsters Inc. , whose goal is to power the city with children's screams. When a little girl crosses the threshold of both worlds, trouble will arise as friendships and the overall faith of Monstropolis (the city's name) will be on the line. Providing a perfect mixture of comedy and warmth, this movie delivers an entertaining ride that will leave you laughing out loud, as well as invested in the emotional trials the characters goes through.

excellent!!,"In my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger! Although the movie is full of clever humor, this is not its strong point against others like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Shrek 2"": It's the story, the sweetness and the relation between the baby and the good monster that makes it an excellent film, not only for children!

The world of Monstropolis was so cool to see, with so many unique monster designs and fun characters. The plot of the whole ""energy crisis! Let's kidnap children to make a real profit"" mixed in with Mike & Sulley's adventure with Boo worked well together to bring the resolution of using Laughter instead of Screams for energy.

The gags, while mostly for kids hold there own in the adult world, not as tightly as SHREK did, but it works. The sappiness of the movie is drained out by the pure charm of it. Every time I hear PIXAR is making a movie I get as excited as a Star Wars fan about EPISODE II (in which teaser trailer shows up here). While it probably won't turn as many heads as TOY STORY 2 and SHREK, it will be noticed. PIXAR is by far the MOST imaginative studio out there, they cover EVER corner of what would seem to be a CARTOON to make it it's own world! It was almost as if the writers had went into a closet that was left opened by a monster and explored their world and got to know every little crack and stain about the place, then came back here and made a movie about it.

If it is appropriate to use such terms, the restyled version of the cartoon looks modern thanks to 3D and, for sure, some other tricks. But in the case of Pixar, it's probably not that that's valuable, but the mental attitude and impressions that come out in the end.

Monster Inc.,"In the aftermath of my lukewarm review of The Incredibles, someone asked me what I would consider the great PIXAR film. I didn't want to give an immediate response without revisiting all the titles I had loved the first time round, before my critical faculties had developed to their current level. But until such a point in time, Monsters, Inc. is a very good candidate, being a truly great children's film with all the hallmarks of what makes PIXAR great.All the best PIXAR films have a simple but engaging premise, from which an entire world can be constructed. With Toy Story 1 & 2, it was that your toys are alive and will miss you when you're not there. What could just be a gimmick was expanded out into a fascinating, complex and heart-warming story about childhood, jealousy, rejection and the fear of being abandoned. PIXAR have always been very good storytellers, laying the proper foundations of a world in which memorable characters can flourish.With Monsters, Inc., the premise is equally straightforward: there are monsters in your wardrobe (closet if you will), but they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they rely on you to function. From this idea is built up the entire system of the factory for harnessing children's screams, the means by which monsters can travel to our world, the hierarchies within the workplace, and the central comic conceit of a child who escapes into the monster world and isn't afraid of Sully or Mike.Even in this set-up, Monsters, Inc. presents itself as a really great twist on monster stories, giving insight into the nature and purpose of monsters in our childhood and culture. It's a film about children learning to grow up and face their fears: either the monsters simply cease to be scary (as happens early on, when a door is shredded), or the children end up actively laughing at them, which the monsters eventually embrace. The discovery later in the film that laughter is more powerful than scares reinforces this message about standing up to your fears and overcoming them. It also ties in with one of PIXAR's overarching themes, namely coming to terms with the people we love growing up.There is also a neat little role reversal in the film regarding the choice of monsters. The employees at Monsters, Inc. are assigned to a specific child to extract the most possible scares out of a given subject. Rather than the children creating the monsters, as manifestations of their fears and uncertainties, the monsters are tailored for them in the hope that their fears might manifest themselves. This approach within the fictional universe is complimentary with PIXAR's notions of creativity: their films have broad appeal but they are built around emotions and feelings that children will respond to, rather than asking them to respond to something they know nothing about.On an entirely different level, Monsters, Inc. is also a film about good business practices. The prosperity of the company is directly in proportion to the quality of life enjoyed by its employees. At the start of the film, everyone is working flat out to avert an energy crisis and the management keep complaining when anyone falls short. They even resort to underhand tactics to achieve their goal, rather than thinking the problem through with their employees at the heart. In contrast, Sully's management decisions, from the new energy source to the brighter colours in the workplace, make dealing with the daily grind a lot more fun.There are a lot of wonderful touches to the visual world of Monsters, Inc. which reinforce the business angle to it. Mike and Sully's world has a lot of blue-collar qualities, from the helmets to the metal lunchboxes, but unlike The Incredibles, it doesn't feel like these adult characteristics are being forced upon a younger audience. The paperwork conversations are structured much better and take up less time than the insurance conversations in Brad Bird's film: not only are they shorter but they are not an integral part of the story. We get a sense of how Monsters, Inc. works as a company without Pete Docter having to labour over details at the expense of his characters.While Docter needn't labour in his storytelling, there are a number of nice references to monster movies buried in Monsters, Inc., reinforcing our impression of PIXAR as a thorough team who are passionate and well-researched. The restaurant at which Mike and Celia eat is called Harryhausen's, after Ray Harryhausen, the great stop-motion animator and special effects pioneer. Celia's hair is reminiscent of the Gorgons in the Greek Myths, in which Harryhausen dabbled at the peak of his career. There are also several little nods to other PIXAR works in Sully's last scene with Boo: she hands him a Jesse doll from Toy Story 2, the ball from the PIXAR logo and a clown fish (Finding Nemo was in production at this time).Even if you don't pick up on all the film's deeper themes or references to other works, Monsters, Inc. is still a great piece of storytelling and a really funny family comedy. While Mike and Sully haven't become quite as indelible as Woody and Buzz, they still make a great double act with believable characterisations and great physicality. John Goodman's lugubrious delivery is beautifully balanced out by Billy Crystal's fast-paced dialogue, and unlike many Dreamworks productions it feels like the famous faces are playing characters rather than just letting loose with their own distinctive shtick.Alongside the main pairing, there are a number of really good performances in the supporting cast. Jennifer Tilly is very good as Celia, her gravelly voice capturing the harsher side of the character while being suitably smitten with her """"googly bear"""". Steve Buscemi is well-cast as the villainous Randall, with the role playing to the same slippery, scheming quality that he brought to Fargo or Reservoir Dogs. James Coburn, in his final performance, balances the mentor-like role he has to Sully with all the ruthlessness and frustration surrounding his position. Best of all, however, is Mary Gibbs, who is simply adorable as Boo. Gibbs was only two-and-a-half she was cast, and was so restless that the recording staff had to follow her around with a microphone.Most of the humour in Monsters, Inc. is visual, but it's superbly timed and really quite inventive. The scenes involving the CDA are wonderfully over-the-top, parodying any number of scenes in thrillers where a SWAT team must invade a building and remove a threat. Many of the best gags are throwaways, like the jelly-like monster slipping through the grating in the street, or Randall's multiple colour-changes when Boo is bashing him over the head. There's also some good dry humour between Roz and Mike regarding his paperwork, and when Crystal is required to improvise, it's a lot funnier than his stuff in The Princess Bride.While Monsters, Inc. isn't primarily an action film, it does have several good set-pieces which will keep children entertained. The door chase sequence is to some extent a one-upping of the luggage chase at the end of Toy Story 2, but it's still executed in a very neat way with good editing. Similarly the scenes with the Abominable Snowman (voiced by Toy Story alumnus John Ratzenberger) results in a decent slice of action with a solid punchline. Neither of these scenes are particularly ground-breaking, but they do punctuate the slower, sadder moments.Monsters, Inc. is also noteworthy for the visual leaps it made, for CG animation in general and for PIXAR'S aesthetic in particular. The film utilised a new animation programme called Fitz to accurately produce the appearance and movements of Sully's hair, including the correct amounts of shadowing on different parts of his fur. Without these innovations, Docter's subsequent film Up would not have looked half as inviting. Ironically, the title sequence feels like a product of 1960s Disney, being reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians in both its pacing and design.Monsters, Inc. is a great and funny family comedy which still holds up really well after both 12 years and its recent prequel. While its technical innovations can be marvelled at in hindsight, its real achievements lie in its beautifully crafted story, great characters, memorable performances and the nuanced ideas that these raise together. While it's not quite up to the high standard of Toy Story 2 or Finding Nemo, it remains one of PIXAR's finest achievements.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Wonderful movie, Another triumph for Pixar","Well, I thought that Shrek was going to run away with the best animated movie title for 2001, but those magical computers over at Pixar has delivered another great movie. It has the fun fantasy aspect of Shrek without sacrificing it's originality for a barrage of pop-culture references or it's good family values for gross and crude jokes.Monsters Inc creates a whole new world that somewhat parallels out own world, only the inhabitants are a variety of monsters, most of which work at Monsters Inc., a factory that collects screams, the source of power for Monsterland (or whatever it's called). The greatest scarer is Sully, a fairly cuddly furry blue monster, who rooms with his little round green friend, Mike Wakowski. But the world is turned upside down when a little 3-year-old, Boo, invades monster land.Everything is so imaginative in this movie. Even with just an eye, an eyebrow and a mouth, Mike's character is so expressive and fun. His girlfriend, Celia, who has medusa hair has snakes that share the same emotion as Celia. But as great as the character design is, it's the heart of the characters like Sully, Mike and Boo that make this movie such a great family flick. Best of all, both kids and adults can enjoy it. Kids will love the colorful characters and the action scenes, adults with love the references and the creative aspects of this movie.A 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

""Sulley"" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and his small, green, one-eyed assistant and best friend, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), are the factory's top employees. But there's a problem; an energy crisis has risen in Monstropolis, because human kids aren't as easily scared as they used to be. And to make matters worse, the monster world believes that human kids are toxic, and when Sulley inadvertently lets a playful toddler girl that he names Boo (Mary Gibbs) into the factory, and she makes herself publicly seen at a sushi restaurant, it's up to Sulley and Mike to return her home before their scream collection rival, chameleon-like Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), gets his hands on her for his evil plot.The animation in this movie is really good. All the monsters in this movie are appealingly designed, and really more loveable-looking than scary. Sulley and Mike, especially! Sort of in the same vibe as the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, and Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In addition, all the characters move with the utmost fluidity and smoothness. Although, of course, the skin texture rendering definitely hasn't aged very well, especially on Boo, though she still looks cute anyway. Also the set-pieces are really inspired and eye-catching. Just about every building and vehicle in the monster world has an interesting shape, as well as spikes, like monster horns! It still looks great today.And also, the characters are terrific, and well-written. Sulley is huge and intimidating, yes, but he means well, and he's a gentle giant. Mike is exactly how you write a jerk with a heart of gold. His pride sometimes gets the better of him, and he acts rude towards Sulley when he gets attached to Boo, but he does still deeply care about Sulley, and gradually warms up to Boo. He's also charming. Randall is a great villain. Even his assistant, Jeff Fungus (Frank Oz), has some depth to him, in that he's much more polite and friendly, and only goes along with his boss's scheme out of intimidation.Also, the voice-acting is marvelous. John Goodman is very warm, laid-back and loveable as Sulley, and this was actually the very first movie I ever saw and/or heard him in. By the way, this is exactly the approach he was going for and failed miserably at when he voiced Frosty in Frosty Returns 9 years before (though, as I said in my review for that special, that was the result of the bad material he was working off of, possibly coupled with poor direction), but here, he NAILS it! Billy Crystal is hilariously feisty as Mike, and even gives him a pretty good New York accent. Steve Buscemi is perfect as Randall. His nasally, smarmy voice really accentuates Randall's snide, smug nature. Frank Oz is terrific as Fungus. James Coburn (may he rest in peace) is very refined as M. I. CEO Henry J. Waternoose, and does a great job subtly bringing out his unscrupulous ambitions. Everybody else is perfectly cast in their roles as well.But the thing that really makes this movie is the witty turns in its script. The movie is packed with really clever and on-point humor, especially the ""2319"" incident involving scarer George Sanderson, Sulley's initial reactions when he first meets Boo, and we musn't forget the incident at the sushi restaurant. There's even clever little cutaway gags, such as when a fire-breathing monster accidentally sneezes and burns his newspaper to a crisp: ""Aww, nuts!"" HAHA! And wait till you see the outtakes! But in addition, the movie is also pretty touching, such as when Sulley needs to send Boo home.And then, of course, the music! Randy Newman, also the genius who gave us the music for Toy Story, composed a very bouncy and jazzy score for this movie. It really helps to enhance the comedic moments, the tense moments, and the heartwarming moments. And of course, he wrote one super catchy song about friendship, ""If I Didn't Have You"", which gives both John Goodman and Billy Crystal the golden opportunity to get their singing chops in, and boy, do they both deliver!Everything considered, Monsters, Inc., while not the #1 best Pixar movie, is definitely one of their best! It's a terrifically animated, witty, charming and lovable movie, and any Pixar fan would be proud to have seen it even once! Therefore, I can't recommend it enough!!!!!And one more thing...

"Better Than ""Shrek""","A lot of reviewers have been comparing this movie to this year's earlier digitally animated ""Shrek"". If they're not using that movie as the yard stick, then they're comparing it to previous Pixar efforts ""Toy Story 1 & 2"" and ""A Bug's Life"".Personally, I think ""Monsters, Inc."" is beyond compare and is a strong enough movie to stand on it's own 5 legs.I enjoyed this movie WAY more than ""Shrek"". ""Monsters, Inc."" has characters you care about and it's loaded to the hilt with great jokes for both kids and adults. Although ""Shrek"" was a good film, I walked away from it feeling like it was trying to be all things to all people and it didn't satisfy as thouroughly as this film.""Monsters, Inc."" knows it's audience and respects them with it's clever premise - monsters live in another universe powered by the ""Scream Energy"" they collect from hopping out of kids closets and scaring the bejesus out of them. But in the end, we learn a laugh is more powerful than a scream. Great lesson and very inventive!All of the characters that inhabit Monstropolis come in a great variety of shapes, colors and personalities. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun creating them. The voice over work of Billy Crystal and John Goodman was spot-on. They have excellent chemistry and are a treat to listen to.The action elements of the film are not to be missed. The last 30 minutes are filled with an exciting chase set within jaw-dropping surroundings. The final moment is a wonderful, touching moment that plays magnificently with the special relationship Goodman's big, blue Sully has with the 3 year old girl ""Boo"" who he has taken under her wing.""Monsters, Inc."" is a very effective movie for fans on all levels.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me.,"From the team that brought you Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., one of the most creative Pixar films throughout the years. Of course me and my friends watched it and quoted from it, it's just so much fun. I have no idea what my favourite character in the film is. I was actually thinking about the two major characters Sulley and Mike but to me I like Sulley. He's the one who found the child named Boo in the monster world and be friends with her. Mike Wazowski is funny too. Those two are voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. I remember the video game of it called Monsters, Inc. Scare Island and I absolutely loved it. I actually do love the soundtrack of it as well and it has great graphics. Just to clarify, I think the game is actually a prequel game to Monsters, Inc. And if you think Monsters University is a prequel to Monsters, Inc., think again. After the stories of Monsters University, Mike and Sulley try to get a job at Monsters, Inc. By going to Scare Island in order to train to become top scarers to scare children. And after that happened, the actual movie happened. In the movie the two monsters Sulley and Mike are top scarers in the Monsters, Inc. Factory and if a human is in the monster world they can get toxic on them which includes clothes and touch. I think the film is re-released in 3-D in 2012 after The Lion King in 2011. I think Beauty and the Beast did that too. I think they did that just so they can get the general audience loving it again. What can I say about the animation? Well, technically I don't. Because everything here is just absolutely spectacular. I know I said that in all animated films I reviewed but this one is so colourful. It has some creative colourful characters and when I say creative, I mean, the colours on the monsters are beautifully made and unbelievably crafted. There's also bloopers in the end credits much like A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2. I even liked the blooper which Mike and Sulley did is ""Put that thing back where it came from or so help me."" One in the film and two in the end credits.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A Must See, the best movie I've seen in years","Great for kids, from 2 to 99.   Excellent story line, and Billy Crystal and John Goodman are great voices for Mike and Sully.  Lots of adult humor.

Excellent!,"Disney and Pixar have done it again. It seems that every time these two companies pair up to make a film, it's a blockbuster, and this is no exception. A wonderfully animated film with a highly creative storyline. This movie gives us a glimpse into the monster world in a way that nobody else could accomplish. The animators have given each monster its own personality, and the detail is amazing. How else do you describe the way the writers came up with all the details of the Monsters, Inc. company? This movie is so wonderful because it's not trying to scare kids like so many other monster movies. Although there are a couple of scary moments, this movie is gentle enough for even the youngest children to watch. This movie is by far the best one that the Pixar team has created. The wonderful sound effects, graphics and fun storyline, combined with the cleverly disguised jokes make this a film for the entire family. I saw it twice in the theaters and once at a ""free-movie-in-a-local-park"" type setting, and now I have the DVD. This movie is excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The 'Monsters' at Pixar Scare Up a Laugh!,"In the extra-dimensional city of Monstropolis, the power grid runs on the screams of human children, caused and captured by the (otherwise perfectly friendly) monsters who creep through their closets every night. The motto at Monsters Inc. is simple and endearing –""We scare because we care"". Sulley (perfectly voiced by John Goodman) is a large monster who is able to scare children by walking into their bedroom late at night and exposing his vicious teeth and frightening scream. The perfect comic foil to Sulley, Mike (Billy Crystal, spot-on) is the guy who keeps his pal in tip top scaring shape - ordering up the closet doors that the monsters go through to frighten children, whose screams are bottled and converted to the energy that keeps the monsters' world, and Monsters, Inc., going.As the story in 'Monsters Inc.' continues, a tiny tot nicknamed Boo refuses to be scared and sneaks through the portal into the world of the monsters. Ironically, the burbling, giggling, ""Kitty"" shrieking tyke scares the dickens out of monsters, as much as our amiable monsters scare little kids. It is now left up to expert ""scarer"" Sully and his one-eyed pal Mike to put Boo back where she belongs and restore order to the universe before the Child Detection Agency can get wind of their mistake.Like every Pixar film, 'Monsters Inc.' is crammed with intricate and subtle details, but the tortuous storyline is laid out so flawlessly that even broods have no problem keeping up. The admirable oddness of its plot — affable creatures harvest children's screams via an inter-dimensional network of cupboards — may now be softened by familiarity, yet it remains as fresh as ever. Laughs are earned throughout this heart-warming story that never engages in the potty humor that so often undercuts these films - the interplay between Sully and Mike results in jokes which feel wholly unexpected and off-the-cuff. But it's in the visuals that 'Monsters Inc.' really comes to life, from the decor each child has on his closet door to the vast variations of monsters on the job on the ""scare floor"" – blobs, giant spiders, lizards, snakes and goblins right up to the dizzying finale, set in a seemingly infinite warehouse of doors, each of which opens on a different bedroom in a different part of the world.Successfully combining intimacy with a sprawling alt-universe world, marrying a gentle character comedy to a slam-bang chase finish - this is exactly what Pixar is so celebrated for. While successfully marrying all of this to jaw-dropping technology, the monsters at Pixar scare up a laugh!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Awesome!,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, you don't know what you're missing out on! It has humor that isn't hard to understand, therefore anyone can watch it and still have a laugh.

I was delighted to see that the second viewing was just as fun if not more.  I caught little subtle funnies that I missed the first time and laughed just as much at those I remembered.  The current release includes out-takes with the ""cast""  which are hilarious.

Boogeymen with a Conscience,"In the workaday world of monsters, Monsters, Inc. is the prime power provider.  The workers at the company get the energy by emerging from kids' closets and scaring the beejeezus out of them. The subsequent screams are then bottled and used to power Monstropolis.The company's top scarer is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman). His sidekick/best friend is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Here's how it works. Doors from kids' rooms appear from a giant warehouse in the company's behemoth building. The scarer opens the door and steps into the kid's bedroom and scares the heck out of the little tyke. As the screams come, they fill up empty canisters, the kind in which one might find helium for balloons, which the sidekick keeps at the ready. Then the monster steps out, the leaderboard reflects the changes (they're very competitive there, you know), and another door is procured. The sidekick takes care of all of the paperwork. But kids aren't getting scared the way they used to, and there's a power shortage afoot.There's one huge rule, though. Never come in contact with one of the kids, or any of the stuff from their rooms. The kids are toxic and will kill you on contact. (At one point, a particularly gruesome monster comes out of the room with a tiny sock velcroed to his fur; an emergency is declared, and a crack Kid Detection team races in to decontaminate the scene - and the monster, who gets quite a nasty shave. It's all innocuous enough, but it's also reflective of current events, although the movie was certainly written a while ago.)One evening, Sulley offers to do the paperwork so Mike can go on a date with his beloved Celia (Jennifer Tilly). There aren't supposed to be any doors left on the floor after hours, but there one is, and Sulley's just inquisitive enough to open it. Whoops! A kid comes out. Hilarity ensues. Sulley races to get Mike, and they both panic. I mean, think of it! A KID, there in Monstropolis! They fear for their lives! And of course all the while the kid, whom Sulley names Boo, is being a cute, adorable, curious little rugrat.This film was done by the Pixar people, the same nice folks who brought Toy Story and A Bug's Life to you. The animation is wonderful, although I'm not sure it's quite on par with Toy Story as far as the monsters go. The animation of the little girl, however, is fabulous. The animators must have kids of their own, because every nuance I can think of that a little kid would have was captured beautifully in this movie.The actors providing the voices are a lot of fun, too. Whoever cast John Goodman and Billy Crystal is probably suffering from a dislocated shoulder from patting themselves on the back so much. The two stars have great chemistry, bordering on Laurel and Hardy-ish.This is a bellyacher of a film, although admittedly it's not one that the intellectual snob would particularly enjoy. While the audience is the teeter-totter set, there is no overabundance of flatulence jokes - in fact, there aren't any. This is good clean (literally) fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!,"What a great family movie.

I can hardly wait to see this movie again and I will see it again while it is still in theaters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rewatchable Pixar classic.,"I fell in love with Monster,Inc. the first time I saw it as a kid. It was the movie I got most excited for to watch, fast forward eleven years and I still get excited for it. This monster world is so different from what we know yet so interesting and fun. Their source of power comes from the screams of children which seems so very strange but in the context of this film, makes perfect sense. I am never forced to accept anything the film throws at me, I choose to accept them because they make sense.Another important reason for why I love Monsters, Inc. is the characters. James P. Sullivan is our protagonist. He is very good at his job, known to many as the top Scarer in Monstropolis. Throughout this film, Sullivan's perspective on everything changes while his caring and comforting character grows stronger. His best friend and roommate, Mike Wazowski, is a funny and smart character who sometimes fails to see the obvious. He is full of energy and charisma, making it impossible for me to dislike him.Apart from the characters and the beautiful chemistry they share, the story is very well written and enjoyable. It had some hilarious laugh out loud moments, but also some very sad ones. The 3-D is okay, but seems non-existent at times. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet must do so, and those who have should go back and revisit it. It's the well written story, the colorful characters and the heart this film carries that makes it such a timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Underestimated piece of contemporary philosophy,"Behind the highly overrated clean animation characters with big eyes and clumsy looks that those big babol chewing Disney CEOs keep promoting, lies silent a very stimulating concept: that logically when there's something unknown to ""face"", we get way more energy from trying to making it better, than from avoiding it following the instincts that are pushed by our own fear. The wisdom of the screenplay is right in front of the viewer, but hidden by the colored masks of the funny and clumsy monster drawings. This movie helps people being less afraid of whatever they're afraid of, and - for how ordinary it might seem - this is one of the greatest purposes one artist can decide to chase.

Plus we get to here that distinctive voice of John `Cliff' Ratzenberger as the Yeti in one of the funniest scenes of the movie.

"Monster, inc.","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in 'Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great 'Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic. I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in 'Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets. It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel 'Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning. For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature 'For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.The short trailer for 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.'Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The monsters children see in their closets and undertheir beds are real, but they are more scared of the children thanthe children are of them.

These gentle critters -- theproduct of animator's wild imaginations -- are harvesting energyfrom human children's screams. The plot turns around the suddenappearance of Boo, a small human child, who accidentally findsher way through the closet into Monstropolis.

My favourite comedy,"You've just got to see this film. It will have you bouncing up and down with laughter no matter what age you are.

""Monsters, inc."" has great jokes and great lines (Randall (the bad monster): Where's the kid you creatin; Mike: First of all it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me you might as well do it properly). This film also has a great score written by the fabulous musician Randy Newman, and the film's song ""Wouldn't Have Nothing If I Didn't Have You"" won a well deserved Oscar. Hang around for the credits, there are some of the funniest outtakes that you will ever see in your entire life-time. But one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is really unbelievably sweet without being sickly so. Most Disney films are full of sloppy over-sentimentality but this film isn't which shows how little an influence Disney has on Pixar studios. If you want to buy this film on DVD, I strongly suggest that you get the special edition which is made up of two DVDs. It has tons of special features and watching them you will find out that the crew that made this film are really adorable people. If you are feeling miserable, this film will almost surely cheer you up. It is smart without being vulgar which I find very good; people of all ages can watch this film. Films as good as this are very rare so just see it! I drink to the health and long life of Pixar animation studios and the crew behind this film which is undeniably a comedy Classic like ""Some Like It Hot"".

The humor was directed equally to children and adults, and the adult humor (and drama) was subtle enough to pass by a child without phasing him or her.

Kids would enjoy the simple lower-level plotline without having to understand the more detailed, suggestive plot that is diverse enough to entertain their parents.  My family enjoyed this movie.

One of Pixar's best,"It's hard to say that anything that comes out of the studios of Disney/Pixar is anything short of genius. In my opinion, the studio has been on a winning streak since their first feature film, Toy Story (1995). Every single one of their films is unforgettable, and Monsters, Inc. shines just as much if not more than some of its partners. Much like Toy Story expanded on the childhood fantasy of toys that talk while you're not looking, Monsters, Inc. expands on a darker fantasy, and that is the infamous fear of the monster in the closet. It's a notion that every child has had once at least once in their lifetime, making this film instantly relateable.Monsters, Inc. is set in the city of Monstropolis, a thriving metropolis inhabited by monsters that come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. The city is powered by screams, and the scariest monsters are in charge of collecting these screams from children in the human world. The protagonists of the film are Sully, the top scarer in the business, and his friend/co-worker Mike Wazowski. The two are a powerhouse duo and Sully is revered for his ability to scare children so well. But problems arise when he accidentally brings a child back from the human world. The story unfolds into something amazingly exciting, clever, and also very heartwarming.Disney/Pixar are renowned for their humorous and cleverly constructed worlds their films are set in, and each of their films always has a great opening sequence to introduce us to these worlds. Monsters, Inc. is one of the best of their openers I think I've ever seen. Every aspect of the city of Monstropolis is a hilarious and yet tasteful pun. There are so many witty things that you can get anything from a good chuckle to a hearty belly laugh out of. Every single aspect of this setting stays true to the theme of this film and there are so many little things to pick up on. You'll always be watching for the next clever joke to be placed in the most unlikely places. Every pun and every joke in this film is very funny, but not over exaggerated, and none of it is hammed up with goofy dialouge or cheesy music. Everything is done with a lot of respect and a lot of wit. It is just what humor needs to be. Sure the occasional fart joke or potty humor is alright, but it can ruin a film if it's too excessive. Thankfully, Monsters, Inc. always knows what levels to take itself to and it never goes overboard.Even after a brilliant opening sequence the film continues to get better with its great story and vibrant cast of characters. Disney/Pixar always manages to pick up some of the most unique talents to do the voice work in their films and they always get the best vocal performances out of these talents. Billy Crystal and John Goodman work amazingly well as a comedic duo. They are perfectly and eccentrically characterized. Billy Crystal in all his nasally hilarity is the zany and bizarre little guy, while John Goodman is the slightly more intelligent straight man, who is much better at keeping his cool. The two characters work together incredibly well, and their routine never gets old. Then there are other amazing talents such as Steve Buscemi, who is perfectly cast as the villain of the film, Randall. He is an odd salamander like monster, so who better to cast that Buscemi, right? No offense of course, I love the guy and everything he does. Of course I was anxiously awaiting Sully to tell Randall that he was out of his element, but unfortunately that never happened. Other stars like James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly show up for some great roles, and of course John Ratzenberger shows up for a scene as the Abominable Snowman. For those who don't know, John Ratzenberger has appeared in every single Disney/Pixar film to date.Disney/Pixar is so consistently great but Monsters, Inc. really stands out as one of their most clever and extraordinarily well made films. The world of Monstropolis is put together so well and it all operates perfectly, with so much attention to detail and an incredible amount of thought put into each and every aspect. The story is a lot of fun and can even bring a tear to the eye, especially when it is voiced by such a fantastic collaboration of actors. I will say that the ending is very kiddy and everything works out a little too perfect for all the characters, but hey, it is a kids film so could you expect anything less. Monsters, Inc. is a fantastic Disney/Pixar adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I never expected that the movie would have touched a very soft spot in me.,"The feeling I got after I left the movie theater far exceeded my expectations of the movie in general. This is a classical depiction of good and evil in the usual choice between violence and kindness. The turn of events were unpredictable and have kept my attention on what would be the next unexpected thing. To sum up things, I would conclude that it is a combination of comedy and poignancy. I immensely enjoyed the movie together with my sweetheart and another lady companion. In addition to what I have previously said, the efforts for kindness are far lesser and the rewards so far greater as conveyed by this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The Movie Shrek Tried to Be,"Whereas Shrek was wholly derivative and unoriginal, Monsters, Inc. is fresh and new.  I was incredibly disappointed with Shrek when I saw it--the jokes were almost universally predictable and stale (not to mention that every potentially funny joke was in the TV commercials).

Monsters Inc is a beautifully crafted movie thats fun and hilarious for everyone!,"A Colorful Feel Good MovieFrom its creative take on the child imagination of monsters in the closet to its advanced animations, directors Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich, and David Silverman outdid other Pixar films like Toy Story, A Bugs Life or Brave. If you've watched 2012's recent movie release of Monsters University then you have to see what's still considered one of today's most hilarious motion pictures, 2001's Disney production Monsters Inc.!Scream Heat corporations top scarer's and best friends Mike Wazowski ( Billly Crystal) and James p. Sullivan ( John Goodman) exist in a colorful Metropolis filled with businesses, and homes powered by the extracted energy of screaming children. The lime green, M&M cyclone Mike, and blue, bear-like monster Sully, share their passion for scaring in a virtual world that can be accessed through an assembly line of doors to the bedrooms of sleeping children. Among other monsters the pair live to scare, but must avoid contamination that is believed to be outcome of touching a toxic child. Mike struggles with juggling work and girlfriend Cecilia, a tall purple one eyed receptionist, while Sully works to impress father like figure, and boss Henry J Waternoose at the organized scaring factory. As they work against their biggest rival, a nasty and vicious reptilian Randall Boggs to achieve the all-time scaring record, Sully accidentally leaves open a door allowing what their city considers to be the biggest threats to their lives to enter; a child. The tale kicks off when panicky Mike and Sully encounter the little girl and are faced with the challenge of returning her to her door without being contaminated or seen. This is proved difficult when Randall discovers the mistake and searches for the four year old for his own evil and selfish agenda.The movies hilarious aspects are displayed throughout the individual roles of each character along their pursuit to return the trespassing infant Boo. Comedic Mike is always one step behind his best friend with funny outburst and witty comments. Randall's dark character allows the film to venture into a seriousness that keeps the audience frantic and guessing. Adorable pigtailed Boo's playful and realistic infant like curiousness makes it difficult to look away. Other characters like always contaminated George, Mike-worshipping Smitty and confused Needlemen are beautiful additions that bring general humor to the film. The plots outbursts of sly one-liners and unrestrained antics lead the film into uncharted zones of hysterical laughter.The detailed graphics presented in Monsters Inc. are brilliant! Each character brings a unique sense of physical humor. Mikes green M&M structure and one large eye is just as hilarious to look at as his voice, played by Bily Crystal, is to listen too. The fuzzy blue like bear and Scream Heat corporations top scarer James P. Sullivan is a great combination of scary and compassion. With so many monsters of different shapes, and sizes there is never a dull aspect in the movie. The entire city is yet another eye catching detail the graphic designers of Monsters Inc. so brilliantly crafted.I personally love this movie and recommend everyone take time out of their day to watch Monsters Inc.! Its dramatic twists, colorful plot and unique characters keep you guessing about what could happen next. From start to finish, the ten star Pixar animation is a hilariously touching delight! With lots of laughs and the perfect amount of mild scares this fun film is suitable for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Another Pixar masterpiece,"Pixar have earned a glowing reputation over the last two decades by creating heart warming and humorous family films, and Monsters Inc is yet another animated masterpiece.From the great adventures of Woody and Buzz in the Toy Story franchise to The superheroes in The Incredibles, Pixar have become an established company in the film animation industry and this 2001 hit about monsters is one of their best.From director Pete Docter, comes a story about Sully and Mike, two scarer's in the Monsters Inc cooperation who find their world turned upside down when a monstrous child enters their world and their lives.It's a typical family film containing amusing physical humour, none more so than Crystal's (When Harry met Sally) Mike Wazowski. Little girl Boo is a great character for the film so audiences can see the differences between the Monster world (Beautifully named Monstropolus) and the human world.These differences make the film even more humours as the monsters all fear humans, and that in itself is a catalyst.The film moves at the right pace, giving characters their own sub stories to widen the interest.It's a very sweet film, especially towards the end which many people have acclaimed to find very sad.The plot and comedy are consistent, the animation is simply super and is one of Pixar's best ever animations and therefore, a simply must watch for the whole family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Monsters University teaches zombies how to Heat the box office.,"For the second straight week, Monsters University takes home the box office winning again over World War Z.This time the winning team Disney/Pixar made $46 million in the U.S. for an impressive total $171 millions in two weeks. The Heat, with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, took second place with $40 millions in its debut week. Brad Pit and his zombie flick only could make third with $29 millions, leaving zombies wanting for more.It is a bit of a surprise that WWZ is doing so modest in the box office in spite of all the publicity and marketing. But in the other hand, maybe we can think of summer as the reason for this overturn to the Max Brook's book film version.In my visit to the theater to watch the second installment of the Monsters Inc 2001 film, the audience was almost all kids with one or two parents. This maybe made it easier for the animated film to make more money in the U.S., as long as kids are in summer break and parents are willing to sacrifice themselves for them; or shouldn't I have called it sacrifice? Pixar Studios, in my opinion, have found the formula to create stories that could entertain both kids and parents at the same time. To name some: Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and the most recent Toy Story 3. Story lines well told, impeccable animation, comedy and a lot of the Disney Magic is what makes these films so attractive to all audiences.Monsters University belongs to this category. The animation of the campus is absolutely beautiful. Screenwriters, Dan Scanlon and Daniel Gerson, recreated the before lives of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in a smart way. But the story line that for me was more relevant was the bullying that Wazowski was victim of.This is a theme that in the U.S. public opinion is being trending for the past years, so it was not difficult to feel related to easily. So for the rest of the story, I won't make more explaining in order not to spoil the movie to those who have not seen it yet. But I have to say that any person, who has had the experience to attend any classroom of any type, will enjoy this film.Also the performances of Billy Cristal (Mike) and John Goodman (Sullivan) were pleasant to the ears. It felt like it hasn't been 12 years since Monsters Inc., and more impressive is that they were portraying those characters voices in their younger spirits. Thumbs up to these good actors.By far, Monsters University belongs to the elite group of sequels (and in this case prequel) that have made a presentation that it's original and yet keep the essence of its previous one. Also, it could become one of the most successful movies for the team Disney/Pixar, even though is quite a hard task to beat the incredible $1,064,404,880 box office score of Toy Story 3 worldwide gross.Nevertheless, while we wait for that to happen, what we can say for sure is that zombies are not happy by the fact they have been beaten by two chicks in a cop flick, and by monsters that were meant to scare kids but that have been heating the numbers for two weeks in a row.Five stars to Monsters University make me say that it is mandatory for parents to take their kids to see it. And for those who enjoy the Disney magic, in this case seasoned with the Pixar originality, please don't miss this change to be entertained with a good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Monsters, inc. — A lovable animation where novel ideas keep you riveted","Monsters, inc. is one of the best animation film ever produced, only surpassed by The Incredibles.The animation itself is incredible, especially if you take into consideration the work that was done on the hairs of Sulley. The world they created is without par, extremely imaginative and full of details, and that's without mentioning the mechanics it uses to get energy, as well as the energy crisis within.Each monster is well thought, wild in design, and nicely rendered. The colors are great, vivid, and cheerful. The humor is plenty, side splitting, and almost non-stop. The jokes are great, and the dialogs complete, natural, and logical.The only negative thing I could say is that the ""evil"" part of the scenario was a little unimaginative, but fortunately, it's not the main attraction.

A Heartwarming and Hilarious Adventure for All Ages,"Monsters, Inc is a classic Pixar film that tells the story of Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal), two monsters who work at the titular energy company, where they scare children to generate power for their world. The film is a delightful adventure filled with heartwarming moments and hilarious gags that are sure to entertain audiences of all ages.One of the standout aspects of Monsters, Inc is its world-building. The film creates a vibrant and imaginative world where monsters live in a parallel universe powered by children's screams. The attention to detail in the design of the monsters, their homes, and their workplace is impressive, and it's easy to get lost in the world of the movie.The film's voice cast is also top-notch, with Goodman and Crystal bringing their A-game to their roles as Sulley and Mike, respectively. The chemistry between the two characters is undeniable, and their banter is a constant source of laughs throughout the movie. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from the likes of Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, and James Coburn.Monsters, Inc is also a film that has a lot of heart. The relationship between Sulley and Boo, a little girl who stumbles into the monster world, is touching and endearing. The film's message about the power of laughter and kindness is delivered in a way that is both heartfelt and entertaining, making it a movie that will resonate with viewers of all ages.While Monsters, Inc isn't without its flaws, particularly in terms of pacing, it's still a movie that is well worth watching.

As funny as it is furry...,"In Monstropolis kid's screams are like electricity and power the city. Monsters enter kid's closets through magic doors to harvest pure fear, only kids are becoming less susceptible and power is running low (these kids today, Oi!). A small child mistakenly enters Monstropolis and two monsters must try to help her back to her room unharmed The charm of Monsters Inc is showing big furry behemoths as nice guys just doing their job, even though by necessity some monsters must be nasty and mean.It also makes light of the very ""monster"" concept, meaning hopefully kids assume they are film characters rather than an unseen menace. Sully and Mike are also voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the best ""name"" combination of voice actors since Buzz and Woody cleared their animated throats.Funnier than most films have a right to be, and there is so much detail in every frame that you notice something new each time you watch it.What you hope kids will learn: There is no reason to be afraid of monsters.What they'll take away: Randall the slimy salamander-monster still is.

Great Movie,"Keeping in line with the other Pixar feels that came before it, Monsters Inc, is an enjoyable film for the ages. I especially liked the script. I felt the writers did a good job keeping the humor clean but giving it enough of an inside joke for older viewers to appreciate. I liked the way they ended the movie too, they left things open for a future movie. I have probably watched this one over 35 times. What about Mike's car, do you think he would get another one. I would have liked to see what kind of car they would have designed for Sully. The old lady #1 was a good role it was very believable.

The brightest minds in show business,"People can ""Shrek"" about it all they want. Here's the real deal: ""Shrek""-style cynicism and sarcasm are easy. The ability to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder and creativity is a gift. It's a gift the Pixar guys and gals are copiously endowed with. There are more clever, witty ideas in any given five minutes of any Pixar flick than there are in the entire running time of 99% of the crass Hollywood rubbish being foisted on the movie populace. It's a small miracle that these folks are able to do what they do, to say nothing of the technical advances they achieve. To those who say there's no difference between the flicks, please, watch ""Toy Story"" and its sequel. The advances in fabric motion, just to name one small aspect, are amazing, and take another step in ""Monsters.""It's the attention to detail that makes the Pixar movies so great -- detail in the nuances of how a character behaves or what his life is ""really"" like, detail in the background of scenes, even in small supporting characters. These films are a long time in the making and it's time well-spent. What a treat to be able to sit in a theater with people of all ages and backgrounds, laughing and having a great time.

More Pixar Brilliancy Beats Shrek,"2001 was supposed to be the year where Dreamworks for once would win the animation war against Disney with their great Shrek. Unfortunately for Spielberg & Co., Pixar would come to Disney's rescue again. Pixar seem absolutely infallible, and they fortify that feeling with Monsters, Inc.Monsters, Inc. is a funnier and warmer film than Shrek and, to me, that forms the most important part of a good animated film. It still doesn't quite reach the peak as Toy Story and A Bug's Life did, but the difference is slim.   The story is extremely original and well-written and is bound to keep both adults and kids pinned to their seats through the whole film. (Only one kid started crying, which must be considered acceptable casualties since the film is about monsters.) Even the ending is cut right before the last mandatory reconciliation, making it much stronger. If the story or the incredibly entertaining characters won't do it for you, the animation surely will. There are some details and scenes here never done before. This is, technically, the best achievement in CGI filmmaking so far.As a footnote, before the movie you will be fortunate enough to see Pixar's 3-minute short For the Birds, which is the funniest short film I have ever seen.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Wonderful animated film for adults and children,"""Monsters Inc."" isn't only a film that will delight kids; it's got big laughs for adults too. What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar.It's sweet and funny, with just that right sprinkle of heart and at times very thrilling too. One chase scene involving doors (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) in particular always gets me excited and I never get tired of gushing over how wonderfully original it is. It's filled with characters and moments with Mike (Billy Crystal), Sully (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs) that your heart would have to be made of stone not to enjoy it. Every time I watch this movie I catch some new gag in the background or some new detail I've overlooked in the past, meaning it's got great re-watch value as well. You'll always find something interesting to look at (though you'll have to be familiar with the story to be able to pull your eyes away from the main action).This is the kind of movie that you call a ""family"" film because anyone can watch ""Monsters, Inc."" and instantly fall in love with it. When you watch it with other people, it makes you feel like your enjoyment of the movie is bringing you all closer together. It's so great and smart and funny that you'll have a terrific time watching it over and over. (On DVD, October 27, 2012)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Boo gets only brief mentions in most reviews, and Boo toys are almost nowhere to be found.This is a great family movie; don't miss it!

Another animated film in the tradition of Toy Story that gets it right.,"Monsters, Inc. is a delightful film about two employees, Sully and Mike, who work for the Monstropolis' power plant after which the film is titled. While the film isn't as knee-slappingly funny as others in genre (for example, I didn't think it showed as much humor as Toy Story), it is certainly full of elements that will please adults and children alike. Younger children will likely not quite understand the business of Monsters, Inc. and the nature of the jobs the monsters do. My 4-year-old, for example, didn't quite grasp the whole concept of what the company Monsters, Inc. was all about. She still enjoyed the animated characters and the slapstick humor, however.One of the things that sets Monsters, Inc. apart from other such films is that its plot is a bit more involved than most. The twist at the end involving the company conspiracy (yes, the plot is that involved) is surprising even to adult viewers and part of the reason that adults will really like the film.What really makes the film work, however, is not the plot and the humor, but the main characters themselves. You can't help but like Sully and thus have a vested interest in the events that affect him. John Goodman is the perfect voice for the giant, furry monster who, while being the company's leading scarer, is also the kindest and most selfless character. Billy Crystal is hilarious as Sully's sidekick, and Steve Buscemi appropriately voices the villain Boggs. I also couldn't help but like James Coburn as the company CEO and former mentor to Sully. It's interesting to me how the appearance of the animated Waternoose actually suggests Coburn without looking a thing like him (Waternoose, after all, is a multi-eyed, multi-legged, crablike creature). And Boo? What can you say about Boo? She does all of the things that one expects a tiny child to do, and it's no wonder that Sully is unable to resist her charms. You find yourself laughing at Boo just being a little girl.Monsters, Inc. is the best films I've seen all year. It's one of the few films that I could sit back and just plain enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Plenty of laughs, plenty of fun!  :D","Aw, don't worry about getting caught watching a kids movie!  :)  Any adult can get just as much fun out of Monsters Inc. as the kids can.  I do have to admit that when i first saw this movie, it didn't quite grab me as I had expected it to.  But once it grew on me, it's become one that I can watch at any time!  The animation is amazing and the cast does an awsome job with their characters.  The little girl, Boo, is one of the most adorable characters thought up by Disney yet.  The next time you end up looking for some way to pass your time, go get this movie and watch it.  Try and get the DVD if you can.  There's a whole bunch of awsome extras too! :D",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Solid movie,"Monsters, Inc. (also known as Monsters, Incorporated) is a 2001 American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs, and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter (in his feature directorial debut), co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, and produced by Darla K. Anderson, from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson. The film centers on two monsters, the hairy James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (Goodman) and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal), who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I always knew there were monsters under my bed!,"`Monsters, Inc."" is the latest full length computer animated feature from Pixar and Disney, the team that practically launched the genre back in 1995 with ""Toy Story."" That film was inspired by one common childhood fantasy (that your toys come to life when your not looking), and this is inspired by another: that there really is a monster under the bed or in the closet. However the monsters in this movie are in fact just regular working Joes from ""Monsters, Inc."" the company that supplies power to their home world by capturing childrens screams. As soon as thats done they nip back home via the portal that exists behind every closet door in the world. The companys most successful child scarer is the huge blue and furry James P ""Sully"" Sullivan (voiced by the suitably robust but tender John Goodman), whose partner is the walking, talking, smart mouthed eyeball Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). However their lives are thrown into chaos the Sully inadvertadly brings a small girl back with him.This time round John Lassiter  Pixars head honcho, driving force and director of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bugs Life"" and ""Toy Story 2""  has taken more of a back seat role, handing the directorial reins over to a duo who have both worked on Pixars other titles. However youd hardly notice; the film has the CGI sheen and spectacular action scenes weve come to expect, along with a plethora of visual gags & in jokes (including tips of the hat to Pixars previous movies), and a razor sharp script that will once again ensure the film appeals to adults as much as kids. DreamWorks may have taken Pixars place as Hollywoods preeminent CGI filmmakers for a while last year, but as good as ""Shrek"" was, ""Monsters, Inc."" is better!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Original Pixar Film That's Sure a Classic in Computer Animation,"Monsters Inc is a classic Pixar film about the monster business of the same name. It focuses on two monsters named Mike and Sully who work at Monsters Inc. They work on scaring human kids in order to create electricity for monster kind by going through doors to the human world. One day, a human girl manages to get into the monster world. The film then focuses on how the monster world reacts to a human being there. That would help uncover some of the secrets of the business. There does seem like there's some emotional depth to it. It doesn't seem as much emotional depth as Inside Out, Coco, or Toy Story 3, but it does still seem like it's still there.It does seem to show how computer animation evolved when comparing it to the prequel Monsters University. Monsters Inc released in 2001 and does show the early 2000's computer animation and Monsters University released in 2013, which was 12 years later. 12 years was a bit of time and is enough to show an evolution in computer animation. The Incredibles has shown it with its sequel that released 14 years later.Monsters Inc is the Pixar film that seems the most fitting for the Halloween season as the characters are literal monsters. Coco is based on Day of the Dead, so it's that and not Halloween, though both holidays are around the same time. Monsters Inc could be a monster film that could help get you ready for Halloween.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Well... Of Course this is what you expect from Pixar :),"Well, I liked this movie. It's full of excitement. I love the character that John Goodman. I was scared of him when i was little. And now when i watch it i'm just saying... Why the hell was I scared of this monster? Labowski is very very annoying. He sure did a good job of making people annoyed. The baby was annoying to but very funny. This movie is very entertaining. But could've been better. I just didn't like the idea where monsters were afraid of children but they scare children... That's the part i hate about. But kids will love this movie. some babies might cry... Because of the ""scary"" monsters. But this movie is family fun! Pixar is the best! but i think this movie is a tiny bit overrated. I don't think this movie should be in the top 250 list. But... anyways...

Adorable,"I have to be honest with you.  At this point, Pixar Studios could make a movie about a guy reading a phone book and I'd go.  They seem to be the last animation studio these days that has FUN animating.  There appears to be an unwritten rule now that you have to take animation way too seriously.  God forbid you have fun making cartoons, right?Okay, end of mini-rant.  Now, while ""Monsters Inc."" isn't as downright *perfect* as the ""Toy Story"" movies, it's very close.  It's about on par with ""A Bug's Life"".  And with all that said, I have to say that this is one of the most charming and imaginative movies of the year.  The visuals are particularly amazing (the chameleonic Randall is a stunner, and check out the great lost visual gag from ""Terminator 2"" towards the climax), so expect this to become a huge cult hit on video.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great Animated Movies,"Monsters, Inc."" excels in its imaginative world-building. The visual design is vibrant and inventive, from the unique monster designs to the creative depiction of the scare factory and its infrastructure. The animation is top-notch, with attention to detail that enhances the storytelling.The film's humor is one of its standout features, with witty dialogue and playful gags that appeal to both children and adults. Billy Crystal and John Goodman bring a lot of charm to their roles, and their chemistry is a key element in the film's success. Steve Buscemi's portrayal of the scheming Randall Boggs adds an effective touch of menace.At its core, ""Monsters, Inc."" explores themes of fear and bravery, and it challenges the idea that what we fear might not be as frightening as it seems. The relationship between Mike and Sulley, and their evolving sense of responsibility, drives the film's emotional impact. The heartfelt moments, especially those involving Boo, resonate strongly and add depth to the story.The film's soundtrack, including the catchy song ""If I Didn't Have You,"" complements the film's tone and contributes to its overall appeal.""Monsters, Inc."" is often praised for its originality, humor, and emotional resonance. It's a delightful film that offers a unique perspective on the monster genre and stands as a testament to Pixar's ability to blend inventive storytelling with profound themes.

Behind the Closet,"Pixar and Disney's ""Monsters, Inc."" is great fun for all.  It was a suprisingly good movie, with a interesting and often touching story by Jill Culton, director Peter Docter, and others.  To their credit along with Peter Docter's direction, the story telling is coherent and entertaining throughout.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi are just terrific in their voice roles.  The cutting edge computer animation is awesome.The idea that monsters scare children at night, to collect power for Monsters, Inc. to power the Monster city is novel.  But kids are getting harder to scare, jaded.  So times are tough for Monsters, Inc.  Sometime  is spent setting up and introducing Monster, Sulley (Goodman), and his bud, Mike (Crystal).  Sulley is a star scarer and his rival is the nasty Randall (Buscemi).  The movie really moves once Boo (a cute Mary Gibbs) enters Monsters, Inc. through her bedroom closet.  Sulley and Mike must get Boo back home.  The relationship between Sulley and Boo works.  MI is sentimental, and has a cute message about  courage and fear.  It does all this in 90 minutes.  Monsters, Inc. is an enjoyable package.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My Favorite Animated Movie,"Great plot, characters, humor, and some emotional parts. The plot is kinda funny because they took the idea of monsters in children's closets and turned it into a 90 minute movie. It has some of the greatest characters in any animated movie, or any movie in general. But those characters are Mike, Sulley, Boo, and Randall. And we can't forget about another outstanding performance from John Ratzenberger, as the Abominable Snowman. Mike, Boo, and Roz(who I can do the voice of nearly perfect) are hilarious, especially Mike.

All of us has a child inside us..,"Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great!,"""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in.First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real.Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall and hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk.You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer.

Aaah! Real Monsters!,"Hooray! A new Pixar! And it's a scream. Literally. You see, there ARE monsters living in our closets. Well, not precisely living there, but they do come through the closet door to collect children's screams which they need to power their city, Monstropolis. Of course, little kids are also said to be highly toxic to monsters, so those are just as afraid of children as vice versa. Imagine the panic when it transpires that one of those disease-carrying creatures is loose in Monstropolis. Aahh!After Shrek upped the ante in CGI technology, Disney and Pixar could not well sit back and let Dreamworks have the first Animated Oscar without a fight. As a result, they surpassed everybody's expectations - and Shrek - by a long shot. The got the wake-up call in time, and - even if the Academy Awards tell us otherwise - this round goes to Disney. Much of the success of this movie is, of course, the merit of the voice cast. Like Billy Crystal came to realise, Mike Wazowski may be green, bald and not even have a profile, but he clearly walks like Crystal, talks like Crystal, IS Crystal. Sulley is a very lovable monster and hero (he's welcome in my closet any time), while Boo is just adorable. And then there's Steve Buscemi's evil slimy rotten villain of a lizard... In short, this is not only animated feature at its best, this is a well conceived film with a solid story and well fleshed-out characters. On top of that, the people at Pixar chose to go the extra mile in giving us a couple of hilarious take-outs after the credits.

The overarching plot is the friendship of Sully and Mike Wazowski... Boo is simply the wedge that is driven between these two lifelong friends.I too agree with the sentiment that Pixar was robbed at the Oscars this year.

Eyecatching and brilliant animation will tickle your funnybone!,"This movie is nothing short of Pixar's best to date. The witfull animations put together with some of the best voices in the business. John Goodman as a purple-haired monster and Billy Crystal as a one-eyed phlegm-looking ditto is something that will make you laugh until you drop and make you ask for more. But animation isn't the only issue here (although it's hard to overlook). There is also a very compelling story behind it all. And a very different, but nonetheless original take on why there are monsters in childrens closets...(and there are, you know). What would any monster with a logical sense be doing in a childs closet if it weren't to ""harvest"" their screams for energy-production to support the hard working inhabitants of Monstropolis.

The best animated movie {yet},"I saw this movie when it first came out, and I loved it. I mean, can you get any better than a pack of monsters thinking kids are contaminated? This is the best idea for an animated movie {yet, considering that Pixar, the CGI company, always gets better and better with every movie}. It takes place in a city called Monstropolis, not far from your closet door. In the city, there is a company called Monsters Incorporated, where monsters of all shapes and sizes go into closet doors around the world and pop out scaring little kids, while collecting their source of energy: children's screams. This may seem like a baby story to you, but it really isn't. 2 Monsters, Sulley and Mike, accidentally let a kid inside the monster world {where monsters think kids are contaminated}, and you know what that means. Total mayhem. I won't give away anything, you might as well wait for the DVD release in September. You have to see this movie.

"Immensely entertaining, especially during the current chaos","After reading some of the comments regarding an alleged ""Shrek""/""Monsters, Inc. rivalry, I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily (bought the ""Shrek"" DVD yesterday, will definitely purchase the ""Monsters, Inc."" DVD) and that both are highly accomplished animated features.  On the ""Ebert and Roeper"" TV show, critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes.  I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film;  the poor fellow must be jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.I will not rehash the plot.  I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive.  Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. (""Sully"") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world.  While the ""Odd Couple"" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie.  Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time.  Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the  presence department.Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of ""King Kong), ""Monsters, Inc."" stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work.  It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie.  Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the ""Scream Suction"" device by the nefarious, reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).  Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears  The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.In short, ""Monster, Inc.""'s plan came wonderfully together.  Unlike some commentators, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again.  Keep doing it...please!  ""Monsters, Inc.One quibble:  Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension.  I wonder what her parents were thinking when she was missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).Out of 5 stars, I would rate ""Monsters, Inc."" 4 1/2 stars(a slight demerit to familiarity of plot, but again, WHO CARES?)  Rejuvenate heart, body, and soul.  See this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great.,"As the single 20-something, I'm not supposed to see movies like this. I should have seen ""The One"" or ""K-Pax"" or something like that. Of course this is the only movie with the ""Attack of the Clones"" trailer (which by the way was worth the $4.50 admission), so I made the 1/2 hour drive, just to be late and wait an hour for the next showing.So what do I think of it? It rules. Kids will like the monsters and Boo. The Adults will like the witty dialog and sight gags. And everyone will love what happens to Randal at the end. Much like The Simpsons, Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. takes the advantages of animation and creates a great story with great characters. Hopefully Pixar continues to create such wonderful movies.Also ""For the Birds"" is a great add on. I really enjoyed that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

When my parents did what they could t convince me there were no monsters in the closet, I knew they ran from the closet to under my bed. What a nice film this was to tap into something we all know about and may have experienced in that wonderful time called ""childhood.""This film was wonderfully animated (yay Pixar!) and wonderfully written for children and adults to love. It was cute, it was fun, it is memorable. The only thing that fell short for me was the very very end, I thought it could have been a bit better, but its not that big of a deal to ""hate"" this gem. John Goodman (Sulllivan)and Billy Crystal (Mike) were wonderful voicing the Monsters who work to get the scares from the kids to keep the city going. Then there's Boo's voice, that is adorable. And who could hate Jennifer Tilly's voice? I had no idea that was Steve Buscemi as the slimy ""Randall"", it was very good.

A child's love is pure.,"I watched this movie when I am in my highschool years. I enjoyed it as much with my older siblings. As an adult now I realized that we have all monsters that we need to conquer.Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay.

An excellent movie,"Being a big fan of these type of animation movies such as TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE and SHREK, I had high expectations for MONSTERS INC. They were met. Not only are the computer graphics impressive, but the story is original and entertaining with moments of great action, good comedy, and even some genuinely sad parts.The voice-over chemistry between John Goodman and Billy Crystal is excellent. Like Eddie Murphy in SHREK, Billy Crystal was hilarious and definitely stole the show. Crystal seems to be ideal for voice-over work. Both the lead voices are perfect for their respective roles, and I thought James Coburn was also perfect for his character, Henry J. Waternoose.I loved the premise of the film. The idea of monsters going off to their jobs of scaring children to power their city is at the same time original and vaguely familiar. Boo is one of the most adorable characters I've seen in a long time (and Mary Gibbs, the young lady who does the voice of Boo, is equally adorable), and I LOVED the relationship which was developed between Boo and Sully (Goodman).This movie is everything an animated movie should be. It and Shrek are two of my all-time favorite animated movies, and it's hard for me to choose a favorite between the two (which is interesting, since I'm sure one of the two will win the first Oscar for an animated film this year). See this and you won't regret it. Fun for kids, adults, and teenagers like myself.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Monsters Inc showcases the imagination and originality of Pixar's early days.,"We all have films we grew up with, earning a sense of nostalgia that may skew the true reflection of the film. Monsters Inc is one of those. It's a little rough around the edges, but the finished product will always be one that I will truly appreciate. Monstropolis is powered by energy garnered from children's screams. Sully and Mike go to work just like any normal day, except they accidentally let a child into the world of monsters. Normal day has now just taken a turn for the more eventful. Comedy ensues with various antagonists being revealed and a surprising touching ending that packs a punch to the heart. One of the greatest additions to the animation genre, this flick shows that pure imagination is able to extend its captivation beyond a good narrative and aesthetically pleasing visuals. It's all in the details! Explaining how the door system works, why the city needs screams, showing the partnership between the scarer and their companion. It fills in all the gaps to complete a greater picture, adding that finesse. The world doesn't feel populated for the sake of it, it naturally breathes life through the art of animation. It's what Pixar is famous for. I loved how they deconstructed the ""monsters in the closet"" theme, which most definitely appeals to all audiences. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were the perfect voice actors, I cannot envisage anyone else replacing them. Sully and Mike are John and Billy. It's a done deal. Irreplaceable. The dialogue between them was intuitive and felt seamless. Quick banter with boundless quotes...""put that thing back where it came from!"". Randall was a memorable villain that was underplayed, not overly sinister which I appreciated. Certain scenes were rushed, like Mike coming back from the Himalayas, but it's not a major detriment. Monster's Inc just screams imagination. Its ingenuity and originality will appeal to everyone and is a stepping stone for cementing Pixar as one of the best animation studios.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Fun for Adults too - like saltwater taffy for the eyes!,"My friend coerced me into catching this kiddy movie on it's release date, even though all the commercial marketing for Monster Inc has already blanketed the stores with shelves of merchandise (so plastique - poor kiddies..)Seemed that pixar/disney knew they had something ~especial~ twirling on their thumbs with this piece.  Their confidence was apparent as the audience was treated to a sweet little pixar appetizer to whet our appetites before the real show (birds).We were surrounded by children of all ages at this 1:30 matinee - I do not recall ever being around so many children outside of grammer school (and I wondered why these parents all felt keeping their children home for this release was truly a wise decision).Regardless - their presence only seemed to sweeten the experience. I am not going to spill any beans - it's all about savoring the originality, artistic and technical wonders of this little dessert of a movie.

"We scare, because we care...","If there's anything that ""Monsters Inc."" proves is that the greatest stories, whether targeting a young or older audience (or both within the same person), all rely on a simple yet original concept. It's so simple in the film that you can almost guess it from the title.What kind of products or services a company named ""Monsters, Inc."" can provide? Well, what do monsters do best? They scare... but as the tag-line says, it's only business. And like every business, you need a target. Kids, who else? But the real question is : what kind of business would require them to scare poor helpless little kids? Well this is where it gets tricky, in fact children's screams supply Monstropolis' daily needs of energy, as simple as that. Their slogan says ""We scare, because we care"", so all these monsters provide a necessary public service, and that one of their rules is to never get in contact with the children shows how actually harmless and worthy of our sympathy they are (or are they? ... suspenseful music).And to add to the enjoyment of a very creative premise, the exposition is a delightful sequence too, plunging us in a world populated by monsters, each one being a gag by himself. Indeed, I could easily figure out the instructions given to the artists during the making-of : ""every single monster must be unpredictable, different, funny and somewhat memorable"" so we get a succession of animal-like creatures with the most bizarre or sophisticated physical attributes, big, small, invisible, hideous, you name them. And leading the show, we have Sulley and Mike (yeah, it's an Americanized parallel universe, what's the matter?). Sulley is big blue furry one with purple spots, cool and friendly, and Mike the little green Cyclopes, wisecracking and talkative. And don't ask me which of the gentle giant and the Napoleon syndrome guy is voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. Please, don't.To complete the imagery, the film is all about imagery anyway, some others monsters are such masterpieces of creativity they shouldn't even be called monsters. Like Celia, Mike's girlfriend, voiced by Jennifer Tilly, and whose dreadlocks-like hair are made of adorable little snakes with reactions that almost match their owner (almost). From the ugly sight of the bulged-eye chameleon-like Randal Boggs whose ability to change color borrows more from the invisible man powers, it's easy to guess who's the movie's bad guy and who dubs him of course? Simply, the most funny-looking actor with the same weird-looking eyes : Steve Buscemi. A final honorable mention for James Coburn who voices the CEO Mr Waternoose, a crab-like cigar-smoking head of company who treats his best monster Sulley like a son and Roz, a daunting secretary with a ravaged-by-smoking voice that sounds like scratching fingers on a chalkboard.And all this colorful gallery works in ""Monsters Inc."" following a daily routine that coincides with Earth children's bedtime, the company provides a warehouse full of millions of doors from all over the world and each one leading to kids' bedrooms, a parallel universe we're most familiar with or used to. And this is where the little Disney magic works again : the film rings that sensitive chord reminding us the time from our childhood when we were afraid ghosts or monsters would come from the closet. Well, I was more afraid of clowns or wild animals and I was more staring at the window with fearful eyes, but psychologically speaking, that's not the point.So, let's get back to ""Monsters, Inc."". Like any company, they have to face real market issues, one of them is kids growing more and more insensitive to violence, this is why they only hire the best of the best, the monster's 'right stuff' as suggested by the hilarious slow-motion sequence parodying the famous astronaut-walking scene. And apparently, Sulley is about to break the company's record, closely followed by his jealous rival, Randall. But one of Randall's evil schemes allows Sulley to discover that there's one little child he does't scare, a little girl nicknamed 'Boo' who grew an instant fondness on Sulley, inversely proportional to the fear Boggs inspired her. From fear to realization, Sulley also develops feelings toward Boo, and we know where this is leading, that drop of tear for an ocean of thrills and laughs, made-in-Disney.The third Pixar movie is another little touchstone of creativity and imagery that will delight kids and adults. It's good, it's even great at times, yet it lost to ""Shrek"" that year, and rightfully so, for Shrek had a less sophisticated concept but treated with more wit and heart. And a parody of fairy material could only win over a concept that, as creative as it is, relies on one gimmick. ""Monsters, Inc"" has heart too, and some moments between Sully and Boo will make a few eyes cry. But somehow, the film was victim of its own concept, and commits many mistakes with the whole door and closet systems, thus featuring a series of plot contrivances at the crucial final act. Not to mention the little resolution that plays like a nice twist but is revealed to early in the film to leave an impact.Still, a very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Film for All Ages,"Monsters, Inc. proves to be a movie for all ages. As a child, I was entertained by the funny ""kitty,"" his partner-in-crime, and their surprising pal. Now, I watch this film and am still entertained. However, I now realize the impressiveness and complexity seen in Monsters, Inc. The competitive world that I have since entered from the first time I watched this movie is practically displayed in the monster world. Along with the competitive spirits of Randall and Sully, is Sully's attachment to an unlikely friend, and the difficulty of letting go. Sully must say goodbye to Boo, as she reenters the human world. This scene is so relatable, that for an instant, we forget the differences between the monster world and the real world.

An adorable addition to the Pixar repertoire,"Monsters Inc. follows in the footsteps of its predecessors in being an extremely charming movie that is fun for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to both children and adults. Pixar has had many great hits in the past, the most shining examples being the Toy Story movies. Monsters Inc. is clearly designed to be similar to those movies, and to appeal to the same crowd that they did -- and for the most part, it succeeds.The performances (vocal) by Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent, as one would expect. There are a few other recognizable voices that make cameos as well (can you figure out who plays the Abominable Snow man? It took me a few minutes). The animation is, of course, first rate (if you get a chance, perhaps on a second viewing, which this movie is worth, pay attention to the way Mike's one eye shows so much expression, and to how the fur movies on Sully with the breeze).This movie isn't quite as good as Toy Story, though. Where it lags behind its predecessors is that the story is a bit, well... obvious, once you get the feel for it, and it is slightly slow in the beginning. The ending is exciting, however, and that makes up for the slow start. The one real disappointment (if you can call it that, since it is minor) is that the movie doesn't have very many interesting supporting characters. Boo, Sully, and Mike are the main stars, but other than one or two slimy villain-types, there really aren't many other interesting characters in the movie. And that's a shame, since the monster world certainly could have given us plenty of nifty personalities.That said, Monsters Inc. was fun, and gives the viewer much to laugh at, and maybe even a thing or two to sniffle at along the way. Boo, the little human girl, was absolutely precious -- I wanted to take her home with me. I recommend this one to children of all ages -- especially those of us over the hill.My score: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An original Pixar concept full of laughs and tears.,"Early Pixar films always had a way of being grounded in our reality. The toys in Toy Story (1995) had to make sense as toys. The insects in A Bug's Life (1998) were all known insects. It wasn't until Monsters, Inc. (2001) when an entire world had to be created to explain the ""monster in the closet"" fear most children grow up with. And while this film is definitely another tech demo to show how good Pixar had gotten at simulating cloth and fur, the plot itself is one of the most original pieces Pixar has ever created.Coming up with dozens of different monster designs was only the first step. That Pixar created a world designed for these monsters to live and work in was the basic follow-up, but creating a whole system of door portals that could access any room in the human world was genius. And having screams power the whole thing? That's the cherry on top of this amazing idea that was superbly executed. I'm just glad I can appreciate the anti-Capitalist message as an adult-much like the pro-union message of A Bug's Life just a few years prior.By this point, Pixar had started pulling out the tearjerkers. Toy Story 2 (1999) introduced heavy emotional stakes, but Monsters, Inc. Carried it to the next level. Even if Boo still suffers a little bit from that early CGI inability to render realistic humans, the connection Sully (John Goodman) forges with her is something that makes the ending hit so well. Pair this with the expert comedic counterbalance with Mike (Billy Crystal), and it's a recipe for success (cliche second act falling out, notwithstanding). Monsters, Inc. Wasn't my favorite Pixar film growing up, but it's definitely grown on me as I've aged.An original Pixar concept full of laughs and tears, I give Monsters, Inc. 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Your stunned silence is very reassuring,"A 'scarer' from the monster world forms a bond with a very young human child.This is an immensely enjoyable, feel-good movie with a clever concept, great characters and brilliantly animated storytelling.The plot is a funny and moving friendship tale with a dash of adventure, but the fantasy concept that underlies it is another fantastic idea from the Pixar writers.Monsters Inc has numerous great scenes and hilarious banter between the characters. Much like Toy Story, it makes you laugh and chokes you up at will, such is the quality of the characterisation.One of its strengths is the thought and detail that goes into the various aspects of the monster world and how it interacts with our world. Everything that happens in Monsters Incorporated, the use of doors, screams, laughter and how characters move between worlds is superb.The visuals as you would expect from Pixar are brilliant. The characters are superbly animated with fantastic colours, textures and expressions. As for the visual storytelling, it is so good that it held my daughter for the duration of the running time when she was about two years old.

Were it not for the gags, and other good laughs in the prior three I'd say Monsters was better.In terms of the animation - the animation is awesome, quite smooth and very subtle.

Wonderful animated movie!,"This movie is just plain wonderful! Incredibly funny, told with a great tempo and with a lot of humour.  No dead moments at all!  The story is based on a single assumptions, that monsters in the closet are real, and that they scare little kids in order to get energy to power their city.  From this assumption, a wonderful story about a big threat to this lifestyle and kids everywhere is spun.On the visual nitpicking side, the computer animations are better than earlier attempts like Toy Story, but they are still somewhat deficient when it comes to humans. The hair on the main character Sulley is superb, and there is a wonderful sleighride scene with swirling snow that is exquisite! However, the humans are still doll-like, and the complexity of human hair has not been handled.  Most of the monsters look like slightly soft rubber, which is a bit disappointing... for some reason, it does not look quite right (except for the furry monsters).But the movie does not depend on the computer generated graphics to entertain, it would have been just as much fun if it had been handdrawn the old way.  Computer graphics allow for more dramatic pans and roller-coaster rides, and are good enough not to detract from the action, which is quality enough.Here in Sweden, there was a short movie about birds before the main movie, which was just wonderfully hilarious.

I thought the story was perfectly well-written, the laughs are meant to be good laughs, and the cast including John Goodman as Sulley and the incredible Billy Crystal as Mike was perfectly hilarious.

Coming Out of the Closet,"Great Pixar animated film about two monsters living in Monstropolis - a land outside human land where monsters of all sorts live. Power is generated by the screams of children from Monsters, Inc. - a factory where doors of small children are presented in assembly-line fashion for monsters to walk through and scare children. I was overwhelmed with the concept of the film for its incredible imagination, innovation, and creativity. The folks at Pixar always seem to be able to pull films like this off with ease. At the heart of this film is the friendship of one huge, all-time(almost) scare monster and his assistant - voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively. The characters are penned to fit the voices like hands to gloves. The puns and funny wordplay, particularly by Crystal, are an added bonus and raises much of this as just being another kid's movie. It isn't. What happens? Well, a child manages to come in to the monster world and chaos and fun ensue, but also an emotional quality is created with the depth of characterization of Sully(Goodman). The additional voices by Bob Peterson, James Coburn, and oily Steve Buschemi - not to mention Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as the Abominable Snowman(monsters like these had been banished - love the concept again!) greatly enhance the film. But it is the magical animation which seems real more often than not that really propels the engine of this film. This is impressive entertainment from a company that knows what entertainment is all about. In one scene, if you look closely, you will see the child in her room and have a small toy of a clown fish - a couple years before Pixar released Finding Nemo. Love the clever nature of these folks. Any film that can explain to my satisfaction, covering all bases, why monsters come out of closets has to be pretty good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Star rating: 4 out of 5,"Monsters, Inc. is another triumph of computer animation from the wizards at Pixar.  As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a ""what if?"" scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours?Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst. His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a ""Grossery Store"" and ""odorant"" (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie.

A Real Scream!,"The Pixar animation company is very good at what they do.  They always manage to keep up with the development of computer animation.  And their latest masterpiece, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" shows you how far they have come, and how excellent they are.  This movie had a lot of laughs, and a few tender moments as well.  It put a nice twist on an old childhood fear: what if the monster in your closet was afraid of you?  I enjoyed a lot of in-jokes, including the use of animation legend Ray Harryhausen's name.  The best character would have to be Randall, whose reptilian moves and chameleon color changing style were very well done.  Pixar did the right thing by not including a ""blooper reel"" in the closing credits.  Otherwise, they would have looked like they were trying to be like ""A Bug's Life.""  Anyway, ""Monsters, Inc."" has left me satisfied, and eagerly awaiting their next work of digital art!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar works its unique magic once again,"Pixar hasn't made a bad film yet.  In fact, it hasn't yet made a film that can be classified as anything less than excellent.  ""Toy Story"" (1995), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998), and ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) were all wonderful films with amazing state-of-the-art visuals and clever humor that children, teens, and adults can all enjoy.  ""Monsters, Inc."" is a film worthy of its predecessors' high acclaim.The voice talents and humorous sensibilities of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi excel in the well-written story line, which is satirical and at the same time innocent.  The story itself is, as usual, exciting and full of laughs and thrills.  It's a fantasy about the innocence of childhood and the classic good-triumphing-over-evil theme.The characters are so real, especially little Boo who wanders from her bedroom into the world of closet-monsters.  The animation has gotten so advanced that you can see every hair on lead monster Sulley's body rippling in the wind, and the facial expressions and mannerisms have gotten so real that they should start handing out Best-Actor Oscars to the animators and voice-overs.  Speaking of Oscars, ""Monsters, Inc."" should definitely contend for the new ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscar (though it's gonna have heavy competition from ""Shrek"").Hopefully in the future we will see more intelligent G-rated movies that all ages can enjoy.  While ""Shrek"" was an excellent movie, it didn't have the level of innocence that ""Monsters"" has that can let parents feel easy about the content their kids are viewing and hearing.  As long as Pixar is doing their thing, parents and their kids should be happy on their nights out at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Genuine Warmth and Fun,"The folks at Pixar have done it again, showing that they are in touch with both their inner children and real ones.  Monsters, Inc. has all the usual eye-candy; although the Toy Story films as well as A Bug's Life have made it more difficult to marvel at what's becoming an expected level of perfection, one must only consider Sully's fur, which ripples and sways in the wind (and from his own snoring) with complete realism.  The story is typical Disney, but any hokiness is avoided by the genuine warmth of the attachment between Sully and Boo, the human toddler who has accidentally crossed over into the universe of monsters hidden behind the closet door.  Goodman's characterization matches well with Pixar's visualization, creating a lovable lug, and Boo is simply irresistible, notably her baby-talk.  The only real weak link is Billy Crystal's sidekick Mike.  There seems little reason for the character, frankly.  He just gets to be the cranky, manic pal of the hero, the annoying but good-at-heart fast talker.  It's not that Crystal does a bad job, but the character's a little adrift.  The movie also acts as a kind of allegory about our reliance on power sources that are rooted in others' suffering (eg., oil), but one needn't pay THAT much attention!  You REALLY WILL laugh and cry at this one.  And you'll leave feeling better about everything.  Trust me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Charming and Fun,"First: be sure to show up on time to see the featurette that preceeds the movie. As with ""Geri's Game"" prior to ""A Bug's Life,"" the movie is fun, but the short is even better.Yet again, Pixar has improved the state of digital films with this offering. That said, what sets this film apart from the year's previous submissions is the story. Instead of being a series of gags held together by a loose story line (Shrek), this is a wonderful tale of friendship and the value of open minds with great gags to accentuate the smiles.Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfectly cast as the monsters who are thrust into the task of protecting an innocent child from the CDF (Child Detection Force) after she accidently makes her way into the world of monsters.You'll laugh, you'll smile, and sometimes you'll wish you could hear the movie over the audience's laughter.

A movie suited for all ages. Disney style.,"A really good movie that fits for all audiences. ""Monsters Inc."" is not strictly a children movie because it has a plot that gets the attention of kids and parents.The plot has always been a mystery to me. Let me explain myself... The plot is VERY similar to the one of a Troma's 80's flick called ""Monster In The Closet"". The idea of the Troma movie is Horror oriented for children (you know, Troma style) and Monsters Inc. gives the plot a direction of fantasy. I don't know if there's a relationship between both movies.Anyways, ""Monsters Inc."" has a beautiful plot, great animation effects, a perfect score, and best of all, a sense of humor that fits for all audiences.I watched this back on the theaters in 2001 with my girlfriend at the time and we had a great time even though I'm a fan of Horror movies. That's the example of how this movie can be enjoyed by everyone.Join Sully and Mike W. in this beautiful ride. It has moral lessons about friendship, responsibility, and best of all, the tenderness of children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great film,"A really good movie that fits for all audiences. One of my all time favorites. Monsters, Inc. is a very moving story about Sacrifice and the power of love.n my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger!

Best Animated Movie of the New Millennium,"Without surprise. Pixar and Disney have done it again!  Monsters Inc. is a wonderful family film and is without a doubt the best animated film since the turn of the new century.  I nearly fell out of my seat with laughter in most parts of the film, and in some others I almost wanted to cry.  My 14 month old daughter could not take her eyes off of the film (it may have been what she recognized as a giant t.v. screen) and even my wife, who generally does not get entertained by animated movies, loved it.  It is a creative and cute film and it is just what I expected from Pixar.  Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Entertaining Fare for the Whole Family,"At one time or another, every kid in the world goes through the dread Monster-in-the-Closet experience; it's like one of Life's Rules.  And for those who remember the chills of the dark bedroom, the stark terror of the moment the light goes out and you're left all alone with the Thing of your imagination, at long last there are some concrete answers to allay the fears of PCCSS (Post Childhood Closet Stress Syndrome), thanks to the good folks at Pixar.  `Monsters, Inc.,' directed by Peter Docter, and featuring the talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman, takes you behind the scenes of those haunted hours of childhood and explains the whole business.  Which happens to be the whole point:  It's a business.  At Monsters, Inc., it's the job of all the scariest creatures around to supply the power for the city, which is generated by the screams of the children found on the other side of closet doors.  The bigger the scream, the more power.  From one floor of the factory that is Monsters, Inc., closet doors are affixed, assembly line style, so that the best of the best (or maybe that's the worst of the worst) can step through (it takes them into a child's bedroom) and do their thing.  The screams are then collected in canisters and the city has power.The monsters earn points for the most scream power collected, and at the top of the list is James P. `Sulley' Sullivan (Goodman) a big, hairy, hulking monster who is assisted by the one-eyed (and it's a big one) Mike Wazowski (Crystal), a monster in his own right, though not of the scaring kind.  But Sulley has some competition; the number two scarer is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), more sinister than Sulley, and not beyond stooping to some underhanded schemes to get to the top spot on the roster.  It's a tough racket, and Sulley and Mike have no idea just how low Randall is willing to go to get what he wants.  It's a plot, however, that ultimately has a far-reaching effect on the whole city, and it falls to Sulley and Mike to try and put things aright with their world.Beginning with the premise, the story is clever and funny, and it's all brought to the screen with exemplary execution.  The Pixar process is simply amazing; the depth and dimension of the animation is brilliant and gives new definition to this genre as an art form.  Consider, for example, how very real the expressions and emotions of the characters are conveyed.  That, combined with the fact that the story moves along with an excellent pace and perfect timing, makes for a satisfying and enjoyable time at the movies.Docter also assembled a top notch cast for his project.  In addition to Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi (who are terrific), the cast includes James Coburn (Henry J. Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia), Bonnie Hunt (Flint), Mary Gibbs (Boo), Bob Peterson (Roz), John Ratzenberger (Yeti), Frank Oz (Fungus), Steve Susskind (Floor Manager), Jeff Pidgeon (Bile), Daniel R. Gerson (Needleman & Smitty) and Sam `Penguin' Black (George).  Entertaining fare the whole family can enjoy, `Monsters, Inc.,' is a real experience for the little ones, and certainly presents something with which the adults in the audience will be able to identify, whether it be a memory from childhood or helping one's own child face the unknown of the Closet-in-the-Dark.  It's a movie that actually offers a little bit more than meets the eye, and it's a demonstration of something I've always said, that it's a kind of magic. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

When one child accidently enters the monster city, Mike and Sullivan try to get this child back to her world. But Randall (Steve Buscemi), an evil monster wants to use the child for his experiment to become the top monster for Monsters Inc. This movie is funny for all ages from 1-1000+.

Imaginative monster movie,"A very clever and well thought out film by Pixar animation studios that uniquely represents the made-up theory of monsters in a kid's closet. The film has a neat and fun amount of colorful characters and even some ""scary"" looking ones like Randall (voiced by the talented Buscemi) and Waternoose. Crystal portrays Mike Wazowski hilariously and Goodman does some good enough seriousness (as well as some humor) with Sully. This was a good childhood classic of mine as well. The doors leading into the human world electronically I think is an interesting idea. The scene near the end with every single door in one place was a scene I really liked when I was younger. Overall, it is a quite an ingenious movie and another good one for the early years of Pixar (their fourth movie they've made).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What are we gonna do?  Waltz right up to the factory?,"Monsters in the closet scaring kids within this world are not doing so out of any desire to do harm ...They are just doing their job.

That is until a little girl named Boo enters the world and changes how things are done forever.This film was beaten by Spirited Away at the Oscars but there is little to choose between them, especially as they focus on the story of a little girl whose journey takes her to a strange world inhabited by bizarre creatures.The voice work by Billy Crystal and John Goodman is superb, and as you'd expect from Pixar the story and script are first rate, the direction is top drawer and the animation a vast improvement on the work done on ""Toy Story 2"".This is an excellent film that's fun for the family, carries a good environmental message about renewable energy that will hopefully inspire the next generation that's coming along, is funny, charming and will make you laugh, cry and cheer as the antics of these big monsters keep your little monsters entertained for hours.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Close to Perfect,"While many of the 18-34 demographic may scoff at animations, Pixar has defined itself as the Disney for this generation. John Lassetter, from the early days of moving lamps, is a genius at telling compelling stories that reasonant with people of any age. Monster Inc. is a not-so-typical buddy story (think Maverick and Goose) with the evil antagonist trying to rule the world (think any 007 movie).The facial expressions (if you can use that phrase with these creatures) and their interactions amongst themselves (jealousy) and coworkers (passive aggression) create a richness in character that is humanizing.The film is filled with The Simpsons style of humor: Level 1 (visual gags); Level 2 (puns, the ho-hum jokes for adults); and Level 3 (the entire scene/movie is a joke/parody).The film and score are an impressive feat for both adults and kids to enjoy (together).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"This film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.","First, let me just say that it is a very, very good and funny movie, but I will come back to its many good points. I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did a very good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I was right, it was an excellent movie. Like most Disney movies, it was a great flick for children and adults alike. It was comedic at times like Toy Story, but overall I thought it was better.

"Monsters, Inc","Excellent movie. When I watched the movie, I saw very high expectations and the movie disappointed me a bit. Sulli's character was a very brilliant character, and Buu's character was one of the most cute characters from Pixar films.

AWESOME,"The animation, colors, style, shading - in short EVERYTHING about this film makes it the technically best animated feature film I've seen to date. Shrek looks like an animation school's course project in comparison!  The fur on Sully is absolutely stunning.  Anyone in the industry will tell you that the door scene is the most impressive display of complexity yet too!No spoilers - but I also think the story is good.  I think it will appeal more to females simply because most people who have seen it call it 'cute.' I do think however that it will appeal equally to adults and children - AND that there is no need for concern with taking even the youngest children to see this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is a great film!,"I'm not big on animated films but I truly like this one! The story revolves around monsters who must scare human children to get their screams since screams provide all the electrical power for the monster society. Monsters utilize the child's closet door as a portal. However, children don't scare easily anymore and production has dropped off. There's also the fact that monsters believe that human children can kill a monster with just one touch. So there's great danger when a child actually comes through the closet door and into monster society! One monster befriends the lost human and is trying to return her to her own bed. But there's evil afoot at Monsters, Inc, the monsters power company and the bad monsters want to keep the child. This is a cute film, and I liked it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Jaw-droppingly spectacular,"I can't avoid the cliche: This movie is an instant classic, made with exacting attention to the true art of cinematic story telling.  What begins as a hilarious and mind-bending take on the hidden world lurking in the closets of our childhood nightmares, becomes a heart-pounding adventure for the welfare of a little girl that is punctuated perfectly with comedic flourishes and sentiment that will jerk a tear or two from the corner of your eyes.  And I thought Shrek was the end all with its rich characters and classic in-jokes--but this animated delight is the reason why Character and not Plot should dominate a film.  Rent it now.

"Very funny animated action, beautifully rendered","Animated movies rarely hit these kind of heights. This is where Pixar showed they are not a one trick pony.In a world where the Monster in the Cupboard is not only real but just the tip of the iceberg, the monsters too have their own world, full of life's ups and downs.The movie follows two work colleagues and close friends as they slowly unravel the world around them, finding treachery and danger along the way.Monsters power their world by collecting screams from human children and processing them into electricity (ish). The trick is doing this without letting the children touch you, as children are toxic to monsters!When a small child finds its way into the monsters' world, it's a race aghast time to get the girl home.Sound spooky? Well no. This is a wonderful, wonderful comedy that just makes you laugh over and over again. Sulley is the best scarer in the power plant and Mike is his Assistant. Each child's bedroom is accessed via a unique Door. One of the best animated comedies ever.As the race to get the child, Boo, back to her own Door takes more and more hysterical turns and leads to the two monster friends uncovering a conspiracy in their own ranks.Things to look out for:Harryhausen's restaurant, a monster changing camouflage every time it's punched, spotting (again) John Ratzenburger, don't eat yellow snow, code 2319, the 'outtakes'.The Collector's Edition is exceptional and utterly crammed with goodies including Mike's New Car & For The Birds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"cute, amazing, very good","It's amazing how far CGI acting has come. I've accused some movies of having gone too far with the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI) and leaning on it a bit too much but in this case, the movie was all CGI and so it should be. Monsters, Inc. is basically a good old-fashioned cartoon, just tens times better than anything we used to watch as kids. And the interesting thing is that cartoons are no longer for children. More and more of these animated movies are appealing to the adults as much as they are to the children.Monsters, Inc. is about something that every child knows aboutmonsters in their closet. We've all had our own monsters that we were terrified of as a child and they always seem to come from that spooky closet in our room. How did these monsters get here? What are they doing here? Monsters, Inc. takes us into the world of bedroom monsters. Every closet in every child's room in the world is connected to the monster world. While the children don't really get anything out of having the daylights scared out of them, the monster's world is powered by the screams they generate out of children. Everyday, some monsters' jobs are to go and generate power by going around to the human children of the world and scaring thembut the one thing that is absolutely not permitted is for a child to enter the world of monstersWhy was this movie so good? Lots of things. They have fantastic actors as voices for the characters. John Goodman plays the main character of Sulley (big blue furry monster) with Billy Crystal playing Sulley's buddy and sidekick, Mike Wazowski (one-eyed gumball looking fellow). With actors like these two fellows, it's hard not to have good material to work with and I wouldn't be surprised if Billy Crystal adlibbed some of his lines.What also added to the quality of this movie was the ability to capture the emotions and expressions of these characters. Unlike animation of the past, computers have been able to mimic human emotions and expressions with great accuracy. This has allowed for the audience to feel closer and relate to these fantasy actors and create an overall more enjoyable experience.Sometimes technology gets in the way of storytelling. It's happened in lots of movies where Hollywood thought that it could rest on the crutches of technology in place of a good storyline. Monsters, Inc. doesn't have this problem. On a basic level, the story is simple. The monster world is turned upside down when a little human child accidentally enters their world. But what the movie has been able to achieve beyond that is create a story that has good believable characters, even if they are fictional. The characters carry the emotions of what they face across the screen to the audience and the more the audience believes them, the better the story is. It's also nice to see that the humor is not just targeted at young children. I quite often heard adults laughing louder than the children and that's a good sign that the movie is appealing to everyone. I don't have any children but the friends that I went with all enjoyed this movie.Overall, this was a very good movie. The animation was amazing, the voice actors were excellent and the story was entertaining. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not one of Pixar's best, but as usual, it can entertain both kids and adults","I got to see a bit of this movie a few years ago in high school towards the ends of the last day before Christmas holidays. I remember that I did not enjoy it, but also clearly remember that I was in a tired state, which the seemed to happen to me after the school's Christmas assembly for some strange reason. Therefore, that says nothing about the quality of ""Monsters, Inc."" I've seen it thrice since then, and while it has never been one of my favourites from Pixar, and may have more appeal to kids than adults, I certainly can't go as far as saying it's STRICTLY for kids.Monstropolis is a city where only monsters live. This city relies on a company called Monsters, Inc. for its power. This company's employees enter human children's rooms through the closets and scare them to make them scream, as their screams are what generate the power for Monstropolis! Two monsters who work for Monsters, Inc. are James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (a big, furry, blue creature), and Mike Wazowski (a green Cyclops monster with no torso), who are best friends. Currently, Sulley is in the #1 position for causing the most screams, but Randall, his chameleon-like rival, is determined to top him! One night, Sulley sees that a toddler girl has come in through one of the doors! Residents of Monstropolis are convinced that human children are poisonous, so Sulley and Mike are scared when they first see her, but she seems harmless, and Sulley grows to like her, giving her the name, ""Boo."" Still, they must try to get her back home before any other monster finds her!There definitely is humour in this movie, but a lot of it is perhaps more amusing for the kids. I personally found a lot of it at least mildly amusing, but overall, I didn't find the movie as funny as I had hoped. We have plenty of the standard slapstick here, but it sometimes seems too simple and childish, and not as funny as I usually find that type of humour. Mike Wazowski is a comic character, with his bitterness and sarcasm, which helps. Claiming he and Sulley are rehearsing a scene for an upcoming company play when their co-workers catch them talking about Boo is a highlight. Overall, I think ""Mike's New Car"", an animated short featuring Mike and Sulley, is slightly funnier than their full-length movie, but for the most part, I guess the humour in ""Monsters, Inc."" is good enough. Maybe funnier for kids, but adults could definitely get their share of laughs as well.Other than humour, this Pixar effort tells a very imaginative story. It may not be the most well written one to ever come from the computer animation company, but still one that obviously took talent and imagination to write. The adventure that the two main characters find themselves on eventually gets quite exciting. As usual with Pixar, the animation is no disappointment, you can basically expect the same kind of great animation and colours here. So, this is not one of Pixar's best, but it is still another job well done from the company. I'm sure ""Monsters, Inc."" has a lot for kids, which is good, since these animated family films are supposed to entertain them, but also has entertainment value for adults as well, even if it's not equal entertainment value for both audiences like it sometimes is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

My favorite animated movie,"Monster's Inc. is just pure brilliance. Not only is it my favorite animated film of all time, but it's one of my top 5 movies ever. In my opinion, it's Pixar's best, and why Shrek beat it for best animated feature at the Academy Awards - well I'll never understand that idiocy. The jokes are screamingly (no pun intended) funny, and the dialog is one of my favorite ever. I love every single character (Mike is my favorite), and all the voice acting is superb. The animation is fantastic and the cool twist on ""the monster in the closet"" is fun and very clever. One of my favorite scenes is when Mike and his girlfriend Celia are on a date at Harryhausens (a restaurant in Monstropolis) and Sully comes in with Boo and unintentionally crashes their date and Boo gets loose, it's hilarious havoc, and I love every minute, and of course every other scene in Monster's Inc. Like I said before, I love this movie, it's hilarious, creative, original, featuring awesome characters, this is a great film that everyone can enjoy.

"Be not afraid, be not very afraid.","In Monsters, Incorporated, monsters make their living scaring kids through their bedroom closets. The reason? To power the City of the Monsters with their screams. (Point to ponder: why don't the monsters do their own screams? If they can roar, they can definitely scream.) One day, a human kid enters their world, turning the lives of every monster upside down. Particularly those of professional scarer James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan, the big blue furball, and his roommating buddy Mike Wazowski, the little green blue-collared eyeball and a devoted friend to Sulley.Mike and Sulley race against time to return the human kid back to the human world, sandwiching that into the dramas they currently have in their respective lives at that time. Mike is trying to win the affections of snake-haired receptionist Celia while trying to avoid confrontations with mumbling slug monster Roz over a job-related assignment. Sulley is doing his best to keep his Top Scarer throne from being usurped by closest rival Randall, the slithering slimy chameleon type. Monsters, Inc. CEO Henry J. Waternoose the crab-legged rounds up this grotesque cast.True to tradition, the Disney-Pixar duo never fails to deliver superb animation that stretches beyond our imaginations. They show it in their creativity of various monster species, in every possible shapes, sizes and positions eyes relative to their faces, and not to mention excellent casting of voiceover actors. Crystal accentuates Mike's brashness, with the occasional obnoxiousness that comes with being a loudmouth. Goodman shows an exceptionally kind and gentle side to Sulley, opposite to what the furball is known for at Monsters, Inc.. He is warm and loving, and dotes on the human kid (ugh!!). In one scene, he actually feels sorry for scaring her. Together, Mike and Sulley compliment each other perfectly in a clown-straightmonster antic that is reminiscent of Abbott and Costello. Celia could not be more beguiling as Tilly's voice. Buscemi's Randall is every bit as slimy and cold-blooded as his reptilian counterpart.But, the film falls flat in its thin storyline and excessive slapsticks. Gone are the deep and serious emotional contents of previous Disney films, instead `Monsters, Inc.' focuses on comical antics almost to the exclusion of all else. While this approach keeps the under-12 fully entertained, it can leave the rest of the older-aged audience peeved at times. Mike and Sulley's attempts to return the human kid to Earth comes across like an extended version of a Mickey-Donald-Goofy situation comedy. Although that is not a bad idea, it does not make the story any more interesting than it already isn't. Mike is occasionally annoying when he breaks into comedy. Yes, he is supposed to be the funny monster opposite Sulley, and therefore gets most of the comedy routines. His problem is that not all of his routines delivered their punches. Case in point: Apartment scene of Mike's motivational' speech to Sulley when Sulley is doing morning exercises. But he is not alone. The frequent monster-infected-by-objects-belonging-to-human-kids gigs dehydrate with every repetition. John Ratzenberger's brief appearance as the abominable snowman provides a little relief, only a little .`Monsters, Inc.' is not bad compared to most animated films of this year. It is at least more family friendly than the summer-released `Atlantis: The Lost Empire'. But Disney & Pixar's fourth animated film isn't so good next to its predecessors. It lacks the heartfelt storytelling of `Toy Story 2' and the wit and colorful characterization of `A Bug's Life'. It is enjoyable for a good laugh, but only if you are young enough at heart.Spellcaster's Level 6",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
was disappointed.,"After seeing Toy Story 1 and 2, and A Bugs Life, I really went into Monsters Inc. expecting it to better than the previous Pixar films, but was disappointed.I must admit I'm 23 years old, and perhaps a little too old for this type of film. I just feel that Monsters Inc. lacked the type of humor that is both appealing to adults and kids that Toy Story and A Bugs Life had.To sum up my thoughts on Monsters Inc., I think it was just a cute and clever little movie for the younger audience (5-12 yrs old).

Probably the greatest animated film ever,"In the recent Shrek-o-mania craze, people have overlooked a movie that I believe far surpasses the green ogre flick in cinematic value. Pixar, the superb computer animation studio, has come out with a fourth incredible feature-length film, Monster's Inc.In what besides a Pixar film would a short one-eyed green monster (Billy Crystal) do a triple somersault to land fully straddling a metal beam in order to make a baby laugh. Ouch...Personally, I loved Shrek for its pop culture and fairy tale references. But while Shrek revolved around gross-out humor Monster's Inc. had slapstick, stand-up, cultural, and ironic humor that I thought made it a more real and substantial feel. Also, the monster-in-the-closet tale is so hilarious when put into the context of a corporation that scares people for power. It's a movie that Dreamworks with all its creativity and processing power couldn't have made.And the film's not just for kids. The aforementioned triple-flip gag and other references can keep anyone watching at least for at least as long as Shrek.All in all, this is a great film for any age, and may be the greatest animated film of all time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Show is for keeps,"A great number of the previous user comments (and a great number of those coming after mine, I would suspect) make the comparison between this animated movie and Shrek, Harry Potter, (the upcoming at time of press) Lord of the Rings, and Pixar's earlier shows. I'm not here to rehash all that.Let me start out by saying that you'll read no spoilers here. Also, to each his own. While the overwhelming number seem to enjoy the film (as did I), others did not, and some of them make objective sense.That said; this is a truly clean movie. I am not one of those people who can read SEX into smoke plumes, but I detected no 'signals' (hidden or otherwise) of any sort. Adult themes do not come into play here, save the usual kissy stuff that may have offended a century ago, but not today. I would recommend the show to almost any age without reservation. This is a movie that (on the basis of suitability alone) should feature a prominent place somewhere on your video shelf.Next, the storyline. I liked Shrek, mind you, and Pixar's previous movies. Lord of the Rings is on my 'must watch' list as well, but Monsters, Inc is good enough to appeal on several levels at the same time. It is something new, although you might catch on to the 'most powerful' energy source (untapped at the beginning of the show) as soon as it is featured. If your children liked it at 3, they'll like it at 13, 23, and 30, but for more and different reasons.I have a heard a great deal about Harry Potter, prominently from the Christian fundamentalists who thoroughly disapprove of the entire concept. I'm a Christian fundamentalist-type myself, but don't let me put a crimp in your enjoyment. Never did like the chap, even when I first heard of him. Personally, I would prefer David Eddings' books be made into movies, except the gentleman doesn't want to do so. At any rate, Monster, Inc will never suffer that kind of adverse 'publicity', and I strongly doubt its effects will seem dated 50 years down the track (which will happen to Harry Potter, believe me!) Animation had its privileges; I still love Mickey Mouse and he's fairly old for a house rodent.Many shows require you to suspend your disbelief, and turn your brains off. Monsters, Inc doesn't require you to do so - at least, it does it for you very subtly. Just watch it. This show is a keeper.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toy Story, part 4","It seems that computer animated films are stuck in a rut. Of the three computer animated films this year, Final Fantasy has seemed to break the mold, but failed to create a plot worth making it a great breakthrough for animation. Monsters Inc. is the 4th installment of Pixar, a company who seems to do AMAZING animation but always sticking it to a ""film that is enjoyable for young and old"" formula, which is beginning to get stale. It is bad enough the praised Shrek, follows in this formula, with Dreamworks going away from more brilliant computer animated films like Antz.Don't get me wrong, I DID LIKE THE FILM! I am just saying that Pixar needs to do something different before it becomes stale.Monsters Inc. had one moment in which Sully (the horned ape-looking thing) is sledding down a hill, my jaw was on the floor for this scene because the animation was so realistic that it looked as if I was watching an actual moving figure in stop motion animation, like something you would see out of Nightmare Before Christmas.All in All, see the movie if you are a fan of animation, Pixar, or just have kids.

Between Shrek and Monsters inc.,"Let's make a comparison between two mayor animated feature length movies: Shrek and Monsters inc. With Shrek Dreamworks proved that they could make an hilarious comedy (whether you like the voice casting and fart jokes or not) which looked stunning in the visuals. One thing lacked though, something that the guys at Pixar are well known for: Articulation. And i don't mean only facial articulation, i also mean: with the body-movement While Shrek tries to copy human-like poses with waving arms, straightening your hair etc, Monsters inc. shows real animation-like poses, reminiscent of two dimensional cartoons like Tom and Jerry. (they even skip frames to make characters move even faster then normal) In the documentary that is included on the dvd the guys at dreamwork brag about making Fiona less humanlike in her environment otherwise she stands out to much. What they mean is: We couldn't do any better. I'm not bashing Shrek. No, i liked Shrek. A lot. I thought Pixar couldn't top this one. But then i saw Monsters inc that blew me away. Shrek may have a more adult approach that works really well. But storywise they made a few mistakes. I think i'm quoting somebody by saying: It is not okay to judge somebody by appearance but they do make jokes about size. All in all without being too nittpicky, a highly enjoyable movie. Monsters inc. has a cute story to tell and some people who commented about it being too tame should consider this: It's much easier to go for a cheap laugh then to tell a story that could move you without it being cruel or rude. Shrek aims for parody and thus is ment for an older audience (but kids will like it as well, maybe on a slightly different level) Shrek has some awesome photorealistic settings but rather pathetic looking backgrounds. The guys start bragging again about 3 million different leaves that move on trees independently but it's hardly noticable. Pixar choose a much brighter color palette giving it a more cartoon-feel. And what about characters? Monsters inc. has plenty: The animation on Randall is superb. Boo is really cute. While shrek has a beautiful animated princess, Pixar goes overboard Mike Wakowski. While not the funniest character in the movie, his animation is nearly flawless. (And don't get me started on Sulley ) Love the snowman as well. And the nerdy monster with the braces. The little monster that shouts: ""Mike Wakowski"". Shrek doesn't top Monsters inc. Just wait untill you see the spectacular doorchase-scene. Let's be honest people. Shrek was a pretty damn good movie but didn't have so much settings and should be considered a well-done-parody on disney animations (while still beeing a story on it's own). Job well done. Monsters inc wasn't as hilarious as Toy Story but did tell a touching story. (and yes you could guess the ending after 20 minutes, But before you get to that point the story has taken different directions that make it worthwhile) Nonetheless:  Animation-wise i'd prefer Pixar because they obviously know how to make a proper animated flick. But i'm still curious enough to see what dreamworks is up too. Both companies are both improving their work to ""stay in the race"". Dreamworks is still learning from each experience. I dunno, i kinda like it. Makes it worthwhile to go to the cinema. And please let's just forget that piece of crap: Final Fantasy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Outside the box,"Take the premise that MONSTERS are just working stiffs, then start thinking outside the box.The adults (those who still have an inner child) enjoyed this.  The children enjoyed it.  The theater was almost full on a Wednesday matinee, and everyone was well behaved.  Boo was a spoiled brat, so I identified with her more than with Mike and Sully, even if I have to play their role (adult) in real life.Seems a shame that a message about conservation and corporate greed can only be made by a large corporation, but here it is.Oh, and if you meet Mike-- ask him how he managed to make Kindergarten the best three years of his life.  Don't monsters have social promotion, too?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good,"Just saw this at an advance screening. I had very low expectations to be honest because I really didn't see how they could have made a second Monster's Inc movie.But it wasn't bad at all. It definitely isn't as good as the first but Pixar has proved time and time again that they know how to play with our emotions and make us relate to these weird looking characters. And this was no different. First of all I was surprised to see that this was pretty much Mike's story and not equally centered on both Mike and Sully. I liked this since the first was more about Sully and Boo. I also liked how they didn't play too much on the college movie stereotype. I mean there are a lot of predictable moments but again the writing and emotions are spot on.My biggest gripe would probably be the fact that since this is a prequel we know how everything sorta turns out. So when they win the Scare Games I knew something was gonna go wrong because Mike isn't a scarer in the first movie. Also the absence of a character like Boo is definitely noticeable, especially since she was such a big part of what made the first movie so great. I guess since this one is more of Mike's personal story this isn't really a big deal though.I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I was really blown away by this film. It was enjoyable from start to finish: there were so many creative moments and characters, the Monsters world was wonderfully rendered, the pacing was spot-on, the narrative was unusual for an animated movie, and to top it all off it was absolutely hilarious the whole way through. To me, it felt more like a fairly authentic slice of life rather than your typical college flick. These were not 1-dimensional caricatures by any stretch. (See: Sully being a jock and a frat boy the whole way through, as well as Randall's slow transformation from nerdy kid to utter douche.) There were also some great Bay Area moments, like the Oakland cranes and bits and pieces of the Cal campus.I'm gonna have to disagree with the critics on this one: Monsters University ranks among Pixar's better movies.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Should get the Oscar..but,"Finally saw Monsters Inc and in the right company; a ten andeleven year old. I was in awe; an utterly magical film. The wholemovie - story, characters, acting, animation - was perfectlyrealised.Many people (including myself on other postings) moan about howmovies used to be so much better (and I think we are often right!),but when you see something like this...well the expression ""it's apleasure AND a privilege"" can never have been more true.Much, much better than Shreck - funnier, cleverer, warmer, muchmore ambitious animation. This is how it should be done.Monsters inc should, if there is any fairness, win the first animationOscar, but sadly I suspect that the industry insiders are gong to gofor Shreck, come what may.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cute and lighthearted.,"I saw this movie with my boyfriend and while I appreciated the adorable nature of the characters, he marvelled over the ""excellent animation blah blah blah"".I must say I loved the scene in the beginning where Sulley is sleeping, and as he breathes in and out the wispy strands of fur on his arm move back and forward... Love it when he gets covered in snow, too!All in all, I found it entertaining. It's good to, now and then, see something you can just relax and watch rather than get caught up in subplots, suspicions, continuity errors, bad acting etc etc.Good for kids and grownups, too.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
a little too schmaltzy,"contains some spolilers...If you can remember the days when you had to stand for `God Save The Queen', they had a half time and only one screen at your local cinema, you'll love Monsters Inc.  The fact it starts off with a digital cartoon short will take you back to the heady days when Warner Bros. cartoons were the stock standard introduction to any movie.Then you're thrown head long into the world of Monsters Inc., the company that provides electricity to the city of Monstropolis by collecting the energy generated by terrified children's screams.  The opening scene is pure genius, with a trainee scream collector as terrified of his victim as the child is of him.  But not all is what you think, with a nice twist thrown in right at the beginning.The best scream catcher at the factory is Sulley (John Goodman), who we meet as he prepares for his day's work under the watchful eye (pun intended) of his trainer and mentor Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  At the plant he's everybody's hero, while chameleon like monster, Randall Boggs is obsessed with knocking him off his perch.Things go awry when a small child enters the world of monsters.  The monsters are as terrified of children as children are of them, thinking that children carry terrible viruses that will destroy their hidden world.  But Sulley connects with the intruder, whom he names Boo, and decides it's up to him and Mike to save her.  That means getting her back through the closet door that will return her to the world of humans.  But it's easier said than done, with Randall and Monsters Inc. CEO, Henry J Waternoose, doing their best to banish Sulley and Mike while using Boo for their evil means.Telling you too much more would spoil the story, but I can tell you, that since Disney are involved, it has a happy ending.And that was the problem for me, not that I don't appreciate happy endings.  I found Monsters Inc. to be too schmaltzy for my taste.  The continual use of violins in the soundtrack became a little overbearing and were used as signposts to let you know that now was a good time to get emotional.Perhaps the writers should have taken note of their own story line - that children don't scare as easily any more.  A few more scares and less sugar would have made a world of difference.  It also lacked the wit of Shrek - perhaps the best animated feature this year?Now, please don't get me wrong and take it that Monsters Inc. is a bad movie; it's just that it could have been a lot better.  If you want to know what it could have been like, check out Real Monsters on Nickelodeon, a cartoon that has real wit for the adults and plenty of slapstick for the littlies.But when it comes to the perfect kids movie for over the school holidays, you couldn't go far wrong with Monsters Inc.  Children will love the delightful, almost cuddly monsters that aren't really scary at all.  The animation is of the highest standard, with everyone of Sulley's hairs lovingly rendered and attention to the smallest details making the movie life like.But perhaps the best thing about Monsters Inc. is that it will help your children realise that all those scary things that go bump in the night are just doing their job.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Undemanding, entertaining, laugh-a-minute stuff. Go see!","I love those nature programmes that take you to the depths of the ocean and show you a myriad life-forms that bear little resemblance either to one another or to anything familiar. Apparently the folk at Pixar do too. But a clever computer-graphical interpretation of Mother Nature's sweet little imagination wouldn't make for much of an entertaining time. Fortunately this film also has wit, slapstick, pathos and adventure in just the right proportions. I laughed, I cried, I was amused by the homage to Ray Harryhausen and the nods to Star Wars, James Bond, Mission Impossible, Toy Story, The Wrong Trousers, Reservoir Dogs (yes really!) not to mention the many more that I probably missed by blinking or not paying attention (Fargo, apparently, for example). Overall, a romping hoot from start to finish, not in the least let down by the straightforward see-it-a-mile-off plot. If only humans could act that well. 9/10.P.S. Why was The Abominable Snowman using a crate of lingonberries (tautologically labelled ""Swedish lingonberries"") as a seat? A seemingly pointless choice, albeit an amusing one. Is there an influential Swede working at Pixar? Hmmm...",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not all the magic has died in Hollywood...,"Not everything in Hollywood has to be gratuitous sex and violence. At least that's what Monsters Inc. proves to moviegoing audiences of all ages. Animated by the now-legendary Pixar, Monsters Inc. tells the story of the best ""scare team"", Mike and Sully, in ""Monstropolis"" the world that exists on the other side of every child's closet door when the lights go out at bedtime. Mike and Sully's job is relatively simple; to make sure that each child visited by them is made to scream in fright, since Monstropolis' power supply is dependant on children's screams of fright to power their homes, heat, cars and so forth.Monsters Inc. shows kids that the monsters in their closets are just workers like people in this world, and that their being scared is just  average, work-a-day employment for an industry for which they provide a raw material. The film does this in a fun way that many kids can relate to, much like seeing mom and dad go to the office every day, with co-workers, time off and a old fashioned, stuffed shirt boss.Mike and Sully's day to day routine is disrupted, however, by an adorable, chubby cheeked little girl named ""Boo""., who thinks that the large, blue haired Sully is an endless source of fun and entertainment, following him through her closet to the scare factory, making the hulking ""scarer"" tremble, since he has been led to believe that a child's touch is fatal to monsters. He soon learns the truth, and eventually risks all to save little Boo and return her to the human world with the aid of his co-worker, friend and assistant, Mike.This movie has something for the adults and children who watch it. Numerous ""hat tips"" to familiar adult icons of the entertainment industry, such as Harry Hausen and even the comedian Gallagher are interjected with tounge in cheek humour, where the kids don't have to understand the references... it's just another locale or funny piece of eye-candy for them. The real value in this movie is in it's replayability for your kids. If you have the DVD or video, you no doubt have a child who has asked you to let them watch it again and again. I know mine has.... the thing is, you *want* them to watch it again. It shows a tenderness and caring between charachters in their situations that, under the surface, transcends any differences. It doesn't matter to Boo that Sully is a great, big fuzzy monster with horns on his head, it';s his actions that she watches and his gallantry on her behalf that binds her to him as they go through their adventure together. And perhaps there's a message in there for all of us, not just the kids...",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, AND DID I MENTION BRILLIANT?","Monsters Inc. has only been in cinemas three days and it is already huge - and it is easy to see why! Monsters Inc. is a company that supplies electricity for the monster world. And guess where they get it from? Children's screams! The scariest monsters in Monsters Inc. go through doors to children's rooms, and scare them. Their agents collect the electricity from their screams. But the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them! If a child's sock is on a monster's back, it's a 2319 and the CDA (Child Detection Agency) comes and blows up the sock! The top scarer at Monsters Inc. is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley. He's a big cuddly monster that for some reason children find scary. The second scariest monster is Randall. Randall is resentful of Sulley for getting all the praise in Monsters Inc. Sulley's best friend is his agent, Mike, a sort-of mini cyclops who is totally harmless - but can split your sides, he's so funny! To tell the story briefly, Sulley & Mike find a cute little toddler in their world, whom they call Boo. In their quest to return her home, they get mixed up in Randall's plot to take over Monsters, Inc. When the time comes to return Boo, Sulley realises he doesn't want to. He's bonded with Boo and gained her trust. But he has to, and they shred her door because she knows too much about the monster world. Because they've shredded the door, Sulley will never be able to see Boo again. Sulley becomes the head of Monsters Inc. and they don't use screams for power - they use laughter. They go through the doors and crack jokes to the kids instead of scaring them. But then Mike resurrects Boo's door - and this is a very touching moment, as Sulley has saved one tiny piece of Boo's door. Mike says, ""It only works if you have every piece."" and then Sulley slides it in - and goes through the door. He is greeted with 'kitty!' which is what Boo calls him. And then it ends...Monsters Inc. is funny, moving, and it's Pixar. All I can say is MIMO - miss it, miss out.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

****1/2 out of 5,"""Welcome to Monsters Incorporated where we scare because we care."" Disney/Pixar have always been known as the kings of 3D animated features ever since Toy Story was released. But now after DreamWorks dropped a bomb on the head of 3D animation with Shrek, Pixar needed to release a creation upon the world to place themselves back atop the thrown that they helped to created, so now we have Monsters Inc., Pixar's newest brainchild. Our story is a very complex one. We are throw into the world of monsters where everything is fuelled by children's screams. We follow the lifestyle of Sully, the highest ranked scarrer and his partner. best friend Mike. This is where the story breaks off into two sections. On one side of the story there is Randall, a scheming lizard who wants to be the top scarrer. Then we have a little girl who accidentally gets released into the monster world. All hell breaks lose because monsters just so happen to be as scared of humans as we are of them but Sully befriends the child and even comes to love her. When making animated features story is key, you can have the best animation out there but without a good story you have nothing to work with. Here, as with Shrek, is a very creative and original story on a misunderstood stereotype. The film easily has the best animation from Pixar to date and the Voice work from Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Jennifer Tilly, James Coburn and Steve Buscemi as fabulous but what truly makes this film a winner is that the monsters are given human traits and live there lives like any other normal human being would. They are also given heart, which sets us up for a lesson, never judge someone by what they look like because deep down inside there is always something special to be found. Now you either would have to be dead of blind to not think that Shrek was hilarious in ever aspect of the word, the humour was enough to keep the kids entertained but also keep the adults just as interested. Well I will admit that Monsters Inc. is downright funny, often time hilarious, but most of the humour seem to be directed to a young age margin, making a lot of the jokes seem childish and fall flat at times. Not to mention these jokes and gags are shot at the viewer at such a fast rate that a lot of them are just misfires and take away from the comic value of the really good jokes, making this a little harder to stomach for the older audience. Still because the film has a heart of gold and some genuine hilarity it is sure to go down in time as a true classic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What is this strange feeling?,"I don't believe I've ever had this feeling walking out of a Disney/Pixar film. Oh, sure, it happens during Disney films, but never when Pixar is involved. I can't quite pinpoint what it is. I guess it could be best described as...disappointment.Well, it was unfortunately bound to happen someday. The good folks at Pixar have given us a sub-par (by their very, very high standards) film. Oh, sure, the cast was top-notch, especially Billy Crystal and John Goodman as our protagonists Mike and Sully. The story was awfully creative. Seeing those monsters in our closet as real, working people was a great idea. What went wrong? It felt like the movie was lacking something, that the old charm from the ""Toy Story"" movies was gone. Many of the jokes, especially in the first part of the film, fell flat. It felt as if they weren't even trying, or else that they were trying too hard. Much of the first half of the film was spent looking at the screen in bewildered silence.However, there were also some pleasant surprises to be found. Ever since I saw young Boo in the advertisements for this film, I was sure she was going to be one of those characters who was so cute that she made you want to gag. As it turned out, despite one or two sickening moments, she wasn't too bad. The scenes between her and Sully were filled with very well-played emotion, making the audience feel warm and fuzzy instead of nauseous. Also, normally the endings to these movies are pretty weak. Although it was weaker than that of, say, ""Toy Story 2"", it was much better than what I expected, filled with both funny and touching moments.So, if you decide to see ""Monsters, Inc."" be forewarned of this: You too may have a slightly hollow feeling inside upon walking out of this film, and you too may ask yourself, ""What's wrong with this picture?""",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Extra! Extra! Scream all about it!,"Monsters, Inc. is a great movie. It has cute characters, a fun story and fantastic visuals. This is definitely a movie you can watch with the kids. You won't be bored and the kids won't pick up any nasty new words.The story of Monsters, Inc. revolves around Mike and Sully, the best scarers on the payroll at the Monsteropolis power plant. One day a human child is accidentally brought into the monster world and the race to find her and get her out of Monsteropolis is on. Mike and Sully are on the case but the somewhat shifty Randall is also showing undue interest in the child. Without giving away too much, let's just say that Randall is involved in an insidious plot to get more screams out of the kiddies while Mike and Sully just want to get her out of town so they can go back to work.Of course, these little problems always seem to get worse before they get better. The power plant is crawling with CDA (Child Detection Agency) agents making it tough for Mike and Sully to sneak the kid back through the door into her bedroom, not to mention keeping her out of Randall's clutches. Their efforts to send the tyke home culminate in a chase in and out of doors leading to exotic locals all over the human world. How does it end? Go see the movie.The best part of this movie is the imagination. The complex industrial environment of Monsters, Inc., the great details on the characters, the smooth colors and various cool visual effects. The casting of Billy Crystal and John Goodman in the lead roles works quite nicely, with Crystal's Mike Wazowski stealing the show. The ending chase through the power plant and in and out of the doors is fast-paced and exciting, with lots of action and great eye candy.The only thing I didn't like about this movie were Randall's blatant attempts to kill off Sully. I thought this was just a little to violent; it doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie.Overall, I give Monsters, INC. a score of 7/10. It is definitely worth watching and if you're still a kid at heart, it's worth owning.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Monster Zinc,"Perhaps I've seen too many 'twist' movies lately, but I really was expecting to see a monster called 'Zinc' as a sort of play on words. I couldn't really understand why else would they have chosen such a rubbish title! I mean, how many kids are going to understand it? How about: 'Mum, there's a monster in my closet' ? OK, not too great, but Monsters Inc? There wasn't even a scary squid to squirt a bit of this famous 'inc'. Overall, I think the film is good, but, save for a few bits of genius, it's not in the same league as the 2 Toy Story movies, and is definitely not as good as 'Shrek' which was the best animation movie since Buzz Lightyear and Co. (Now, I've started doing it. It could have been 'Monsters.Com'. Anything's better than inkless 'inc'). The great bits are Billy Crystal's 'eye', which confirms that he is best suited to hiding his body from us; the very original concept of the 'monsters-eye view'; and the chase on the doors, which I think is probably the best bit of any animated movie I've ever seen. It's the meat and veg of the film which I found a bit wanting. A sub-plot was craved to take the heat out of the little girl's interference with the monster world. There seemed to be a lot more mileage to be had from the doorways to different worlds, but I expect we'll get that in 'MI 2' Oh no, they can't use that title. 7 out of 10, but overrated, I'm afraid.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It's has the wacked logic of a Gary Larson ""Far Side"" cartoon come to life.  What I loved are the amazing details- the purring snakes in Celia's hair, the various shaped monsters that populate the town, the amazing facial expressions of Boo, the human child that wanders into Montropolis.   There is almost no preachy moral to the story, no real social message, just 90 minutes of endless fun (oh, and the fate that awaits the bad monster, I think I broke blood vessels laughing too hard!)",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
well-crafted and sure to please,"Pixar delivers again in this enjoyable animated feature about the monster world.

They both have their hands full when a human child inadvertently stumbles upon the monster factory.

In their world, the screams of small children create the power that runs the city--and nobody's better at scaring kids than Sulley.  He does a dangerous job (it's widely known that children are toxic), and he does it with pride.Of course, in every workplace there's an office backstabber, and Monsters, Inc. has its own resident workplace bully in the person (monster?) of Randall, the second-best scarer in the factory.  Through Randall's machinations, a child gets loose in the monster world, with disastrous results.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best animated movie ever!,"You know what, this movie is the cutest disney animated flick ever made. John Goodman is good as Sullivan, Billy Crystal is so funny as Mike Wazowski. But the funniest part to me, is when Boo, voiced by little Mary Gibbs, enters the Monster world by accident, and causes chaos. so  Sully and Wazowski, try hard to return her t her world, even though theyre being warted by Randall Boggs voiced by Steve Buscemi, and Waternoose voiced by James Coburn. Anyway, I reccomend this movie to all kids and grownups, ans I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I say 10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A disappointment of monster proportions!,"Toy Story it isn't.  In fact, Monsters, Inc. doesn't measure up to any of the last three Disney/Pixar outings - except maybe in the animation stakes - and even then it isn't a significant leap forward.Sure, the voice acting is great, and there are a couple of funny moments, but the plot is very weak (you'll guess the outcome well before the end of the movie) and the odd bit of great animation isn't going to change that.Kids in the audience were audibly bored of the movie half way through, as was I.Don't expect any jokes to appeal to the older members of the audience, as they did in ""Toy Story"" & ""A Bug's Life"", because this one, it seems, is aimed squarely at the kids.I wondered why there was such a frenzied marketing hype surrounding this movie prior to its release, more so than the other Pixar films (which were masterpieces, in my humble opinion).After seeing the movie, I now know why.Rent or buy the other Pixar movies instead!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
monster inc,"Monster inc is a great movie for kids and adults to see.It stars Billy Crystal,Bob Peterson,Frank Oz,James Coburn,Jennifer Tilly,John Goodman,John Ratzenberger,Mary Gibbs,and Steve Buscemi.Directed by David Silverman,Lee Unkrich,Pete Doctor,Sulley and Mike's successful careers at Monsters, Inc. are suddenly under threat when they accidentally let a human child into the monster world. The problem is that monsters are terrified of children, and anything associated in any way with children is banned in Monstropolis. The little girl is called Boo (Mary Gibbs), and Sulley and Mike will have to find a way to hide her while they try to figure out how to get her home.

An entertaining morality story,"As a person in their mid 50's, I watched this with just my wife - no children or grandchildren as an excuse. We were pleasantly surprised at a slight departure for Disney - metaphors all over the place. The characters had to face up to the real problems of the work place, not the usual fairy tale pap. Basically its a story about the little man against the evils of big business, brilliantly told. The goodies are not super good but decent with consciences, whilst the bad are morally corrupt - far closer to reality than Disney has ever got before. We appreciated the humour of the 'out-takes' at the closing credits. All in all a kids film made for adults.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A fun, great movie.","I must admit that while I make it a point to see all animated films at some point, what drew me to this movie was Billy Crystal and John Goodman providing the voices for our heroes.  I'm a big fan of both actors, and Monsters Inc has found itself into my library.  To those who love this more than Shrek, I am going to put forth that Shrek had some points over this film in terms of pace, storytelling and originality, but Monsters Inc, in my book, comes in to a really close second to this film, helped along by its animation, witty jokes, great action and voice talent.

a full-filled family movie,"The majority of so-called ""family"" or ""kids movies"" recently have been full of lame-brained ""jokes"" such as bathroom humor and gross-out stuff. In MONSTERS, INC., we have a terrific family comedy that kids and parents alike can enjoy, with not a single gross-out joke or spot of bathroom humor to be seen. Kids will like the comic situations, and parents will get some of the more grown-up jokes, but both will delight in a fun-filled adventure about monsters and the world they in. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are spot-on with their vocal talents, with Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and veteran James Coburn rounding out the supporting cast. It all moves at a pretty good pace and has good honest laughs scattered throughout the story. One moment may be a tad scary for real little kids (the scene where Buscemi's Randall is threatening to physically extract Boo's screams from her), but the film is pretty light the rest of the time, with everything building up to a fun, thrilling climax involving the millions of closet doors the monsters use to enter the real world. A good-spirited kids movie that the whole family can enjoy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cute.  Just plain cute.,"I'm probably not supposed to do this, but comparisons between Monster's Inc. and Toy Story 1 and 2 are inevitable.  The story concept behind Monster's Inc., although clever, isn't quite as clever as that of the Toy Story series (particularly Toy Story 1).  The plot, in addition, is much simpler and less involved than those of either Toy Stories.  Still though, this is a great movie simply because of its enormous adorability factor--a big furry monster, a goofy eyeball monster, and an absolutely adorable little girl (without a doubt the most adorable character I've seen in any movie ever, animated or live).I won't say anything about the details of the story as most have below.  You should just watch it and enjoy.  Overall, not as good as Toy Story (the yardstick by which all future Disney/Pixar movies will be judged), but a very cute and very touching story nonetheless.  The ending nearly brought tears to my eyes.  Great flick.  I will definitely purchase this one on DVD.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
We scare because we care,"Monsters Inc. Takes use to a world of monsters we we meet Mike (Billy Crystal) & James P Sullivan(John Goodman). The top scare team at monsters Inc a company whose job is to go into the human world, scare children so they can use screams to power their world. The two of them are at the top of their game and close to breaking the all time scare record. It's all going well until one night Sully comes across a door left, and by accident he ends up letting a human girl named Boo into the monster world. Now mike & Sully have to find away to get boo home, but also uncover a much more sinister plot. Monsters Inc was always one of favorite when I little though keep in mind this was earlier in Pixar's career so they didn't really have much back then. Rewatching it I ended up still enjoying it and getting some and getting some of the things that I didn't necessarily get when I was younger Like the odorant or Harryhausen. The Plot overall is pretty original I like the concept of how this world works and how everything is powered, the concept of scaring I can't be the only who was curious how the door worked. Evening look back on it now the visuals don't really look very dated at all the monster still look good especially Sully the fur effects on him still move very great for 2001. The characters Mike and Sully both are likeable characters really enjoyed their Banter between each other. Even though some the jokes with mike don't always hit still both funny characters. Of course the biggest grasp with the movie is the relationship between sully and Boo. It's very heartwarming how they go from being scared of this little girl and turned around to protect her. Boo's cute and gets some smiles, but do it expect much. And Steve Buscemi as Randall is great just because he's Steve Bucemi. The C. D. A you wouldn't believe how many kids were going around shouting 2319. Overall it's enjoyable movie but it's little basic by today's standards with the amount of films now. Though that's what makes it good that it's not really over complex and it's always good for a watch just to sit down and relax without having to take to serious.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good or bad? Read my blurb and find out,"Yep, that's right, in light of upcoming awards ceremony, I will have to make the obligatory Shrek reference. And that is only to say that I personally believe all Pixar films blow Shrek out of the water. That this is my favorite one yet is only icing on the cake.I found MI to be irresistibly sweet. It wasn't as funny--no, make that hilarious--as Toy Story 2, but it was so much deeper that I didn't care at all. Watch this movie and try NOT to adore Boo, the little girl.

"Warm and fuzzy feelings of sweetness and inocence with sprinkles of laughter, sparks a world of energy!","Walt Disney and Pixar Productions succeeded once again with the film, Monsters Inc. (2001). What a fun movie, with emotion and lots of humor. Monsters Inc. shows that life is greatly enriched and energized with the presence of joyful children. One of the scenes that emphasizes the great energy of a happy child is when the main monsters, Sulley and Mike, bring a child, Boo, to their home in an attempt to hide her. So that she does not cry and scream zapping the energy of the city of Monstropolis, Mike makes her laugh thus creating an endless amount of energy enough to light up the entire city. Early on in this movie, children are perceived as toxic intruders in the city. The monsters work frantically to get Boo back to her own environment. However, with all the chaos that develops in trying to complete this task, one monster, Sulley, learns the joy of having a child in his life. Two scenes demonstrate the enrichment of a joyful child in one's life. The first scene is when Sulley puts Boo to bed for the first time after bringing her home; his heart begins to soften with the sweetness of Boo as she sleeps. The second scene depicting this is near the end when Sulley walks out onto the Laugh Floor with a clipboard in hand. On the clipboard taped under the paperwork is a piece from Boo's door and a picture she drew of him holding hands with her. Clearly, Sulley is energized with the love and happiness of Boo in his life. Another movie that follows the same concept of a joyful child enriching one's life is I Am Sam (2001). How ironic that the two movies came out the same year. In the movie I Am Sam, a mentally-challenged father faces many obstacles raising his daughter from birth. The ultimate challenge he encounters is fighting the legal system that believes the child should be removed from his care and placed into a foster home. Yet, because of the love she gives him and the happiness she brings to his world, he is energized to continue his battle seizing what belongs to him.Monsters Inc. suggests this theme throughout the movie as Sulley realizes that children are an asset and must be kept safe. No longer should they be scared. A wealth of goodness is added to life when happy children are present. Both the children and monsters benefit from the affect of humor as it creates laughter and radiates positive attitudes. A motif of children's toys is in almost every scene. With the toys in sight, it reminds us not to take life so seriously, that one forgets how to laugh and have fun. At the scream plant, the atmosphere is dull, dark and competitive at the beginning of the movie. It is all work and meeting quotas with the large scream board indicating each monster's performance. Near the end of the movie, you see the plant lit up with sunshine coming in the windows, balloons all-about, banners saying `Think Funny' and the board now labeled as the laugh board reflecting the `Joke of the Day'. Because Monsters Inc. focuses on the delight of children, it encompasses several angles with the majority being at eye-level, a level of a child. Early on in the movie, you see a deep-focus shot of all of the monsters coming onto the scream floor of the plant to begin work. This shot was adopted from the movie All The Right Stuff. The shot highlights the importance of these monsters and what they are about to do.Pete Docter has brilliantly mastered the art of computer-animation with this movie. So much detail is involved. One example is Boo's T-shirt that freely moves while her body stays in place. Her movements express her energy level through the scene with catching Cheerios in her mouth thrown to her by Sulley. Docter eases small viewers' minds as he creates a vision of monsters who really are not evil but rather just like one of themselves. They see monsters get into trouble for being bad. And yet, he portrays most monsters in a good light reinforcing that a child can bring out the best in them. So he turns closets once feared by children like himself, into a stage of entertaining monsters filled with enthusiasm. Monsters Inc. is a wonderful, whimsical film showcasing that children as well as monsters benefit from each other through laughter and a positive outlook in their lives. Warm and fuzzy feelings of sweetness and innocence with sprinkles of laughter, sparks a world of energy!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"If you're old and single, and you have to borrow a kid, GO AND SEE IT","Pixar has come up with another winner, as with most animation it relies on all the pieces coming together to make it work, if the animation is great but the story is lousy, it's just a well animated lousy film, but this is one where everything works perfectly. The animation is what you'd expect from Pixar ie damned good the story is fabulous the characters are lovable and watchable and the voices give the characters personalityOn a par with Toy Story, Monsters Inc is a company that generates power by making kids scream ('we scare because we care'). The scarers are just run of the mill Joes who clock on and off during their shift, and aim for the exalted title of scarer of the month. Sully is the king of the screams, a big bluey green bear like monster who wins scarer of the month time after time. His friend and sidekick is Mikey, an eye on legs basically, who is the comic sidekick to the rather more serious Sully. Mike and Sully work on the factory floor as a team, Mike controls a conveyor which brings the doors which allow Sully access to the kids via their closets. When Sully goes in, does his act to make the children scream, Mike collects the energy, which is used to power the City the Monsters live in. The monsters work under the myth that if a child touches them they die, which gives some comic touches. One monster who comes out of a bedroom with a sock attached to his back is 'decontaminated' by the Monster Inc equivalent of SWAT. Things get more complicated when a door is left on the factory floor one evening and when Sully goes through it to check who's scaring in it, he accidentally brings back a human infant with him into the monster world. This causes all sorts of mayhem as the monsters searchfor the little girl, and Sully tries to keep her from harm as he gets to like her more the longer she's around. You really have to see it to understand the story but it well worth it. As with the latest trend, especially from Pixar there are a few in jokes, the main one being Mike taking his girlfriend to the poshest restaurant in town which is called Harryhausen's, with his girlfriend bearing more than a close resemblance to one of Harryhausen's best known figures Medusa, from Jason and the Argonauts. Again a trait of Pixar's is the out takes at the end so make sure you don't leave before the credits finish. A great family film from Pixar, who seem to be the next generation Disney and as long as they keep this standard up, they'll certainly be up there with them.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
more innovative than any animated movie!!!,"When I first thought on what I have seen in this animated movie..well I think it seems pretty realistic in spite of all the imaginary monsters and a monster world! I mean look at that ""Monstropolis"" city scenes.They really challenged to create a parallel world for the monsters. All details of everyday life were considered (chairs have rear openings for tails; buildings have multiple doors of different sizes). And the the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes!!! And the way I think is that monsters were really created in different sizes,shapes,colors, contrasts. they are really creative animations. Out of ordinary! For example when you look at the Celia's hair you can see the innovative animation! Mosters Inc.is better than any animation movie I have seen including ""Shrek"" and the ""Finding Nemo""..The animation is better, the story is many times more innovative and the characters are more endearing and less clichéd. Maybe Sulley's attachment for a human kid is similar to the attachment of a mammoth for a human kid in ""Ice Age"" but this is really different. While Sully is the top scare-maker at Monsters, Inc.--the electric utility of the monster world he gains a compassion for a one he scared. He learns he can get the power he needs for the monster world by making the kid laugh.And that Mike Wazowski really learns something from his friendship.I think in every way marvelous animation.

John Goodman and Billy Crystal do a great job as the main, ummm... actors in the movie, about a parallel dimension of monsters whose electricity comes from kids' screams.  While they pop out of the closet & scare the kids, a device collects the energy from the screams & powers the city. Unfortunately, one of the master scarers is thinking he can do better with new technology.  As a kid is accidently brought back to the monsters' side of the closet door, havoc ensues as the good monsters try to return her.

A little too warm and fuzzy,"Monsters Inc. creates a secret world where monsters really exist. They work for a company called Monsters Inc. and are busily scaring children all over the world to collect their screams, which are used to power the city of Monstropolis. However, the monsters live in fear of any contact with the children they scare, believing that they are highly contagious. So when a baby girl accidentally crosses over from the human world, it's the beginning of a chaotic adventure for the hero, James P 'Sully' Sullivan and his friend, Michael 'Mike' Wazowski.The voices have been well cast with Billy Crystal and John Goodman working well together as the voices of the main characters. Goodman is Sully, a big, blue hairy monster and Crystal is Mike, basically a giant eye on legs. Steve Buscemi is the villain Randall Boggs, an evil chameleon lizard intent on taking the top scarer award away from Sully. Even the smaller roles have been filled by the voices of heavyweight Hollywood actors such as Oscar-winner Jennifer Tilley (Mike's girlfriend Celia) and James Coburn (grumpy factory manager, Henry J Waternoose).Made by Pixar, the animation company behind the ground-breaking Toy Story (the first fully 3D animated feature film), Monsters Inc. shows just how far technology has developed since those early days. The characters' expressions and movements are fluid and completely convincing. However, the inventive storyline will ensure that audiences are only barely aware of the computer wizardry at work to bring Monsters Inc. to life.Unfortunately it's not quite as witty or as much fun as similar animated releases like Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life or more recently, Shrek. Those movies worked well on two levels - providing enough cuteness and action to keep the kids happy as well as plenty of 'in' adult jokes to keep the grownups entertained. Monsters Inc. just doesn't have the big laughs and veers a little too often towards warm and fuzzy. The producers definitely had small children in mind when making this movie.All in all, however, this clever behind-the-scenes spin on monsters in the closet is sure to keep kids captivated during the holidays. But make sure you're on time. There's a very funny animated short about birds shown before Monsters Inc.Rated a monstrous 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A pure gem...,"Comparisons will be many when viewing Monsters, Inc.' to its' Pixar siblings. Yet in doing so would be a great injustice. With a witty blend of adventure, warmth, humour and fantasy, this film stands above the rest and dutifully lives up to its' expectations. Monsters, Inc.' is the fourth in a series of films from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures. Its' last outing was Toy Story 2' and up until then was the best film in the series. Now, Monsters, Inc.' will have many viewers having a difficult time debating which one of the films is the best yet.      Starring the voices of John Goodman as Sully and Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski, this film follows our two lovable (and toy-friendly marketable) heroes as they unleash the worst of their horrors  a human child.  With another inventive and flexible plot, the creators of this film have assembled a fresh and fast paced comedic adventure with enough warmth that will even be conveyed to the smallest child in the theatre. The plot bases itself on a hidden city where monsters such as our two heroes scare children in order to capture their screams. Yet, there is only one problem, our monsters are actually afraid of the very children they scare. After an error occurs, a child travels into the lair of these monsters creating havoc and frenzy that only Pixar/Disney can create so well. This computer-animated film is truly a gem and displays the advancements Pixar have developed for their filmmaking. One will marvel at the technological advancements in computer animation and find themselves wanting more.  Notice Sully's fur and examine how the ripple effect affects each other fur on his body in a fluid and poetic motion. Furthermore, look at the scales when he breathes. This is just an example of the tireless effort invested in this film for a great picture that satisfies on many levels. Or if you have seen the film, notice the joyful, exasperated, detailed smile of Sully that ends the film on a touching note. The film indeed has many great points and will be pleasing to both children and adults. That said, there really is not much more to say than to sit down and enjoy a real treat.  From the creepy voice of Steve Buscemi as the villainous and slimy Randall Boggs, to the company head Mr. Waternoose voiced by James Coburn. One can analyze and hypothesize all they want, but what it comes down to is that this film will bring families together in thrills and laughs and will ultimately satisfy many. Furthermore, one must respect an animated film that contains a little twist that can catch many off guard with their gullibility when watching a children's film.

Bravo!,"In recent years, most Disney films have sacrificed heart and human emotion for ""look, no hands, ma!"" animated virtuosity, manic ""comedy"" performances by the likes of Robin Williams, and sloshy musical numbers with one eye on a Best Song Oscar and the other on a #1 Hot 100 chart position.Thankfully, ""Monsters, Inc."" rectifies the situation by being smart, witty, and cracking good fun--WITH a heart. Produced in association with Pixar, the visuals are stunning; you are actually tricked into thinking you're watching live action and certain points.But savvy effects a good film does not make. Enter John Goodman and Billy Crystal, who give voice to the film's unlikely heroes: Sully, a teddy bear-ish, blue-and-purple monster who is the good natured ""#1 Scarer"" at Monsters, Inc.; and Mike, Sully's wisecracking, one-eyed best buddy and colleague. Goodman and Crystal are pitch-perfect together, making their characters' comfortable, affectionate banter sound easy and natural.When Sully and Mike's lives are turned upside down by a ""child security breach""--Sully accidentally lets a 4-year-old tyke into the monster world--the gags and action never stop. What's most effective, however, is the growing bond between Sully and ""Boo,"" the nickname he gives to the toddler. It is sentimental and sweet without being manipulative or cloying, and offset by Mike's reactionary, seething resentment.This movie has it all: lovable characters for the kids; witty visual and verbal gags aplenty for the adults; and a rollicking good story for everyone.

Part of this success is direct reponsability of major animation studios like Pixar, who always find a way to renovate itself in every aspect.This time Pixar comes with Monsters Inc., a unique and beautiful story where action takes place in Monstropolis, a city of ""nice and colorful"" monsters that need to produce all its city's power by scaring human kids at night all over the world. Monstropolis' power company is Monsters Inc. and its top scarer employee James P. Sullivan finds himself in a wild and beautiful journey, just when Boo, a two year old kid, enters this odd world, threatens the whole city and changes Sullivan's life for good.Monster's animation is so amazing that all its character's gestures or other any small detail is shown in such a realistic way that really move ahead from animation hits like Toy Story II. The whole script a way very original, formed by a lot of funny gags related to past movies, and of course, Randy's Newman music is at its best, never so amusing, touching and delicious.Monsters is a delicate, warm funny and very touching story that deserves being one of the truly beauties of 2001.Robinson Almanzar.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

(""Sully"") Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top-scarer at Monsters, Inc., a powerplant type factory that uses children's screams as a source of power. His partner is the eyeball Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Sully does the scaring and, well, Mike takes the credit. Mike is romantically linked to Celia (Jennifer Tilly). When the two are out on an evening of romance, Sully offers to do Mike's paperwork. When he goes to the ""scaring floor"" to pick of the papers, he finds a door. He checks to door to see if anyone is scaring in there. When he turns around, the cute, adorable Boo (Mary Gibbs) is standing right there. This isn't good because children are toxic. ""A single touch could kill you,"" we are informed by Waternoose (James Colburn), the head of Monsters, Inc.Sully and Mike have to hide the little Boo (Boo's not her real name, Sully nicknames her that) so they don't get in trouble. They need to find her door and return her safely home. This won't be easy because the evil Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is after her. He's trying to beat Sully's record and become the top-scarer. Randall is lizard like thing that can blend in with the surroundings. He is bad news.I don't think that Disney/Pixar could make a bad movie. Even if the story was horrid, the visuals would be terrific and make up for it. But MONSTERS, INC. doesn't need to worry about that. It is practically perfect. Crystal and Goodman are the perfect comedic team. Crystal offers a ba-da-bing style and Goodman is the awe-shucks monster that Boo calls ""Kitty."" Boo is captured by Mary Gibbs, a real child. Not some adult voice of a Rugrat. A real little girl. That gives her more authenticity and believability.There is nothing I can complain about. Nothing at all. Except, I just wish it was longer because it was so good. I am ready for MONSTERS, INC. 2, MONSTERS, INC. 3 and even MONSTERS, INC. 4. Only if Goodman and Crystal return that is.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's not Shrek...but it sure is cute,"Shrek was put together excellently in every aspect.  Visually, Monsters Inc. is also very stunning.  While I was watching it, I couldn't help but notice the completely realistic fur on Sully.  But that's the problem, the movie didn't really grab my interest...if I'm staring at something like camera angles, lighting or computer effects, the chances are that it's not utterly brilliant and superb.  I do have to admit though that I had laughs throughout the movie (not as much as there was in Shrek) and I also couldn't help myself to adoring the little girl ""Boo"".  When you're adoring a little computer generated kid, it may be lame, but at least you know that the people at Pixar did a pretty good job putting it together.  And being a woman (estrogen-filled), there's also a lot of cute things that you just can't stop saying ""awwww"" too or shedding a tear.The one thing I really noticed though was that my 4-year-old nephew was laughing to death and I was not.  As oppose to Shrek where I was laughing to death and he was not.  Do you see the difference in comedy?Bottom line:  It's fun for kids and it's not going to kill you to see it, so it wouldn't hurt to watch Monsters Inc.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not QUITE as Good as Toy Story 2,"A solid, super-duper fun movie. Another quantum leap in technology -- Sully's fur is about the most amazing thing I ever seen computer-rendered. Boo was about fifty times more entertaining than I expected her to be. I still have to give Toy Story 2 about a 98 and Monsters about a 95 because TS2 dealt with heavier metaphysical and even theological issues. So there you have it. I'm gonna see it again at least once and buy the DVD the second it comes out.-- BH",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Charming Pixar,"Monsters, Inc. (2005)*** (out of 4)Fun Pixar film about a company that operates by having monsters go into the rooms of children, scare them and then capture their screams. Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) accidentally bring one of the children back to Monstropolis and must find a way to get her back. This was another pleasant film from the company that seems to release one winner after another. As usual, there are many gags coming out of just about every place possible with many of them aimed at children but a lot of others are aimed at parents. You have to give a film a lot of credit when it can entertain adults just as much as children. I enjoyed the fact that the movie wants to make kids believe there are monsters in the closet and that they come out when the lights go off. For an animated movie to start with this premise and then work around to where the kids won't be scared is a pretty good little trick and it works wonderfully well. Crystal and Goodman do a terrific job with their vocal work and they make for a great duo. Apparently a lot of their dialogue was recorded with the actors together and this comes across as they seem very fresh and work extremely well off one another. Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi and James Coburn all turn in fine work as well. As expected, the animation is top-notch and looks incredibly good and especially the fur on Sully. I'm not sure what it was but his fur color and the way it moved just kept getting my attention.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Definitely the family fun that you expect from Disney.,"We all really enjoyed the film....it was Disney all the way.  You have the bad guys getting their just desserts and relationships that go through ups and downs, and come out shining.  The characters were fun and the colors and visual effects were excellent.  As per usual, the cast was fantastic and everything was completely thought through and worked well.  A great family movie, definitely worth your time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar's best work so far, but there's more there","There is more to this story than just it's fantastic look and action. In Pixar's best film yet, there are also themes of loyalty and friendship, as well as betrayal and forgivness. The relationship between Sully and Mike is so well represented despite their being such an unlikely a pair. John Goodman's Sully is so well voiced you could cry (and a few of our group did at one point, but it was a moment lost on the youngest in the crowd). The writers have to be congratulated for a great story that was well told through dialogue and action. And there are many quick jokes in the background for repeated viewings to catch. Despite the glare of future marketing by Disney (I can already see the ride based on the chase scene through the factory where the closet doors are stored), this is a sweet movie and perfect for discussion of more than just what you've seen on the screen.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Laughter 10 times more powerful than fear- (if you saw the ending),"This film had all of the same action, creativity,and touching moments and CG ""romance"" that Toy Story and Shrek had. It is similar in the way of CG to our- lives today. It just keeps getting better and better. A no brainer box-office smash and blockbuster.  Another CGI Disney/Pixar classic. A sequel will  be on it's way! **** The special Episode 2 ATTACK OF THE CLONES TEASER made it look even better.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Funniest disney movie ever,I have just bought a copy of Monsters Inc. and I have to say that it has to be the best disney movie ever.  It was funny and sweet and I was laughing the whole movie.  It had a knock out cast of voices and the little girl boo was just adorable.  John Goodman and Billy Crystal did excellent jobs and I would like to thank them.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Monsters Inc. A Feast for Comic Fans,"The choice of John Goodman and Billy Crystal to voice the lead characters of Sully and Mike in the animated film ""Monsters, Inc."" was utter brilliance. In a great animated film, the voices carry such importance. Not just the leads but the entire voice cast makes the story work so magically while Pixar animators have lifted that bar up another notch with a visual feast.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's Funniest Film To Date.,"A powerhouse of imagination, creativity, heart, humour & passion, Pixar Animation Studios' funniest film to date is such a fascinating blend of excellent direction, smart screenplay, heartfelt narration, perfectly-timed humour, colourful characters, gorgeous photography, dazzling animation, terrific voice-work & mesmerizing score that it not only ranks amongst the studio's best films but is one of the greatest works of its medium as well.The story of Monsters Inc. is set in the parallel city of Monstropolis which is inhabited by monsters who travel into the human world to scare the children for their scream is what powers the whole city but they are also equally terrified of being contaminated by them for children are considered toxic. When a human child accidentally enters into their world, the titular company's top scarer & his best friend try to return her back to where she came from.Directed by Pete Docter, Monsters Inc. is narrated with such fine elegance that within few minutes into the picture, we get a clear idea of why this world exists & how it works without it being spoonfed to us. Add to that, it's full of gags & hilarious moments that keeps it a rib- tickling experience from start to finish. And then, there is Pixar's very own trademark fusion of heartfelt storytelling with stunning animation that radiates an immense sense of warmth & admiration for what it's about.As the film is an outlook on life from a monster's perspective, the story provides a massive canvas for the animators to create, design & render these characters in various shapes & sizes, and it is pretty evident on the screen what a remarkable job they've done. But where these talented minds at Pixar truly triumph is in assigning personalities to each one of them. Every monster here gets its own personality, their world is fully realized & despite the visual difference, it's effortlessly relatable.Taking a leaflet out of almost every kid's nightmare & coming up with the idea of monsters' absolute necessity to scare children, it's amazing how Pixar keeps coming up with original concepts that feel incredibly familiar yet has an originality of its own. And the process of refining that concept into a heartwarming story that viewers of all ages can relate to & then pushing the boundaries of animation with relentless innovation is exactly what makes them the best animation studio on the planet.The voice-cast is another gem for it comprises of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi & others, and they all are perfect choices for their characters. The chemistry between Goodman & Crystal is no doubt impeccable but the real charm is provided by the character of Boo; a 2-year old human girl in the monsters' world. The story is light-hearted for the most part, filled with hilarious situations n set-ups but when it goes for the dramatic effect, it nails it so well that many are sure to leave misty eyed by it.The 3D animation in itself was groundbreaking at its time of release but even after all these years, it looks damn impressive. Whether it's the realistic rendering of animated fur or the skillful use of lighting or that jaw-dropping ""door vault"" sequence, Monsters Inc raises the bar that was set by previous Pixar features and is visually enticing all the way through. Also worthy of mention are its ingenious use of camera angles, tight editing that provides a breezy flow to its narrative & Randy Newman's emotionally resonant score.On an overall scale, Monsters Inc. is one of Pixar's most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying works that takes its creativity in the storytelling department & innovation in its 3D animation to an all new realm. A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Pixar's fourth feature film & their first to be not directed by John Lasseter has been adored & cherished by viewers of all ages ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, and for the timeless classic this film is, it's gonna continue to do so for decades to come. Delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Scary,"Not much to say about this one really, except that it does what it says on the packet -- thoroughly enjoyable for both children and accompanying adults.  Or in my case, infantile computer geeks and their imaginary big - knockered amazon warrior princess friend.  Pixar's ability to churn out one impeccable after another is almost scary.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great film!,"A great film! Good character development, good story and wonderful animation. I feel sorry for anyone who thought this movie was lacking. It's a shame when pretentiousness gets in the way of enjoying a great film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Man - This Was A Lot Of Fun,"I watched this movie yesterday (Sunday) afternoon and again in the evening.Boy - I got to tell you.  This was loads of fun and Boo was so cute - with her ""Kitty"".I have nothing else to say about this movie - except - see it.  You will not be disappointed believe me.  You'll enjoy it and so will everyone else in your home - Young and Old alike.Trust me.....",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another good effort from Pixar,"Like the previous work from the gurus of computer animation, this one gets high marks for artistic excelence.  The fur on Sully's coat is alone worth the viewing--rich and vividly detailed.  Sully's partner, Mike Wazowski, is built on more simple lines--basically, a walking eyeball--but is given a full range of expression that makes him, well, human.Sully and Mike work at Monsters, Inc., a power company that fuels their dimension with the screams of frightened children.  This is dangerous work for the monsters--kids are not only becoming increasingly difficult to scare, they're believed to be a biohazard (any relation to current events is both coincidental and handled in such a manner as to not be disturbing).  So naturally, panic breaks when a toddler named Boo slips through the portal into Monstropolis.  Sully and Mike are given the task of getting Boo home; en route, they fend of the machinations of professional rival Randall (a nasty chameleon-like creature) and the Monsters Inc. CEO Waternoose (a crab-like being well-voiced by James Coburn) and of course, realize humans might not be so bad after all.As with all previous Pixar films, the supporting cast is colorful and entertaining.  Among the highlights: Mike's girl Celia, who looks like the love child of Cyclops and Medusa, and Roz, a slug with cats-eye glasses who seems to be a compilation of every dour-faced, embittered, nicotine-and-caffene-addicted drudge I've ever worked with.Despite the high-quaility animation, ""Monsters, Inc"" lacks the captivating quality that would have rocketed it into masterpiece territory.  The characters aren't as engaging as those in the Toy Story films, nor is the humor as infectious as Shrek's.  But the film has its moments; in particular, the climactic roller-coaster chase through the closet-door portals that grant the monsters access to the human world is a highlight.""Monsters, Inc."" may not be perfection, but it's a beautifully rendered and overall fun journey into another world and that's always a good thing in my book.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
