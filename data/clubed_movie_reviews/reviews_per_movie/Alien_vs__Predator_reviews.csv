"Is this a perfect movie? No, this premise had no chance of that. Is this worth viewing and entertaining? Absolutely","Alien vs. Predator (2004) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a research expedition that recently was discovered miles under the ice. The research team doesn't know the pyramid was setup as a hunting playground for Predators to test their hunting skills against the ultimate beings...and we aren't talking about humans.This movie is directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (Event Horizon) and stars Sanaa Lathan (Love & Basketball), Lance Henriksen (Pumpkinhead), Ewen Bremner (Rundown), Tommy Flanagan (Gladiator), Raoul Bova (Under the Tuscan Sun).The storyline for this picture was actually okay and was a good setup for this premise. I enjoyed the settings and the cast. I'd never complain about Lathan and Henriksen movies. The special effects were awesome and the kill and action scenes were very good, loved the depiction of both the Aliens and Predators. The alien vs predator fights were excellent, including how the face huggers were mixed in.Overall is this a perfect movie? No, this premise had no chance of that. Is this worth viewing and entertaining? Absolutely. I'd score this a 6.5-7/10 and strongly recommend seeing this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good monster action flick.,"I first saw in in a theatre in 2004.
Revisited the 109 mins unrated version recently.This is the first film installment of the Alien vs. Predator franchise, bringing together the creatures of the Alien and Predator series. In this one, scientists are caught in the crossfire of an ancient battle between Aliens and Predators as they attempt to escape a bygone pyramid.
The film is fast paced with tons of action, aided by top notch special effects n amazing set design.
Thankfully it doesnt have any shaky cam stuff, no flickering lights n none if the scene is shot in dark light. We can make out what is going on.
Compared to most films where too much darkness takes away the fun, this one doesn't have bad lighting. They have toned down the human body count n reduced the gory moments.
Nonetheless, it is a good monster action flick.
Gore wise, it is nowhere close to the original Predator.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not sure why it got such a bad mark from most people,"I went into this expecting a horrible movie. From all the reviews that I read I thought it would be HORRIBLE! I've seen many, many worse movies than this.A previous comment stated the movie went a bit too fast in explaining things and developing the characters. While I can certainly agree on the former, the latter, well, you just know most of the people are going to get wasted so character development isn't that necessary. We came to see Predators hunt and fight with Aliens.One thing I didn't like was the movie showed the Aliens more powerful than the Predators. I believe the canon shows the Predators are much more powerful than the Aliens. Regardless, I liked this movie.This movie surprised me because there were many things I didn't expect. Were some scenes over the top? Absolutely, but this is Hollywood and we're talking Aliens V Predator here :) IF you are a fan of these genres you really should give this movie a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great set-design and action - terrible dialogue,"Just watched it again yesterday - it's striking how good the action is compared to the ridiculous dialogue. I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It's hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you're able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you're in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",,Anonymous,Horror
This movie still holds up after 20 years,"AVP is one of my favourites from both the Alien and Predator franchise. It does not attain the golden standard that the first two movies in both franchises have set, but no other movie has done that. And it's now 20 years and several sequels/prequels later. I have to say AVP aged really well.But I always liked it from the start. It's very entertaining. There's all kinds of interactions between humans, predators and aliens. There's a lot going on at once, it's not simply linear when it comes to the action scenes. The same doesn't really go for the story itself (yes the plot could be a bit thicker here or there). However, while it may not be perfect, I had absolutely no problem running along with the story. I also like the setting and how it gives off this part sci fi, part thriller, part action movie vibe.It's still good after all this time, possibly even better when you compare it to many of the so called blockbusters that are poured out over us nowadays, a lot of which ar so lacking in quality and originality.Maybe it's not iconic enough for the general public, like Alien and Aliens. Those were groundbreaking, I admit that. I guess I happen to be a fan of the genre and this movie fits right in.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"With its shameful rating, poor acting, awful writing and mediocre direction, 'AvP' disappoints the fans at every turn, and will probably leave non-fans feeling a little wishy-washy. Fox has taken two of thei","We don't go to see movies about dueling alien species for deep themes and intricate character development, but a little sympathy would be nice. I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator' because they were all unlikable clichés: The Heroine, The Hero, The Nerd, The Tomboy, The Gruff Leader, et al. These carbon cut out characters we've seen in hundreds of other films are all assembled together by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) in 'AvP' to venture into the Antarctic, where they uncover an ancient pyramid recently discovered by Weyland's multi-million dollar satellites hovering about in space.The movie is based, of course, upon the iconic 'Alien' and 'Predator' films  the rights to which are both owned by Fox Studios. The concept for the project originated with 'Predator 2' (1990), when a cop (played by Danny Glover) ventured into a Predator spaceship. There, in the 'trophy room,' was the distinct skull of an Alien.This small in-joke reference (similar to that of Freddy Kruger's claw appearing in the 'Evil Dead' sequel) sparked a phenomenon of fans speculating as to the meaning behind the very brief big-screen insinuation. And due to strong requests, the two fictional species were finally united together for a string of comic books, videogames, novels and action figures in the early-'90s. By the year 2002, 'Alien vs. Predator' had become one of Fox's most profitable off-screen franchises. So, it was only reasonable to demand a film be made. By October 2003, production was underway, with sets in Prague being assembled.And the film's director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has always excelled at set design. In 'Event Horizon' he perfectly captured the dark essence of the 'Alien' series; with 'Resident Evil' he managed to mimic the Gothic structure of all great zombie movies. But, to be honest, that's about it. He's never been any good at three other vital elements of film-making: story, characters and direction. 'Alien vs. Predator' - a project that took 14 astonishing years to bring to the big screen (longer than 'Freddy vs. Jason') - doesn't do much to change this.Yes, his set design here is fantastic (it's no surprise that a great amount of pre-production work went into creating these enormous surroundings). The pyramid is buried deep within the wastelands of the Antarctic (2,000 feet, actually), which provides us with some great cinematography and stages.The plot could have used extra work, though. After venturing deep into the pyramid, the team of scientists soon realizes that the pyramid is - surprise, surprise! - actually the home of an alien hive. And furthermore, a pack of teenaged Predators -- on an annual 'manhood' hunting ritual -- are there, too, and they begin to draw the humans into their fight, using them as bait.The movie's cast is comprised of many newcomers and they are all unimpressive. Sanaa Lathan ('Out of Time'), as Alexa, the heroine, is rather annoying. Raoul Bova, playing the hero Sebastian, is the most likable of the characters, but even then, he's simply no Arnold.Furthermore, the dialogue is completely lame. Sure, 'Predator' had lame dialogue too ('Knock, knock!') but at least it was funny and delivered with charisma. This movie unfortunately takes itself way too seriously. I've heard many people quote lines from 'Predator' over the years ('I ain't got time to bleed!' being a popular one). I can't imagine anyone ever *wanting* to quote dialogue from this film.Even Henriksen seems like he's just in it for the paycheck. (His character, Charles 'Bishop' Weyland, is the billionaire who  according to 'Alien' mythology -- creates the Bishop androids seen in 'Aliens' and 'Alien 3,' which are modeled after his own image.) Is it any coincidence that the only returning cast member from either series of films happens to be the same actor whose career has devolved into straight-to-video duds recently?However, kudos must be handed to ""'AvP's' creature effects artists (mainly Tom Woodruff, Jr.). I had expected lots of CGI, but there are also many close-ups of the Predators and Aliens played by thankless actors in suits (and some good IL'-fashioned animatronics). Kevin Peter Hall (the original Predator) passed away shortly after the release of the film's sequel, but Anderson has comprised an acceptable team of replacements (most of the actors being some seven feet tall!).That, and the set design, and one or two OK action sequences, makes 'AvP' adequate for 'regular' cinema-goers expecting nothing more. If you're just looking for the average Saturday night blow-'em-up action flick, you could certainly do worse. But, for any true die-hard fans of the films, this movie continually disappoints  and worst of all, due to its restrictive PG-13 rating, the fights (which take place all too often and rapidly become boring) are all over the place. We are not 'allowed' to see anything, which hinders the flow of the film. There was more violence than I had expected, but still not enough. (For the record, 'AvP' is the only film from either of the two series to ever receive an under-R rating.) After negative test screenings, Fox Studios decided to go against the will of the film's own director and brutally chop the movie apart so that it could fit into a more marketable age demographic. (So, the awkward flow in many of the sequences cannot be entirely contributed to Anderson's directing skills.) The day the official rating was released, fans across the world united online to protest it. I can't say I blame them.I had personally been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite some time now, being a fan of both 'Alien' (1979) and 'Predator' (1987). Yet I tried to view 'AvP' unbiased, and judge it on its own terms, as a movie, and not particularly a sequel. It was a difficult task, but the truth of the matter is that the film  as a stand-alone project  is still not particularly enthralling. With its shameful rating, poor acting, awful writing and mediocre direction, 'AvP' disappoints the fans at every turn, and will probably leave non-fans feeling a little wishy-washy. Fox has taken two of their greatest franchises and turned them into a joke. 'AvP' is nothing more than typical action fare which, all considered, isn't much of a compliment at all.2.5/5",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ahh, it could have been so good","The 'Aliens versus Predator' storyline has been with us ever since the 'Predator 2' when Danny Glover huffed and puffed his way across what looked like an alien's skull in the Predator's trophy cabinet. This brief image sparked a storm among fans, whose dreams and wishes were subsequently realised by volumes of comics and graphic novels regarding the subject matter. And they were actually pretty good! Having read a fair few of them, it seemed no end to the possibilities of pitting two of the big screen's most famous monsters against each other. With so many ideas as to what could be done, how could they possibly lose?The answer: they gave it to Paul W S Anderson. Now, Paul W S Anderson is a very competent director who can stylishly bring action scenes to life. However, his films' major flaws all are that they're 'almost great.' They're not bad. They're watchable. And that is their major crime. They leave you thinking that if you were given $60 million to make a film (in this case one starring the aliens and the Predator) then you could do better than him. And there's a reason for this - you could. And so could I.Aliens vs Predator sports the tagline 'Whoever wins - we lose.' Isn't that the truth? The film gets its rating taken down from an 18 to a watery 12A, removing all gore and much of the suspense with it. Instead of brutal tough Predators we have a trio of young, inexperienced ones who are - quite frankly - a bit rubbish at killing aliens. Instead of the gun-totting Colonial Marines from Aliens, we have a team of bland, disposable scientists who are there simply to increase the body count. At least the aliens perform on camera, but the battles you may expect between the two races are few and far between. Also, if you saw the trailer and witnessed a million aliens tearing towards some Predators on top of an weird and wonderful pyramid, that's only a flashback. That's about the best bit of the film.It sort of tries to tie into both the 'Aliens' and 'Predator' mythology, but fans really don't want it to. Like I say, it's not bad. I know I'm making it sound terrible, but it really isn't. It has action, special effects and, um, that's about it. It's perfect for your average sci-fi monster-munching movie. However, when you have either an Aliens film or a Predator film, people expect a little more than something that's 'just okay.'At least it was more understandable than Prometheus I suppose.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as some people make out,"Reading some of the harsh reviews I thought I would comment. The big disappointment for me in the movie was the lack of gore , fox did get it wrong to make it a pg13 even though they tried to substitute it with monster gore. All that being said this movie is a visual master-peace, the effects are top notch with very good fight scenes and creature effects with the best looking Alien Queen to hit the screens, The story is pretty cool and it gives more insight of the Predators, It takes a while for the introduction of the creatures but once the ball is rolling its none stop action. Not the horror feast we all wanted but fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Try filming a decent movie to go with the marketing...,"This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??) all in the name of the mighty dollar bill. Seeing this movie only eggs them on people! This is a movie that you immediately wish you could UNWATCH and erase from your memory banks.I would be highly surprised if more time went into the script of this film than the actual marketing. I'm not even going to complain about the PG-13 rating because it is what it is.... just a bad movie.Horrible acting. Pointless plodding sub-plots. Decent action sequences and a precious few cool moments in what should have been a fan-boy's wet dream. The lead in this movie is a demographic friendly woman with barely enough acting ability to make a shampoo ad believable. Any mildly entertaining characters were immediately destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the film with zero payout. Even the marquee monsters end up looking bored as the audience is lead along in a by numbers popcorn sales ploy.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such an underrated movie,"I don't understand the low rating. I see a review complaining about dialogue... considering the second half of the movie has nearly zero dialogue in it, I wonder if this person actually watched the whole movie, or maybe watched a different movie altogether...
HOW MUCH ECCENTRIC AND INTELLECTUAL DIALOGUE SHOULD AN ACTION MOVIE HAVE? Looking back at the classic action movies, AVP is right on par with the dialogue of the others, and actually above average.Everything about this movie is better than or far above the usual in every manner. The visuals are great, and in fact, being from 2004, the visuals are better than most action movies that have come out in the past decade.The acting is great, the cast is great, the storyline is fantastic and actually makes sense and has substance to it.Once the action starts, the rest of the movie is nonstop action and one really cool scene after another. There were actually some moments with the predator acting that were genius and so well done.Such a good movie. Easily in the top 100 all time action movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's well worth watching!,"If you're a massive fan of the first four ""canon"" films (like me) the best way to approach this film is to say to yourself this is a separate thing. It's easy to do so, as apart from a few nods to previous events, this film has sod all to connect it to the canon. The script is dreadful, and the cast make a game attempt to do their best with it, but this isn't what most people come to this film for. The action sequences are excellent, especially the first fight between Xeno and Predator which is pretty jaw dropping, and the plot (what there is of it) is silly and enjoyable - there's plenty of decent stuff going on, right up to the incredibly violent climax, and you can always play ""Spot The Plot Hole"" if you DO get a bit bored. That will keep you busy.You can see why people who love the canon films hate this so much - it's pretty brainless, and it lacks so many of the things the other four have. There's too little of the bone-freezing horror of ""Alien"", none of the superb character development that made ""Aliens"" such a huge hit with audiences, not enough of the chilling echoey industrial art-terror of ""Alien 3"", and none of the gorehouse comedy and atavistic dread from ""Resurrection"". Give your brain the night off, and you'll really enjoy this.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An utter work of genius,"Many people castigate Paul Anderson for destroying both the Alien and Predator franchises. I must say that they have no clue and the director/writer is a true genius for having pulled this movie off. Notice that I did'nt say that this movie itself was great but it was a work of genius. So what is the movie like? It is by far one of the worst and most disgusting pieces of crap that will kill your interest in both the Alien and predator. But don't you get it? That's the point.Paul Anderson obviously hates the fans of the franchises and has been hating them for a while now. He hates them beyond anything and they must be made to pay dearly and suffer. So in a brilliant plan, he manages to fraud the fools at Fox to give him the project. He did that despite the fact that his previous movies were laughable. Now isn't that just genius? Anderson has made a joke out of every single thing that made the concepts stand out. Your innocent curiosity will make you sit through his parody in hopes of some big twist but it never happens. Scene after Scene is one joke after another. How can anyone possibly imagine a bullet-time mode for an Alien attack? All this has been done very intentionally and nobody realises that. Once you've watched this movie, there's nothing you can do about it. You've lost and Anderson has won. His revenge on fans is complete. Hes also left room for a sequel by including a predalien birth at the end, further putting a big hole in future stories. He makes a ton of money too. Genius.Oh, I should have said EVIL genius.UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR INTEREST IN ALIENS AND PREDATORS KILLED OFF, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unjustly panned by critics and fans,"A team assembled by a billionaire investigate a heat signal that reveals a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station in Antarctic. However, the pyramid is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage and the team find themselves caught in the middle of their hunt.It shouldn't have been mixed, Paul W.S. Anderson's AVP: Alien vs. Predator was more so unjustly panned by critics and fans due to the hype and anticipation. It has the feeling of an Alien film, a great premise, good cinematography, some amazing effects and a fine score.Paul W.S. Anderson is successful in bringing the franchises together, respecting ideas from both Alien and Predator movies. I haven't seen a bad film that he's made and I'm not sure why there is such a geek gang hatred against the mans work. The ever-improving Uwe Boll he is not! The strong leads include Sanaa Lathan as the heroine and Raoul Bova. However, unfortunately actors Carsten Norgaard as Rusten Quinn and Tommy Flanagan as Mark Verheiden disappear far too early. Overall the acting is good, Lance Henrikson shows up as the 'real' Bishop but some of the characters lack development and the editing feels choppy in places.The Predators and Aliens look great apart from some badly executed CGI. It not Ridley Scott or John McTiernan, but Paul Anderson pulls off the almost impossible task of putting these to aliens together on screen.If there was not an Alien or Predator film prior to this it may have been haled as a science fiction adventure classic, but alas that's not the case.",,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't deserve the hate - time for a rewatch!,"First off, I'll try to make this short. Second off, I generally just don't write reviews as there's already plenty out there, mostly covering just about everything you'd want to read already.That said, I watched AVP last night for the first time in I don't know how many years (probably since the 00's) and I must say, this flick absolutely does not deserve the hate it generally gets from fans and critics.What you have here is an absolutely ridiculous concept taken from comic books adapted for a movie, and to be honest, it's constructed better than one would think for something of it's nature.For a 2004 sci-fi flick combining two VERY heavy hitting characters and concepts, you've got the a blend that works well here story wise, and is it completely out there and unbelievable? YES, and that's exactly what you'd want to witness from an Alien Vs Predator flick.Script: Well written and out there enough and still flows.Set design & Cinematography: Kept my eyes peered to the screen the whole time, looking around every frame, trying to catch all the little details.CGI: What use it has, honestly looks pretty sharp for 2004, and twenty years later, absolutely holds up compared to many other flicks in that era.Concept: Totally insane and awesome, and as stated, executed rather well for what it is.I flew through AVP's 100mins like it was a 18min short film, and honestly could have used a little more, even though it wrapped itself up setting itself up for a sequel (let's not talk about that one) in about as hilarious and daunting fashion as it could.My one main complaint here is how all this fits into the whole franchise:How did we not know this was here before?Is this why the Weyland Corporation even sends Ripley's team out into space in the original Alien?Will we ever hear from the Queen at the bottom of the ocean again?Other than that, this flick packs an out there concept into a tightly knit package that does it's best to stay true to both franchises, while blending it in a way that surprisingly Paul W. S. Anderson pulls off here, and well enough that I may just put this right under Event Horizon as his other best flick.I hope I covered everything I wanted to that was swimming around in my head after watching this last night.Long story short - this one actually holds up and is 1000000% worth another fun rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Literally and figuratively underrated,"Alien Vs Predator can probably best be described as pure entertainment, in one of its most honest forms.The titular contenders have never looked better, with the variety of three fully armed Predators shaking up the usual 'single hunter' formula, paired with the intense ferocity of the Xenomorphs posing as a threat not felt since 'Aliens'. The practical effects; costumes, miniatures, and set design are all really well-constructed and detailed. And the blend of occasional uses of CGI feels effectively complementary. The action and tension are decently directed. Sanaa Lathan as Alexa Woods was a strong lead, able to sell the quipy dialogue and the terror near-seemlessly. Lance Henriksen as Charles Bishop Weyland was a great casting choice, showing a concern for legacy and creating empathy from that. The rest of the cast did enough to not feel too generic, even if they were ultimately just quipy body bags. And the story, although almost bordering on blatantly campy, offers fun new lore that can best be i interpreted as good fan-fiction.However, the Aliens and Predators, two creatures arguably most known for their abilities to remain hidden in the shadowy darkness, are very noticeably at each other's throats in very blunt manners, detracting from one of the factors that makes them very unique and at times m making them look like wrestlers in cosplay. The PG-13 rating causes a lot of cutaways and underwhelming kills, and the Unrated Cut is worse, with the addition of an almost pointless cold open, and distractingly useless stains of very obvious CGI blood.Overall, AVP is a pretty good crossover film that, although misses the gore, manages to make up for it in great visuals and endlessly entertaining action.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises.,"Many fans want different things from this film. Many fans, including myself, were hoping to see lots and lots of action. One Alien & Predator battle after another. Some fans were hoping for a edge of your seat, truly terrifying horror movie much like the original Alien. No matter what you want, hope, or expect from this film you will be disappointed.The direction this film takes is a horror route. It tries to be like the original Alien movie in the sense that the horror has to come more from the characters and their fear than from the monsters themselves. Paul Anderson tries to show as little Alien & Predator as possible without being ridiculous and let the actors & characters sell us the fear. Now this sounds like a good approach to a film and normally it would be. Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face. The problem being is that the characters aren't interesting and their actually paper thin cut outs. And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.But as I said, Paul Anderson tries to hide the monsters and show as little as possible much like the formula Ridley Scott & James Cameron used for their films. And thats where the film fails. Fans come to see this movie to see Aliens & Predators fighting. They don't come to see Sanna Lathan and the other people run around a dark pyramid. Fans didn't wait 14 years to see paper thin characters run around all over the place. They go to see Aliens & Predators.The film should have taken the action route and gives us large amounts of AVP battles. However Paul Anderson only gives us ONE, count them One, true fight scene between an ALien & predator. And that fight scene doesn't occur until half-way through the film and it only lasts 2 minutes. 2 minutes. As a fan I did not wait this long to see a AVP movie only to have one battle that lasts 2 minutes.Above I said ""true battle"" because there is technically another battle. It is between a Predator, Lex, and an Alien Queen. Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator. After a while you begin to think the title ""Alien vs. Predator"" is inappropriate and instead should be called ""The Adventures of Lex"". Paul Andersons direction leaves out the two title characters.The idea of hiding your monsters appearance till half way through the film and rely more on your characters is a formula that has worked in the past. It even potentially could have worked here but in order for that to happen you need to do one thing. Make the characters more interesting. If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren't going to care about them and then they quickly become bored. The film should have done is focus less on characters and more on the monsters. It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has its moments........,"I am a big Alien and Predator fan. So I was excited to watch this, but wow this was disappointing. First off, why would you make an Alien Vs Predator movie PG-13? Secondly there were way to many plots. And the character development was very poor. Even then, I wish they wouldn't make the human characters a main part of the film. You spend to much time with them before you even see the Alien or Predator start attacking anyone. I will say though, the film was not boring. There is lots of shut your brain off entertainment in this film. I thought the lore of it was neat. And the Alien and Predator action was fun. Overall its a film that is entertaining but has very clear faults and for a film like this, it shouldn't have to many faults.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Paradoxial,"Most people going into this film want to see one thing: Aliens and Predators rip into each other. I suspect a great many geeks and lame individuals inhabiting message boards of every corner of the internet will complain that this film spends too much time with the humans when the name of the film is 'Alien versus Predator' and they couldn't care about the humans, and another sect will whine about how shallow the film is to jump right to the big fight as soon as it can possibly set it up.The nice thing about the Freddy vs Jason premise is the fact that most of the Elm Street films and none of the Friday the 13th films had any substance to them, so throwing the two juggernauts into a battle rumble with each other with a side of useless characters and uninspired plot shouldn't have phased anyone but the most deluded of fans. I really liked FvsJ more so than all but the Craven-driven Elm Streets and the all the F13s.Alien vs Predator is quite a bit different since I love Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens, and though I don't hold Predator 1 & 2 on the same level, I'm still pretty fond of the original Predator film (been too long since I've seen Predator 2). The Alien series (and to a much lesser extent, the Predator series too) has always been about depth . . . so to just throw the two monsters at each other and let them rip into each other really does not do them any justice and strips away what makes their films so good to begin with.So . . . AVP takes a middle path. It attempts to build up the characters to an extent, it attempts to give a valid reason for both the Aliens and Predators to be in the same location, and it attempts to do it as quickly as it can. How well does it succeed? I found myself wishing it would either slow down more or pick up the pace.I'm very pleased to see the stylish Paul Anderson lead this tangled and difficult project. His nods to the original films, in jokes, and slower paced setup were much appreciated from me. Ninety minutes of guys in rubber suits cut with CG monsters fighting constantly just will not cut it. I felt Anderson rushed the setup (or the studio rushed him); but part of me did grow bored of the characters rather quickly, and I did want to see the Alien and Predators get together sooner than they did.The lingering time between bouts did create more tension and anticipation for the coming fights, which I admired, and when the beasts finally sank claws and teeth into one another I found myself more or less satisfied. At first I felt somewhat let down by how seemingly easily a few Predators went down; however, then I remembered these things were fighting Aliens with bare fists and blades when Space Marines were getting slaughtered with state of the art artillery.A classless director would have started with a bang, ended with a bang, and had a boring parade of bangs. When I want meaningless, yet entertaining, bangs I buy firecrackers and save myself both time and money. Paul Anderson strived for something more, and pretty much came through. While I did like the film and the idea of Aliens and Predators fighting it out, I couldn't help but compare it to the superior films that inspired it. As fun as AVP is, and as much as I like Paul Anderson . . . he is not Ridley Scott and this is not Alien.",,Anonymous,Horror
Overhated,"Very overhated in my opinion. First off this movie isn't really an action flick till the last third. It starts off extremely slow setting up characters and setting, some may not like this as it can be somewhat boring at times and the people aren't as fleshed out as you'd hope. That being said it does help you care at least a bit about the characters, once they set on the expedition it focuses on the place they're in it sets up a bit of backstory and showcases gorgeous shots, the movie deals with a bit too much exposition but I think it does a good job at fleshing out the world even if it'd be much better to show instead of telling. When the movie finally gets to the alien and predator stuff it's pretty interesting for the most part it's hype and has extremely cool action, their are however some moments where it relies too much on cuts which can get annoying. I think overall while this movie starts of slow it works because when it kicks off there is a lot of good action and surprisingly this movie is actually tense in some parts. It's more aimed at the action predator fans then alien fans but I really like this movie and think you should definitely give it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bad, really bad","Okay, I'll confess that the only reason I registered at this site is to tell people how bad this movie really is.AVP is embarrassing, the whole thing gives you the impression of an empty commercial exploitation on the well-known monsters images.Anyone who comes to this kinda of review sites and gives this movie a 10 out of 10 is either a Fox films employee or related to the film crew somehow. Don't fall for it.The whole idea of teen Predators hunting Aliens to become ""real warriors"" is idiotic. How can you compare a high tech civilization that is able to travel space to Indians? Okay, maybe It is possible they would have the same kind of ritual, after all why can't highly developed species have their rituals...I was intrigued about how the first time a Predator blew itself up on top of the Pyramid it did not damage the construction at all.... Of course, the second time that another Predator did that, the whole thing fell apart.It is laughable the friendship among the hero-chick and the teen Predator. I could almost see them holding hands and running away in the end of the movie. It turns out that the Predator developed feelings for her. I wonder why the Predators first came down from the sky shooting the hell out of the other guys who stayed in the abandoned whailing facility, no questions asked. Still wondering...I didn't like the ""new"" Alien life cycle. The face-hugger burst out as an alien in 40 seconds. This is truly ridiculous. Anderson did not even take the time to watch the original Alien movie.On top of that, the cast is composed by a bunch obscure nobodies in shallow roles. Even if they were any good, the lines they received would just have made them look as bad as they did.As an Alien and Predator fan I felt I was disrespected. If you are too, you will know what I am talking about",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
It took 14 years...,"...Before a possible showdown between the iconic monsters of ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" would occur, when they would cross paths on screen and battle to the death. There's a scene in ""Predator 2"" that occurs towards the end of the film, where Lt. Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) ventures into the Predator spaceship and accidentally stumbles onto the alien hunter's trophy room, and neatly placed towards the back amongst the various awards, was an alien skull. Those 10 seconds of film spawned over a decade's worth of rumors that one day these titans were going to go at it head-to-head, and that whoever won, we'd lose.As a fan of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises, I've been looking forward to ""Alien Vs. Predator"" for a long time, since that historic scene. I've admired the two monsters for years, collecting all kinds of memorabilia, including books and action figures; you name it, I've probably seen it.With ""Alien Vs. Predator,"" director Paul W.S. Anderson has achieved something of a mixed bag. Undoubtedly critics will balk early into the film. They'll pick apart its MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and lack of spirit of a genuine ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" film. Die-hards will balk at Anderson's direction and the fact that he was even allowed near the film.I had fun watching it, despite some inconsistencies regarding our two iconic monsters who like to either use humans as hosts for more of their hideous offspring, or trophies which can be displayed in their intergalactic showroom of skulls.The story is that a massive, ancient Aztec/Egyptian/Mayan temple has been discovered deep below the surface of the Antarctic, and Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen of ""Aliens"") has assembled a team of the world's best archaeologists, which includes Alexa ""Lex"" Woods (Sanaa Lathan, who convincingly fills in the tough female role), Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova) and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner) to accompany him in investigating it. But wouldn't you know it? They're not alone in this gargantuan maze of dark tunnels and ever-changing structures, and that a trio of Predators have come there to hunt rapidly reproducing Xenomorphs.Well, I can tell anyone that the powers-that-be in Hollywood and at Twentieth Century Fox played heavily into the film's mixed bag treatment. If the movie fails, I'd blame constant executive and studio interference - the b*****ds in suits who decide they want to cater to teenage fanboys instead of the largely adult fan base that this film was originally built on. In doing so, they opt for action over story, more importantly, $$$ over artistic vision.Anderson has remained faithful in preserving the essence of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises by casting no-name performers to combat the extraterrestrial foes, and by emphasizing ideas over action and special effects. On a sour, angrier note, the gorehounds will be sorely disappointed, since executives at Fox toned down the violence considerably as to release it with a ""PG-13"" rating, as to rake in every penny. Of course, that ""PG-13"" rating doesn't stop us from getting quick edits (read: no gore) of chestbursting sequences, facehuggings, and people being mercilessly slaughtered by the Predators.I had faith that Paul W.S. Anderson wouldn't let me down long before I even saw the film; he doesn't, but I have a feeling that his film is destined for the same fate as David Fincher and his film ""Alien 3"" - that it will go down in infamy and only years after the director has disowned the film and controversy is still brewing, that the true vision of ""Alien Vs. Predator"" will surface and will finally earn the respect owed to it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A decent action movie marred by an overly critical fan base, an irresponsible studio and director, and a broad shadow cast by its predecesors.","Okay, so this isn't Alien or Predator. Did any of you really think it would be? Seriously, now. Let's get some perspective here. There will never be another Alien, or Aliens, or even Predator. What a lot of your die-hard fans fail to recognize is that this movie CAN'T be those films.If they made it like Alien, namely much suspense and very little alien, we would have people balking at how it copies Alien or how you never see the aliens. If they made it like Predator or Aliens, namely with a lot of heavily armed guys blasting creatures down right and left, we would get people complaining and comparing it to those movies.AvP is a movie that can never be as good as the films that came before it, for many reasons. First, and most obviously, it has some mighty big shoes to fill. It would be quite difficult to make a new Alien/Predator movie that could hold its own against the films that have come before, let alone one-up them in any meaningful way.It also has an overbearing fan base that was way, WAAAAAY too demanding, a studio that is more concerned with raking in dollars than making sure they have a good and faithful movie, and a director that prefers to blame everyone but himself for his own mistakes.Beyond all that, however, one must recognize the general malaise that weighs heavily on the Alien franchise. The bitter truth is that with each new Alien sequel that comes out, it becomes increasingly difficult for writers and directors to make new and exciting Alien movies. I mean, how many times can you see a face hugger scurry across the floor after a guy, or an Alien drone creep out of the darkness, or a queen rise 20 feet over some hapless victim? After 5 films, this is all old hat.I give credit to AvP for at least maintaining the entertainment value of these Alien standards with some very well done special effects. Who cares if it's CGI? For all those who were so angry at AvP's CGI, you need a dose of reality. There is never going to be a non-CGI Alien or Predator movie again. Period. CGI is here to stay. Deal with it. At least they took the time to make AvP's CGI as authentic as they could.Truth be told, AvP is a decent movie. It isn't the best Alien or Predator movie, and it isn't the worst. Beyond all the fake history and the screaming human victims, there were enough entertaining moments between the Preds and Aliens to prove that there is potential here for a great movie franchise.All they need is for Fox to leave the film-making to the filmmakers, an extra 30 minutes, and an R rating...............and Bill Paxton.;-)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some cool scenes but mostly a disappointment,"Alien Vs. Predator has some cool scenes and some other entertaining moments but mostly the film is a disappointment. The fast-breeding creatures from the Aliens films take on the headhunting space colonizers from Predator in a battle for the earth, leaving a poor team of Antarctic archaeologist's and the rest of us lowly humans trapped in the middle. The plot does sound like it has potential and if it was rated R it could have been a lot better. The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting. The death scenes are lame as you can't even see what's going on. Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film. The acting is terrible but its normal for this type of film. The most notable person in this film you might recognize is Sanaa Lathan but she of course doesn't add much to the film. The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared. The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive. The dialog is bad and funny but in a bad way, which is always a bad thing. Yet even with all this negativity I didn't completely hate it. Some of the action scenes were cool and its a pretty movie to look at, especially the creature special effects. Paul Anderson shouldn't be blamed as Fox wanted to edit the movie and make it earn more money. The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though. Rating 5/10 I had some fun watching this but this film is for hardcore fans only and even they will probably hate it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"For some reason, everyone hates this, but I love it!","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!I just like this movie because I saw it when I was younger, and when you're young, you just love any movie. I didn't see any of the Alien or Predator movies before I saw this, and maybe that's why I like it. I like to believe that the general audience (ie me) liked the movie, while the die-hard Alien and Predator fans hated it. So I started thinking about how they wouldn't like this. And I came up with these conclusions:1) The fans were disappointed by the fact that this was only PG-13, not R. All of the previous films were R, so less violence in this, which ain't good.2) There aren't a lot of scenes where aliens and predators are fighting. It contains more scenes of humans running away from aliens and predators, and once in a while, the aliens and predators get on each other's nerves.3) Lance Henriksen was in the film, which basically messes up the continuity of the entire franchise. It's different if it was just a 10 second cameo, but they give him a huge role.Why do I like this film? Because it gives me a great sense of nostalgia. I enjoyed the special effects, and I thought that the plot was great and fun. Plus it is pretty scary (if you're 8).I don't know, just try the film out. That's all!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Spectacular and decent Aliens/Predators movie set in Antarctica  where a motley group takes on  extraterrestrial monsters,"During an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists led by Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan , several hundred actresses tested for the lead female, Sanaa was selected one week before filming began, and had to fly to Prague immediately) and Charles Bishop (Lance Henriksen who was first to be cast to maintain some kind of continuity with the previous films , he is the ""ancestor"" of the Bishop Android from Aliens (1986) and Alien 3 (1992), who were also played by him) and other scientists (Raoul Bova , Ewen Bremner , Tommy Flanagan , Joseph Rye) along with a military platoon (Colin Salmon) find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends . Soon, the team realize that only one species can win. There they find some altars where victims were placed in the Chamber of Sacrifices of a pyramid (it is arranged identically to the hibernation pods in the original Alien , 1979)Moving sequel with plenty of chills , twisted intrigue , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . In fact , this is the first Alien film, and also the first Predator film, to get a rating other than R . This was a project that had floated around for about 10 years , it was only when director Paul W.S. Anderson did his verbal pitch to the suits at 20th Century Fox that anyone showed any real interest . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , filled with action , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and passable acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s , 90s and 2000s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Based on the comic books by writer Mark Verheiden, creator of the first Alien vs Predator comic series and the first story involving both species , contrary to popular belief, the comic was released prior to the infamous shot of the alien ""skull"" in Predator 2 (1990). The Alien vs. Predator story crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film . There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, soundtrack of the PC game and even a trading card series . Breathtaking as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . Top-notch special effects by SFX designers Tom Woodruff Jr and Alec Gillis , after the opening credits are shown, they have brief cameos as technicians who discover the heat bloom coming from the pyramid . The animatronic Queen was controlled by a motion-control rig which could save her movements digitally . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sanaa Lathan battling the malicious alien and with impressive scenes that took various weeks to film . The star and support cast are pretty good such as Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon and Tommy Flannagan . The picture packs an original music by Harald Kloser , plenty of frightening and stirring sounds . Colorful and adequate cinematography by David Johnson . The motion picture was professionally directed by Paul W.S. Anderson , though Guillermo del Toro was offered the director's chair but opted to make Hellboy (2004) instead . Paul W.S. stepped down from directing Resident Evil 2: apocalypse (2004) and directing Mortal Kombat to write and direct this film. According to director , if they'd filmed in Hollywood, the sets would have cost them $20 million . In Prague, they only cost $2 million, an important factor in keeping the film's budget down below $50 million. This was he most commercially successful of both Alien and Predator movies, grossing over $172 millionThere was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The gaps between the four Alien films steadily decreased . The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Sigourney Weaver as a great action woman similarly to Sanaa Lathan ; it is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; and this Alien . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years followed by Sanaa Lathan . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) that was first film in the ""Alien"" franchise to not feature Sigourney Weaver, who has said in interviews the idea of the crossover ""sounded awful and ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis and Robert Joy . The original and the best ¨Predator¨ (1987) by John McTiernan in which Arnold leads a team of CIA-hired mercenaries into the Central American jungles with Jesse Ventura , Bill Duke , R.G. Armstrong , Carl Weathers , Elpidia Carrillo who appears briefly in ¨Predators II¨ with Bill Paxton , Danny Glover , Ruben Blades and ¨Predators¨ (2010) by Nimród Antal with Adrien Brody , Topher Grace , Alice Braga and Walton Goggins",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien vs. Predator plays like a video game,"Twentieth Century Fox has taken two of its most popular sci-fi franchises and paired them in a Super Bowl of monsters in Alien vs. Predator. The result is OK entertaining but ultimately a pale version of the original classics, Alien and Predator. It helps to get some useful perspective.The concept, while intriguing, is not entirely new. Quite recently, Jason (Friday the 13th series) and Freddy (the Nightmare on Elm Street) did battle as studios attempted to milk every last drop of revenue from waning sequels. Three-quarters of a century ago, Universal pictures became what would be the greatest horror film studio with Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, The Mummy, and Creature from the Black Lagoon among others. When it became apparent that each franchise was running its course, the natural thought was to pair their monsters in a showdown. Most prominent was Frankenstein Meets Wolfman. So it is no wonder that a clip from that very film shows up at the beginning of Alien vs. Predator.Set on present day earth, a satellite detects a thermal event in Antarctica which triggers a hastily assembled scientific expedition financed by the Weyland Corporation. Its enigmatic head is Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) who wants to leave a legacy as his health begins to fail. Sanaa Lathan is the mountain climber/guide who leads the group to the thermal anomaly and discovers an ancient pyramid beneath the deep ice. Unfortunately, the explorers trigger a sequence of events including the birth of new Aliens via the dreaded facehuggers and the arrival of a group of Predator warriors ready for a new hunt. As the body count rises, the Aliens multiply in number and thus a battle royal is ready to commence. Will there be any humans left? How come nobody told the Nostromo crew in the first Alien movie about these critters? And what happened to the Henriksen character's namesake who reappears in the guise of Bishops 1 and 2 in later films? So many questions are left unanswered.The plot does have plenty of holes and glosses quickly, almost too quickly through the story as characters we barely get to know or want to care about quickly perish. Fans of both film series will appreciate the multitude of references to the Alien life cycle and Predator code. There are a couple of inconsistencies which may nag the purists such as the rapid maturation of the Aliens from egg to adult in record time, and the ease with which the dwindling humans understand the whole scenario. In fact, not only do the humans quickly realize who the Aliens are, namely the ultimate quarry for the Predator hunter warriors, but that human beings have been used like cattle to perpetuate the Aliens every 100 years as game for the returning Predator race. Note that the film Predator 2 hinted at this very concept with a brief glimpse of an Alien skull inside a Predator spaceship. Alien vs. Predator also serves as a kind of prequel to the Alien films and a kind of sequel to the Predator films in its timeline.Sanaa Lathan is actually good in the role of the guide and it is possible a better script and strong direction would have brought echoes of Ripley from the Alien films of old. The set design of the pyramid is fascinating though confusing with all of its ever changing mazes. The creature effects are not bad though reserved for the latter half of the movie. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon) does a serviceable job here and the PG 13 rating is designed for all those fans of the video games and comics featuring the Alien and Predator battles. Business should be brisk though limited to those loyalists who will find this installment diverting and certainly not the disappointment of Alien 3, or is it we've just lowered the bar a bit more?",,Anonymous,Horror

This movie was long awaited...,"I must admit that I don't get why so many people dislike this movie. Perhaps the idea of crossing the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" universe had been set up for something way too grand, and it usually always did work out in the comic books. Personally I think that this 2004 release of ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" was actually a good movie and fulfilling to the two franchises.The story is about a group of explorers and scientists traveling to a remote arctic area where they have found a pyramid-like structure deep under the ice. When they arrive, a perfectly cut hole at 30 degrees leads down through the ice to the ancient structure. When traveling to the structure, the group find that they are not alone, as it is an ancient site where extraterrestrial hunters used to breed xenomorphs for honing their hunting skills.The movie is action-packed and is so almost from the very beginning. It kicks up into a high gear from the early beginning and doesn't really let down the pace. As such, this is a tour de force of action Sci-Fi throughout the entire course of the movie.""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" does have a formidable list of actors and actresses, some which have far too little time on the screen in my opinion, but still nice that they were there. And the magnificent Lance Henriksen is there for the role of Charles Bishop Weyland, which was a nice reference to the future events of the ""Alien"" movie.The special effects in the movie were really good and they did so much for the movie. The alien design was great, as it always is, and so was the predator design. I especially loved the individual personal touches there was the individual predators. But lets not forget the set and the environment; are you kidding me? That was just awesome, so many nice details and cool effects to the pyramid. And the concept of it being set in a remote frigid region was also nice, as it added a sense of isolation and no possible means of help or a chance to escape.I believe that this 2004 ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" movie really did justice to both franchises and added a good amount of depth and detail to the lore of both franchises. I found the movie to be really entertaining and it is the type of movie that you can watch again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
IMDb Bottom 100 : #1,"Okay the real rank may not reflect on the actual IMDb database but this is without doubt one of the worst and most unpopular movies ever produced. Paul Anderson takes a royal dump on the faces of all fans of both the Alien and Predator franchises. Although one cannot say that everybody's a fan of the franchise, one simply cannot deny that Alien,Aliens and Predator were some of the best movies ever made and also commercially successful. Now how would it be if Pokemon had an episode with Aliens and Predators? Probably better than this movie.How would it feel if your company once promised you a new computer, you waited for 20 years and finally got a 486DX266? The situation is similar. People forced themselves to think that AvP may possibly end up being a good movie despite being written and directed by a complete retard who could'nt direct if the existence of humanity depended on it. When they actually forced themselves to see the movie, if not out of curiosity, but out of sheer loyalty to the franchises only to get a feeling of being urinated on, they did'nt know what to say.So how bad could it be you ask? Far far worse than anyone or you could possibly imagine. A bunch of F grade actors set off to Antartica after a technically fact and logic devoid discovery of an ancient pyramid under a whaling station in the Antartic. The first reference to the Predator is one of the F-grade actors referring to the full moon as the hunters moon - Ooooooooooooh scary! As if you did'nt know what happens eventually? They go into the Pyramid and get trapped.Then the Preds come, the Aliens hatch, chestburst in 5 minutes, kill preds and humans, forcing one Pred to have a romantic scene with the lead idiot actress, blowing up all aliens, summoning the CGI Alien queen, throwing the Queen into the water and ending 1.5 hrs of the worst movie ever made. There. Now you don't have to see this movie and I've saved you. If the plot was'nt bad enough, the Aliens and Predators act like total loser, pathetic lowlife stray dogs which could'nt defend themselves for nuts.I suggest that one read all the negative reviews on this site about AvP, have a good laugh and never ever see this abomination of a movie made by the world's crappiet and most untalented director.

From there on, it's Aliens vs. Predators, with the humans caught in the middle.Since AVP was panned by critics and hated by fans, I want to show another perspective of the film. I liked it. You might say that this movie needed to have an R rating since the originals were R rated. You might be right but I, on the other hand, didn't mind. You might also say this film isn't a classic. Well, you might also be right, but I, on the other hand, didn't mind it was an entertaining popcorn movie.I'm not a fan of Alien or Predator, neither have I also seen the originals, which might be a reason why I liked this movie. Would it have affected my view on this movie have I seen the originals? Maybe but for a person who just went to see this film, that person will like it.This film is the definition of a popcorn film: Fantastic CGI with great action sequences, a murky plot, and and is just entertaining if you want to kill 90 minutes. I must admit I didn't like the plot. It was too ridiculous with the dumb characters but still, it attempted to be a popcorn film and it succeeded.For you people who are complaining Sanaa Lathan is trying to replace Sigourney Weaver: Shut up. Stop complaining. Lathan is not trying to get on the spotlight. I liked her performance in this film and I liked the fact this film gives unknown actors a chance at the big screen.You might also complain that this film is dumbed down for a wider audience. Well, that's you. I know most kills are off screen but I think they got away with a lot for this PG-13 rating. I liked the costumes of the Predators as well with the high tech modern technology they use. I like the look of the Aliens with slime. I liked the cinematography and the production design.If you're a fan of the originals, you might hate this film for being a popcorn dumbed-down movie. I don't blame you.

No because those are classics. What this is, is glorious B-movie monster versus monster fun.It does a very good job of fusing together these two unrelated franchises into a story that is credible to both creatures. It also puts both the predator and alien in an environment you've never seen before. Most of the action takes place in an ancient pyramid/tomb which is constantly reconfiguring itself. It's a cool idea and the humans in the middle play their roles well.It's a lot of fun if you're not looking for anything taxing. It's far more competently made than The Predator, it's a lot less hysterical than Predator 2 and is a lot more fun and exciting than either Prometheus or alien covenant.

There's nothing to be said about the writing, direction, acting and sfx that hasn't been said before. Just avoid this movie.Forget afghanistan and Iraq. Bush should just send the air force and bomb Paul Anderson. This movie has probably made Fox more enemies than real terrorism could have ever done. This movie is probably the perfect weapon to use against your enemies. Disguise it as something else and make them see it. They will never be the same again.Consider yourself really lucky if you have'nt seen it. If you are rich, do the world a favour by buying as many DVDs of this movie as you can and burning them in bonfire.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why, Why, Why????","... that was all that I could think of most of the time. What an awful film! Bad bad bad script: We don't get what we paid for - or we get to much! For instance: Why does everything has to take place in a pyramid under the ice? Okay, I swallow that one. But why does this thing has to move like ""The Cube""? Just to get a reference to another film of the director? The answer of somebody who liked the film was: ""Where else?"". And all the characters that the viewer might identify with? They all die a silly unnecessary death - but not unless they pump a little flat character into the fodder - ""I got children."". More character is not necessary... It is such a bad script, it screams.Okay, bad script - enough of that. But what is it, that I - the paying fan - wants to see? The fight!!! I want to see the fight of the ultimate biological weapon and the ultimate hunter! But no such thing. Two Predators are killed in less than half a minute. Aliens are killed by the dozen. Listen, I don't want to see the kill, I want to see a glorious fight.When there is a fight the camera is whirling like it was tied to a mustang with barb wire on his genitals. Thus, I - the humble viewer - make no sense of the whole she-bang.I got to admit, a few nice references to the old alien movies (gets a point for that). But the silent terror, the feeling of claustrophobia and of fear is replaced by a video-clip mixture of mediocrity and below.I wasted money and time. I wish I could get both of it back...",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly good!!,"AVP: Alien Vs. Predator Surprisingly Good! 3/4 starsNever had any interest in seeing this upon it's initial theatrical release as i had already saw another monster vs monster movie and thought it sucked...Freddy Vs. Jason so with that god awful movie in mind i had little and no interest in seeing yet another of my two favourite film franchises once again merge and do battle. Bored out of my mind last night flicking through the channels on my satellite i started watching the cut up movie that AMC had to offer on their Kevin Smith hosted Fear Fest (for those that do not know about what this is ...AMC usually air nothing but horror films on the weeks surrounding Halloween) Anyhoo...saw that a Predator marathon of sorts was showing along with Predator 1-2 AVP was on next so i'm it's not like i was doing anything anyhow...sigh...might as well have a look. Well i was surprised none the less on how quickly i got gripped by this movie (it helped a lot that Lance Henriksen co-starred) Although straying from both of the stories that these monsters who were yet to do battle originally came from in their individual franchises, what we get is a pretty impressive new storyline that has the Predators using an anciently buried pyramid in Antartica underneath the ice shelves. It seems many many years ago the Predators, who all the fans like myself know are hunters used to flock to this ancient site to do battle with the aliens that were grown there and those that did were considered amongst themselves to be the ultimate in warriors.Now after the pyramid was once again re-discovered as a heat blip on a map by a team of researchers who decide to start an expedition and set up camp to start drilling only once arriving to the mapped out site find that someone/thing has already made a massive tunnel down to the pyramid itself, a hole that ceased to exist not 24 hrs ago according to their maps and calculations. Of coarse our band of scientists have to scale down the already made opening and once touching down at the pyramid itself quickly find out that they are not alone down there.Great battle sequences between the two. I also found director Paul Anderson's vision of what the Predators uniform and battle helmets looked like as a much needed change form the equipment used in both Predator 1-2. Also we get to learn more and see the crab like creatures that pop out of the eggs that the queen lays, you know the ones that attach themselves to whatever crew member they find, faces and where something slides down the unwilling person's mouth laying an egg in it's stomach that grows quite rapidly, then comes crashing out of it's chosen human's chest? Well we see more of that creature's parts as well. Being a fan of both of these franchises like i had previously said...this was needless to say a cool side piece to have along with them. I enjoyed it and am going to now watch AVP Requiem as i have not seen that either.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's pretty good!,"Finally got around to watching this crossover between the two titular characters. It's pretty good!I'm not someone who has a keen interest in either franchise, though. I'm kinda surprised both have as many flicks made as they do and as many still on the way. I admittedly I do like all of the 'Alien' films, whereas I found 'Predator' to be rather uninteresting - until 'Prey' anyway, that's the only one from that series that I'd say I like.With all that, I wasn't too sure what to expect from 'AVP: Alien vs. Predator' - a movie that I've actually heard of since I was a kid, I remember people at my school referring to it quite often; I probably knew of this before I knew that they were a crossover from separate releases. Pleasingly, i did find the required enjoyment from this 2004 movie.None of the cast are particularly outstanding, though all work really nicely as a whole. Sanaa Lathan gives a good showing as the main human character, in what is my first real experience of seeing her onscreen. Same can be said for most of the acting talent, with only Ewen Bremner being someone I could say I recognised; and Lance Henriksen, only after thoroughly racking my brain from the original 'Alien' films though.That final scene leaves good intrigue ahead of the sequel. After viewing that, I can finally say I've seen all of this most abundant franchise. No mean feat, eh? At least there aren't any more coming any time soo... *Alien: Romulus releases in two days* ffs.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's PG-13 ... That Alone Says It All!,"After reviewing both Alien & Predator franchises last month, I thought it wouldn't be fair to leave out the very picture that simply killed the validity of those two reputed series in one shot. More a spin-off than a sequel or prequel in my book, AVP: Alien vs. Predator was destined to surface ever since the alien skull was discovered in that Predator's ship in Predator 2 but I can't help but wish it hadn't.Bringing together the two eponymous creatures of Alien & Predator series, the story of AVP: Alien vs. Predator is set in 2004 & follows a group of archaeologists assembled by Weyland for an expedition near the antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal where they discover an ancient pyramid buried beneath the ice. While exploring the pyramid, they find themselves caught in the middle of a battle between the two species.Written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this is the first film I've seen of his & well, I'm so not impressed. Why do humans even exist in this film? We could've simply had these two creatures battling their differences out on another planet without human intervention at all which sounds way cooler than having this dull set of undeveloped characters who bring the story down every time any of them appears on the screen at any given moment.The technical aspects is overall nicely carried out but its job is to compliment the narrative in a more engaging & polished manner but since the groundwork in the storytelling department is already weak here, none of those elements play any relevant role. Camera-work is fluid, editing is choppy, visual effects are impressive actually, music is forgettable & the very same goes for the performances by every single one of its cast.On an overall scale, AVP: Alien vs. Predator is an unnecessarily crafted movie that tries to keep the viewers interested in its premise by referencing the films that inspired it yet fails miserably. What's even more disappointing is that it doesn't even live up to its own name as the sequences depicting the two iconic species going against each other are too low in number & expectedly, those scenes are the only ones worth talking about to some extent, at least.",,Anonymous,Horror
What went wrong?,"I must preface my comments by first saying that on a purely visceral level, I did like Alien vs Predator. Alexa held her own very well. So well in fact that I would like to see her again. It was a real thrill seeing the predators and the aliens get it on. It was also cool to see humans totally out of their league on a battle field of dueling behemoths. True underdogs. For any of them to survive was a real triumph, yet I totally bought the rationale behind Alexa's survival.Now for the criticisms: What went wrong? The predators have been going through this Right-of-passage training ritual for thousands of years. They built many labyrinthian pyramids, presumably getting better at it as time went on. So again, what went wrong? They are obviously aware of the current stage of human technological development because they lured us their with heat blooms to attract our satellites. Did they think we went there to ritually sacrifice our selves. If so, why did they kill everyone in the whaling station? Why was it so surprising that the team found their way to the predators canons? There were no obstacles. If we can build a satellite we just might be able to read hieroglyphs and figure out their sarcophagus calender lock which was based on our own planet's cycles. The predators boomerang charikons and their spears were made of metal impervious to the alien's acid blood (unlike their wrist bayonets that instantly melt on contact). Why wasn't the mother alien shackled with that stuff? And if the conveyor belt is designed to take her eggs to the sacrificial chamber, how did all of those other eggs get into the aliens incubation room. How was the pyramid designed to stop this? The poor design of the pyramid is inconsistent with the technological sophistication that built their ultra quiet ship with ultra refined controls. One last thing. The mother speared the predator through it's back and out of its chest with her tail and kills it. The tag scene has the predator/alien larvae burst out of the dead predator's chest. Why break out when the mother conveniently supplied a ready made birth canal? And more curiously, why was the alien larvae not killed when mom speared the host through the chest? And even more curiously, why did she kill the last predator. Alien 3 established that they do not kill impregnated hosts. Or was it because in Alien 3 the larvae was a mother alien? Which means that they will kill their young, but that is contrary to their previous behavior, except in Alien Resurrection (which I hated, so I will not go any further with that). Or should I just ignore this fact because very few people like Alien 3. Personally, I liked a lot about that one also.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dumb fun,"This film has an interesting premise for a crossover - some of the biggest, baddest alien foes we've seen on cinema duking it out. The storyline is nothing special and in fact it throws off the continuity in many places, but it is all in service of the action. This is a true Paul W. S. Anderson style action film - it has more of the fanservice and sensationalism of the original franchises than any of the emotions or commentary, so it's exactly as advertised.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien vs. Predator: 3/10,"I suppose Hollywood will never run out of movies, especially horror movies. Not only can they make endless sequels (there's been 10 Friday the 13ths?), but they can also have the characters fight each other in new movies (such as Freddy vs. Jason). That's the case with Alien vs. Predator, two characters that are both owned by 20th Century Fox who couldn't meet in real life but meet in an underground pyramid underneath Antarctica. Add into the mix a half dozen random characters played by people no one has ever heard of (save Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen), as you guess the order in which they'll die. Sounds like a fun time, eh? Uh, yeah, if you're a masochist.A group of supposedly experienced adventurers (we see a few of them in various exciting activities in the beginning) travel down to Antarctica to see the aforementioned pyramid that is just found 2,000 feet underground. It turns out that both the aliens from the Alien series and the Predators from the Predator series fight each other. The humans are caught in the midst, as they try to escape. Stupidity ensues.The whole plot is convoluted and stupid. These characters (who we don't care about at all) don't really do much for half of the runtime as we see glimpses of the title characters, when they attack for no reason at all. Then, halfway through, it turns out that some alien hieroglyphics (that humans can read quickly) are found in the pyramid and tell the complete history of the creature that created the pyramid (and more). It's quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen...EVER! And then one of the creatures help the humans destroy the other...aargh. It's just so absurd that it crosses the ""it's so bad it's good"" line to ""it's so bad it's bad."" All of this is the fault of writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (who is credited in three SEPARATE credits, in a row, in the ending credits). His script is generic Hollywood bullplop, the kind you can get for a dime a dozen by any writer waiting tables in Hollywood. The directing is strictly PG-13 and MTV-quick cuts and cut aways as soon as a character's about to die, destroying what people liked about the Alien and Predator movies. By keeping it PG-13, it can get more people into the audience, but it takes out the language and the gore that the fans of the respective series liked so much about those movies.All of this could be overlooked if it did its job: thrilled, or even entertained. Alien vs. Predator did neither. The only part that could be considered thrilling is the music, which could be found anywhere. And the most entertaining part of the movie is when I found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing is. The action's incomprehensible because everything's the exact same color, and most of it's computer generated, which makes it basically uninteresting. Going back to Anderson's script, there's at least three or four elements stolen from other movies. There's a complete quote stolen from True Romance, a scene stolen from The One, the whole concept of the pyramid stolen from Cube...the list goes on and on. Something this unoriginal can't be exciting anyway. And it isn't. The whole movie's not worth it. Even if Alien and Predator movies are your six favorite movies of all time, don't see Alien vs. Predator.My rating: 3/10Rated PG-13 for violence, language, horror images, slime and gore.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I had hoped for more, but  that does not  make this a bad movie.","AVP was a let down for me in terms of violence and action. In terms of a Story it was pretty good.

I want Space Marines.... Now.,"Alien vs. Predator: 5/10: Aliens check; Predators check; Space Marines; umm Space Marines? Okay who took out the Space Marines and put in this fodder.Some surprise moments and some thrills but not nearly enough and AVP is over way to fast. Everything is speeded up and suspense is simply zero. Both the entire series of Alien movies and the first Predator film depended upon moments of silence to build up the suspense. (Nothing really happens at all of the first hour of Alien for example.)This movie on the other hand moves so much like a video game you will be reaching for the controller. The Predators look okay but the Aliens are too cartoonish and seem to change size at random.The plot and the back-story are simply inept. What is wrong with an alien Queen in the New York subway system or Predators fighting in Iraq? Heck putting them in an office block, cruise ship or shopping mall at Christmas would be preferable. (The Predators take out the Orange Julius while the Alien Queen makes her nest in Victoria Secret.)The fun of aliens on earth is watching them walk into a Seven-Eleven and taking out some customers not fighting in a silly pyramid that could be on any planet in the universe.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A delicious meal, but sloppily prepared","14 years in the making and here we are: two of cinema's most infamous monsters (three if you count the humans) bash it up head to head to head. As a fan of the Alien and Predator movies and the AvP game I was very excited to see this movie come out and couldn't wait to see it. I was expecting just a guilty pleasure type of movie and that is just what this movie is. If you are not a fan of the characters basically stay away.However even fans will be disappointed with this release. The story, acting, design, special effects, and action scenes are all pretty good and don't fail to satisfy, the movie's fault, and it's a rather big one, is the look and feel of the whole thing. The Alien movies are violent with R-rated level violence and gore. So are the Predator movies, and Predator 2 was even trimmed for graphic violence from an NC-17 rating to get an R. The game AvP is also graphically violent complete with dismemberment and spraying gore. People have come to know the Alien and the Predator as violent and terrible beasts, yet this movie is remarkably limited in all of that. It doesn't take a gore hound to realize that it just doesn't work the way it should, or more importantly, the way the fans expected it to. This is a film for a limited audience and it was made with a big downside: it just doesn't feel completely like Alien vs. Predator.Taking a look at Paul Anderson's previous films like Soldier, Event Horizon, and even other video game adaptations like Resident Evil you can tell that this guy can make his movies no-holds barred violent. The only real explanation for the tameness of this movie is the potential cash revenue. They wanted money so they made a toned down, relaxed version of what should have been. However, fans will, undoubtedly, want to check it out. 6/10Rated PG-13: violence, minimal gore and horror, and some profanity",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The movie has many mistakes. Its too short (less than 2 hours). I am a big fan of AVP productions, and I've expected much more from this movie. The storyline is boring. I hoped it will be inspired from the 2 video games : AvP1 and AvP2. The movie was made in a hurry, and thats why its a big disappointment.

an excellent sci-fi movie that has been made infamous by overly critical fans,"When I first went to see AVP: Alien vs. Predator at theaters in 2004, I was just as tense as a guitar string. Just like the originals, it was thrilling and got me scared many times. And then I heard about how many fans hated it and when I found out why, I was even more shocked then ever. They said they didn't like it because it wasn't like the originals. There will never be a film as terrifying as Alien or Predator so how could those overcritical fans think that AVP could be them both? And then they began to say things about bad plots and acting. I can disagree there, both are great in my opinion. And the battles--the battles are excellent! The best sci-fi creature fights ever put on screen. In my opinion, the first battle is the best. And the final one is also pretty good and realistic. The music is also pretty tense as well. Overall, Alien vs. Predator is an excellent, thrilling, and very fun movie to watch.

One of the worst movies ever made,I went to this movie with an open mind. It is one of the worst films i have ever seen. It had absolutely no f---ing plot and the acting was horrific. The script was worse than almost any b-movie scripts. The film was incredibly short and the cutting away from all the action scenes was obscence. This film is f---ing dogsh--. Fox needs to fire some of its execs for giving the go ahead on this movie. Paul Anderson just assured himself of a Razzie. The Pg-13 rating was a mistake. The predator-human teaming up was incredibly stupid. When the guide yells out the f word to the pod of eggs I have never been so p---ed at the movies since Fahrenheit 9/11.

"Compared to recent genre movies, this is a Hall of Fame classic.","When I saw AvP back in the day, I found this movie to be inferior to the Alien franchise. When I rewatched it on Netflix, I was very surprised how this view changed.I noticed a lot of things that made me change my mind.First of all - the special effects are not CGI. We have become accustomed to the artificial look of computer generated images, which in my opinion is not a good development. Hands-on special effects had already become perfect in the 80s, at least in most bigger-budgeted films. Especially in creature features, these latex-and-animatronics artists managed to really create horrific scenes that looked real because they ARE real. Just think about masterpieces like ""The Thing"", ""Aliens"", or - already quite retro - ""Blade II"". How can anyone think that basically real creatures could be inferior to CGI? It's a new industry, and it seems it creates its own demand. In AvP, this leads to claustrophobic and really terrifying imagery that is quite underrated today.Secondly, despite some flaws in dialogue and writing compared to ""Aliens"", AvP is very much above most of the recent Superhero craze movies. If you watched it, you will clearly notice. There are lots of great ideas and scenes in AvP that would not be done in most movies today.If you like the Aliens franchise and have never seen AvP - go watch it despite its low rating. You will be surprised how good it actually is.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Blend of Two Highly Successful Franchises,"This film essentially begins with an extremely wealthy corporatist by the name of ""Charles Bishop Weyland"" (Lance Henriksen) learning of a strange heat source emanating from a pyramid-shaped structure underneath Antarctica. Fascinated by all of this he quickly assembles a team of scientists and other personnel to accompany him to that area to investigate. Once there they discover that the pyramid contains Aztec, Egyptian and Khmer inscriptions along with an advanced technology never before encountered. What they don't know is that an alien race called ""predators"" use this facility as an arena of sorts where their young warriors gain acceptance into society by participating in a deadly hunt against a reptilian species known for its aggressive and deadly tendencies-and the humans are caught in between these two groups. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good match-up of two highly successful franchises which combined an exciting plot with some good special effects. Admittedly, I was somewhat disappointed in that it focused more heavily upon the science-fiction and action aspects typically associated with the Predator franchise than the horror element normally featured with those of the previous ""Alien"" movies. But despite that I still found it to be entertaining in its own right and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Death would only be a solitude after this movie!!,"When I first heard this film was about to be released I was excited, I thought at last we are going to see a truly worthy Vs Movie unlike that ultimate pile of steaming cow dung that is Freddy Vs crappy Jason. How wrong I was!! Not only does this movie suck but it manages to rape and pillage all my happy memories of the awesome first Predator movies and the first two Alien movies, its as if the director said ""hmmmm, an excellent story of two great baddies, let me think of 10 possible ways that I could take a huge dump on this franchise"" the 10 ways we shall get to later on.So anyway back to me watching the film, I decided to queue up patiently waiting for my ticket, eventually after getting the ticket I found that not only was I cramped in the theatre but I was wedged between two enormously obese geeks that hadn't showered in more the 2 years and could not help taking about how awesome it would be to blow the predator... Yet this was nothing compared to the pain I was about to endure, they soon became a distant memory and from the onset and the premise of this film making the predators gods I knew this was going to possible be the worst day in my life... no wait, make that the history of mankind. It has no continuity what so ever with the either Aliens films or the predator films, the predators are toothless and the aliens seem to wonder about aimlessly looking stupid, where the hell where the marines anyway I mean don't you think mankind can be represented a bit better then some geriatrics and losers stuck in the middle of the Antarctic armed with pea shooters.Here are the 10 reasons why this film sucked 10. Aliens are on earth, the whole idea of the aliens movies was to stop them spreading to earth! 9. The predators establish them selves as gods, enslave the people and have them prepared for sacrifice, yet I'm supposed to swallow that these are the good guys after all.8. The films tries to establish that aliens created civilisations... News flash morons its old news get over it! 7. The predators look like a bad WWE superstar with a one-line gimmick 6. Use of the line (variation of) ""one ugly motherfu*ker"" I mean how many damn times already, only Arnie can do this 5. Shifting pyramid, erm hello primitive civilisation... now you geeks (presumably the ones in theatre) ""are saying its predator technology"" really, great way to ensure that humans never find out about the aliens under the Antarctic and what a way to ensure no body knows you was on earth in modern times by establishing technology beyond even our standards today.. Morons and lets no forget cryogenics and the furnace that seems to burn like forever I hate you! 4. W. S Anderson Period.Now the top 3 reasons this sucked so hard it gave me a haemorrhoid 3. She ran around in a t-shirt in freezing temperatures.2. It seemed as if the predator would bone her any second 1. I checked the timing of this too can you can too, the first predator died and the one to follow exactly 3 mins and 24 secs later... yes I subjected myself to that s*it heap merely for that stat Don't watch this film unless you 13 and clueless, I did and now I'm writing this to you from the comfort of my cell that has white padded walls.Burning your eyes out with Sulphuric Acid is less painful than this",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Exactly what any true fan could have hoped for,"My expectations for AvP weren't high at all, especially because AvP has gotten a lot of bad press. After having seen it however, AvP is another example of how established reviewers completely misses the point of a movie. The idea of AvP obviously is to pit the cruelest race in the universe (Aliens), against the coolest race in the universe (Predator) and then place some humans in the middle to show how feeble we are. That's exactly what the movie does, and does it very well.The story has all the stereotypical elements: A strange pyramid is discovered below the ice of the South Pole. The main characters are quickly presented. Naive humans venture inside the pyramid and discovers the truth about themselves and the Predators. The underlying plot is epic in proportions and a bit far out, but true fans are gonna love it and it has no infuriatingly loose ends. Tension builds up as the arena is being set for the final showdown. The humans know something is very wrong, the Predators enter the pyramid and the Alien queen lays her eggs. Next follows an hour of intense and very well made action. The humans do what they are supposed to do. They get separated, runs around screaming and ends up either in the Alien nest, or hanging on the wall impaled on a Predator spear. The Predators fight the Aliens and toy around with the humans, while they use all their cool gadgets. The Aliens kills or captures every living being they come by, and generally show their usual disregard for all other lifeforms.Everything is aimed at the great action sequences while all the introductory elements are told sufficiently to make the movie work, but without any unnecessary details. The characters are quickly presented, which is great. Who on earth wants to dwell on personal development and intergroup tension, when the humans are just walking hosts/trophies (depending on racial perspective). The plot is quickly outlined and the humans discover the truth unnaturally fast by reading the inscriptions in the pyramid, which is great too. Who wants to watch humans run around playing detectives when it's the fighting we're looking forward to! The director - Anderson - knows this and dispenses with it during the initial 30 minutes. The remaining hour is great great action. It's an action movie and is neither scary nor violent, and even though violence and horror is an inseparable part of both universes, I didn't really miss it. Instead the movie relies on fast-paced action combined with hints to the previous movies + AvP universe, to keep its crowd entertained and it worked for me.The acting is sufficient. The music works with the fast pace. The effects are great and the scenery is ambient and well made.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad if you are a die hard fan of either of these franchises,"Greetings from Lithuania.""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" (2004) is not bad movie if you are a fan of one of the franchises. If you are not - for you it will be just another slasher with a twist - it has monsters instead of people.I remember i had high hopes for this movie upon it's release back in 2004, i saw this movie in a theater and it wasn't a big disappointment because it has these two iconic monsters in one movie and there were some nice Easter egg left for fans. What it did lack was a sharply written characters - this was one of the reasons why first two movies in both franchises did worked - there were people, not just caricatures that we did care about.Overall, because you have probably have seen this flick already, there isn't anything new i can say about it. If you are a die hard fan, you can check this one out - it will do just fine for one evening, but if you want a serious movie about ""Aliens"" - now you can wait for the upcoming Neill Blomkamp's so fan untitled ""Alien"" movie. Now that i hope again (and have all reasons to do that) will be a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Monstrous -  but not a total monstrosity.,"Antartica, and an expedition is about to uncover a battleground for Aliens and Predators.Whoever wins, we lose! So ran the tag line for Paul W. S. Anderson's prequel (?) to two fanatically worshipped franchises. Little was Anderson to know that it was the majority of cinema goers who would feel that they had ""lost"" their cash on coming out after watching this miss-matched effort. Though in truth nobody could seriously have expected a film to rival the best of both serials (Alien, Aliens & Predator), it's still right that us fans should expect the formula to be respectfully adhered too. We want character build up, we expect a group dynamic to function, and we definitely want the baddies to stay just that, as baddies.It's not a total loss, though, even as Anderson all too quickly hurtles towards his ""humans caught in a cube like puzzle box"" blood bath, there is just enough back story and anticipation to tickle the tongue. In fact, when it all goes pear shaped and Xenomorphs, Pred-Rastas and humans are all lined up for slotting, it's damn near exciting stuff. While the pyramid/cube/maze design is pretty awesome. However, then the plus points are vanquished as the film quickly becomes kiddie friendly as gloop gives way to strawberry jelly, featuring a turn of events with our ""heroine"" that's so clumsy I'd be surprised if Anderson sleeps at night.Still, it's obvious that Anderson loves both franchises and he in no way would have wanted to make a stinker. But he has made a very average movie, one that's got two things in its favour. One being that is the neat middle section, the other that it's not half as bad as the messy hack job that was AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem in 2007. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
AVP: Alien vs. Predator (Short Movie Review),Positives:Most of the directingAlexa WoodsPredators and XenomorphsNegatives:WritingCharactersFeels a bit tame,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining but meaningless and silly,"AVP is one of Paul W. S. Anderson's better efforts. Inexplicably - I saw it during its theatrical run at the request of my spouse. I agreed to see the film mainly because I enjoyed Event Horizon (probably Anderson's best effort to date). Neither of us had ever played the computer game and despite my 30+ year interest in comic books, I had never bothered with the comic book. From what I understand from the reviews gamers and comic fans have given this film - my lack of familiarity with the game and the comic probably worked in the movie's favor. Check through the reviews here on IMDb and you will see that there are a lot of fans who are violently angry about this film - so much so that they have provided negative feedback to nearly every review that speaks positively about AVP and voted for all of the negative ones. In other words, having an opinion about this film, if it is not ""the right one"" can get you into trouble.Despite his mediocre to bad reputation, Anderson's films have always entertained me. Entertainment is, I believe, all Anderson attempts. His movies are generally pretty shallow, very visual, and fast-paced. Do not go to an Anderson film in order to have an emotionally charged, deeply satisfying film experience or to be exhilarated by a sweeping, revisionist interpretation of classic fictional themes. Instead, bring popcorn and minimal expectations.AVP is a silly story which could have been pulled out of the X-Files. There is a nest of Aliens buried deep below the tundra in the arctic region of Siberia and it has just reactivated for a ritual hunt by - you guessed it - a young 'predator'. The interpretation of the Alien here is that of Aliens, not the original Alien. Since I consider Aliens to have been the worst film in that series, and since I disliked the radical reinterpretation of the creature provided by that film, I could have been seriously annoyed by this, but the entire Alien series is in a different class of film from AVP, so I am not going to make an issue of this.As the nest reactivates, an American millionaire's scientific team discovers the heat signature and prepares an expedition. As they arrive, they discover that somebody has beaten them to it. An entire mining camp has been set up to explore the heat signature, but what did the miners find? And where have they gone? What follows is about an hour and ten minutes (this is a short film and no time is wasted) of wild action and effects-laden scenes. There are relatively few surprises, and very little dialog (after all what would you say to a pair of grunting, hissing and roaring killing machines fighting it out under the ground in a set which could have been borrowed from the most outlandish Indiana Jones movie?).Taken in its proper context, AVP is an OK film. It has little to do with the comic book and the video game, but it's a fun little romp nonetheless. The acting is passable. The script is minimal, and only permits character development for Henriksen and Lathan, and the direction is typically slick. The special effects are quite good, and the film is strongly visualized. Although some of the aliens scenes are almost comedically outrageous, the aliens are visualized more interestingly than in many of the recent films from the Alien series.Keep your expectations appropriately low, grab a good supply of popcorn, and enjoy. If you are looking for something powerful and artistic, don't bother with this.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good xenomorphs. Bad story.

The Queen is always a welcome sight and she gets some good screen time.I would take 10 films like AvP over a single Ridley Scott pretentious pseudo-philosophical brainfart film like Prometheus or Covenant.I really hope the next time I write an alien film review, I don't want the director to suffer an immediate chestburster.

My 8 year old daughter could have written better dialog. The plot was actually o.k. If they had known what to do with it. I knew going into the theater that I shouldn't expect much. But I was still very disappointed. It wasn't even cheesy enough to make up for the fact that it was so terrible.

Disgustingly disappointing,"Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should.

It's okay--better than Resident Evil: Apocalypse at the very least!,"During an Archaeological expedition in Antarctica, the crew finds an ancient temple, undiscovered by modern man. Once they enter it, they discover a race of aliens are inhabiting it, and that another alien speciesthe predatorsare using this temple as a hunting grounds for the aliens. And the humans are caught right in the middle Alright, I'll be honest. AVP is by no means perfect. There are many flaws/plot holes, a lack or gore and scares, and the CG is awful. But seriously, this is a HUGE improvement over the jaw-droppingly stupid ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", Paul Anderson's previous film. Starting with what works here: The actors, especially Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite actors, all did a fine job. There was no actor who gave a wooden or bland performance, unlike ""Apocalypse"" which had it's fair share of awful acting. The creature effects, courtesy of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr., who were also responsible for the creatures in 1990's ""Tremors"", were quite impressive. The aliens had very lively, fluid movement, and the predator make-up was top-notch. The pacing was brisk but never too fast, and the film has a satisfying (albeit predictable) twist ending. Thankfully, all the things I hated about the Resident Evil filmsthe bullet time shots, loud rock music, unbelievably stupid plot twists, lets-make-the-story-up-as-we-go-along writing and lack of credible performanceswere all absent from this film. There are many problems, yessuch as glaring plot holes you could march a parade through, and an obvious ignorance fore the time-line of the ""Alien"" trilogy (If the REAL Bishop is seen at the end of Alien 3, which is set hundreds of years in the future, how can he be in this film, which is set in 2004?!?!?), not to mention the occasional moments of over-the-top action (Such as our Heroin's escape from a HUGE explosion with the help of one of the predators), and the alien queen, once she shows up to do battle at the end, is one truly awful CG creation, especially the shots of it runningthose were B-A-D! There is also, as I said above, a disappointing lack of gore, though there is a lot of alien goop splashing everywhere, which is always fun.Through all these flaws, though, I managed to enjoy AVP more than I had expected to. Give it a chance and you might like it. By no stretch of the imagination is this a great film, but it isn't all bad, either.5.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Worse than you deserve, but still better than you'd expect.","I'll make this quick, giving this film about as much of my time as it deserves. That sounds demeaning, but I don't mean it to be. Bottom line, if you're thinking of seeing a movie called 'Aliens vs. Predator,' you not only know pretty much what to expect, but you also clearly have nothing better to do. The title of this movie says a lot.With that in mind, this film is a faintly pleasant surprise. It's no masterpiece by any vestige of a stretch of the imagination, but it's about as good as a film called 'Aliens vs. Predator' could be. People complain about the crummy plot and the butchering of the mythos of two highly revered sci-fi franchises, but aren't these foibles implicit to the title? What did you expect walking in?Frankly, I'm glad there was a new storyline, shabby or not; it kept me much more interested than if they had tried to somehow combine the stories without warping them -and how exactly they might have managed that is a profound mystery to me.To reiterate, you know pretty much all you need to know from the title. You're going to get some flippant action scenes involving characters who are largely disposable, punctuated by the occasional reference to the respective franchises and the traits of their respective monsters. Thing is, the action is a lot more well done, and the characters a lot less disposable, than a movie of this nature deserves. On top of that, many of the special effects are fairly top notch, paying the alien and the predator as much respect as possible, considering the bastardization inherent to letting them versus each other.You already know, before reading this review, whether or not you plan to see it. I'm just saying that if you do, you'd be unreasonable to find yourself disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Got there early and started out strong. . . than lunch hit, they left took a nap got back to the office late and really wanted to beat traffic to get home in time to see the Simpson's. So they looked at the clock, freaked out and threw the last hour of the movie together in less than 45 mins. I want to know what went through there minds, when they relied they had a summit climber out run a queen alien.

"Cool idea, way too much set-up","I would give it a 7 if the first 2 acts weren't so boring. A movie like this doesn't need so much set-up, but because this movie has chosen to do so, the first 45 minutes or so really drag. And then when we get an explanation as to why these 2 monsters are being put together, it feels really cheap. But then, the last act, wow that's such a cool idea and the action really starts in this part. The problem is, you have to wait really long to get there. And I understand why the first parts drag, it's still supposed to be an alien film, there needs to be suspense. But that really doesn't work for this movie.

Six Aliens versus Three Predators,"A movie that could have been much more than it was.The truth is that Paul Anderson did nothing wrong and achieved a pretty attractive film at the visual level.The strong point of the film is that it is very light, it does not insist on telling us a heavy and convoluted story, but it gives us a small but interesting introduction about the arrival of predators to the earth, to get us fully into the great clash between the two creatures, in a brutal extermination fight.The special effects are quite decent, although sometimes you notice too much computer effects in the movements of the aliens, but they are minor defects. The best without a doubt, are the sequences of the queen of the aliens, spectacular and full of tension.The actors are correct, the protagonist, Sanaa Lathan, is a beautiful woman and brings seriousness and character. From Lance Henriksen I can say, he is a crack and one of my favorite actors, whether his role is good or not, his presence is always appreciated.The only problem of the film is that it lacks more ambition, since the only epicenter of the whole feature film is to see the desired confrontation between both species but this only occurs between three predators, of which two die quickly, and I think, too easily, and a few aliens, it is clear that it should have been something much more epic, with hordes and more hordes of aliens and predators destroying each other mercilessly. Here the truth is that everything is somewhat bland.Anderson's address is correct and his work is not bad but I think that was not enough. Anderson is a less versatile director in commercial films but does not possess the genius and imagination of James Cameron or the psychological depth and sense of suspense of Ridley Scott.In short, Alien vs. Predator is a well-made film at the visual level, with an effective but not masterful direction of Anderson, a story that should have been polished somewhat more but that works equally and a cast that although does not shine is the least solvent.A film with some interesting ideas and sequences, but that remained rather in something failed despite being undoubtedly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Annoyingly average,"This is an average flick. Average camera work, average acting, average special effects, average plot.That shouldn't be troublesome, but it is, given that this movie draws from two important, and well-established, science-fiction/horror mythologies. There was a lot more to work with here than the scriptwriters seem to have realized. Any of the Dark Horse comic series which revolved around Alien/Predator, and even some of the novels which were penned as tie-ins, made better use of the available material.Where we should be getting a gritty exploration of how humans make their way between two extreme threats, and how we navigate lose-lose situations, instead we get a routine thriller with few actual thrills, and oddly slow pacing. Extended shots of the antarctic tundra, where there ought to be tense standoffs between humans and their interests and the aims of the two alien species.

Sheepdom at its finest,"Another great movie spoiled by bad initial critique. And most people jumping on the bandwagon.

This movie is superb in nearly all aspects I watched it more times then all the prequels combined.

Not that bad. IMHO the third best Alien movie of the saga...,"... and for sure better than the expensive and pretentious garbage that Ridley Scott created as prequels. For what it is (a crossover between two previous sagas, mixed with classic techno-ancient-pyramid adventure, all the ingredients for a low quality Asylum-type sub-product) it is imaginative, well realized, with rhythm and good action. The only big problem I see with this movie is that everyone knows the modus operandi of the two legendary alien species, so no surprises here. We all know what will happen, how the guys will die and how the aliens will behave. But, if this movie were made in a parallel world without the classic Alien and Predator movie, it would be a revered classic. Maybe I am biased because I enjoyed that old AvP videogame and comic. But, you know, I really liked this movie. Simply do not take it too seriously. Some people complains about the dialogues and I cannot deny there are some idiotic decisions (nothing compared with the infamous Prometheus, though). Anyway, they are a bunch of people trying to escape from aliens, so, what do you expect? conversations about ancient Greek philosophy?

A wasted opportunity,"AVP could have been one of the best films ever made...however it must be considered one of the worst. Fans expecting plenty of action and violence will be very disappointed by this stale offering. It has obviously been heavily watered down to get a lower rating, thus allowing younger people to see it. This was a mistake. The film should have been an 18, no question. The Alien and Predator monsters are still fantastic creatures, but in AVP you get the feeling that they are barely exerting themselves. There is a distinct lack of blood and gore, and nowhere near enough firepower. The original Alien and Predator movies had all that in bucketfulls, AVP has a few lame action sequences, too many of them ending quickly and cutting away before the real violence can be seen. As for the cast, only the great Lance Henrikson adds anything to the movie, but he is underused. The rest are all Z-listers who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The wordplay is dire and you soon find yourself wishing they would all be eaten by the aliens! The plot is also poor. AVP suffers because Sigourney, Arnie and Danny Glover are all absent. One of them should have been included. AVP is a wasted opportunity that will leave true action fans cold. Don't bother with it, it only tarnishes the franchise.",,Anonymous,Horror

A Bitter Disappointment for Franchise Fans,"I am a huge fan of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises. In fact, the original 'Alien' is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. While I have never read the comic books and I may have only glanced over the video games, I still recognized the potential if both of these epic science fiction baddies were put on screen together. Sadly, when that day finally arrived that these sci-fi/horror icons were pitted against each other, it was a mediocre disappointment. Why must Paul W. S. Anderson does this to us? A quick synopsis for those who haven't seen it: billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (sound familiar?) hires a crew to assist him in investigating an ancient pyramid that one of his satellites detected in Antarctica. Upon arriving at the pyramid, 2000 feet beneath the ice, they are faced with the realization that they have wandered into a Predator proving grounds and now must escape as the two species duke it out.Honestly, the movie wasn't COMPLETE trash. Just the fact that we get to see Aliens fighting Predators for the first time ever on screen gives the movie some brownie points. I've been waiting for this match-up for a long time and I was super-pysched to see it come to fruition. The special effects in this movie deserve some credit as well. The Aliens looked fantastic, and the blend of practical effects and CGI is near seamless. The Predators have a beefed up new look that makes them seem more threatening than ever, and we are treated to the usual arsenal of high-tech/primitive weaponry (with a few improvements).Unfortunately, in this movie, the bad outweighs the good. My first (and largest) complaint is the same as you've probably read in a bunch of other comments and message boards: why PG-13?!?!? This movie is a combination of the two greatest RATED R sci-fi horror movie franchises. So they throw the two together, they sugar-coat it to a teen-friendly PG-13?! NO! This is supposed to be a violent showdown and because of this rating, we miss out on some aspects that made the original movies what they were. All of the major violence (against humans anyway) occurs off screen in this movie, whereas we were treated to every gory detail in 'Predator'. In 'AVP', you might see some blood spatter on a wall but nothing more. While on the topic of violence, my other major complaint with this movie is the editing style. During the Alien/Predator fight scenes, most of the shots are too close and the edits to quick to really see what's going on. In a film like this, I want WIDE angles so I can see the battle raging! This isn't MTV, this is WAR! Finally, we have the story and the cast. The story is pretty basic and weak, but it was enough to move things along. I felt it took a little too long to really get to the meat of things, but when it does, it takes off. The cast were really nothing special. Sanaa Lathan plays the heroine, Alexa Woods, and doesn't come close to matching the strength of Sigourney Weaver and her role as Ripley. Lance Henriksen plays the role of Charles Weyland and is the only real acting strength in the entire movie. The rest of the cast (all 10 of them) are forgettable and die off relatively fast so it doesn't matter. Overall, this movie is worth watching at least once if you are already a fan of the franchises or the genre.Now, let's just be glad Anderson will not be directing the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's depressing to see this movie,"This movie should never have been made. For it to have worked, it would've required a genius of Hitchcock proportions.

Yup, it's the latter.It's PG-13 so any camp value goes straight out of the window. No naked breasts, very few gore moments (most are alien related, with only a smidgen of the red stuff seen throughout the movie), no harsh language and no muscle bound action heroes. I remember a time when action movies had balls. I presume they tried to make up for by including that annoying high pitched whining for the aliens. Oh how fun it is to sit in a movie theatre and listen to that at high volumes and give you a headache, beats a good script any day of the week, right? No.This film, is nothing short of an atrocity. There is nothing you can take out of this movie at all. There is no intelligent dialogue, no witty conversations, no character development, and most of all, the action scenes are actually boring. Yes that's right, BORING. Again, over use of cgi ruins any suspension of disbelief as you watch the same scene over and over again... all goes quiet then out jumps an alien to attack a predator, or vice versa, usually with a group of humans around the general area.

If the originals weren't so great, this movie would have ruined them both for me. Way to go Anderson.

I explain why it deserves 8,"For me, this movie was one of a kind at the time, bringing together two mighty creatures and showcasing their interactions with humans. Let me explain:Throughout the movie, there are many exciting scenes, including top-notch fights. But what I truly and absolutely love about this movie is the plot. Two different types of aliens, each with a long history of haunting humans-where even one of them alone would be enough to threaten the entire planet-suddenly come together, with humans caught in the middle. Predators have always been fair fighters, and this reaches its peak here, as they help mankind against the horrific aliens.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"An enjoyable popcorn flick, which is what it's meant to be.","I went to see this movie with little or no expectations, and I have to admit, I left the movie theatre very happy. Being a huge fan of both the Predator and Alien series of movies, I expected this to be little more than a fanboy crossover movie directed at kids (which in theory, it was) but I have to admit upon leaving my brain at the door, I got sucked into the action and ended up seeing one of the most enjoyable sci fi movies so far this year.I've seen all the fanboys taking Anderson to pieces, because he didn't make a movie as good as Alien, Aliens or Predator. Well, he was doomed to fail in that case, and people should remember this movie is a damn sight better than Predator 2, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. People should lay off Paul Anderson. Who else had the balls to take this project on? Who else could have done a better job? The fanboys in their little rooms? Give me a break, for Gods sake. The studio insisted on a kids rating, because they saw money, and Anderson had to oblige to earn his crust. Its not as if it's 'Help! I'm A Fish"", it IS violent.Oh and one more thing, the little fanboys should remember that Jim Cameron and John McTiernan enjoyed Alien vs.Predator.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a fun ride for what it is,"This movie gets a lot of hate from all sides and after watching it I'm not quite sure why. I was a huge fan of the originals coming in and watched this with rather low expectations, knowing how Hollywood likes to absolutely destroy franchises with constant reboots.Is it an academy award contender? No. But you should not expect that from a third sequel crossover of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.There are genuine moments of suspense and good action/fight sequences. The ancient aliens angle is really cool and interesting as well. There is also a lot of lore and world-building in the aliens and predator ""universe"" which is really fun if you're a sci-fi nerd like me.The special effects aren't perfect and are a product of their time but they're also not horrible and there's still some good practical effects to make up for the so-so CGI.It even has a woman of color as the main protagonist even though it was made 20 years ago, long before this was common. The lead actress who plays the part is very likable and has some good action hero moments. She has some nice one-liners with at least one major callback to the original predator movie.There are some super cheesy ""eye roll"" moments as well but again, what do you expect from a franchise action movie?If you've got a spare hour and a half plus and are a fan of the originals or action movies in general, give it a chance with an open mind and you might be pleasantly surprised like I was.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You just can't make a pg-13 film in this franchise.,A lot of the scenes from this movie were cut and edited from the original takes. This is why the movie gets so much hate from hardcore fans.

Machiko was her name and she eventually was supposed to be a vad ass predator.Rising through the ranks to the elites.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun!,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, but let me begin by saying that it should not be compared to the very first Alien movie. I think that may be the reason so many people dislike this movie so much. People should not expect an intensely frightening, suspenseful movie. It isn't and could never have been as good as the original. However it is exciting, entertaining, and just a generally fun movie. It's a real treat to see these two monster icons square off, and the mythos from both movies are perfectly integrated together. The fights are nicely brutal and the movie will definitely please both Alien and Predator fans, as both creatures get some good blows in. The special effects are great, as they rely far more on advanced animatronics than CGI.Alien vs. Predator is by no means a great movie. It's got corny dialogue, weak characterization, and a few lame plot elements. It's hokum. But it does give a nice punch in the arm to both movie series, and even has good potential for future Alien and Predator battles. Your expectations for this movie shouldn't be set too high, but I'll guarantee you'll have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very decent, unpretentious Entertainment...","Once again, I beg to disagree with the critics. Yes, this film is surely not a quintessential milestone in the history of cinematography, but it is simple, well made, ordinary popcorn-and-beer type entertainment. What's so wrong with that? Films are supposed to entertain, distract from the problems of everyday life or aren't they?I found the idea behind the story to be original and even though things are kept essentially simple and neither the story or the characters are very much developed, I didn't find it boring at all, there is more than enough tension involved. Yes, I know most of the story doesn't make sense, that it isn't realistic. I am usually the first person to complain about that in other movies, but when you go to watch a movie like AVP, you must expect this. Such movies are not even supposed to make sense... And then, then there is the most important and best thing about this film - the special effects. They where really excellent. I have seen many a big budget film with much less realistic scenes than the ones in this movie (the 'dinosaur stampede' in the recent 'King Kong' just to name one). What else do you need in a movie like this? I have seen much much worse in the past than AVP, which to say the truth, actually delivered much more than I expected.On a final note, I do agree with most critics that the last scene is lame and predictable, but come on, one has to prep the ground for a sequel..., doesn't one?",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great crossover,"This is a great movie, I thought everything looks great, the story is quite solid for the excuse needed to see both monsters on the same movie, the characters were acceptable and the stages look amazing.
Then, some fight between the Aliens and Predators felt a bit clumsy, the choreographs were not always the best, but it was good action overall.
The characters (humans) again, maybe the weakest point, could have been more interesting, but no one annoyed me to the point of dislike or ruining the movie.
Cinematography was very good, as it was the designs (stages over all), and the flashback scene was absolutely amazing!!
I really don't understand why so low in rating, honesty, I sense some fanboy hate here, the movie is great fun to watch and is way better than other Aliens and Predator movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Predator returns for a right of passage ritual,"This is the first of Alien vs Predator franchise to be created.In the premise of this movie Predator created a large under ice base in Antarctica in the late 19th century for the purpose of performing right of passage for the Predators. They return in 2004 to perform this ritual for the new batch of Predators. The ritual consists of battle with the Aliens. When the base is reactivated, the heat signature is picked up by a satellite, and an expedition team is sent out not knowing what awaits them.Special effects are good in this movie, but the battle between the Predator and Aliens weren't all that successful because both lacks character and it just turn into a mindless fight. In this movie humans are relegated to a total supporting role.It's the first attempt of combining the Alien, Predator, and humans in one film and interaction between all of them remained somewhat raw. While this movie is pretty good, I liked the Predators (2010) better than this one, as blending of the plot and the monsters were much more smoothly done, and recommend that movie over this.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
As entertaining as a PG13 of the age can get.,"I am quite a large fan of the Aliens vs. Predator universe. This movie was below my expectations, but not a disappointment. The director, Paul Anderson did a good job on the movie. On IMDb, a 4 (in my eyes) is a good movie unless its boring, and Anderson has a lot of 5's and 6's. He has made some good ones despite what people say. An example is Mortal Kombat. I liked it anyway. One thing about this movie that could have been improved is the lighting. At times it was hard to figure the aliens from the preds. Also, maybe the first two preds shouldn't have died so fast. The aliens shredded them quickly. A little bit more human gore would have been good too. Good directing, for most of it Good acting, Some of the best fight scenes I've seen. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The title says it all,"Admittedly, the PG-13 rating made me and my friends a bit nervous just days before the movie came out. In the end we ultimately got what we wanted. I thought the quality of the special effects was excellent when it came to the aliens, and although the Predators were a bit bulkier and slower than I would have liked, the fight scenes were fun. Since I really didn't expect an Oscar winning script I wasn't disappointed with the dialog. A few of the scenes were a little cheesy and some of the lines seemed a bit canned. Anyone who is a fan of either franchise will see some funny little things that hearken to the parent movies. These little ""inside jokes"" make it fun for us fan girls and boys.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was over when it was just getting started!,"This movie should have been 3 hours long (because if it was, the film-makers would have had enough time to make it excellent). I swear, this movie was over when it was just getting started! All the production is awesome: the aliens, the predators, the humans, the temple, the audio visual effects ~ except the plot moves too slow in the beginning, and too fast at the end! They should have seriously cut the first 20 b-movie minutes, and get straight into the actual A+ AVP story and battle. More real scenes of aliens and predators actually hunting and fighting each other would have been cool, and forgetting to exploit the warrior bonds forged between the main human and predator characters, with real suspenseful action-packed fight scenes within the temple, is a mistake. Nevertheless, the mistakes are seriously forgiven by the alien and predator effects themselves; they're truly amazing. Overall, I like what I see, but I wish the screenplay was better. Good movie, but keep your comics.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It makes you wish for more plot and less scenary.  A lot of time is spent just analyzing the Pyramid.  Its called Alien vs Predator, not The Pyramid.  The writer thought the movie is more about a pyramid then the mythos of Aliens and Predator.  I wish there was more plot. I wish they explained more about why the Predator's do this.

Bad Character...Good Action,"Now let me start by saying the characters in this movie aren't all that impressive. In fact you can flat out say they suck. What made the Aliens franchise, well at the every least the first two, so great is that you connected with the characters. You wanted them to make it out alive, and when they didn't, you actually gave a damn. When the characters die in this movie, I just don't care. Not to mention the story was complete bull.Instead of taking place in the future, or on some distant planet, this takes place on Earth in the present day, Predators used to be Gods to the Mayans, Aliens treated like fodder for generic horror movie, temple was rebuilt after it got completely blown apart with the force of a nuclear bomb...what the hell?! This plot is complete and utter crap!! And the score was mostly..what else, sh*t.But in the movie's defense, the Predators look awesome, as do the xenomorphs. It's been around six or seven years since this was released, so after all this time it comes down to the fact that simply don't walk into this movie expecting deep characterization, a flowing and coherent plot, memorable music or even R-rated violence. After all, it is no Steven Spielberg or James Cameron, it's Paul W.S. Anderson. That says it all right there. just expect a decent action flick.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Don't over expect, and you'll enjoy","I saw a screener of it today, and I have to say that I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. A lot of people seem to have some sort of real hatred for Paul W.S. Anderson though I feel it is unfounded. I've never seen a movie of his that was Oscar worthy, but I haven't seen one that was horrible either. As with his others, Alien vs Predator falls right in the middle.The directing is well done, with the exception of doing too much ""shaky cam"" during the action sequences. Although, this seems to be something that's in every action movie now-a-days, so I guess I can't be too hard on it.The acting is well done, considering the movie. There are some laughable scenes, but most of it comes across pretty well. Likewise, the characters are well portrayed (including the predator/alien).If there is one downside, it's the story. Although, this is where you just need to not expect too much. For what it is, the story does well. There are some things that are just plain silly, but in some odd way, it works.I'm sure there will be a lot of people complaining about how this movie isn't aliens or isn't predator...but that's just the thing, it ISN'T an aliens movie or a predator movie, and therefore shouldn't try to be one. It has parts of both as well as something of its own.Overall: Good action flick with some minor nuances. Nothing great, but a fan of the two series who don't mind just watching a ""fun"" movie, should enjoy it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

AVP put together well,"AVP is a film lover's dream. I didn't want to put a lot of faith in Hollywood when I heard of this movie being made. If you appreciate the old school method of don't show too much too early, you will enjoy AVP. These two movie giants played a large role in developing my Sci-Fi/Horror appreciation. The suspense of Alien and the combining of Horror and Action with Predator helped shape many followers. The AVP film took me back to the 70's version of King Kong, one of my first theater experiences. The original Jurassic Park also followed these rules. Tease a little while developing a story even though we all just want to see the result. AVP did not just create a dream for fans, but made a movie that anyone could enjoy, whether you had seen the previous movies or not. The movie also put to screen a Video Gamer's dream. Sometimes, going from the VG system to the big screen makes for many disappointments. AVP was able to pull it off and satisfy fans of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
57 yrs,AVP was supposed to take place originally between Alien's & Alien 3 but things didn't go according to plan.

One of the better movies based on a game,"But that's not saying much.  While Alien vs Predator was a fine video game, it seemed unlikely that it would ever be made into a film.  First of all, franchise crossovers, while common in comic books, are extremely uncommon in movies, save for Japanese monster movies.  Also, the total lack of humans in the AvP game made it even more unlikely to be turned into a film.  I don't think film studios are brave enough to make a movie without any human beings in it.So, predictably but probably wisely, they took the Zerg vs Protoss route. For those that haven't played Starcraft it means it focused on a battle between Aliens (Zerg) and Predators (Protoss) with the humans caught in the middle serving as mainly hosts for the Aliens.  Predictable or not, it made for a fun movie with good fight scenes, decent acting, and an okay back story.But, on the downside, it pretty much played it completely safe.  Nothing really that major happened, and nothing really came as a surprise.  However, save for Alien 1, none of the previous movies had many serious surprises, so I guess it's no real loss.This movie was good enough to warrant a sequel, and I think this may be one of the few franchises where the sequel outdoes the original.  More big stuff needs to happen though.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not an award winner, but fun","I've definitely seen worse movies. I was prepared for a cheap thrill tonight, but was actually surprised at AvP's punch. Let's get it out first...The plot... not that original... the humans... not that important. The stars of this movie are two creatures we've waited to see in their prime and finally got to. While the action and gore was a little dumbed down from some of the past movies in this branching series, it still got the point across. There were some spectacular scenes that caused the fanbase on the theatre to applaud for a bit and keep the newcomers entertained.While I probably won't pay full price for it in theaters again, the movie was definitely fun. It was worth the opening night trip and kept me entertained. The ending events of the movie begin to shallow out a bit as the plot heads somewhere you don't want it to, yet I found it was kept 'realistic' (as it can be in this story) and believable. Give the movie a chance with an open mind and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

So utterly pointless,AVP: Alien vs. Predator should have been a slamdunk of a film and been an entertaining popcorn film. What we got was a really boring film that plays the audience for fools or more likely 13-year-olds who hadn't seen the original films.

Control your expectations and you'll enjoy it.,"I have seen all the previous installments in the Alien and Predator series. So I simply had to see this, despite the bad press.I did not expect this to equal Alien, Aliens, or Predator in quality.  Nor should you.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie easily surpasses both Alien 3 (which I hated) and Alien 4 (which started well, and completely fell apart by the end).  And it's better than Predator 2.Like many, I was skeptical that Paul W.S. Anderson could pull this off.  He succeeds with a film that is enthusiastic, though not groundbreaking.I think a lot of the negative reaction is from people comparing this to the ultimate AVP movie that they've carried in their heads for years.  Making that comparison will only lead to disappointment.However, if you watch this for what it is, instead of bemoaning what might have been, you will probably enjoy it as I did.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
So much fun potential turned into a mindless movie,"I watched the extended version, don't know if I needed to.Do you just want a movie to turn your brain off to? Nothing special or particularly interesting but short enough to not hurt you? Then this is the movie for you. Alien vs predator is such an exciting idea. It´s a match made in heaven when you think about it and so much better than older vs horror movies. The idea of having the ultimate hunting species finding the ultimate hunt just makes sense but it´s sad that the concept isn't fully realized here. The movie doesn't have a lot of impact since we are focusing on the most uninteresting part of the story, the role of the humans, and so much time is taken to set up and trying to make you feel for blank slates of wood. I still enjoy this movie though. It´s short and to the point when it gets going, it´s a fun little action idea and I think the concept and lore set up is really cool for this extended universe.After a heat signature revels a pyramid under the ice in Antarctica, an expedition is sent to find out what lies beneath. What they don't know is that this is an elaborate trap to bread xenomorphs so that the predator species can hunt them and get their glory.I think the weakest point for this movie is it trying to make us care about the nonexistent characters. They really are blank slates, and their only real character trait is their occupation and nothing more. The problem sort of continues as the character aren't really meant to be characters but cattle to make the body count of the movie go up. The fact that the movie uses so much of its runtime setting up characters we don't care about and aren't supposed to care about is a bit insulting and a shorter runtime would definitely have streamlined the movie better.I say this, but I actually also want the movie to be longer. Set the characters up more and an aspect I would have loved to see was giving time and character to all three species represented. Let´s hear the predators talk about the importance of the hunt, hear the xenomorph communicate and understand the fear of the humans. I wanted this movie to be a three-way exploration of the different species to learn more about them in this extended universe. Maybe just stick to the predators being secondary characters, I don't care, but the lonely focus on the humans' court in the crossfire just isn't interesting or what people wanted for the movie with this title.There are some implications I have to address here. So, Wayland of the Wayland company joins this expedition very sick. Are we not going to address the implications of the future of the alien franchise? Any who this movie has a lot of these small connections to the prior movies, and I don't think your supposed to think to hard about it.I think another weak point of the movie ends up also being a strongpoint to be honest, the runtime. I have just complained about it being too long or too short, but this is a rather small-time commitment and for what you get it´s jut fun action scenes. Is it unimpactful action? Sure, but the commitment for your part just weighs it out in my opinion and there is fun to be had here. The action is fun enough and the concept and extended lore is interesting enough. There are cool ideas and concepts in here and that kept me hooked enough to see it though.I most say though. While the action is fun and exciting at times with some obvious things that just most happen in a crossover movie like this, the movie can sometimes be really hard to watch. This is both in terms of effects, camerawork and editing. The effects I don't mind in this movie. Sure it doesn't look amazing, but I think it looks just fine. The creatures look fine and the rendering look fine. Some effects look really bad though and it´s more when they do practical effects the movie shines more. The problem then is the horrible editing. Look, I know you can´t make things look cool here if you stay on it with the camera, but this movie constantly cuts during fights. It´s disorienting and just ruins the fun to be had. The fights between the title characters are so hard to follow it´s kind of sad, since that´s all you wanted from this movie. Also, the amount of slow motion used only becomes more and more hilarious as the movie goes on. Add the horrible camera angels and camera moves and you got just an ugly and dirty looking movie.But I most say, it´s exciting to see the xenomorph and predator fight. It feels like a fanfic coming to life and the different kind of tactics and fighting styles of the two works well. It makes sense that the predators would consider the xenomorphs as the ultimate prey. Although haven't the human race killed predators and xenomorphs before? True, I think one on one humans lose to xenomorphs and predators, but we have seen them defeated and especially in the future xenomorphs just gets obliterated by future guns. I´m trying to say is it´s fun to think both species see humans as far less superior, when we clearly have and will get some stats behind us. Even in this movie.An aspect I really like about this movie is the extended universe lore. The idea that predators hunt on other planets and built ancient buildings to earn respect and their signature weapons. The scenery is well decorated with predator and xenomorph symbols all over the place and the stories just blend well together. There are some story aspects I don't like though. The whole premise for this movie is that the humans go to the heat signature and make xenomorphs breed. It´s fun to me that the predators just expected us to go. You could easily make the argument that if no humans came the predators could just kidnap some humans and make the ritual anyway, but the coincidences are a bit dumb. Also, there is some mumbo jumbo about aurora being a signal that predators hunt, so every time an aurora is visible a hunt is going on? I really don't know. The xenomorph also free themselves a bit too easy. The predators seem like a pretty dumb species after watching this movie.I really loved the bad attempt at making one xenomorph stand out. It´s like they were thinking there were supposed to be one distinct human, predator and xenomorph but the xenomorph is still just random drone number 5 and the attempt is hilarious to me.I also really liked the way the predators respect is portrayed. The way they acknowledge other species as great hunters as well, how they don't kill sick people because that's low. It´s interesting.The dialogue is really bad in this movie and most actors are really doing a poor job delivering it. I think it´s primarily the scripts fault, but as more and more humans die and fever and fever are left the acting really takes a dive for some reason. It really becomes nearly unbearable to the extend where I just wanted the characters to just not talk anymore.And what about that ending huh? Pretty freaky am I right? I know it´s predictable and camp but I can only love it.As stated in the beginning. Do you want a mindless sci-fi creature feature action movie then this is it. It might be too mindless fore many, but the small-time commitment makes it worth it for me. There is so much to love here, and the campy nature works for me, but if you wanted a serious alien vs predator movie that dose the concept justice this isn't it. There are good attempts to do it here, but it falls flat. I will still be watching this though, when my mind needs to wonder a bit.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

You will enjoy it if you accept it for what it is.,"For what it's worth, AVP is not that bad a movie. In fact, it's pretty enjoyable if you just accept it as a simple mindless excursion from reality; a type of movie I call junk food for the brain.Predators (or Yautja, for the dire-hard fans) come to Earth once a century to hunt aliens as a blooding ritual. There hunting ground for this is an ancient pyramid under the Antarctic ice, but a ground of scientists have discovered the temple and are now caught in the middle of the fight.Simple story, not particularly great acting (but not terrible, either).

"Enjoy, I did . . .","From an audience who has been waiting years to see this battle waged on the big screen AVP does not disappoint. The action is PG-13 brutal for 'slime' and gore, in spite of that fact there are many pieces for the Alien fans to enjoy. For the Predator aficionados all the toys are back with a vengeance.In short, this film takes all the hits from both franchisees and combines them, well. The FX in this film are amazing the camouflage and wiping tales are almost perfect. The human touch in AVP is done nicely especially Lance Henricksen who pulls this adventure together in a matter of 20 minutes. Then the eggs unfold and we get almost 80 minutes of acid / florescent green blood roller coaster ride. All things being equal this film pulls the two beasts together with the fans in mind and does not let them down for a moment.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"There's a novelty to seeing two movie monsters fight, even if it's watered down by a mandated PG-13","In 2004, one of the satellites of the Weyland corporation picks up the heat signature of an ancient pyramid in the Antarctic that shows similarities with Egyptian, Aztec, and Cambodian structures. Charles Bishop Weyland organizes a team of scientists and archaeologist lead by guide Alexa ""Lex"" Woods (Sanaa Lathan) to travel to this structure for study. Upon entering however, they soon learn the pyramid is the battleground between a race of alien hunters and a race of alien parasites as the fight for survival begins.Following stalled development on a fifth Alien movie with James Cameron and Ridley Scott exploring the origins of the Xenomorph (which would eventually become the 2012 film Prometheus), Fox instead decided to pursue their long held desire of making a crossover film of Alien and Predator with Alien vs Predator. While crossovers of the characters had appeared in both comics and video games, a film adaptation had been in development hell since 1991 due in part to the development and production of Alien Resurrection. Paul W. S. Anderson came onto the project in 2002 as writer/director, having previous helmed the first Resident Evil movie and produced the follow-up. Given a $50 million budget, Anderson was unfortunately saddled with the same Fox management who'd eventually give audiences a PG-13 Die Hard 4 and dictating Deadpool's mouth should be sealed shut in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie, so with management such as that audiences were given a comparatively more neutered take on these franchises meeting than they'd wanted. While not completely without merit, Alien vs. Predator plays like a big budget fan fiction, albeit one with a decent sized budget and understanding of the franchises.I will say that while the movie plays very fast and loose with continuity and backstory, especially in regards to the origins of the Xenomorphs, the movie has a solid enough setup for a monster mash with the movie beginning as a temple diving adventure film only to become a fight for survival. The movie also does a solid job of building upon the Predators and their culture and code which is put to good use in the movie. Sanaa Lathan is quite good as Alexa ""Lex"" Woods and makes for a solid and charismatic lead and the cast is filled out with solid character performers like Lance Henriksen. The effects used to make the creatures were made by Amalgamated Dynamics, the same company that had been involved with the Alien franchise since Alien 3 and their creature work remains solid with convincing puppetry and animatronics.What's unfortunate about the movie is the way it feels like it's compromised itself. While action scenes involving the creatures are typically fine, there's large sections of the movie where the human cast are killed off but the kills are done off camera or with cuts away. Both the Predator and Alien series are known for their memorable and convincing kill sequences and when you remove those it dilutes the intensity of the movie. I'm also not really a fan of the way the movie ties the Predators and Xenomorphs in with ancient human culture but that's more a personal preference than it is a legitimate criticism.Alien vs. Predator isn't great, but given the time in which it was made this was the best possible outcome of this Fox desired monster mash we could possibly hope for. The creature work is quite good and Sanaa Lathan makes a solid lead, but the attack sequences feel very restrained and are only allowed to cut loose when its creature on creature or human on creature. As long as you don't mind feeling like you're watching the TV version you can get decent entertainment from it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth seeing if you like the genre,"Basically it comes to this: it wasn't boring and it didn't suck. But why should you see this movie? Because it's another chance to see your favorite monsters of all time bash each other in the face. I didn't regret this at all, and in fact I thought it felt more like the comics than anything else.A few of you don't seem to think the ending is ""predator-worthy"", but I've read comics which come pretty close and I thought it was a good angle.But, don't see this movie expecting another Aliens or Predator. And why would it be? It's like complaining about a Batman vs Superman movie, it's just so out there to begin with so why compare it to anything else? Perhaps the hardcore fans would like it more if they stepped out of the Aliens and Predator ""worlds"" for this movie. This is a new breed of a movie, worthy of seeing only if you like the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Blah!!,"I left the movie feeling no strong opinion, which is a bad thing! Movie was over before it started. Predators looked like a pack of Jason X's. (Jason X was on cable, wouldn't pay to watch this trash) They moved around like swollen muscles heads.(Ending: Sprint to safety) Is the predator half stepping, how is this woman able to keep up with him? They are actually running neck and neck. In the original PREDATOR, the creature was strong and very agile.(Ending: Chest cavity) This was complete BS. On several occasions it is demonstrated that the Predators are able to see inside living organisms. A total of 5 came to retrieve the last hunter, and NOT one of them checked the body before bringing him aboard.Pros: Effects Much improved cameo effect and a very sleek infrared system.Rating: 5/10, so much potential, an opportunity wasted.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, but does not live up to expectations, but that may not have been possible","ALIEN VS.

Anderson has created a movie that doesn't quite live up to expectations but that may not have been possible given that as Paul W.S. Anderson has said, for him to live up to the expectations of most die-hard fans, he would have to be Ridley Scott, James Cameron and John Mctiernan Fused into one body.People often ask about how the predators only hunt in warm temperatures, as is said in the first and second predator movies, then why would they go to Antarctica. There are many possible explanations fore this, like how the cold air would obviously enhance their thermal Vision, or how they say in the movie that ancient maps have shown antartica with no ice, and it may have been a tropical climate and the fact that the predators did not want to jeopardise the general human public in utilising the pyramids in cambodia, Mexico or egypt.But I would have to say that the movie itself is definitely not all that original, it doest so much follow the previous movies as it mimics them.The movie as a whole is actually pretty entertaining, and i would not call it a B movie, but it is most definitely not an A one either, i would say it is definitely better than predator 2 and alien3 and alien resurrection but it does not come close to the first2 aliens or predator.i give it ***1/2 stars and my recommendations on seeing it even if you are not a fan of the genre,if only to fund a sequel to this or the predator series i am disinterested in another alien movie cuz the last 2 sucked, so i give predator one more chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You get what you pay for.....,"I liked AVP, it wasn't too bad. It could of been a lot worse. The PG-13 rating really hurt this movie...It was stated before that there was a lot of on-screen kills...? What were these people watching? Name one on-screen kill where a human died. All the on-screen kills were deaths of Aliens or Predators where the MPAA lets go because they think it is unrealistic. In movies where things burst out of chests leaving blood flowing everywhere and where other aliens rip the spine + skull out with their bare hands and skin people alive, this movie should of gotten a R rating. But Paul Anderson and Co. wanted to be money whores and collect from the middle schoolers wallets, so we got BS. Most of the human deaths were unseen and when you did there would just be a claw or two though a body with droplets of blood on them, you call that on-screen kills? See ""Predator"" or ""Aliens"" and then you will see death beyond PG-13. But the worst part of this movie was the starting. For one whole hour we are introduced to a bunch of whiny idiots who we couldn't give a damn about. Come on! We don't care about your kids, just die already! I doubt there is anybody here that is watching this movie that needs or wants a reason for people to visit the pyramid. Just get to the fight scenes already! But when we were finally introduced to the battles they were a doozy. The one-on-one battle between the drone and pred was pretty darn cool (me being a predator fan myself would of liked to see a better outcome but you get what you pay for) *SPOILERS* The two predators who came with the main bad-ass pred were killed off WAY too early. I know that they are teenagers but I doubt that the predator clan would send them down so unexperienced, I mean they only go there every 100 years, they are going to send somebody who knows what they are doing.*END SPOILERS* But all in all I really enjoyed this movie, the ending was great...I was glad something from the game was included in the movie. 7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hopefully when the DVD is released they will have the special edition including all the violent content that had to be obscured along with all the other footage that had to have been stripped for it to fit in its run time.Just like Aliens 3 the theatre release was totally messed up by editing, so is AVP.

not as bad as people are saying...,"I read these boards before seeing the movie, hearing mostly all negative comments, so I was a bit worried, but after having seen it yesterday, It isn't all that bad...Of course it's not to everyone's expectations, but what is? It was fun, entertaining, and the staple movie which has brought the Aliens and Predators together, if nothing else. It may not have seen great, but just seeing some of the scenes of the Aliens fighting Preds were surreal images I had thought about occurring throughout my childhood. I remember having action figure aliens and preds fight in a WWF ring when i was a kid, and seeing them actually battle on the big screen was cool, at least for me. Now, for my criticism on the negative reviews...**SPOLIERS**1: I heard rumors of a 'potential kissing scene' between the Predator and Lex. Seeing the movie, I don't know where people get that idea. AT the end, the Predator merely takes off his mask. then brands lex w/ the alien blood... wtf are people talking about of how they thought they were gonna kiss? i in no way got that feeling.2: and people say people in the theatre were laughing at some of the corny parts, all the way through to the ending and it was like a comedy. No one in my theatre, including myself, took anything foolishly. we enjoyed the film for what it was, and were not 'chuckling' at its insipidness. everyone seemed to enjoy it. i don't know what people were laughing at...3: people were like 'it's not scary at all, etc'. the first alien movies were intended to be scary, since you really didn't know what the hell it looked like and where it was lurking, but after 25 years of the same creature in the same corridors, you kinda know what to expect. same thing with freddy vs. jason. they're not intended to be 'scary' 'horror' movies anymore. they're intended to be 'monster' movies, like the classic 'wolfman vs frankenstein', 'king kong vs. godzilla' etc. these are our generation's VS. movies, so just enjoy them for that. They're made to entertain, not to scare.4: People always trying to compare it to previous Predator or Alien installments, which I suppose in inevitable. of course it's not as good as 'Predator' or 'Aliens', but it's NOT a sequel or even a prequel to either franchise. It is NOT Predator 3 or Alien 5, so don't expect it to be.(both respective movies are still being considered being made). This is the FIRST of a new franchise, 'AVP, part 1' (if there are sequels, that is).5: of course there are plot holes and stuff, and things everyone would have done differently, but it's not perfect, and you just have to take it as it is. sure it took place in crappy antartica, the camera work was shaky and poor, there was no characterization, and most of the human deaths were off- screen... but for what it was, is was not AWFUL as everyone is making it out to be. if you don't have such high expectations, you shouldn't be all that disappointed.i just go in to be entertained, and not expect an Oscar-winning, well-acted masterpiece. the first half was boring beyond belief, but the 2nd half was just what you'd expect: aliens fighting predators. that's what the title is, and that's what you pay for. end of story.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Predator comes off as a bit wimpy in this one.,"All in all it was an okay movie, but it should have been much better.  It had its moments, but all in all it needed something more.  Mainly, it needed more alien vs predator and a lot less unknown gal and gang of merceneries running around pyramid.  This movie also makes the predator seem kind of wimpy...I came to this movie mainly to see them cause they have not been featured in a film since 1990, and they have only appeared in two films. They should also be able to take down an alien one on one if you can kill an alien with simple bullets as was seen in many of the alien movies.  Here though the aliens can take multiple stab wounds through the chest and body and still fight.  We are supposed to believe that the predators hunt these things as a right of passage, but if they were this tough I don't think any of them would have survived.  Still though it has some good action and there is one rather nice fight between the two combatants.  Still, this movie should have been better...I mean ""Freddy vs Jason"" was better than this one, at least in their fight you could see what was going on all the time.  Here sometimes you just couldn't tell.  This one was fairly predictable too as you knew something was going to happen when the predator and lady were standing over the ice and you knew what it was going to be.  A plus though for this movie is that I can not believe it got a pg-13 rating.  It is a very hard one at that and you can tell it was edited down so there probably will be an R version on dvd.  Not that I am going to get it, it was an okay time killer and better than the last movie I saw at the theater, but it should have been a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
My opinion,"It was an awesome movie overall, but there are a few things I didn't like, such as the following: You see the Predators and Aliens almost right away(there should've been more mystery about their presence), the Predators cloaking appearance was kinda sucky(it was better in the previous movies), the Predator's vision was no longer inferred like in the previous movies, the Pred's faces were different than the original. Despite all that, I did like it a lot because the Predators kicked some tail in the movie, it was accurate to the books, I liked that a lot.

Even though there isn't a lot of big names, the actors are pretty good and convince-able. I will watch it again, which is a flattering comment for me! I wouldn't suggest letting small children watch it, I don't recall any vulgar language but there are many fight scenes and a lot of people do get killed in one way or another.

"Not necessarily exactly what you might fear, but not really better","A pyramid(full of traps, adding to the already excessive amount of threat in this, further diminishing the effect of any of it) is discovered in the Arctic, beneath the ice. Of course, a team is sent to investigate. With them are a bunch of armed mercenaries, because who doesn't bring that to an archaeological dig site? We don't actually care about any of these flat, undeveloped and stereotypical characters, we're here for the titular creatures. So this is bogged down by poor dialog and an attempt at build-up(because Anderson, in spite of confusing surprising the audience with entertaining them, isn't a *complete* tard) until we see them, halfway through. And then there is a bit of hit-and-miss action(the genre this fits into, and the wrong one for both species this has plenty of ""exciting"" things and doesn't go for proper atmosphere as it should and things either come out of nowhere or are ""cancelled out"", so tension is wasted(when it's there) and pay-off is nonexistent) as this continues to be erratic in pace, and then it ends. At 85 minutes, the credits roll. We leave unsatisfied. This is filmed and edited fine enough, if there is an abundance of stylization(who thought these beings needed slow-mo?). As far as effects go, this does favor practical over CGI, and they do look nice. The concept is overly detailed for a single picture(and the exposition reveals far too much about the extraterrestrials(taking away the mystery that gives them a firm grip on our psyche) and we see them weak and overpowered to the extent that we are no longer scared of them), it doesn't hold up to even a little questioning(there haven't been sacrifices to the pyramid for hundreds of years, where did the ""hosts"" come from?), and at the end of the day, if you want fighting between Aliens and Predators the video games(actually, this plot could have worked in that medium) are what you want. Yeah, the comics aren't that great, either. There is disturbing content, mild bloody violence and brief strong language in this. The 2-Disc Extreme Edition DVD has a nifty raised cover and comes with two commentaries(#1: director, Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan it's interesting and fun, if you can ignore the dumb things she says. And #2: the FX guys, who have a very dry sense of humor and are funny if you like that), various documentaries(most I will review on their own pages here on the site), 9 minutes of Deleted Scenes with the option of hearing their thoughts over them, a 7 minute featurette about the ADI Workshop(not bad), galleries of storyboards and concept art, an Inside Look of several movies, a trailer and a teaser. I recommend this only to those who are desperate for a silver-screen match-up. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Forget the naysayers, this film kicks butt!","Series note: It is strongly recommended that viewers watch the Aliens and Predator films prior to watching this film. In order, the Predator films are Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990). The Alien films are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997). While Alien vs. Predator isn't constructed as a chapter in a continuing story, watching the other films first will give you a more thorough grounding in the mythology behind the two series, bringing greater depth to this film.Set in the early 21st Century (after the two Predator films to date, but before the four Alien films), the Weyland Corporation has discovered a pyramid buried under 2,000 feet of ice in Antarctica. They assemble a team of researchers and explorers to investigate, but when they arrive, they discover a tunnel already dug through the ice--a tunnel that wasn't there just 24 hours before. While exploring they uncover part of the history of the titular Aliens and Predators on the Earth, and may have just walked into the middle of a ""war"".Despite my best attempts to avoid comments from the peanut gallery prior to finally watching Alien vs. Predator, I had heard a number of negative remarks. I can't for the life of me understand the negative reviews of this film. Often, disparaging remarks arise from the ranks of pimply, purist fan boys living in their parents' basement, who usually resemble the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. But in this case, I can't even imagine why the purists would not like this film. It's perfectly consistent with the mythologies presented so far in both series, and the mood, pacing, story, cast and so on are also consistent with the other films. I can only imagine that the naysayers had already created their own Alien vs. Predator films in their heads long ago, and when this one didn't match their Cartesian theatrical versions, they blew raspberries. How they'd have low enough IQs to expect other creative minds to match their personal constructions yet still be able to speak and write intelligibly remains a mystery.In Alien vs. Predator, writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson has managed to create a fascinating extension to the mythos of both creatures' worlds (not to mention human history), while building a bridge between the two story lines, all in a wrapper combining the suspenseful action sequences that both series are known for and the traditionalist horror trappings that are often found in the Alien series. He presents a similar ragtag cast of characters as are found in every film in both series, and in the tradition of the Alien films, gives us a somewhat surprising woman as the smartest, strongest and most resourceful person at hand.I loved the sets and locations--the beginning of the film was a quickly paced travelogue of exotic locales. The main action takes place not only in Antarctica, but far under the ice is what is essentially a traditional Mummy film setting. It most closely hearkens back to Alien 3, but with a much more conventional Gothic horror atmosphere than Alien 3's industrial dinginess. The sets were beautifully built, shot and lit, with incredible production design down to the smallest details. There are also excellent little nods to films as diverse as the Indiana Jones series (beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)), the Cube (1997) series, and the Stargate (1994) series. Some might be put off by such references, but they are traditional in the arts (not just in film), they're fun for genre fans, and they further deepen and cement an overarching mythos for many different films, all with a degree of pretense that they are set in the real world. If the alternate history presented here were true, then of course there would be similarities to the lock used on AVP's weapons-bearing sarcophagus and Stargate's portals--they stem from the same source, or similar sources).I loved the creature designs here, and I thought the effects were among the best I've seen. The action sequences were exciting and suspenseful to me, the film was well paced throughout, and the cast was good to excellent (especially Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan). I also loved the ending, with its opening for AVP2. I agree that I would have preferred the film to be a bit longer (I rarely think a film is too long) and I wouldn't have minded more gore, but neither of those facts actually affect the quality of the film in my opinion, they're too much personal preferences in my view to justify subtracting points for them.If you've enjoyed any of the Alien and Predator films, forget the naysayers, Alien vs. Predator is comparable to the quality of the rest of the series. If you haven't liked most or many of the films in both series, ask yourself why you expected different with this one. If you haven't seen much of either franchise yet, get started!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Oscar worthy, but a worthy addition to Alien and Predator movies.","First of all I want to make clear that it's a PG-13 movie. Nevertheless the violence is clearly visible in most parts of the movie, even though it feels a bit cut sometimes.Second of all I have to say; this is the most violent PG-13 movie I can remember to ever have seen.The movie is filled with references to earlier movies, games, books and comics. On the other hand; the only casting follow up is the ""Bishop"" character which we have to assume was also an android in ""Alien 3"" .In Alien VS: Predator, Bishop is the creator of the coming droids. He is a billionaire (owner of ""Weyland Corp"".) and gathers a team of (armed)roughnecks and intellectuals to follow Lex the guide, which leads the team to 2000f. below the ice of Antarctica where a heat bloom is detected via satellite.The suspense,triller,horror, and the character development rushes through the movie. I recommend reading the novelization if you are interested in knowing more about the characters. When the first 45 minutes are done, the director Paul Anderson starts giving the audience some good old action sequences, mixed with fancy ""matrix""style action. It works for the last 45 minutes, and suddenly the movie is done. 1hour 28minutes and it's over.It leaves you hungry for more. I hope a directors cut, or an unrated version hits the store before Christmas!Finally after watching this movie three times I believe it's the best Action/Horror/Sci-fi/Triller/Adventure movie I have seen in the latest years; It plays like a rushed version of Aliens, and ""predator 1"" which I think are the best ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" movies.10/10 ,but it's not perfect; an unrated or directors cut can make it perfect. I recommend this movie for people who are Fans and open minded for new ideas in this franchise.And remember that just because a lot of people thinks that this movie is really bad, doesn't mean that you'll not like it.

I usually don't like movies where different monsters and characters, popular as individuals, are suddenly united in movies like ""Van Helsing"" and ""Freddy vs. Jason"". These two are perfect examples on how NOT to make such a movie. But ""Alien vs. Predator"" don't seem to have this ""versus-problem"" at all. Both monsters fit great into the story of the movie and their popular characteristics, like the predators' cloaking-ability and the acid-like blood of the aliens, really makes the battles awesome.

Good Idea vs. Bad Idea,"I'm going to start out on the good ideas.Good Idea: Putting together the two scariest aliens together in a battle and humans getting in the middle. How perfect is that? Examples: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Freddy vs. Jason, and Dracula vs. Frankenstein. It's a plot well used, and very loved by horror fans. The ending was also very cool, which I will not spoil. You'll just have to trust me on that. The characters are pretty well developed and bringing back Lance was a interesting and exciting concept. You have the same feel from the original movies. The best part is that I think the director, he wasn't trying to upstand the original Alien and Predator movies. He knew that they could never be touched and didn't feel the ultimate need for CGI effects.Bad Idea: First off, Antarctica. This is the coldest place on Earth, 50 below zero is summer time in that country. All the explorers wore was one winter coat, and the girl takes her jacket off at the end. She would've froze to death. As along with the others, because one coat would never keep them warm enough. I know that ""Alien vs. Predator"" was a comic book, but the stories could never realistically be put together. ""Alien"" was set in the future and in space. ""Predator"" was set in the jungle and the creature was a man hunter. It being on the side of the humans didn't make much sense.

Alien vs. Predator,"Ever since it's conception, the very thought of having two of the best franchises in sci-fi cinema come together to kick the crap out of each other was one of the best ideas to come out of Hollywood. A decade later, when the film was finally made, the results are slightly less than were expected.The Alien Vs Predator franchise has been going for some time. The comic books were very well received (and still are) since their creation in 1989, and since then they have spawned two video-games. It was inevitable then that a film would one day be made. After being tossed around studios for a bit, responsibility for the film fell to Paul W.S Anderson, who had a background in video-game-to-film projects. And here was the first mistake: Anderson was responsible for both Mortal Kombat and the more recent Resident Evil's, both of which were a bit, well rubbish. It seems odd that studio bosses would put their faith in someone who made two bad video-game-to-film films. Still, they did, and the result is a fairly passable, yet wholly unsatisfying film.The reason is this: Aliens and Predator are great films, the pinnacle of the sci-fi genre. That means, as this film combines the two, that it has to be rated against them both. If there had been no Aliens or Predator then the score for this film would possibly be a bit higher but as the first two films were so good, this seems very second rate in comparison.Not that it's all bad. The moment we first see an Alien and Predator face off is great, the moment which has been a long time coming and that we've all been waiting for. It's a bit too hastily edited, and it's hard to see sometimes exactly what's going on  it's all too zoomed in  but the audience is too immersed in the scene that these are minor niggles. Also, the final fight between the last Predator and the Queen is an adrenaline filled, action packed showdown, which does end the film on a bit of a high. It is just that the rest of the film is let down by a lack of any real tension in the build up, a script that is too full of clichés, and (this may sound a bit odd) too full of humans. With the title Alien Vs Predator, you would have thought that it would be mostly about them with humans just kind of in the way a bit, but it is actually the Aliens and Predators which take the back seat. This is a real shame, especially as most of the under-developed characters are only there so that they can get killed off in gruesome ways. Sanaa Lathan is good enough as the lead, though unsurprisingly comparisons with Ellen Ripley from the Alien films will surface and quite simply, she's not as good.The film is shot well and really looks the part, and the special effects are fine  the Aliens in particular have never looked so good  but the now obligatory action film slo-mo goes a little too far. Still, it's not a totally bad film; it's just that it can in no way compete with the original films. It has to be said though, and raises the score up a bit because of it, that the Predators are, and always have been, awesome!Rated: 6/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What went wrong,"Combining Fox's two great sci-fi movie monsters, Aliens and Predators, with a Stargate-esquire back story about alien gods and ancient pyramids in the Antarctic must have seemed like a great idea at the time. But somehow it falls flat. I'm usually a big fan of writer / director Paul WS Anderson (I loved Event Horizon, and the first Resident Evil is one of the few video game movie adaptations that stands on its own merits), but I'm afraid he really stumbles here.The script could have used another pass to tighten it up before shooting began. The opening is rather clumsy and shows too much too early, missing out on the slow build up of tension which worked so well in Alien, Aliens and Predator. Most of the ""characters"" are faceless cannon fodder, even the central characters are woefully under-developed, and everyone dies too quickly for the viewer to really care about any of them.There are also a host of glaring continuity errors, plot holes and contradictions of things we've already seen in previous Alien and Predator movies, like the way the Aliens in AvP apparently go from an egg being laid to hatching to implanting to chest bursting to being full grown adults in the space of a few hours.All of which would be forgivable if the action lived up to expectations. But it doesn't. There aren't any memorable set pieces, the Predators look like chubby WWE wrestlers, the occasional slow motion shots don't really add anything, and there just isn't enough Alien on Predator action to keep you interested, while the humans are predictably pretty much wiped out within a few minutes of encountering the two alien species. Unlike the original Predator and all four Alien movies, there just aren't any fights, chases or reveals that really stick in the mind, and the whole film flashes by in a blur in just over an hour and a half.All in all its a bit disappointing, and the prospect of Aliens vs Predator (see what they did there?) coming soon is enough to fill fans of either franchise with fear.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Entertaining, but not as good as it could have been.","In AVP, a group of scientists headed up by Charles Bishop Weyland, who's descendant would go on to create the Bishop android from Aliens and Alien 3. They go to explore it and accidentally discover two warring alien species.This movie is an all around good time, very entertaining, because if you're a fan of the Alien and the Predator, you see your favourite characters in action, however, this movie doesn't really have the feel of the other six movies it's based off of. The first mistake was taking two successful R-Rated franchises and combining them into a PG-13 movie. All of the intense action, gore, violence, and horror from the other movies are gone.Another problem I have is that they totally ignored the plots from the other movies. The Predator, who normally gets a thrill out of hunting humans, is totally changed in this. He forms a friendship with the lead girl and she helps him dispatch the Aliens.So, while this film is fun to watch, it is nothing like the Alien and Predator movies, and it's just not the same experience.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Where's the heat?,"I, like many, have been looking forward to a movie that pitted Alien against Predator for quite some time now. And I have to say that I'm fairly disappointed with the result. Having to wait so long and reading the synopsis ahead of time, I didn't go in with high expectations. However, this movie was littered with so many faults that it's difficult to leave the theater satisfied at all. It's as if they took the canon related to both species and threw it out, without consideration. Being a fan of both movies the creatures came from, I did expect the pyramid below the ice to become literally hot inside. Not for the sake of seeing the actors strip, but because that is the environment the Predator hunts in and the Alien lives in. I'm not being tot ""fan-boy"" here, but I do feel the movie didn't stay true to its sources and fans. Speaking of. Did they forget us, when they chose the script? It seems to me the producers picked the one that would garner the PG-13 rating, because it would attract younger audience members. Most of the people who wanted to see this movies are the fans and the fans are around fourteen years older than they were the first time they creamed themselves at the sight of an Alien's skull on a Predator's ship. The script is written as though the writer had no respect for his audience's intelligence. We're told too much of what we can figure out for ourselves. 'Told' being the operative word. A good writer doesn't tell anything. A good writer shows the audience what's happening. They even failed to do that well. For at least the first half of the first fight between Alien and Predator it's impossible for the audience to see what's going on, due to poor cinematography. The camera's either in way too close, at a terrible angle or jumping around as if the camera person had both tourettes syndrome and ADD. The following fight scenes aren't much better. While you can see more clearly what's happening, they are too short. Very much like the whole movie. The movie's pacing is too fast, which leads into other problems with logic. Can we say no gestation period? And while I started to like the characters, I just didn't care when they died. There is practically no character development in this movie. Aside from that, the acting was well done and it was fun to see both creatures on the big screen. As others have put it, a very ""popcorn"" movie.

"Half-decent.  Good action and special effects, but @$$ acting.","Not a bad work. The special effects are thrilling, and the action borderlines intense, but the acting is crap. And the fact that two of the(will not list what species) are killed in the same scene was dumb. It's not very Alien versus Predator, if two of the (will not list what species) die back-to-back.I did like the idea of a pyramid in Antartica, but to have it under the ice blows chunks, and the movie takes to long to pick up. Sure there's a snippet or two here and there of a Predator ship, but other wise, no extraterrestrial action until later on. The plot is mediocre and full of holes, and, as aforementioned, the acting is poor, and when coupled with your aunt's constant jawing about what this person or that person should be doing, you've got yourself a heaping platter of man-speak that will drive you insane. If you know of someone who won't shut up during a movie about the characters and their actions, do not watch this movie with that person.On a positive note, as I have already said, the fight scenes are really cool, and the Predators and Aliens look much better than they used to. The movie also features really nifty camera angles that make for cool shots. And of course, the last battle between Predator and Alien features potentially the coolest action shot ever (but I'll let you see for yourself). So, in short, decent with good special effects but poor acting. 6 outta 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

yet another good movie,"yes this is another action movie cross over, fortunately better than the horror of watching freddy vs jason. true it is no longer a horror movie but with alien an predator horror really is a thing of the past, times have changed an yet the ratings for the old movies didn't. so the makers cut there horror roots an switched to action. a wise choice as horror really isn't scary any more (serious name a good horror movie from the last few years an ill remove that). the new action side to the movie is impressive but not the greatest. both the aliens and predators are visually impressive and the weaponry has kept true to the game from which it was based on. an there is the odd subtle hint that connects it to the previous movies for instance the old guy (as you can see i know all the names) that setting this whole thing up, starts to mess around with his pen(stabbin it between his fingers, only for a brief moment), in the alien movies (i forget which one) a cyborg does the same thing, i know it sounds stupid but possibly the same person. maybe, i dono. anyway overall its a good movie id go see it any day i give it an 8/10.",,Anonymous,Horror

Biggest letdown of the 2000s,"Imagine it's the year 2004, one of the most anticipated movies alongside Spider- man 2 is set to be released. It's the crossover between alien and predator, the two most well known cinematic aliens. The idea of the predator fighting xenomorohs had been a thing quite some time, teased since Predator 2 with an Easter egg. Sadly, this movie dorsnt quite live up to its premise. First and foremost, the decision for the film is rather questionable given the first Alien and the first Predator basically defined what r-rated science fiction films were meant to be, and this doesn't do either franchise justice. Second, the scares also fall surprisingly flat with the only real moment of intensity being when a freaking penguin emerges from the shadows. But there is some merit to it, in that the fight scenes are well-made and the film does do a good job at giving a backstory as to why the titular characters are in battle. But otherwise, it was a rather meh crossover.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
All This Movie Has is Spectacle,"The Alien vs Predator legacy is one that actually goes way beyond this movie. The AVP comics starting in the late 1980s and didn't end until just a few years ago. The point of these comics was almost entirely just to see these two monsters that do work well together. The AVP movie is essentially an adaptation of these comics and just like the comics, the most impressive thing this movie does is shows xenomorphs and predators onscreen fighting one another.This movie came out during a time period where CGI was slowly replacing practical effects and I'm glad this movie decided to stick with practical given the respective legacies of impressive visual effects in both alien and predator movies. With the exception of Alien: Romulus (2024), I would say that the xenomorphs in this movie are the best looking to date. The movie is also great at giving a little bit of personality to the titular monsters, the main predator in this movie is given a name and one of the xenomorphs is distinguished from the rest by having a grid pattern molded onto its head. I think these are all good things to do in a crossover like this.Now we get into the things that this movie does not do very well and if you really think about it, the only thing this movie truly does right is its spectacle. The characters in this movie are boring and have no emotion whatsoever. The acting is horrific. The music is also forgettable. I haven't seen the original Alien or Predator movie in over a year and I still will never forget the iconic music from those movies. I could not tell you for the life of me what the soundtrack in this movie is like because I just don't remember. It is that dull. Additionally, while the xenomorph fighting predator scenes are executed well, I still have no idea why this movie pursued a PG-13 rating. This is a movie about an alien parasite that eats people from the inside and another alien that kills people for fun; both alien and predator franchises are known for their well done gore, it was very sad to see that we didn't get any kind of attempt to make this movie have that edge.Should you see this movie? Well, if you're a fan of the comics or either franchise, I would say yes. At the end of the day spectacle alone can take a movie pretty far, but don't expect any kind of brilliance aside from that.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Alien vs. Predator (2004) The long-awaited crossover,"Crossovers between characters from different franchises have always been something that drove the public crazy. Among one of the most anticipated was ""Alien vs. Predator"", which could generate something really interesting. However, this film could be about any other character and it wouldn't make any difference. It's a terrible story about a group of explorers who encounter aliens. The time it takes for the characters to find each other makes the film unbearable, because nobody cares about the protagonists, everyone just wants to watch the big battle. To make matters worse, when they meet, the battle isn't even that exciting. It's a film that only attracts audiences because of the meeting of two great characters, but it's very bad and boring to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

your average post 1992 sci-fi / action blockbuster -- all SFX and little else thanks to the meddling of 20th Century Fox,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator franchises. I had been waiting for this film since the very first day I came across the ""Aliens Vs Predator"" mini-series from Dark Horse in the fall of 1990 at the wee age of eight years old. I have been following the evolution of this idea to the silver screen ever since.Midnight. August 12th. My 14 years years worth of wait comes to an end. I wasn't expecting anything superior to ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"" -- unlike most of the fanboys on all the forums -- just a fun time at the movies and the return of my two favorite creatures to the big screen. I got what I was expecting -- though perhaps a little less.Let me just break it all down like this ...Great creature effects courtesy of Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis -- especially concerning the Aliens. I didn't really care for the altering of the mandibles on the Predators though. That was my only gripe with any of the creature effects. Everything else was very adequate.Great special effects courtesy of John Bruno (a veteran FX master of such great effects-laden films as T2 and True Lies amongst many others). All the computer generated imagery is damn near close seamless. By far the best (and most epic) effects of any film in either series.Quality action through out -- though I will admit the PG-13 does hamper a good deal of the proceedings. I wasn't expecting it to be so obvious after witnessing the overt amount of violence in recent films like The Chronicles Of Riddick and The Lord Of The Rings -- but it most definitely was at certain points (Namely because of the obvious edits made by Fox in order to ensure a lower rating than ""R"" to attract younger audiences.My main problem didn't lie with the the direction, writing, acting, etc. I actually thought all of the above was just fine. Its not all on par with the greater films of either franchise -- but (as I said prior) I wasn't expecting that. I can say it was definitely an improvement upon Alien - Resurrection (though I know that really isn't saying much).My main problem with AvP is the obvious meddling from 20th Century Fox. Here's just a few of the obvious indications that AvP was given SEVERE cuts prior to release. The script for this film is 110 pages long. Its a common fact that one page of a screenplay equals one minute of screen time. AvP is nowhere near 110 minutes in length if you subtract the EXTREMELY long ending credits. Further proof that numerous edits were made is the lack of crediting co-screenwriter Shane Salerno in the final cut of the film. Another fact -- the tracklisting for the official film score (which really wasn't all that good or bad) lists ""1904"" as the score's opening -- yet the scene in 1904 is completely absent from the final cut.All in all -- a sufficient way to kill 2 hours of boredom if you are a casual fan of action / sci-fi hybrids. There were two showings at the theater where I saw AvP and both were full of extremely young people. Nobody older than myself (21) and most everybody who was a casual fan had a great time and began clapping and cheering at all the right parts.I really don't know what to say if you are a devout fan of Alien and Predator like I am though. I guess you should all go see it to satisfy your curiosity. Just don't go into the theater with high expectations. Its not so much like an Alien or Predator film as it is your average creature feature of the summer.At least there's hope for the director's cut DVD -- as there is surely a copy laying in wait for release after witnessing the many obvious edits through out. A few extra scenes of character development and plot setup would surely be a welcome addition (and most surely exists on the cutting room floor at 20th Century Fox).",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
It wasn't that bad,"Having never seen any of the alien or predator films AND this not being a genre I usually pay any attention to, I didn't really know what to expect of this film. I didn't hate it which I was pleasantly surprised at. There were some great special effects and the plot line wasn't as silly as I thought it would be. There were no shock factors and obviously most of the gore had been cut out but I don't think I'd like to meet an alien or a predator on a dark night. The ending was a tad predictable but probably any other ending would not have suited the film at all. I'd recommend seeing it because it is a good film to switch your brain off to.

Alien to the Alien series,"It is an impossible task to please the fans of both these movies, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been attempted. No attempt seems to have been made and this is certainly not an Alien movie. The story and structure of the film is a combination of 13 ghosts, Cube, and Stargate. It just so happens that the monsters involved happen to be Aliens and predators. Cliché after cliché is thrust down our throats with out any attempt to disguise that this was written in 5 minutes with no thought or depth. The whole pyramid idea has been done to death so many times before it beggars belief it could be attempted again. The acting is the worst I have seen in any of the films, but then the dialouge was awful so thats hardly surprising. It plays out like a kids movie feeling it needs to explain everything that is happening. The Alien movies were great, you had a real sense of a Universe you wanted to know more about through your own imagination.If you watch this having never seen any of the previous films you would think that this was an enjoyable action film, and that it is.

Meh for Meh,"In school, seven is a C, and therefore,... painfully average.I love both alien and Predator, and unfairly biased Predator. That is main reason this movie is average for me, because the predators died far to easy. One didn't even get to fight an alien, he just got to get sneak attacked. And then, the same fuggin alien kills his buddy likes it's nothing. I think the director had an opposite unfair bias. Nonetheless, the movie was definitely lacking in plot, character interest (I felt no remorse when the first twenty people died, because they were unimportant) and most of all, length. If ill sit through 4 hours of Lord of the Rings, just because i love the series, then 2 or three hours with AVP would have been fine. Go ahead, make the story better, make the characters connect, make the aliens die like ants under the Predator boot, Ill sit alone in the theater. Also, the director's original idea was better, five Predators. Or better yet, a war like it was advertised. Letsee, OK, here's a better plot off the top of my head, then some manhood ritual. Somehow (remember, off the top of my head) the aliens are on Earth. Lets go ahead and make Earth a holy place for the Predators, give them a religion, for further development. So the Predators decide that Earth must be protected, and, Lo and Behold, a war. There. Maybe not better plot, but would make a certainly more suspenseful movie. Just, you know what, more action would have been great. I didn't really go for a plot anyway. I'm done.

"Not the greatest, but not a total lost.","If you've bothered reading though the reviews this far, you have either a lot of patience or a lot of time on your hands. Or both.After seeing AVP, and I consider myself a big Predator fan and knowledgeable in the lore. I'd say this movie is watchable but it could have been better. I say this as I've waited for this movie since Predator 2 shows an Alien skull in the trophy case and after Phill Norwood first drew the Dark Horse comic Alien vs. Predator and then it was turned into a novel.This move follows the basic ideas of the original Dark Horse comics, but there are certain aspects of it that director Andersen drops. Make me wonder if he even bothered to do a little research into what has already been established, such as the Yautja's or Predator's weapons being resistant to the Alien's acid blood. Really how many can they kill if their weapons melt after each kill? And the face huggers can latch on a Yautja but after seeing a Yautja tossing an Alien around like a rag doll I would think they'd have the strength to yank a face hugger off, providing they do it before it paralyzes them.Alien drones are supposed to have the intelligence of a dog, it seems to me these Xenomorphs are getting a little too smart. I would think the Yautja would know everything about these parasites seeing as they've hunted them for hundreds in not thousands of years.No it's not an Oscar winning movie, then again most movies that win Oscars suck in my opinion anyways. LOTR being an unusual exception, yes honestly I didn't think it would win. However back to AVP, It's not the greatest, but it is mildly entertaining and very watchable. Unlike another film I could mention. And while the Yautja making googly eye looks at the human female mountain climber might have looked silly and like an attempt at a little romance. I think it was merely the admiration of one successful hunter to another.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as people make it out to be,"There are many people out there, who are die hard fans of the alien/predator series, that will tell you that Alien vs Predator was a complete flop and that it brings a bad name to the series.

If they had gone in without any expectations I'm sure they would have got a lot more out of the film.Lets get it straight, AvP is not as good as it's predecessors, though I did enjoy it more than Predator 2. But it is a hell of a lot of fun and I found it thoroughly entertaining. Yes, the directing is nearly as poor as the story, and many of the characters have less charisma than a bumble bee, but there ARE some things this film does incredibly well. The special effects are superb and the creatures have never looked better. The fight scenes are frantic and exciting. It also gives you a bit of the history of the two alien races on Earth.I would have liked it to be more scary (not one scene made me jump) and yes, it COULD have been amazing.

Give this movie another 20-30 minutes to flush out a few things, add a few more sets, and build suspense...Oh well, still worth an afternoon viewing!The aliens looked fairly good although I was a little disappointed by the Predator with his mask off. He looked a bit more ""rubbery"" than in previous films. The cast did well enough with the female lead stealing the show. If there is an AVP II, then please let it go 2+ hours and give it the build up it requires!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awesome movie!  Worth the wait,"I loved this movie! I just got out from the midnight showing on the 12th and i have to say that this thing was awesome! I've heard a lot of bad hype stirring before the movie was released, but I'm hear to tell you it was great! I got everything I was hoping for. Looking back I can see how they could get away with it being PG13 and still not rob you of anything. Quite simply it isn't as bad to show aliens / predators getting stabbed, cut, etc and green / acid blood vs humans. In other words the things that happen in the movie, had they happen to a person, would make it R rating. They were very smart about filming the people dying as to avoid the R rating. So believe me there's some decent gore. A director's cut might also be good, but there was certainly nothing lacking in this movie from that standpoint.The movie flow was great, kind of built up until things started to explode. Also, certainly gives you a new found respect for the aliens, the predators too, but you could really see the strategic intelligence of the aliens as they are obviously natural born hunters too. Watch out for that tail! The acting was good enough and I wasn't displeased with the performances of any of the actors, alien or human. I did like the story line and how the sequence of events that led up to a bad situation for the humans and the predators, giving a starting advantage to the aliens. I'd love to talk about specifics, but I don't want to give anything away. The running time was somewhere around 100+ minutes. Also, I loved the very end.I'm happy to report there was very little CGI or at least noticeable CGI in the movie at all. The aliens and the predators looked very real / believable and moved very well too. Hats off to the creature creators and special effects folks. The fight sequences were great too. What I liked best is that unlike movies involving Human fight scenes where its show off time, the aliens / predators don't mess around and simply go for the kill. The fight scenes are pretty quick, but awesome!Only complaints I have (and they're only few minor ones). It took 20-30 minutes to build up and it could have been little longer overall, but in saying that the movie delivered enough. If anything it left you with that feeling of wanting more, which is usually a sign of a good movie, and in this case it is too. They didn't explain how the predators or aliens could keep warm in the cold as they kind of bypass the whole temperature concept for both the aliens / predators, no biggie. I'm still at a loss as to how Bishop fits in and the whole timeline concept connecting the various Bishops, or if it's the same guy, great great grandfather, who knows. Didn't matter too much and the movie could have survived with out him as he wasn't really a key player, just a familiar face. The sound effects were great, but there was no real theme song or lack of a good one. So there's no tune or song you can hum that would remind you of the movie. Again these are very weak complaints.Overall I give this a 9.5 out of 10. There's very little I could think of to improve it to a 10, but the complaints are listed above. I'm glad I saw it opening night and will likely see it again in the theaters. Definitely one I'm going to buy when it hits DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A disappointment??,"Not really. I got a free ticket when I purchased the SE Predator DVD. The movie really does not connect with either of the alien, predator story lines and doesn't have an ounce of suspense to it. The story really doesn't make sense at all and really isn't that interesting. The aliens aren't really scary and the predators aren't impressive either. The ending is contrived and the movie was boring. The PG-13 rating also really hurt the movie. How can you take two very violent franchises and make them kiddie friendly? It makes me sick. Hopefully resident evil 2 will be worth seeing now that this director isn't in charge of it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
...or how Hollywood took two franchises and flushed them down the toilet,"Over ten years of hearing rumors about this film being made and waiting and waiting and then more waiting as nothing comes to fruition. Two more (disappointing) ""Alien"" pictures will come and go and still no confrontation. Finally, it is hereand THIS is what we get? I was at least vaguely entertained, but this should have been much, much better. This movie succeeds (barely) on being short and having a lot of (uninspired) action scenes. I wasn't bored, just extremely let down.First off, I had problems with the premise. A team of scientists discover a ""heat bloom"" from Antarctica and venture out to discover a pyramid buried under the ice. Now, I know next to nothing about science, but wouldn't a burst of heat large enough to be detected from outer space be warm enough to melt the ice? Anyway, once there they discover the pyramid is a weird series of mazes and moving chambers that seemed to house a pre-Aztec sacrifice ritual. We soon discover the humans are merely there to gestate the eggs of the Alien species. And the said aliens are merely the prey for a race of the alien Predator species, who like to hunt the acid-blooded beings.Now comes my second problem (believe me, there are many more between one and two; this is just the order I am describing them in): what exactly do the predators do? We know from the first two ""Predator"" movies that they like to travel to Earth to hunt us weak humans every hundred years or so. But, in the meantime did they fly by and check on the pyramid? I can just see them in the 1500's taking a cruise through outer space and thinking ""Nope, the silly human race has not advanced enough to travel all the way to the coldest region of their planet, dig miles beneath the surface of the ice, find our pyramid, bring to life those nastier, slimier aliens and let us hunt. Let's try again in 1600. Who's paying for gas this time?"" And the aliens sure have a wonderful shelf life! They have been dormant since before the Aztecs! And come to life at the first sign of human lifethousands of years later!!The human element is the weakest of many weak factors. There is absolutely no point for any of them to be there, other than gestating the eggs and providing dialogue. Of course, after hearing them talk, I could have done without the latter. Poor Lance Henriksen is completely wasted here. He is cast as a modern-day ancestor to the guy who would go on to finance the expedition to the planet of the aliens in the 1986 sequel (at least I think that was who he was; I think I lost a lot of brain cells watching this). Here, he's just a character with a familiar name and a wonderful actor trying to make the best out of what has been ""written"" for him. None of the other actors make any sort of impact whatsoever; they are merely present to die.And what were the so-called filmmakers thinking in dumbing down the aliens? In the four Alien movies, they were very scary creatures; kind of like outer-space versions of sharks. They were deadly and existed only to kill and would go to any means to do so. Here, they seem like a pack of barely vicious dogs. And they are much smaller than before; now they are the outer-space version of a pit bull.Blame must lie with director Paul W.S. Anderson. He has made some stylish and decent (plus the excellent ""Resident Evil"") movies in the past. Here he just comes across as a talent-less hack; a director who was handed a dream project that knew would make millions and did not bother to make an intriguing story. For that matter, he barely bothered to make a movie. Rarely have I watched a movie and felt like I was looking at a video game. This is the equivalent of watching one that someone else is playing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
AVP- Not Truly a Good Film,"This movie is sort of P.O.S (piece of sh*t) quality, but it does have a couple redeeming points. But I'll get to those. Right now is the review of AVP (Alien vs Predator):Plot: The title pretty much explains it all. but unfortunately, we don't get to see either side until at least 45 minutes into the film (my memory is foggy). Pretty much, this movie focuses on humans instead of the famous movie creatures. Plot score- 4/10, reason- because of the freaking wait for either monster to show up.Cast: Aside from Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, Tom Woodruff Jr. and Ian Whyte, the rest of the cast is sort of... well clunky. Not terrible, just not suited for this movie, that's all. Cast score- 6/10, reason- most of the cast is just not suited for the movie.SFX: One plus side of this movie (aside from the cast members that I mentioned) is the special effects for this movie. Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. (ADI) did pretty well in this movie. Companies Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore CFC and Ghost (Bionicle fans who saw this movie will recognize the commercials they did) were also good. But the one complaint I had was that the feet of the CG Aliens were not similar to the one that Woodruff's Grid costume and the stunt people playing the other ones wore. Effects score- 8/10, reason- The CG alien feet looked nothing like the costume's feet.Overall: This movie is okay, not great or horrible, just okay. Score- 5/10 (I don't want to use a sign off today because of the long length of this review)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

14 years of waiting and here it is,"look if you enjoy movies like resident evil, freddy vs jason, 8 legged freaks etc etc, then this movie is for you. i personally wanted to see really awesome fight scenes and some real continuity to the predator and alien movies. when you have a movie so fantasy based you can use your imagination to make excuses for poor writing, in this movie, you cannot. someone earlier made a great example by saying the predators were in training, but if all predators go through such a training then there obviously wouldn't be very many predators left. 2 die immediately, thats a joke. you CANT argue it was way too fast for them to die.things about the ""bomb"" being used off the arm and such is besides the point. the location, and story could have worked MINUS the pairing of the woman and predator and horrible final chase scene. she had unbelievable abilities and strength.i can also agree that this film was rushed. no real build up of suspense or any scenes that show how amazing either species is other than maybe the fighting sequences which are no different than terminator 2 or 3.i love fun action movies like from dusk till dawn but that movie has character development. the premise is absolutely unbelievable and steps all over itself but its fun to watch, the atmosphere and characters mold with the movie. here its just out of place. the characters all have different attitudes about them, they're not really on the same page. the predators don't hold true to their lineage and the aliens are the only constant except for the gestation and whatnot. the action isn't even that good. please don't tell me it is because its not. i was never on the edge of my seat except until i anticipated the final credits. look if you want to see two creatures thrown against walls and chase scenes the watch the terminator movies and jurassic park. the only reason to see this movie is to see aliens and predators on the same screen after 14 years of waiting.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Aliens in present day Earth,"Weyland Industries has found an unknown heat signature in Antarctica. Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) gathers a team to explore a pyramid buried deep underground. Inside they find an altar which they activate. Meanwhile three Predators have landed to collect their trophies.This is an idea created out of desperation. Both Predator and Alien franchises had run their courses. Somebody came up with the insane idea to marry the two franchises. There is a reason why only Henriksen returned. It should have been an obvious mistake to bring Alien into present day and on Earth. It rips apart the original Alien franchise canon.If there is any redeeming quality, it is to be found in the movie itself. It is a pretty simple creature feature with 2 different creatures. One must abandon all hopes of the enjoyment from the original franchises. There is no hiding the creatures. They are revealed quickly. Director Paul W.S. Anderson brings along the monsters and produces nothing good. There is no imagination. At least enough money has been spent that the production doesn't look completely cheap.

Enjoyable romp if you let it be ...,"I can't to be honest add much over what's been said already except that most of it is about right depending on your perspective ...The characters are 2 dimensional and mostly poorly acted, there are some pretty big plot holes and there are some problems with consistency and the earlier films.

What the hell....?,"Sorry horror fans but Alien v Predator was doomed as soon as Miss. Weaver turned her nose up at it, And went as far as to call the whole idea ridiculous And even more shocking was Paul Anderson being announced as director(Sorry Paul but event horizon is the most shameful clone of hell raiser I've ever seen.) From then on things just went from bad to worse.I watched this movie last night(27 November 2004)knowing i was going to hate it, As putting two fantastic creature features together just does not work. Look at Freddy v Jason i mean, What the hell(no pun intended)was all that about? Needless to say i did come away hating it, But i needed to satisfy my curiosity as to how bad it was going to be.Before everyone starts sharpening their knives can i just say i am a massive horror fan and i own alien 1-4 and predator 1+2 and in there own right are fantastic movies,But put together as an item they totally fail which i think is a real shame.I think the director was out of his dept with so much expectation riding on his shoulders to get it right and the actors, Well they just seemed like they where counting the dollar signs with every cheesy line they spoke from their cheesy script rather than trying to give the viewer the realism and the tense atmosphere that the individual master pieces achieved from the great yonder.Sorry all you fans out there but I'm giving it 1 out of 10 and i think I've been kind there.

Something like this is hard to rate,"Being a die-hard fan of both Alien and Predator movies, the prospect of combining both in the same movie is very alluring. While the sheer charisma of the Predator creatures (created originally by Jim and John Thompson) carries a long way, there are multiple reasons why this film does not reach the final distance. The biggest flaw in my opinion is the running time of 90 minutes. There is simply no way you can completely deliver the story successfully in that time without compromising the available potential of it.Paul W.S. Anderson, the director, takes (voluntary or forced) disturbing shortcuts too many times. Particularly, the pacing in the sequence where the Italian archaeologist explains with his lightning speed interpretation of the ancient wall-markings the history of predator-alien-ancient civilizations on earth is just lousy. That is just one example of not-so-great pacing of the film. I liked Anderson's Resident Evil because of its straight-forward style that does not spell everything out for you -- action that trusts audience's wits at least to some extent. AVP needs to spell out everything so that nobody misses a thing. Admittedly, the Italian guy is the one explaining everything (and BTW, there are such people in real life as well), still it manages to destroy the joy of figuring things out yourself.I have heard reports of studio pressure to modify the end product quite a lot (less visible violence & gore to get a PG-13 rating, at least). I am hoping that the real thing will be released on DVD sometime in the future as I also witnessed very good action sequences and suspense in the movie. Many reviews complain the lack of character development in AVP, but that is a minor concern in my opinion - humans play the third fiddle in this one anyway.A low seven is the verdict. Hope to see the dir.cut some day for higher ratings.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A lesson learned.,"And that lesson is that if you don't expect anything, you might be positively surprised. Like I was. I really hated the idea of Anderson making this film, since he's like a studio pet to me. If the financiers want a PG-rating in order to perform better at the box office, he's the guy they call (Resident Evil, anyone?). Yet, Anderson managed to pull it off this time and I'm man enough to admit if I've been wrong. And I was wrong on this. AvP rocks.Of course I would've preferred it if AvP had been more towards gore, like the original Predator or Aliens and Alien3, but it works the way it is. Anderson continues his trend plot outline in AvP which features a bunch of people getting in trouble in a hostile environment (Event Horizon and Resident Evil).Most importantly, the thing that made me happy in Alien vs. Predator is that they were respectful to the original characters. The predators are as bada** as ever and the aliens are slimy and brilliant. Plus the action scenes kick a** and the effects are great enough to support them. Hooray!**** / *****",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really good.,"It is a great movie where the two colossi face each other in a war where whatever happens we lose. The story is good, the cast is well chosen, the female leadership doesn't bother (since Weaver was the heroine of Alien everything is fine), the pace is fast-paced and if there is any complaint there is that we would have wanted more dead. Leaving aside that detail, we can see the love of the creators of the film to make a film that not only satisfied the fans but also honored two superlative characters. As long as the basic principle of telling a simple story in a great way is respected, success will be guaranteed. Very good experience to see and see again this great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another piece of royal Hollywood turd,"OK, I have to say I was hanging for this movie initially. But as soon as I saw the trailer and read up on it a bit, I realize I was to be 'royally' shafted.

(that's a ""Standard issue abbreviation"" pun for the fans of this movie)Doesn't Mr. Paul ""video game film"" Anderson know that there is so many cheesy moments in this movie and in every other movie that I have seen by him? I wasn't aware that this Mr Anderson had done all those bad movies! Man, some directors just have bad luck huh?... or is that big pay cheques? I reckon Mr. Anderson, Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr Emmerich should do lunch; collaborate on this fantastic piece of s#!t idea and kill 3 birds with 1 stone so they don't all make separate movies, and threaten the intelligence of the next unsuspecting victim.OK, that's enough of an intro... time to get serious and break this baby down!Script:: what script? was there a script in the movie? is there going to be a sequel? it was meant to be a comedy yeah? I mean I was meant to laugh in sections, laughing so hard I was spilling popcorn all over myself and the unfortunate innocent bystander sitting to my right? I'm sure the suspense was meant to be like every other Hollywood movie I've seen?The movie was meant to be hyped up like a serious battle but never delivers, as the Rated PG-13 wouldn't allow this film to get serious. Serious as in violence (not a blood splatter on the wall), real suspense (not a largely drawn out Hollywood 'standard') and real fighting (not distant shots of Alien and Predator play fighting and hitting each other with soft squeaking baseball bats).I mean this was never meant to be a good movie, just a great marketing idea to make some serious bucks by exploiting this concept. Just like a heap of other comic to movie conversions have been so far. They are based on in depth, well respected (and well purchased) comics but none of them are masterpieces. $38 million earned in opening weekend for a $65 million budget... that's pretty good.I wonder if it will have a sequel? I mean I'm not giving anything away with this movie, but doesn't a lot of Hollywood character based movies have that structure so they can milk the idea?Ah the Hollywood engine is finely tuned here... well guys, you did a great job at sucking me in and delivering another 'clichéd' marketing plan.

Maybe next time...,"...they will get it right. Better than many angry fan-boys (myself included) would have you believe, it still isn't as good as it should have been.Satalites pick a heat signature underneath the ice layer in the Antarctic. A research team arrives and accidentally unleashes the alien creatures contained within. Simutamniously, a pack of young predator hunters arrive to begin their initiation hunt into adulthood. 3 species, only one survivor.The first, huge mistake the film makes is it's white-washed PG-13 rating. All four 'Alien' and both 'Preditor' films were pretty hard R-rated; so why ostracize the fans of the films in such a way? Answer: so that kids can't in too, even though it's a horror/action film that kids shouldn't be watching anyways.Next up is the pacing of the film. Every one going to see this knows the deal with the aliens, knows the deal with the predators and knows that they are going to be fighting each other. So why spend the first 57 minutes of a 100 minute movie trying to wrap all the plot details in a mystery? Answer: actually, I don't have anything for that, there was just no reason for it. If you make a film called 'X vs. Y' you better not take 2/3 of the film for X and Y to start scrapping on each other.Which finally brings up what the film does right; once the pointless exposition (which fails to ever explain that the predators are supposed to be teenagers) is over and the action kicks in the film shifts into high gear and zips along at a break neck pace. The first battle between the two malevolent ETs is a great bit of action violence; my only complaint with it is that it makes the dull first hour of the film look all the more dull by comparison. It does finally give you what you want, it just makes you wait a long time for it.For the first hour of the film, it give it a 4, the last 40 minutes get an 8; ergo-6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"A true follow up to ""Aliens"" mythological ark mixed with horror and sci-fi suspense","To me this is a real true follow up to ""Aliens"" mythology and story arc. It is improvement over disgusting horrendous Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. I have enjoyed this movie more then the last 2 movies, it is fast pacing goes quickly around. I like this film not love but I like it. It is not the best one or the greatst one but it is decent and a good movie. AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) is field with horror and science fiction suspense that work in the movie.Directed and written was from Paul W.S. Anderson who previously directed Mortal Kombat and series of Resident Evil. I think the man did a good job making this movie. This movie deserves more than 5.6 it is at least better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It is decent, fascinating, filed with horror, sci-fi and little action.The design and CGI effect for xenomorph queen was correctly the mythology was right. Aliens did laying eggs and make a nest. The design for Alien creatures was right. I think they did it right with this movie. Tom Woodruff Jr. playing ""The Alien"" trough whole movie did a right excellent job. This are the Aliens that were portrayed in James Cameron's Masterpiece Aliens (1986). That is why I enjoyed seeing Alien creatures portraying correctly in this movie. They did right with this movie because Alien creatures did act the like they did in Alien and Aliens.Predator design and CGI effect was closely enough but nothing can top the original Predator (1987) Kevin Peter Hall the original actor who played Predator creature. Ian Whyte did a good job as The Predator but he is no Kevin Peter Hall. Ian Whyte in my opinion is much better Predator than Derek Mears, Carey Jones, and Brian Steele in Predators (2010). Ian Whyte is also much better Predator than Brian A. Prince as the New movie The Predator (2018) from Shane Black.Alien and Predator fight each other that is the best thing in the movie and does not drag it goes quickly around.The story is set in Antarctica just like (John Carpenter's ""The Thing"") a team of archaeologists and other scientists find an ancient pyramid buried in Antarctica. But soon the make a terrifying discovery: two alien races engaged in an-all out war. Whoever wins we lose. From the actors Lance Henriksen is in this movie he is a legend to me from James Cameron The Terminator too Aliens too Hard Target too AVP: Alien vs. Predator. He did a fine job playing his character. Sanaa Lathan is excellent as Alexa Woods I am really wondering to what happened to her character.On Blu-ray disc there are two version one is theatrical the other version is extended unrated cut. I only watch theatrical cut because it goes fast paced around. You have also a slasher death scenes a little gory not much but I like it. They did it right with this movie and it is a true follow up to ""Aliens"" mythological ark mixed with horror and sci-fi suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superb action violence vs. plainly preposterous writing,"To read of the production it's clear what an incredible amount of work went into it, and I'm deeply gratified at the abundance of practical effects that were employed as opposed to pure computer animation. If only one thing about 'Alien vs. Predator' is true, it's that the film looks and sounds amazing: the set design and decoration, the models, the creatures, costume design, hair and makeup, blood and gore, lighting, cinematography, editing, sound effects, and every last facet of the audio and visual presentation is impeccable. The action scenes are genuinely very well done, executed with obvious care, attention, and finesse, and they're highly entertaining on a purely visceral level. Even the very concept of the pyramid is outstanding; though it's true other stories have played with the idea, that certainly doesn't make it any less delightful here. If you're looking for a violent sci-fi action romp, then this is the movie for you.Yet I'd be lying if I said I didn't have mixed feelings. Paul W. S. Anderson is no slouch; he's a highly experienced filmmaker with a signature penchant for bombastic, stylized action flicks. What action flicks don't necessarily require is especially mindful writing. Yes, provided one can put this aside, 'Alien vs. Predator' is pretty fun. Still, there's no getting around the wild leaps in logic and unmistakable Movie Magic that allow this picture to exist. The wide-ranging expertise and capabilities of the humans in the Antarctic expedition threaten suspension of disbelief. The inclusion of a character for Lance Henriksen, extending the 'Alien' mythos backward in time, is another step in the wrong direction for make-believe. Establishing a joint history for the yautja and exomorphs, and adjoining it to ancient Earth, invites skepticism that can only be met with a resigned ""Okay, sure."" Scenes that recall other action-adventure blockbusters, including an ending that distinctly borrows from another entry in one of these franchises, are acceptable so long as you don't think too hard about it, though the very last few seconds are maybe a bit much outright. And with all this having been said, while I appreciate the effort to assure just enough removal from pre-existing canon such that the timelines remain intact for both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' series, the entirety of the narrative concept feels like one that's best chalked up as a ""what if?' scenario.On the balance I do think 'Alien vs. Predator' is entertaining and worthwhile, and again, the work put into it from behind the scenes is wonderfully admirable. I think Sanaa Lathan is terrific as protagonist Lex, commanding strong presence - and I'm pleased to see a black woman elevated as an action hero, not least in such a major, visible movie. What it all comes down to, though, beyond any doubt, is that having a good time depends on a viewer's ability to bask in the sci-fi horror action-adventure without getting caught up in the ludicrous inventions of less than judicious screenwriting that manifest the bluster in the first place. Am I glad that I watched this? Sure I am. Is it an essential for earnest fans of the converging franchises? No. Is it recommendable as anything more than a popcorn flick? Not really.Kick back, relax, turn your brain off, and just let it be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average IMDb rating of AVP today about 2 times better than that of 8/12/04,"Just saw AVP for the first time on HBO -- loved it. But I remembered everyone hating it back when it was first released in 2004. Couldn't help but wonder why.So, out of curiosity, I checked out the IMDb user comments back on 8/12/04, the first day comments are available, and found that, as I remembered, they are overwhelmingly very negative. Of the 11 comments with obvious ratings posted that day, the average score is 3.27 out of 10, very poor indeed.Flash forward to 2006, of the most recent 11 comments posted with obvious ratings (not including mine), the average score is 6 out of 10, quite an improvement.My conclusion? AVP is clearly not for everyone. Given the huge fan base of Alien, Predator and similar sci-fi films, a whole lot of people went and saw AVP back in 2004 who, for very legitimate reasons, hated it. Almost 2 years later, however, when viewed without all the hype surrounding it and by people who are approaching the film with an open mind and a strong interest (in other words, people, like myself, who would view a film that was completely slammed by critics and audiences 2 whole years later), AVP is a surprisingly impressive pop culture and cinematic work.Take home message? If you're still interested in seeing this movie 2 years after everyone told you not to waste your time, you'll love it. Otherwise, don't bother.Please send personal replies to iwshu@hotmail.com -- I don't check my IMDb messages very often.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A joke...,"Being a fan of both Alien and Predator series and even of the AVP comics and VGs (like me), when you hear a movie like this is being made, you will certainly have some doubts about its quality. I've read the original AVP comic and enjoyed it immensely and at the time thought it would be a great story for a movie. So when I first heard of the upcoming AVP movie, I had hopes it would be based in the comics. (Oh! such innocence!) My fears came true when I saw the trailer: It would have nothing to do with the comics except for the concept of having Aliens fighting Predators with powerless humans in the middle. But still I had hopes the story could be somewhat acceptable and the directing good. So I went to see it... and then reached the one logical conclusion: Mr. Paul W. S. Anderson hates us (fans of Alien and Predator) and decided to insult us with this... movie.The events occur somewhere in Antarctica, below an old mining site where an ancient pyramid is buried. A small team of experts and (of course) brutes with guns, leaded by Bishop Weyland(head of Weyland industries) and Alexa Woods go there to investigate the pyramid, finding themselves trapped in a maze with Aliens and Predators. After knowing that, the movie is an absolute joke: clichéd scenes of action, the Italian archaeologist being able to reach conclusions that a normal human being could not (for example, just by seeing the maze change its form the first time, he discovered it would be done every 10 minutes), Alien gestation time being only 5 minutes, Predators' armors and weapons melting with the Alien acid blood, and so on. It has loads of FX and matrix style camera rotations. And the revelation of how Predators used humans in the past made me remember Stargate (the difference being that Stargate was a good movie).With all this, the it isn't more than an action movie trying to put together two of the most famous Sci-Fi characters unsuccessfully.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage pure and unrelenting garbage..........,"The effects seemed interesting, the story had a chance, but Paul Anderson rushed it, the make up effects on the Predator sucked, it is so corny with it's doe, puppy dog eyes. I have been waiting close to 10 years for this movie to premiere and it sucked. Choice of actors are lagging, choice of scene execution and camera effects seemed quite familiar to what was done in his previous film RESIDENT EVIL. I suggest to all those who haven't seen it wait for rental... Though if you want to waste more money than needed by all means see this movie. Just know it is so bad that to laugh is all that can be done, not to mention the lack of backgrounds and basics of both the Alien and Predator as seen in the previous films.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A truly mediocre experience,"I had really low expectations for this film, but as it started I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised. The initial effects, the mildly funny ""spaceship overhead"" shot which turns out to be of a tiny crevice in a standard earth satellite, and the hackneyed but serviceable sequence assembling the team raised my spirits. Something at least workmanlike seemed to be on the way.Sadly the film quickly nose-dives into the imagination-free franchise sausage factory exercise I was expecting all along. When the characters arrive at the big pyramid set, any sense that there was a plot or guiding intelligence just evaporates. The machinery grinds out statutory Alien and Predator moments. Chest-burster follows Face-hugger with no tedious hanging around to build up silly suspense. A number of full size aliens not even remotely based on the number of dead people appear out of shadows or haul screaming bodies into light-wells. ""Shimmer effect"" Predator (soon to be available as an 8 inch action figure) uses its genuine retractable claws to gut over half the admittedly built-in-obsolescent human cast. After an interminable delay one of the predators finally removes its hockey goalie mask and does the team hiss, as if this was a really special moment worth waiting the full hour and a half. There are a number of what were presumably intended as ""iconic"" face-to-face moments between masked and unmasked predator and alien, that in fact seem as managed as a movie poster photo-shoot.Most of the action takes place in a huge stone building that changes its internal structure on a timer every ten minutes. Walls open or close, the floor turns into pits or lifts, exactly in the way incongruous traps and elevators enable the gameplay in every first-person shooter since Doom. We're supposed to accept the premise that ultimately the building is supposed to be an Predator paintball alley, but the entire backstory is so juvenile it's an insult to the creators of the original Alien, which alongside Blade Runner always seemed to be one of the few really intelligent science fiction films. This isn't even a comic book. It's not a fresh observation, so I'm sorry, but it has all the charm and intelligence of a video-game without the replay value.Like most of the people who'll read this I have a crap job grinding thanklessly through routine tasks for a pitiful wage. A privileged minority of people have access to vast sums of money to make the bread and circuses to entertain us coal-face workers, and I have no complaint when that results in whiz-bang popcorn movies like Bad Boys 2. It's a crime and an insult, though, when someone just grinds out mediocre corporate franchise pap like this. If he can only raise his game to the level of this sort of production line pap maybe the writer/director should have his bread and circus privileges revoked, and taste life away from the swimming pool and beach-house community for a while.",,Anonymous,Horror
The plot is quite thin but still enjoyable,"I'm not sure why so many people value the fan value or the fan base of the Xenomorph and Predator characters so much and use that as the main basis for their evaluation of the movie. To me, each movie is a separate production and it is independent of the other movies. If it still brings enjoyment to viewers, we need to acknowledge that.This film has a fairly simple and understandable structure, the plot is nothing special, if not monotonous, lacks depth, lacks authenticity, logic, and lacks conviction. It's more like a B-movie than its budget.However, that's all I don't want to remember about this movie. The rest are very positive. The first is the performance of Sanaa Lathan, the second is a round of applause for the production design and costume design, makeup, and alien design team. Oh my gosh, these are probably the most beautiful Xenomorphs and Predators that have ever appeared. The whole team is in charge of the action scenes as well. The human characters also more or less leave an impression. And especially, the movie is worth enjoying. That's the important thing. No one wants to fall into a mess like Alien: Covenant.Explaining the origin of the two species can be quite funny and absurd but I hope someone will connect the timelines of seri Predator, Prometheus, the Alien series and this movie together in the future. Remember that time in the universe is only a relative concept.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful! Just another splatter-movie!,"There's no tension, the plot is simple and nothing is fitting with the great Alien-movie history.

"Weak, weak, incredibly weak.","In fact AVP is weaker than a 10x recycled tea bag. You get my point...it's a very weak film. What else could be expected from Paul 'It's not my fault' Anderson? A man who is forever blaming studio interference for the poor quality of his films. What on earth Fox, Walter Hill and John Davis were thinking in hiring this hack I'm not sure I want to know. Trust me, no matter how naive and simple your film-going pleasures are, you will walk away from AVP forever jaded and cynical.Both franchises are best examples of their genre.Alien-Utterly faultless Aliens-Breathtaking hardcore sci-fi action Predator-Just so brilliant words fail to describe it Predator 2-Underrated sequel that plays like a story taken directly from a 1950 Tales from the Crypt comic-book. Alien 3-Notorious failure but far superior to AVP. Alien Resurrection-Very strange but intriguing weirdo sequel with some wonderfully unique touches.And now...AVP: Alien vs Predator-Watered down, childish, repetitive, boring, completely flat, soulless and castrated.Paul Anderson simply has no idea where the heart of either franchises is. He directs the film with arrogance and over-confidence. Undeniable proof of this is obvious in the scene where Sebastian says 'It's all beginning to make sense now.'I'm sorry, the sense must have been lost and me and the rest of the audience.Having seen AVP in the cinema twice now I must stress to you that the film does NOT hold up in repeat viewings. After being surprised at how 'not too bad' it was the first time, the rotten dialogue, endless exposition, slow set-up and lack of actual Alien vs Predator fighting damn this film to hell. Much like the main faults of last years Freddy vs Jason, though at least that film was a hard R-rated movie and not a kids movie.For a crossover franchise that has existed for over 14 years throughout many different forms of media, the AVP movie should have been an epic directed by someone with talent. Instead Anderson craps all over the source material and directs the worst film of his toilet dwelling career. AVP plays like a bunch of cut-scenes from the video games and totally devoid of any originality. In one particular scene he blatantly and obviously rips off a narrative from HP Lovecrafts At The Mountains Of Madness. The nerve!There are plot holes all over the place and massive gaps in logic. Like why does the acid blood conveniently only corrode weapons the Predator doesn't really need? And why oh why do they hunt in Antartica? The are drawn to earth areas of heat and conflict.Just as horror movies are desperate to come up with new, better reasons to make the use of cell phones not available to the dying one-by-one characters, AVP uses the most asinine reason to isolate the cast so no one can help.Get your head around this monstrosity...the Predators hunt Aliens in a pyramid 2000 feet below the ice on a remote island in Antartica.WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!Of course they do. And the next Robocop movie is set in a volcano below Vietnam. Honestly, it is the most ridiculous story ever concocted. How dare they release this gibberish upon an audience who, for a long time, deserve better.Despite the utterly moronic plot and pathetic characters, the film does do a decent job of tying both creatures together. Such as the Predator's fondness for triangles and multiples of ten. The Weyland-Yutani corporation's initial interest in the species. And the presence of Lance Henrikson, as Bishop's creator and the only cast member with credibility.The Predators get very little screen time (much of the film's meagre 101 minute running time-14 minutes of credits-is devoted to wandering around dark corridors...how astonishingly new) and when they do show up they are total wimps. Though the main one is a bit harder, he's a bit too humanized at the end. His facial expressions are very, very cool however.One cannot help how much better this film could have been. Even with the awful Anderson at the helm, if Alan Silvestri's scores and themes from the Predator movies had been kept then the tame action scenes would have soared. As it is, Harald Kloser's score to the movie is generic and unengaging. Yet another missed opportunity.The ending hints at a sequel. If it's anything like this count me out.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not as bad as everyone says,"I love the Alien series, I enjoyed the Predator films too. This clearly is not part of either franchise, it is its own paradigm with homages to both series. If you view this film as part of the Aliens/Predator canons, and are precious about them, you are probably going to hate this film. It's not terribly well-made - the special effects are occasionally striking, but more often look a little clunky. The scene where they discover the Pyramid is a good example - it's hopelessly out of scale, and it even looks like 1980s bluescreen..... surely no-one In 2004 would have let that stay in the film? The script is wooden, it seems like it was written by a 17 year old retaking his GCSEs, but all credit to the actors, they do the best with it that they can. The characterisations are ersatz and formulaic, that's always a bit irritating, although Lance Henriksen's character has a decent flaw I wasn't expecting. There are huge plot-holes, I know a little about Aztec civilisation but the scriptwriters obviously knew less than I did! If you can suspend these not inconsiderable failings, there is an enjoyable hokumish action-thriller here, that's certainly worth 88 minutes of your time. The pacing is fairly good, the pyramid interior is a fascinating backdrop full of images and patterns from the Alien/Predator franchises, and the creature fight sequences are exciting, if a little confusing sometimes. I confess I was on the side of the Aliens, and cheered each time they notched a kill up! There's little of the claustrophobic horror of ""Alien"", just enough action combat but not as well choreographed as ""Aliens"" or ""Predator 1"", the chilling cathedral-like atmosphere of ""Alien 3"" is present but muted in this film, and there's very little of the humour and dazzle of ""Alien Resurrection"" and ""Predator 2"". But it's far from bad. It's just not great. I can think of far worse films. Watch it and make your mind up!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"OK, could have been much better","Although it deserves only one star, I give it four because at least it was made. Fans have been thrown a bone here. Granted, a bone with no meat, but a bone none the less.The biggest problem is time. This movie barely cracks the 90 minute mark, giving the entire story a rushed feeling. No time to establish characters. It's pretty obvious in the first 10 minutes who the survivor is going to be.Remember how great Aliens was? We didn't see one Alien till well after an hour into the film. Why? To develop characters. Hicks, Hudson, Apone, Dietrich, Vasquez, Gorman, Bishop and the like all became such memorable characters, and it sucked when your favorite marine got killed.That sense of development is clearly lost here. Plotwise it ain't so bad. They discover a temple in the Antarctic, so they send a team to investigate. Apparently, in ages past, the Predators used this temple to harvest Aliens, presuming the purpose is to then hunt the aliens as a sort of right of passage. So when the humans show up, they trigger the egg hatching process. A nearby Predator ship picks up on the signal and arrive to exterminate.Again, not bad, but with the time constraints, the lack of any real effort in the acting department, and fight scenes that could have been better kept this from being a true sci-fi match-up.The end of course, hints at a sequel.

Alien Versus Predator A Disappointing Sci-Fi Horror Movie,"Alien Versus Predator is a disappointing sci-fi movie but to be honest I wasn't expecting much from this either so I wasn't too surprised that I didn't end up liking it. The movie was okay but it wasn't the greatest and I found it to be rather predictable. Director Paul W. Anderson has done an all right job of making this movie but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The cast for the most part good in their roles including Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremner, and Colin Salmon but most of them (except for Lathan) lack development and screen time because their written out of the movie rather quickly for you to care about their struggle to survive when they find themselves in the middle of a war between the nightmarish alien beasts and the deadly predators. Luckily Anderson keeps Alien Versus Predator at 100 minutes so it's not one of those films that seems to drag on forever (A.I., There Will Be Blood, or Spider-man 3). The action/fight sequences are okay but nothing memorable. The showdowns between Alien and Predator are letdowns because none of them ever last very long. All of them are missing that WOW factor you get when watching movies like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, or Spider-man 2. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either. Overall Alien Versus Predator isn't the best sci-fi adventure with so-so action sequences, good special effects, a little suspense, and decent performances by the cast but this movie could've been a lot better.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

What happened?????,"I am a bit confused here, when did Predators become team players? And when did the gestation period of an alien take 5 minutes? It must have been the cold, as we all know cold is the most effective catylist. In short, the people who made AVP are truly what sci-fi nerds call geeks. They like the same stuff but when it comes down to it its like watching a handicap kid get in a fight with a ziploc bag, its ...just really said. I would say the whole team played five minutes of AVP2 and jumped up and said hey lets make a movie. I have never seen such a cut up clusterfuck of unmatched parts. The day a Predator makes a shield and staff out of alien parts for his human counterpart is the day Ripley gets a sex change and becomes the cover girl for Vogue. But then again she was able to out run both Predators and aliens who on average can run up to 55 mph. And magically while cutting up an alien the same metal another Predator used seemed to be uneffected by the hydrochloric acid. Personally i think i'd want my breast plate and wristblades to be as strong as my swiss army knife. I really think Fox turned their back and let this idiot make this film. I mean the slogan ""whoever wins we lose"" didn't make sense because if the alien won the last Predator would self destruct out of honor and if the Predator won they would be back next year, but no instead they both die and the human is the only one left, wow give the dumbshit in charge of advertising a raise. My point being don't waste 6+ dollars on this film wait till its on DVD to rent for 3.

"This movie is Sci-Fi, not Action.","If you go to this film expecting to see an action flick, I will tell you right now you will be definitely disappointed. Paul W. S. Anderson is a master of the Science Fiction genre and taking two action legends and mashing them together would surely generate a good movie right? Almost.As I said before, this movie is Sci-Fi, not action. Anderson's previous movies were all very interesting, and this was no different. I have heard the predators described as being fake-looking, and almost plasticky, however the make-up and animatronics people did a good job in replicating the look of the aliens and the predators from the original movies. I was a big fan of the two franchises, to be honest, and looked forward to watching this film.I was fairly disappointed with the lack of pacing and suspense in the film. Anderson's other screenplays, Resident Evil I and II, have had similar pacing problems, but he is getting better. That being said, the film was poorly paced and the suspense factor was just not there, relative to Ridley Scott's original masterpiece.Overall, the film not bad, from a visual effects perspective. With a bigger budget and better pacing by way of script, it could have been much better than it actually was. I would recommend seeing it after the rental price goes down, and not earlier.I give it 3 out of 5 shoulder-mounted PPC cannons",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Calling it an Alien or a Predator movie is ridiculous,"(First part of the comment: viewed as an Alien or Predator movie)Who on Earth thought that the events of the movie must be placed on Earth? Although, we can hardly speak about ""events"" in this ridiculous cinematic disaster...Let's think about this: the Predators ruled the ancient Aztecs and some other ancient civilizations, they were returning periodically and organized great huntfests each time. BUT, in the first Alien, the Nostromo's crew doesn't know, what the hell is this acid-blooded, double-jawed killing machine they must deal with. So, if they are placing the AvP movie to the Earth and still no one has a clue about Aliens, what then? One can expect, that there will be no human survivors. But there IS one - but presumably she will not make it or no one will ever believe her.That's the point. Such pointless situations in other movies have meanings or artistic values. But pronouncing a sentence, which contains the term ""artistic value"" regarding this movie is an insane act, which should be punished by the law...So much for the ""plot"" or ""script"" of this movie, let's see the action. At first sight I went: ""Oh my, it's PG-13, what will Aliens and Predators do in the movie? Will they play chess? Will they bring flowers to each other or what? It's PG-13, for chrissakes!"" And this can be seen in every action scene in the movieThe Aliens are represented nowhere near as dangerous and threatening as in the previous 4 movies. Their movements are so corny, and the atmosphere during the scenes just doesn't fit. They are just like the other movie monsters - not that outstanding, well thought-out creatures, like they were in the Alien movies. The Predators... although, I always liked the Aliens better, but I must admit, that I realized too, that the Preds were so damn pitiful. They were like ""We are the Predators with capital P, so get out of our way, even if you are an acid-blooded killing machine. Oh, you won't? Well, then we must fight with them, guys. Oh, it's a pity, I would rather watch TV..."" I mean, how on Earth could they make the Preds so out of character? They are HUNTERS, they have a codex of honor, for crying out loud, they shouldn't have been represented like pompous, self-loving morons...As for the back-story and the ""ideas"" in the ""script"": ""Let's chain down the Queen! Oooops, some of the other Aliens can spit acid on the handcuffs, and it's melting, because we couldn't make them acid-proof, while our spears are made of acid-proof material!

But it's watchable, so I give it a 6/10.(Third part: a little explanation)Finally I gave a 6/10 to the movie.

But I have to say, that I didn't ""love it"", because I'm a fan of the first two Alien and both of the Predator movies, and I had to watch it as an Alien or Predator movie. Then, after the movie ended, I thought, that ""Well, maybe it ruined the reputation of Aliens and Preds, but viewed as a stand-alone movie, it's waaaay better than for example Queen of the Damned, which was so boring and tedious, and it's nowhere near as stupid as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""That's why I gave the movie 6/10, and not because I loved it - do not think that for a single moment!",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not As Bad Like People Said It To Be.,"Despite all the trashing from everybody else, I some how find this movie to be surprisingly good. People tend to keep comparing this to the previous movies and then slam it just saying that it isn't good enough. I don't think that is right. After all it is a totally different films and production team.I won't deny that the story is typical action movie and the characters are more or less shallow, but in the end it is very much watchable. What make this movie watchable are the action sequels that occurred from time to time and also the CGI also has been done brilliantly. The set also look great.On in All, I did have a quite a good time watching this movie. There are loads of stuff and action that keep on coming making it a good fun action movie to watch. Of my experience people that trash this movie have are stereotype and have a fix idea that the first Alien and Predator are good and nothing else can top that. Give this movie a chance and enjoy it for what it offer  loads of action scenes.Reason To Watch: To See Whom Will Win - Aliens or Predator?Reason Not To: Typical B Grade Action Movie Story.

Do Vs. Movies Ever Really Work?,"I saw Alien Vs. Predator and had ambivalent feelings about it. It definitely could have been a lot better, had better actors, better script, better reason and logic, and better atmosphere. It also could have been much worse than it was as well. What is does have going for it to some small degree is that the film was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson,a competent suspense, science fiction director accustomed to working with this kind of material. Anderson gives the audience what he thinks they want to see, and going by the money his movies make he doesn't fall far off the mark most of the time. For me(being someone I gratefully acknowledge as being outside the majority of the movie-going population) he disappoints with his cliché-ridden dialog, tissue-thin, stereotypical characters and plot threads, his over-used CGI effects, and his general arrogance to presume how little the movie-going population knows. Notwithstanding all of that, Alien Vs. Predator has some special moments. What did I like: some of the sets were impressive, a couple of the fights were well-executed, Lance Henriksen(being the only ""real"" actor in the film, and the Artic setting surrounding this hidden pyramid. I haven't gone into any detail of the plot for two reasons: (1)many other reviewers have already done so and (2)the plot is so ridiculous that any real scrutiny would be more enlightening than anything that happened in the film. Is ALien Vs. Predator entertaining? Yes, it is - like many accidents are. It has just enough going for it to keep the viewer engaged but never really satisfied.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
AVP: Action; Violence; Power.,"In 1989, everyone's favourite chest bursting xenomorphs went head to head with the galaxy's greatest intergalactic hunters in the Dark Horse comic series Alien vs. Predator; but it wasn't until a year later, when an alien's skull was glimpsed in the predator's trophy collection at the end of movie sequel Predator 2, that excited fans began talking about the very real possibility of a cinematic merging of the franchises.Fourteen years later, and 20th Century Fox finally gave them what they had been dreaming of: a movie smack-down between the creepy, bio-mechanical critters with the extendable inner jaws and the imposing, dread-locked hunter/warriors. Unfortunately, with almost a decade and a half to develop their own ideas of what the film should be, fan-boys were less than enthusiastic when the finished product failed to meet their unrealistic expectations; other naysayers included the professional film critics, who complained about the film's lack of characterisation and clichéd dialogue.It all goes to prove that some people are never happy, because in my humble opinion, Aliens vs. Predator delivers way and above what one might reasonably expect from the fusion of a gung-ho Arnie creature-feature (albeit a fantastic one) and a sci-fi series that had hit rock bottom with its last instalment.Director Paul W. S. Anderson, who inexplicably receives a lot of flak from critics and viewers alike whatever the project, comes up with the goods as far as action, excitement and spectacle are concerned, making this film not only a hugely enjoyable piece of blockbuster entertainment, but also a treat for the eyes. The set design and special effects in particular are simply incredible, with a terrific combination of CGI and more traditional techniques bringing the nasty extraterrestrials realistically to life.As far as the performances go, they might not exactly be award worthy, but since when does a monster movie require the acting chops of a Larry Olivier or Meryl Streep? Everyone involved does what is necessary of them, with Lance Henriksen making a welcome return to the Aliens series, Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner putting in a surprising appearance, and lead Sanaa Lathan making a likable and very gutsy heroine.All in all, I liked AVP a lot. My advice is to ignore the biased sentiments of the fickle fan-boys and pompous critics, and for once, go with the popular opinion: the general public took the film to No. 1 in the box office and made it a commercial success, and for good reason—the film rocks!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ridiculously bad!,"My one line summary pretty much sums up my feelings and thoughts on this movie. I never usually comment on films unless I've seen them more than two times so as to get the details of the film and attempt to look at the film more objectively. That is, however, not the case with AVP as having to sit through this film again might have resulted in my suicide. Grossly exaggerated of course but I really couldn't understand how the once mighty alien has become reduced to this piece garbage. Why did the studio give the OK for this film that clearly should have died in the early stages of pre-production. Paul W.S. Anderson should have had his license to make films removed so as not to create this kind of garbage ever again.The original Alien film had some of the best acting I have ever seen in a Sci-fi film and the uniqueness was in the fact that the characters seemed really down to earth and their reactions were believable. I think they have been described as truckers in space. That is not the case with AVP. In this film its more like supermodels in space (except of course its not in space but on earth). The film copies the original Alien in the sense that quite a long time is taken to build up the characters and make them believable. They should have picked some better actors then. Sanaa Lathan has to be one of the worst leading ladies since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls. She sucks on every front. Her performance seems forced and unbelievable. Her ability to seem scared is pretty much non-existent making the ""horror"" scenes seem fake. Raoul Bova was obviously cast because of his accent as the director might have thought it would bring a little spice to the film. That is, however, not the case and when you think about it the accent is all there is to the character which is otherwise flat and unbelievable. Lance Henriksen does his best and his character is without a doubt the most credible in the entire film. However, the dialog is very poor which doesn't exactly leave him with a lot to work with. The rest of the cast is pretty bad as well and I won't go into details about them as it would be the same all the way through.The effects aren't that good. I thought they were better in Alien Resurrection (also a bad film) which was made in 1997. The fact that 7 years has passed should have meant that something would have happened in the effects department but it really hasn't in this case. At one point an alien trips up a predator using its tail and you can literally see the predator falling backwards on purpose the effects and action is that bad. The predators have quite a few stunts but the bulky suits make the predators look clumsy rather than gracious. The fact that there is little to no gore in this film ruins it almost completely. The gore was obviously removed for financial reasons. If the film had a PG-13 rating kids would be able to see the film as well and it would make more money but there is just something terribly wrong with seeing a chest-burster scene without the gore. It just isn't done.The overall story is ridiculous so I won't go into it other than that. The story was obviously secondary. It was just a loose draft which would then justify some heavy action between the aliens and the predators but since the action is horrible there are no saving graces for the film. AVP is a horrible mainstream action movie that disgraces all the previous films with the alien in it. It almost makes me wish there was a 0 rating. Avoid it at all costs.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not the best movie I've seen but it has its good points too and I've seen worse,"I have heard a rumour that there are a hell of a lot of scenes cut out of this movie containing more ""sticky"" encounters. Whether this is true or not, i don't know. A lot of people say this movie is crap and granted it isn't exactly what i hoped for either, but like I said, it has a few good parts. I enjoyed the major (and only)beat 'em up scene between the alien and predator. this scene could have been done better as that big predator guy was way too cool to be killed by just one alien. disappointing end to that scene! I also agree with pgray2's comment about the buddy scene. Most of those who say the movie isn't as good as the written material. I agree with this. most movies (if not all) that have been based on novels or comics are rarely good. Steven King's 'Christine' is a good example of a good book gone bad on screen. Visually AVP is impressive. The predators look more intimidating than in earlier movies and the aliens look....well...as weird as ever and both of them kick ass.

"Good, But Not Good Enough","Stuff blows up, people get stabbed, great big setpieces fall down.  If this is all you require for an action movie, thumbs up, go to it, have fun.  It's rated PG-13, but don't let that dissuade you.  Your mind is already made up.For the rest of you (and me), not so much.  The reason the first half of each franchise (Predator 1, Alien, Aliens) was/were so successful was not just because of the violence, body count, or cool-lookin' bad guy, but because they were pitted against humans we cared about.  We spent time with them, we got to see them in action, and that made it all the more horrifying when they're offed, one at a time.  We're supposed to be rooting for the humans.This movie, like 'Freddy vs. Jason' before it, is made SOLELY for us to pick our favorite bad guy, and root for THEM, humans be damned.  Oddly, even ""FvJ"" had some character development.  In this one, we meet TWO whole characters in the initial set-up, and the carnage begins almost immediately. I don't care about the people, and now they're gone, and now I'm bored.It's remarkably similar to Paul W.S. Anderson's earlier movies-- we don't count ""Mortal Kombat"" because he didn't write it, and we don't count ""Soldier"" because it sucked.  The shots of the holographic underground complex, the rag-tag recruits, even Colin Salmon's death.  Not only has it been done before and better, it's been done before and better BY ANDERSON.The ending is pretty nice (if a little obvious), but getting there isn't really worth it, when only half the cast has any lines at all, and only half of them say something beyond ""Help Me!""  There's room for improvement, but somewhere in this 90-minute PG-13 C+ of a movie, there's a 120-minute R-rated A+, screaming to get out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
WORST MOVIE EVER,"Being a fan of the AvP series, I must say this has got to be the worst movie ever. Firstly the Predators were a disgrace. If anyone has read the story you would know that there is no way 2 Predators would be killed off so easily by the Aliens. Secondly the story sucked bad. There was no point to the story. it all made no sense. Since when did Predators come to Earth and taught humans how to build pyramids? Bullcrap is all I can say. To make matters worse they used some reference from the books and did a terrible job implementing them. I will never watch another movie from this horrible director.

its all about respect,"The creators/writers of this film had obviously no respect for either franchise. I don't understand how some people on these boards say that people who didn't like the movie are being overly critical. The truth is that even if you are not a alien/predator geekboy, the film does not stand up at all. I felt nothing for the characters, i thought the action sequences were really badly done and the story was awful. To anyone who disagrees, i say do this....go back and watch alien, aliens and alien 3, then predator and predator 2...ok? now all those films had an interesting story and they all had reasonable character development (you actually cared what happened) and they all were fun to watch ( hell i even liked alien 4). The main point is that even if a film is science fiction, it should still make sense in its own way....with this film there were so many gaps in logic that i realised that the creators of this film really didn't care about the end result....they were just looking to make bucks. Its funny, films like alien and predator were risky projects at the times they came out cos nobody new they would do well...and it amazes me that movie companies are willing to risk on the first film, but after that if it does well, they all try to rehash the same story over and over. I was really disappointed with this film, i remember playing the alien versus predator game a few years ago (my first introduction to this crossing of the two franchises), and thinking what a great film it would make. I just don't understand why the creators of the film felt the need to bring the story to present dayand make gradoise claims about the origin of civilisation....if they wanted to cut the special effects costs, they should have based it in a remote futuristic laboratory where scientists discover something in the aliens the predators want and shot it all in doors, reducing alien and predator on screen time to a minimum as in previous films, and building up the tension. There was simply no tension here....i would have preferred it if they had just spliced up the first couple of films from either franchise and directly combined em...it would have made a much more entertaining story.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Made for franchise but still deliciously entertaining,"A group of explorers set out on a journey to find a pyramid that is hidden miles below the earth's surface, only to find a raging battle is happening between Aliens and Predators.When you see all the sequels made from the original Alien and original Predator, a prospect of a meeting in the same film sounded like a fantasy. But low and behold it was achieved in 2004 and was an exciting prospect considering the originals broke minds in 1979 and 1987.However with the extra sequels made and the products available, they have become a franchise and when watching this Sci-Fi thriller, you will believe this was used to build on the already established brand, and was a product to test ride the ever improving CGI effects.Die hard fans of the originals will not take too kindly to the cheesy reflection on how the creatures came to be alive and the ongoing battle they have been fighting for hundreds of years. This really puts a negative vibe on the two greatest creations in Sci-Fi history. Here they feel quite ordinary, not to mention a ridiculous turn from one towards the end, he was almost human it was that silly.The reason Alien and Predator worked in their first appearances was because they were a mystery. Their presence was frightening as they hung around in the darkness without the humans knowing where they were, creating a horrific and very tense innuendo. Here we see the Predator about 10 minutes in, face on coming to earth and so the tone of the film is set and we know pretty much what will happen.However despite the essence of inevitability, there is a tense and excitement to proceedings. The humans vs the Aliens and Predators are always exciting and the finely directed action sequences will have you on the edge of your seat.The plot is pretty predictable throughout but has a great ending. Not to mention the fact you see a finely balanced fight between the two monsters, with an interesting climax. The excitement is excellent as you can never predict which out of the two the superior is. Another sequel Requiem was released in 2007 but with this interesting and open ending, it is best to leave it where it is.The humans are almost forgettable come the end. It is all about the creatures from other planets with their own lives and rules to live by.Despite the fact this was made for profit and to show off the tools on the computer screen, it is an entertaining film with some impressive action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad at all,"This is certainly more interesting than ""Predator II"" or the final (?) ""Alien"" resurrection. There are several plot holes (like the minutes thing noted above, and the absurd connection of the Julian/Gregorian calender to the Aztec -- 2004 just doesn't translate), but the basic plot makes sense. There is occasional plot weirdness, as when Stafford and his buds suddenly pull out their automatic weapons as soon as the hunter's armament appears in the crypt -- and why were they kept there, anyway instead of being carried in. But, in the main it plays.Lex (very well done by Ms. Lathan) might well be a lot irritated at the winners, having lost her entire team, and not all to the Big Slobber. I can't really see her explaining this to the cops when she gets back home: (""You ain't gonna believe this, guys."" ""Well, try us anyway, miss."") I thought there was going to be the same problem with ""Cursed"" and that headless corpse on the kitchen floor, but they cleaned that right up. Too bad they could not have done something equitable here as well.There is some considerable difference between ""bad guys"" and ""evil doers"" and certainly the outcome is predictable.

dear sweet mother of god.,i saw alien vs. predator. at the theater. and boy was it terrible. but. despite the complete disregard for a plot. scenes where predator should have been whooping some serious alien tail. but instead made friends with some one hundred and ten pound black woman who i could take if i were in a life threatening coma. that would have never survived in the first place. and the persons who edited the film obviously being drunk. it ruled. although i think a rippin soundtrack would have made it way better. maybe even def leppard being in the pyramid when they got there. anyway. i added my own music throughout the movie. all and all it was really fun. making fun of it. and besides it being really bad. it was rated PG-13. and it doesn't take a genius to realize this means no 'f' word. no graphic sex scenes. no horribly brutal deaths. only vague innuendos of potentially brutal deaths.if you have to put 'slime and gore' in the rating to make it sound cool. your movie isn't good.paul w.s. anderson. he also directed resident evil. which was bad. as well as event horizion. which just so happens to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. seriously.see this movie because it is retarded. but pay no more than a dollar fifty for it. please. god.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent middle section in an otherwise messy smack-down,"After loads of comic-books and video-games, it was only a matter of time before Alien vs. Predator made it to the big screen. Of course, the task was always going to be risky, given Predator 2 was largely ignored during its original release and Alien: Resurrection is unanimously despised by all fans of the face-hugging monster. That Sigourney Weaver and, allegedly, Ridley Scott condemned the operation before filming had even begun made things worse, as did the news that the movie would be written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, a competent visualist but a terrible screenwriter (as the Resident Evils testify). In the end, what emerged is neither the complete disaster expected by sceptics nor the great action/horror movie AVP devotees were hoping for: it is a film that, despite having some good set-pieces, leaves the viewer with the impression that the magic of both franchises' early years is largely missing.To be fair, Anderson does try to come up with a decent excuse for pairing sci-fi's most popular mass-murdering extra-terrestrials. In fact, the idea itself is not that bad: expanding on some loose threads from the original films, the story sees Predators as creatures who have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. Apparently, it is they who taught us how to build pyramids, in exchange for a few humans to sacrifice: every five centuries or so, they would serve as hosts for Alien eggs, which would later spawn grown-up victims for the Predator's rite of passage. One of the locations for these rites is a pyramid in Antarctica, and a mysterious heat wave originating from it has attracted a group of scientists led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), co-founder of the Company seen in the Alien franchise. Naturally, there is no time to say ""Something's wrong!"" before the major bloodbath begins.Actually, there is very little blood in the movie: whereas all other entries in both franchises were proud to boast an R-rating that enabled them to do almost anything (Predators skinning their victims, for example), AVP suffers from a PG-13 which was imposed by the studio for commercial reasons and seriously dampens the fun: sure, the two monsters kicking the crap out of each other are fun to watch, but where is the brutality both species crave and deserve? Even worse than the lack of explicit violence is the character development: James Cameron's Aliens is justly famous for how the director carefully crafted each of the human players and made Ellen Ripley more than just another scream queen (hell, how many science-fiction flicks can brag about receiving an Oscar nomination for the female protagonist?); this movie's heroine, played by Sanaa Lathan, is likable but nothing else, and the rest of the cast, mostly comprised of nobodys (apart from Ewen Bremner), is just a bunch of expendable idiots. The biggest disappointment is Henriksen: chosen deliberately to remind viewers of his role(s) in Aliens and Alien 3 (Charles Bishop is the man on whom the androids were based), he has absolutely nothing to do but stare at random and look concerned. Even a gratuitous reference to the knife scene in Cameron's film fails to give the slightest thrill.On the flip-side, AVP is a good-looking picture - not as gorgeous as Ridley Scott's work, but fluid and slick enough to ensure boredom rarely kicks in. The highlight is a flashback showing how the battle began, but such scenes occur far too seldom to make this an above-average experience.""Whoever wins, we lose"" said the tag-line. After seeing the movie, it's more like ""Whoever wins, we don't care"".5,5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A horrible effort at an easy movie.,"I did not expect this movie to be good, but I did not expect it to be that bad. I have to be harsh on it because this may have been the easiest movie of all time to make good. All Paul Anderson had to do was adapt the first comic series. That's all. He could have also realized that after 2 Predator movies most people know what they look like and show us the Predator's face early on and try...TRY... to get us to care whether he lives or dies. We could have seen some interaction,conflict, respect, whatever between younger and older Predators. This was done in the comic book series, and it was good.By using the comic book setting, on another planet where humans have set up a mining and ranch town, Anderson could have spared us another pyramids built by aliens movie. That premise should be officially banned from any future use. The time spent setting that up could have been spent on Predator culture. Here was a chance to showcase their warrior culture much like what was done with the Klingons in Star Trek.But in the end I'm not surprised. This is the same guy who ruined Resident Evil. And did anyone notice that AVP was essentially the same movie? He even used similar 3D map pull outs to show where the team was. He even had the same actor who was laser diced in RE get caught in the razor net. There was also the same terrible fight choreography. At least the boom mikes didn't creep into the scenes.This was too bad to even be a B movie. 1 out of 10, and that's because I saw it using a free ticket (that I want back).Paul, if you are out there, MST3K was canceled; stop making movies for them.Stop making movies period.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm afraid its very difficult to see any positives in this,"Quite frankly, I believe that this movie should be in the IMDb bottom 100. It is really that bad. But with so many (suspect) votes, perhaps I should contemplate further to check out any possible positives that this movie has? Some of us like the Alien franchise so much that we would just force ourselves to suffer through this. What could the positives be? The SFX - Paul Anderson promised to not use CGI. He lied. Very bad CGI has been used in important scenes. The rest of scenes ie the Aliens with people in suites are quite convincing looking because they were done by the original SFX team. Despite that, the Aliens behave more like stray dogs and zoo animals than the monsters they are supposed to be. The results are quite embarrassing. The Predators also act like buffoons rather than stealthy killers. In one scene, the Predator runs like a ramp model.Creativity....should not be confused with dreaming. A Pyramid buried under the Antarctic containing Aliens and all makes this a sort of fantasy film. The realistic horror is what made other Alien and Predator films stand out. With shoddy camera work, poor props and implementation, even the minimal allowance goes away.Fight scenes...show the Alien tail held by strings and the Predator blades to bend like rubber. Admitedly, this is a very difficult scene to perfect but if you don't have a Cameron like talent, you should not even try. Ultimately, while it starts out good, it ends up like a wrestling match.That about sums up any possible positives that this movie had and they were really, not positive at all.

I for one... possibly the only one... enjoyed AVP!,"I'm not one of those ""non-fans"" who just so happened to like ""AVP"".I am a fan of both the Alien movies and the Predator movies (though I thought Predator 2 was only half as good as the first).All the other Alien and Predator movies give us the depth that so many people complain wasn't in AVP. This movie is all about FUN!Some people may complain about the movie holding back on the violence and gore. My opinion, the PG-13 restraint pushed the makers to be more creative with the blood and gore. There was a lot for a PG-13 movie by the way. It almost takes on an artistic/stylish factor as opposed to drenching the screen with it.Sure, its AVP..... Not AVH (alien vs. humans), but without the humans then there wouldn't be aliens for the predators to fight. Without the humans, the AVP would have truly been a film lacking depth.I didn't think the script was so bad. It wasn't great or profound in anyway, but enjoyable. That acting wasn't terrible like so many people are saying. Trust me, there are a lot of overrated films with worse acting.Finally, my favorite part of AVP is the development between the Predator and the lead actress. I thought it was pretty cool.... who in their right mind can tell me that that is not an element of depth. If you want depth, just let the Predator kill all the humans and then what? Kill the Aliens... and then what? Anyways.In summary, this movie is not so bad, in fact I very much liked it. It is really short compared to the Alien and Predator movies, but that's okay. It is exactly what it was intended to be but I guess most people didn't get that.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An okay movie but what a rush,"Hi,I've just seen it and I have to admit..even tho I first was sceptic about the producer's view of the Alien vs Predator saga (even tho he still was wrong about it, he obviously hasn't read the books)..I liked the movie and it's an okay prequel (if you ignore some plot line holes)But the only really bad thing I have to say about it is that it was waaaaay to hastily done, it's like okay intro, that girl dies, that guy dies, big ending and that's it...next time it's okay to make it a few minutes longer (20 would be okay) and have a deeper story line than this.Oh well that's my 2 cents :)DJ_M",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily the worst film in either the Alien or Predator line,"Let's face it Sanaa Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver. For most of this film it feels as if she is being bumped from one poorly acted, badly scripted scene to the next, completely unable to take control of her destiny.The first 30 minutes of the film are filled with the usual Hollywood formula plot, clichéd dialogue and predictabilty. You feel that the only way this film is going to be saved, is for a hardcore Sigourney Weaver or some ultra cool Predators to start kicking Alien ass.But in the end it's all a little underwhelming, Predators arrive, couple of dark fight scenes, lots of running about, the human saves the day, the predator dies and the sequel is set up.And I won't even bother to mention all the holes and other obvious plot flaws which will make this movie a black sheep in the Aliens and Predator franchises. Do yourself a favour - read the comics, play the game, avoid this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not great, but cops much more flak than it deserves","I can honestly say, that this is one of the most under-rated films of 2004.Not because it was good, just because it was panned so damn hard by critics! I think this is mostly due to the fact that it was being compared to both the Alien and Predator series, which is fair enough, but it was never going to be what either of those films was.Ultimately it's downfall came from some poor dialogue, and trying to reach a larger audience. Where Predators was a film that you didn't need to have watched all the others in order to follow, it was still fundamentally a Predator film, aimed at the Predator-loving market. AVP on the other hand used references to the older films, but then completely threw the canon out the window and went for a larger fanbase. And whilst it worked to some degree (my grandma liked it) it wasn't enough of a step in either direction. AVP was complicated as a stand alone, and disastrous when compared to anything else in the franchise except perhaps its sequel Requiem (and maybe Predator 2 or Alien3).Honestly I think the film works as an archetypal film in the realm of both Alien and Predator, just not a sequel or prequel to either. The lead protagonist is a woman by the name of Alexa Woods, portrayed by Sanaa Lathan was clearly meant to be a modern day Ripley, and catastrophically failed at doing so. The Predators were as cool as ever, and people complained that in the latter half of the film they weren't as ghostly as in Predator/Predator 2, but we've already had two whole films of that, and these were juvenile Predators, so it sort of made sense that they were a tad more restless.Bringing Lance Henriksen back was an awesome decision, one that was probably lost on the audience who had not seen the Alien series.Tommy Flanagan is another an actor I love, it was a shame his character (Mark Verheiden) was so underused. Ultimately, the film is a good one to pick up and put down, don't think about it too much, don't compare it to the others, go in with your only expectation being that it's a monster-movie, then you won't come out too disappointed.59%-Gimly",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"pallid, unnecessary sequel to two series","""Alien vs. Predator"" brings together the two most popular sci-fi monsters from the 1980's to duke it out in a winner-take-all battle. The question is: does anyone care? The tale begins when scientists discover an ancient pyramid mysteriously buried deep beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica. In no time, a team of explorers and archaeologists is dispatched to the site to investigate the puzzling phenomenon. While there, they discover that this is no ordinary ruin, but a temple established long ago by outer space aliens who have made their presence known in order to lure fresh human sacrifices into their trap.With a premise that feels an awful lot like a warmed over version of ""The Thing,"" ""Alien vs. Predator"" spends virtually no time on character development and, instead, heads straight to the action - not an unusual course of events in a film of this kind, until one realizes that what distinguished both the original ""Alien"" and the original ""Predator"" from the typical action flick was having charismatic performers in the lead roles (Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively). In contrast, Alexa Woods makes for a pretty wan heroine and the supporting players are not much better. And although this film predictably registers high on the goop meter, there isn't much inspiration to be derived - even for die-hard action fans - from what is, essentially, two CGI effects going at one another for nigh unto two hours. The sad truth is that the fight scenes quickly become monotonous and boring seeing as there is nobody on screen whose fate we really care about.About the only real surprise in this film is that the obligatory ""fake scare"" scene, usually given to a cat to deliver, is here performed by a penguin.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
I just re-watched this movie,"and I'm giving it a 10 because I hated AVPr so much more.Let us speak the truth. AVP is not an earth shattering sci-fi epic. I personally find the whole idea of AVP asinine but if your going to do it do it good. In defense of Anderson, who has received so much crap from turd-brained gamers and AVP comic lovers, HE TRIED. He tried to come up with a concept that put the two alien species together and have a human element as well. The film is actually pretty slick. But that is its major problem, it is too slick. There is no attention to detail, no love shone by the director for any of the characters, ALEXA being the sole exception, but there was so much going on that ALEXA remains unsympathetic. I don't doubt the makers of AVPr love the characters but love ain't enough when making a movie. You have to be able to tell whether the script is decent. You have to be able to cast and direct appropriate actors. You have to be able to stage a scene. They are visual f/x guys but the f/x in AVPr are decent at best so even what they are supposed to be good at, they SUCK at.My biggest complaint was the pred hybrid hatchling. That is taking a stupid concept and dumbing it down even more.As for the movie, I give the Director a solid B. The script I give a C-/D+. The acting I give a solid A (Sanaa Lathan did what she could with the part, but I thought the casting was great for what the movie was--the peripheral characters played their parts well--save for Colin Salmon, I just can't stand that guy (love it when he gets shredded by the grid laser in Res. Evil.) I really like Tommy Flanagan, this wasn't his best character but I think he must have owed someone a favor to take the part. And Ewen Bremner is just a great supporting actor. I hope no one tries to make him a lead and ruin him like they did Paul Giamatti.All in all I'd really give this movie a 6 but AVPr was so dreadfully wrong in so many ways that the 10 is to poke those little twits who gave AVPr a 10 and seriously think it is a better movie than this one.The script for AVP sucks but it tries to follow a path from start to finish. AVPr starts wrong, goes in fifty directions which are all wrong, then ends as bad on down note as well. Same for the direction. Anderson got paid well I'm sure but he didn't have the love for the Alien or the Predator necessary to treat the characters as they were established in their earlier films. Other than that though Anderson actually knows how to stage and shoot a scene while the Brothers Dumbass do not. Anderson chose to go with cgi for the f/x while the Brothers Dip and Shite opted for rubber suits and dark lighting. But at least the cgi meetings between the A and the P were visible and viewable. In other words AVP was a professionally done movie (save the script) whereas AVPr was amateur hour from top to bottom.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why does everybody hate this again?,"OK before you hate me for finding this movie entertaining, hear me out Alien VS Predator is the movie fans have been wanting for years. The movie got super hyped making it receive unreasonable expectations. Of coarse it didn't live up to the hype and people hated it, but I wasn't hyped for this movie. I was 3 or 4 when it came out. I've recently been collecting movies and I wanted to watch the alien quadrilogy so I did. alien and aliens are great, 3 sucks, and 4 was almost as good as the first 2. What was next ? Alien vs Predator of coarse, I had no intention to watch this movie when I heard first about it because I heard it sucked. But then one day during school my friend said he watched Alien vs Predator and it was awesome. I thought about watching it after that and I ended up buying AVP and AVPR. I watched AVP with no expectations of it being decent, but I was wrong.I found the suspense buildup G-R-E-A-T I was clenching my pillow watching this movie because of the fear and what would happen next.The action in this movie is Amazing, although it's not any original idea for action sequences COUGH*Matrix*COUGH its still pretty sweet. My favorite part is a face huger jumping in slow motion.The story works. Not going to get into it because of spoilers but, the reason the predator fights the alien is entertaining.The only problem this movie has is acting. Some actors suck and some are great, I like how they have one character from the original alien franchise but my god has that actor aged.I think I enjoyed this movie the same reason a 4 year old enjoys Star Wars Episode 1. They never experienced the hype. but, my opinion might change on this movie when I get older like how the kid that likes Phantom Menace realizes it sucks and that the original star wars trilogy is better. Right now I find this movie enjoyable and it's as good as alien resurrection.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Insulting drivel,"Someone thought: let's just show aliens ans predators fighting, and we will throw in s b.s. Storyline and some wafer thin characters, and we'll call it a movie. They never even tried. The only thing I thought was fun in that film was teaming up with the predator. Too bad it was some irritating female character that got to do it. Imagine the carnage Arnie and predator could do if they joined forces...
In sum, this is a needlessly dumb film, which uses as a lousy excuse for being dumb the fact that it is essentially fan service posing as a film. Well, you could have done that and still had a good film. You just didn't care. I hated these dumb characters, not least because the film itself hates them.

"Ew, he slimed me!","Finally, the two sci-fi franchises meet, as was prophesied in Predator 2., when the head of an Alien was seen in the Predator's trophy room. This was in 1990. For fanboys, it's been a long 14 years.Having seen one other crossover movie (Freddy versus Jason!), I wasn't too stoked for this one. When you take two movies that have their own histories and mush them together into the same movie, there are going to be some inconsistencies.I'm not a fanboy of either series, so I can't speak to the movie's accuracy in that sense. All I know is that Alien = bad (i.e., attacks humans) and Predator = bad (i.e., attacks humans).The basic story here is that a group of scientists discovers an ancient pyramid in Antarctica, and when they explore it they find themselves in a battle between the Aliens and the Predators. Place your bets, kids! The over/under on bloodshed is forty gallons; the Predators are favored by 19 vats of slime.As with all disparate casts, the expedition is composed of scientists from varying backgrounds: a mechanical engineer, a couple of archaeologists, a mountain climber/guide, and do forth. Oh, and men with guns. Their mission is to get to the pyramid and see what's what. Leading them is Lex Woods (Sanaa Lathan); she's a tough, strong leader. You know right away she'll make it through this ordeal alive, because much of the pre-expedition focus is on her. You know, to endear her to the audience. Other characters are given short shrift by comparison.Neat little trivium: Lance Henriksen, who was in a couple of the Alien movies, here plays industrial billionaire Charles Weyland, whose company found the pyramid and is financing the expedition. Lance looks pretty haggard. I mean, he always did, but now he looks like Clint Eastwood before Clint got his Botox injections. But I digress.Anyway, long story short - they get there, find Aliens have attacked the previous expedition (from 1904!), and then all hell breaks loose as everyone has to fight to survive.There are plenty of good things to say about this movie. For one thing, the set design and special effects are fantastic, making the viewer forget the pedestrian plot and the shallow characters. Come to think of it, though, the characters really aren't all that shallow, compared with other recent sci-fis. Take Supernova or Event Horizon. No, seriously, take them. Same idea - heterogeneous crew, Something Evil afoot - and yet the effects weren't good enough to distract us from the crappy dialogue. In AvP, there aren't many memorable lines (if any), but it didn't matter.And here's why. By now, we all know what the Predator looks like (seen near the end of P2). And we've always known what the Alien's looked like. So there was no sense in keeping either hidden from view. This is Alien versus Predator, so let's see 'em fight! And fight they did, with our feckless humans stuck in the middle. This time, since we've seen some of what either species can do, some human characteristics are attributed to them, particularly the Predators, (yes, Predators plural), such as War paint, honor, and rituals.AvP is a very diverting, action-packed movie - there aren't any slow moments, and it follows through on its own premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Choppy but Still Evergreen,"Correcting numerous misconceptions about its creation, the AVP license brings to bear two of cinematic history's most potent science fiction symbols. The beloved Alien and his more civilized counterpart the Predator have been satisfying lovers of quality big screen entertainment for three decades now, and, with AVP under their belt, enter a new century of (hopefully) continued excellence.However, contrary to many a belief, AVP has little to do with the popular video and computer games bearing the same moniker. Although the core ideas are identical, AVP the movie hails from a split second cameo by an Alien skull back in Predator 2, which later gave rise to a bevy of comic book reiterations. No matter what the reason, any recurrence of these two must be true cause for ululation, for it has been way too long since we last beheld either one (1997's torrid Alien Resurrection).Sadly, though, more than love and admiration went into releasing AVP. Fox decided to convey this momentous occasion using a PG-13 vehicle, major mistake and deviation from both Alien and Predator series, each known worldwide for its subscription to gratifying violence, suspense, gore and mature language. Conversely, the 2004 addition has almost no blood, spares audiences most frightful moments, and uses its solitary F word with frugality so obvious it would shame the world's proudest of misers. But even if you can live with all these faults, remember Director Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil) probably intended and crafted this to be a full-on R rated monster mash. Since the studio decided, in their infinite mercantile wisdom, to hack and chop AVP at will, the resulting mess feels decidedly disjointed and helter-skelterish, often providing odd pacing and strange time sequences. All told, AVP's way too short, with characters buying the farm prematurely, micro-sized action segments and a sense of rush-job carelessness often associated with low-budget TV productions. And you simply know there's an agenda behind all this. Fox, playing The Company a bit too seriously, are doubtlessly working on a Director's Cut Special Edition Multi-Disc Box Set as we speak, wetting their collective lips with glee. Thank heaven for gullible fans.Make no mistake, AVP's still a solid flick, mostly due to the sheer power evident in its two key personalities. Even encumbered with bad politics, Alien and Predator still come through paws and fangs a blazing, causing audiences to cheer zealously as their fateful encounter unfolds. Speaking of which, the story's set in present day earth, so don't go expecting Colonial Marines and M40 pulse rifles. Instead, the movie offers a possible explanation as to where the Aliens came from to begin with, pitting them against a team of clueless human researchers and adventurers who think they're heading to Antarctica in search of long-lost relics. Upon arriving at the frosty hinterland, the warm-blooded expedition soon realizes there's more than mummies and fossils going bump in the catacombs, as we see the good old Alien posse getting their groove on and teeth into people's faces left and right. Led by Charles Bishop Weyland (yes, The Company's alleged founder, done by Lance Henriksen), the excursion further stumbles upon hideous tragedy when a crew of Predator braves arrives to test their mettle and camouflage gear. Things soon escalate, with Alien and Predator mixing it up amid several triumphant moments designed to make long-time addicts go ""yeah!"" in their stadium seats.To its massive credit, AVP uses very little CGI, opting to deliver excellently old-school effects and animatronics. Most creatures appear to be either mechanical models or guys in rubber outfits, and such skill in light of today's synthetic movie scene surely warms the heart. As far as the project's budget goes, as well, modesty seems to have been the operative concept, reaching a reasonable $65 million, mere pittance next to other Hollywood blockbusters. AVP exudes professional production and smooth execution, a trademark for its director, yet given a too-short runtime and brutal editing priorities, it plainly needs more space to show its true colors. Therefore, and while aware of Fox's cunning greed, this reviewer will indeed wait patiently for the unrated, expanded revision to reach store shelves or cineplexes. Such a product will grant the movie's extraterrestrial stars (from face hugger to queen) a better chance to share with us all they have to offer. As for the humans, in their present condition all stand as too brief and superficial to really care about, but you can tell several characters in their camp will benefit hugely from increased exposure.The film also includes at least one novel plot twist, novel within the context of both franchises, and you'll be surprised at the new light thus shed on one of its main constituents and his social prowess. Nice touch, and well worth the wait.Much the same can be said of AVP as a whole. We waited ages for this one to come out, and in retrospect, it's been highly justified a tenure. Sure, Ripley's absence did not go unnoticed, as didn't all of the picture's other problems, but just like she said in Alien 3, the critters have been a part of our lives for so long, we can't even imagine ourselves without them.Rating * * *",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Was 2012's ""Prometheus"" a secret remake of this?","A scientific expedition finds an ancient building in a remote and desolate place. Only this is not an unknown area of outer space far from Earth, it is our Antarctica. When it comes to how lethal this hostile environment is, it does not make much difference, though. The expedition itself is pretty competent. There is one nosy guy whose behavior can be annoying at first, but when things get serious, when it is life or death, his behavior changes for the better. Someone is very serious and gets easily annoyed by levity and sentiment, and the scars on his face can hint why. Put these two men in one perilous scenario for some time and you get an interesting dynamic to watch, especially in the ""unrated"" cut of the film. Also, these scientists are pretty careful. And they are accompanied by men secretly carrying weapons in case trouble should arise. There is an old man overseeing it and funding it because he is interested in it. There is also a heroine here, only she is careful, rational and competent. Also, there are deadly alien creatures you don't want to cross paths with.""AVP"" features a solid cast in a motion picture that had the unenviable task of bringing two famous movie monsters together. The way it was done may raise a question or two, but the movie does not pretend to be extremely smart and focuses on the right things. It has a plot where predators fight aliens.

Also, it may not break any new ground anywhere, but it does have creative imagination and passion behind it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

not as bad as I feared,"For some reasons 'Alien vs. Predator' has a bad name. Critics did not like the film. or maybe the idea of bringing together in one movie horror characters from two different flick series does not seem too original. Maybe so, but it was done before, and will be done more, I am sure. The film is not by far as bad as they say and I expected. I am a fan of the genre, and I would see almost all that was and will be put on screen in this genre, but 'Allien vs. Predator' has a consistent story, is not too difficult to follow, effects are OK, and the graphics are average plus. The original 'Alien' design was by the famous Swiss artist Giger, and the following films in the series including this one kept the cool repulsiveness of the original designs. Director Paul Anderson does not fall much from his original 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Resident Evil'. Main actress Sanaa Lathan is no Halle Berry, but I doubt that Halle Berry could have extracted much more from this role. The problem with the rest of the actors is the fact that they spend too little time on screen, and we do not really get to know them beyond the cliché, or even less. This is probably the main problem of the film - despite belonging to the horror-sci-fi genre it never succeeds to make the viewer too involved or too afraid. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointment at its prime,"I watched the Predator movies after seeing parts of Predator aired on Spike TV. I watched them both 3 or 4 times because I enjoyed them so much. I zipped through the Alien series but I still liked them and got to know the Aliens' history as well as the Predators'. I then set my sights on Alien vs. Predator in hopes of seeing an excellent, action packed, historically accurate Alien AND Predator movie mixed together as one. But I was clearly wrong.Not to be rude or demeaning but this movie was pretty bad.The Positive: Don't get me wrong, the action was decent, the CG were great also. And Lance Henrickson even appears as Captain Charles Bishop Weylend (obviously a reference to the Alien movies, where Bishop the droid worked for the Weylend company), he was good in this movie. Also, I liked how the Predator was actually more of a main character than some random killer. The Predator was probably one of the best characters and everything. Also, the story was pretty good.The Negative: As I said the story was good, there were some huge problems with it. One of them was their history. Why was it that the Aliens' and Predators' histories were randomly intertwined. However, this was never previously mentioned in any of the other movies, and I do think this is something that should be mentioned. Also, the aliens were on Earth...why? The fun of the original movie ""Alien"" was that they were randomly found in space and never heard of. If they were on Earth, are we that dumb that we've never seen them before? Also, if I recall, the Predators only came in hot weather, hence only in the South American jungle or in L.A. during a heat wave, so why are they suddenly in the NORTH POLE? Aside from that, the pacing in this movie was bad. All the characters were killed in one small time period, then there would be long periods of nothing happening.This movie was disappointing.

What could have been one of the most awesome movies to grace the screen in years turns out to be one of the worst movies to grace the screen in years.,"Well, if you haven't already figured it out, this movie sucks. Too bad, it had so much potential too. There are numerous problems with this movie, well here we go:Acting: It is poor. Other than Lance Henriksen, who doesn't really have much to work with, the actors clearly can't perform well. They are no-names and they quite frankly deserve it.Direction: Mediocre at best. There is no talent in the direction here.Script and Dialogue: I am not one the Paul W.S. Anderson haters, I have no problem with several of his films, but this one is just shameless. The dialogue is terrible. The actors aren't good, but even if they were, the script doesn't give them much to work with, case in point being Lance Henriksen who is slumming in this role. Yes I understand that Predator has bad dialogue too, but it is enjoyably bad dialogue at least. Numerous quotable line, my favorite being I ain't got time to bleed. There is no memorable dialogue here, it is just stupid dialogue.Editing and Rating: They edited this movie to a point beyond bear-ability. You can barely tell what is going on during the hectic moments such as the fight scenes. Combined with the dark lighting and it is very confusing. This is mostly due to the shameless rating of the film. A PG-13, come on. I guess I can't blame the producers for this one though, had it been R the movie would have done no business because no adult in their right mind would like what is on display here.This is shameless, disposable entertainment of the worst kind designed to make teenagers think they are watching a movie. It is a chore to sit through. Other than a couple of very brief genuinely cool moments, that encompass less than one minute of the film, there is nothing worth watching here. The target selling point of the film, other than the name recognition of course for fan boys, is the fight scenes. Well there are indeed two actual alien vs. predator fight scenes. But they are disappointing, as they are on a small scale and are over quickly. Plus they are edited ridiculously and dark to the point beyond recognition. You also have to wait a good while into the film( at least 45 minutes for the first one) to get to this point. And by then, the audience will be bored or asleep due to the poor acting, dull dialogue, and mediocre direction.There is nothing here, no dread, no terror, no excitement, no fun, no awesomeness, no enjoyment, no wit, no charm, no humor, nothing genuine at all. Except genuine suck. The aliens on display here provoke no fear, and the predators are pushovers. The creatures of the previous films should teach them a lesson for masquerading as them. This is nothing more than a cheap retread imitation of the other films, without the atmosphere, thanks to the overwhelming darkness of the film, and without the proper pacing, thanks to the first 45 minutes of watching the humans walk around and act like idiots.

Not great but decent movie,"I can't not believe this movie is already 10 Years old,The last night was the first I saw it in full.I did think, it took a while for the movie, to get going, I was bored with first half hour but I just could not care for those people.All I was waiting for was Alien VS Predator , I really enjoyed the fight scenes with these AliensI Thought it was decent battle. it was not to long and wasn't to short and over in seconds.Things about this VS movies, is that you always feel, that one monsters are better or feel less evil, then there pass movie.I don't like the Predator felt more of goody in this movie, even Alien saved her in early part of the movie.I thought Alien was great in this movie, I actually felt sorry for most of the Aliens, I did not find it as fun as Freddy VS Jason, which was lot more fun.I wasn't to keen on the back story of movie, those scene was way over the top and looked really bad and silly. thankfully those scenes more longer.I thought it was decent, it could have been so much better then it was.(You know who side I am on) Alien all the way!The acting was okay in this movie, from the cast, i found everyone to be little annoying, I wasn't big fan of final girl, I was hoping for someone to killer her.Will be giving a sequel watch later6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good action between the aliens, but everything else sucks.","I was worried returning to this that it probably hadn't aged very well, but it's on the better side of decent. The alien and predator action is by far the best thing in it as is the lore, it's everything else that pretty much sucks. The characters are dumb as hell and have the worst dialogue, our lead girl and Lance Henriksen are really the only two bright spots. Also, this could have benefitted from more gore. Making a clash of your two big horror franchises PG-13 when both have been hard R since the start is beyond freaking stupid.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
not good enough,"i just finished watching the movie at the cinemas right now and I'm quite disappointed with it. the movie has made it that predator is weak and not very effective. if anything predator woulda owned them all, another movie should be made with BETTER fighting scenes where u see EVERYTHING and predator should be made to wot he can really do, sure aliens r strong but predator can take them out with his technology and weapons. at sum parts the movie was good but there's too much focus on the humans, there should be more on the battle with predator and alien. and the when the movie does go on the humans...they should have tech weapons like mini-guns and stuff. anyhow i new and better movie should be made!",,Anonymous,Horror
I'd say one of the better movies from the Alien and Predator films.,"This movie came out back when I was still rather young, and being a fan of both the Alien and Predator series, I couldn't wait to watch it. While I agree with some users on it's lack of acting quality and such, I really don't see why someone would give this film such a low rating. It has the best of both worlds, Alien and Predator action and violence, and a decent plot as well. The setting is rather odd and random, but that wasn't really problem for me. I really enjoyed this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bitter disappointment,"It's been two and a half years since the release of Alien Versus Predator and you can still see the collective fanboy disgust at this film reverberating round the Internet. On the one hand, you've got to thank Paul W. Anderson really for giving fans of the Alien franchise something to talk about besides David Fincher killing Hicks, but on the other it is undeniable that even with the benefit of hindsight, the critics who derided the movie when it was first released were right in their estimations. This is definitely a weak movie and considering the awe-inspiring smackdown it should have been, it's understandable that the geek contingent, myself included, were bitterly disappointed.The chief problem of course is the lingering sense that it was knocked out for a quick buck or two and nothing more, with the target audience made up of hip youngsters who listen to nu metal and have a TV in their room permanently switched to MTV. You know, those idiots who walk around with their jeans slung low so that we can read the labels on their groovy Calvin Klein boxer shorts? Well, in keeping with the music video aesthetic, things move quickly. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all if Anderson's directing approach had consisted of him stood off camera, waving his arms at the cast while shouting ""come on come on, faster faster, more flare, more zing, more kapowzer! The Ritalin's wearing off!"" We've barely met any of the characters before they're being jetted off to the Antarctic to meet a series of unpleasant endings. The action starts roughly half an hour into the movie and fifteen minutes later, nearly all the principle cast have been killed. Where was the gradual build up of tension? Where was the careful handling of atmospheric unease? Where was the mounting sense of dread? Oh, that was what that penguin scene was all about...right.Adding to this is the fact that you really don't give a damn about any of the people involved, they're merely there to provide explanations and die screaming. As such, none of them really develop any further than the sketch pad and it's amazing they even bothered to take the time to think up names. They could just as easily have been cast as lovable Scottish idiot, spunky tough black girl, dashing Italian know it all, dying old fella, bastard British bloke and expendable extras. An entire generation of movie goers jumped with astonishment when Kane's chest burst open, shed tears when Vasquez blew herself up and punched their fists into the air with reckless enthusiasm when Arnie's final trap worked. All you're likely to do this time around is stare blankly and count the seconds until the next one.Woeful though the plot, characterisation and cheesy dialogue may be (the ""hunter's moon"" conversation is the stupidest thing ever. Ever ever ever), Alien Versus Predator does have one thing in its favour...Man, when the two species actually get round to killing each other, it's so cool. Years since imaginations were set reeling by the trophy scene in Predator 2, there is a terrific burst of adrenalin when the two finally collide. The bruising one on one duel at the centre of the film in particular is totally bad ass, with stone masonry and ancient bricks being shattered into dust as the two monsters collide, acid blood spurting, wrist blades glistening and mandibles flailing as they try to wrench each other out of existence. Its popcorn munching mayhem of the highest order and just about the only thing that the movie does well, but still enough to lift it into the realm of passable entertainment.It cannot disguise the fact that AvP isn't the almighty ruckus that teenagers and twenty-somethings have dreamt of all this time. Truth be told, it's not a bad film and if it hadn't contained the two famous beasts, but replaced them with new creations and gone under a different title, it'd probably be regarded as fun little B-movie. Given that the sequel is imminent, you can only hope it improves in the second round but otherwise, fans of both series would be better off seeking out the original Dark Horse graphic novel that was at least as good as the earlier movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not very thoughtful, but keeps you occupied","I saw Alien vs. Predator a lot of years ago, and I remember it leaving a bit of a non-impression on me. I remembered it as a little dull, and a bit daft. But recently, I went through both film franchises again. I decided that after the stupid Predator 2, the boring Alien 3 and, well, whatever the hell Alien 4 was, AVP couldn't get much worse. Having given it another go, I was thoroughly entertained by it.There's not much of a story, the plot is narrow and the human characters don't have much to offer. It was nice seeing the old familiar face of Lance Henriksen again, and Ewan Bremner and Tommy Flanagan are decent. As for Sanaa Lathan, she's certainly no Sigourney Weaver, but she does a fair job at holding her own as the leading lady. But after the first half, she and the rest of the cast really have very little to do. Once an hour or so is spent teasing us with slight glimpses, references and homages, the focus permanently shifts to fleshing out the history and mythology of our two titular beasts, moreover, watching them knock lumps out of each other.First of all, AVP is a welcome improvement over the pathetic CGI blob of Alien 3 and the hybrid monstrosities of its sequel. The creature designs in this one are refined, back-to-basics designs that made the first two films work so well, including a welcome back for our favourite Alien, the Queen herself. All the Aliens are scary and menacing looking. Some have criticised their scenes for being too dark, but that's their trademark, and how they should have been kept. Surrounded by darkness, barely visible, not knowing which corner they're gonna leap out of next. In this respect, Predator becomes a much more threatening villain too. Adapting to the horror tone of its counterpart, it still delivers the action thrills the Predator films are known for. Watching the two of them fight is a real treat for the eyes and ears.Nonetheless, in spite of everything it has going for it, it still doesn't leave that big an impression on me. It really doesn't make you think. But for its two hour run-time, it will keep you occupied. It's the best Alien film since James Cameron's Aliens and, dare I say, it's the best Predator film so far. I was expecting nothing more than watching the two beasts scrapping with each other and killing each other in imaginative ways. And that's exactly what I got. I'm a happy shopper.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not bad at all,"OK, the idea that these two monsters would have a history together was so outrageous that the expectation that there could be no plot line worthy of even the quickest breakfast at Starbucks between the screenwriter and producer. Yet this movie actually pulls it off. I went in thinking this is going to be a B movie at best, and came out of it wanting more. The likelihood of a sequel is slim, and I think the idea is only a carry over of the utter blowing away of my expectations. Now that I think more about it, I don't even remember questioning whether there were holes in the plot. That is something I usually do in movies like this. This movie was entertaining enough to force me to overlook the whole ""let's pick this apart"" type approach. It was surprisingly enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could have been immensely enjoyable but instead comes off as strictly watchable,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDr Wood (Sanaa Lathan) is asked to head an expedition out to Antartica to explore the remains of an ancient pyramid.Already skeptical about her crew's lack of training,upon arrival,she finds even more reason to worry when they realize they are not alone.The aliens and the predators want to duke it out for ultimate supremacy.......and whoever wins...we lose.Lance Henriksen makes an appearance as the Bishop character he originally played 18 years ago in the film Aliens,who's now head of Weyland Enterprises,who fund the expedition.Aside from this,the film makes limited use of the mountainous potential it had to poke fun at itself and be self-referentialising and self-depreciating and instead kind of takes itself a bit too seriously.A few years ago,the film's director,Paul Anderson,made a film I thoroughly enjoyed by the name of Event Horizon.Since then,he's gone on to make more strictly action-orientated stuff like the Kurt Russell film Soldier or the Resident Evil movie.That this movie lacks EH's eerie sense of impending claustrophobia and instead chooses to follow in the afore-mentioned film's footsteps serves as a real set-back for it.The action itself,namely in the shape of Alien and Preddie's battles,isn't bad,as the body count rises and they weave their blood-thirsty path to victory.However,it's never as awe-inspiring or fun as it could have been.You can see the ending coming before it arrives,yet the plot somehow still manages to just about be engaging.But where the film really comes to life is in the F/X and creature design department.The Mother-Alien (funnily enough,a toy I remember owning as a child!) is fantastic and the Predator creature designs are nothing to sniff at either.Overall,this isn't a film that manages to blow you away or excite you as much as it ideally could (or even should!) have,but it's an engaging enough joint venture for two of sci-fi horror's most memorable and endearing characters.***",,Anonymous,Horror
I kinda liked it...,"I mean, come on. This movie was supposed to suck. And in that very vein, it didn't disappoint. It was, uh, shot pretty well. And the sets they built were relatively detailed. They spent a lot of money, didn't they? Why would you go to a movie called Alien Vs. Predator and expect great acting? What, if you really wanted expensive loss leading Hollywood schlock you got it, right? The investors sure did. And 2 years later? Meh, not bad. Not great. I suppose I could have surfed Digg for another 2 hours, but this movie provided an entertainment that looked expensive, and probably was. Movies like this are a dying breed in Hollywood methinks.

More compelling than Predator movies,"This is the first crossover movie between Alien and Predator series. At last, 18 years after the second and best Alien movie (Aliens 1986) and 17 years after the first and best Predator movie (Predator 1987) we are faced with a pleasent action movie involving both creatures. The plot is obviously delicately studied. The underground world is nicely constructed, resembling the mysterious places in Indiana Jones movies. Characters are generally relatable. They are not wannabe badasses nor do they try to deliver silly one-liners unlike the Predator movies (except the first one). The only downside is that most killing scenes are kept out due to PG-13 rating. Inclusion of gory scenes would have made it more appealing for fans. Otherwise, the movie is compelling and definitely worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The special effects were flawless.The negative side of the film for me was the dialogue.I wonder how much of the dialogue could have been left out but still leaving a visual feast and not losing any of the plot or the atmosphere.I loved the film and I hope there will be another one with the same cast and special effects company.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Deadly dull with the horror limited by PG-13 rating,This film never recovers from the opening 45 minutes which are deadly dull. All we do is watch a bunch of B-movie thespians wander aimlessly around for what seems like an eternity inside a pyramid in the antarctic (!) waiting for the titular villains to finally show up. The horror is limited by the PG-13 content of the film. (MINOR SPOILERS) The film treats the predators as the good guys. There's some peculiar human-predator bonding towards the end. The Special Effects can barely be made out in the dark. This film is a massive letdown from the previous films in both the the Alien and Predator franchises.Overall 3/10,,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun monster action from two popular series, but human scenes and isolated settings dampen the show","Movies made for fanboys are often a disappointing enterprise, but such is not always the case. Every now and then, a studio manages to get something right, especially when the premise is so intriguing it would be nearly impossible for it to fail.Nearly. ""Alien vs. Predator"" is a testament to the durability of both film series, not quite the best realization of the idea, but still a very entertaining movie. Where it lacks the suspense of the earlier films, it makes up for in a sheer pleasure of witnessing a long awaited grudge match.The Weyland Company has recently discovered an ancient pyramid located 2000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. Company CEO Charles Weyland(Lance Henriksen) has gathered together a team of explorers and adventurers to excavate down to the pyramid and explore the site. They include Alexa Woods (Sonaa Lathan), an expert on the Antarctic environment, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), an archaeologist who specializes in civilizations with pyramids, and Greame Miller (Ewan Bremner), a photographer who comes along to document the event.However, upon arriving at the site they discover that a hole has already been dug, as if it was in anticipation of their arrival. Once they enter the ancient structure, they quickly realize that it is actually a hunting ground. Two rival extraterrestrial species, one the warrior breed Predators and the other, the both insect-like and reptilian Alien xenomorphs, are at war with each other. The explorers quickly deduce they've been led into a trap, and must find a way out the pyramid while simultaneously dodging attacks from both killer species.""Alien vs. Predator"" is the type of film made specifically for the fans and people of morbid curiosity. Like 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" the movie will divide up the viewers between their preferred monsters. I myself am an Alien man, but am open-minded enough to cheer on the Predators as well.Unfortunately, there isn't much here that we haven't seen before, and furthermore, the movie lacks the kinetic edge that the original films in both series possessed. This is an action movie, but a dark and disturbing one at that. Still, the story moving this whole enterprise is basically just a gimmick, not a plot.The movie also makes some nods to a few other sci-fi horror movies. The Antarctic location is obviously an homage to ""The Thing,"" and the pyramid, a death trap whose rooms are constantly moving around, is most likely a nod to ""Cube.""As Woods, Lathan is smart, resourceful and tough but still vulnerable. She's obviously meant to be the Ripley character, though she unfortunately lacks Sigourney Weaver's human edge. Lathan is up to the challenge, and it's neat to see her in this sort of environment after doing dramas like ""Love and Basketball.""Henriksen is fun in the role of the billionaire adventurer who wants his immortality. As the only real established actor amongst this cast, he adds a level of professionalism that would otherwise be missing. His role is also an inside joke for fans for the Alien series.The other actors are competent, but not special. Most of them are just fodder for the monsters, but Bova manages to make an impression as the Italian archaeologist looking for a missing link between the different pyramid civilizations, only to find that he's sorry to discover just what it is.Director Paul Anderson has a long history of making films such as these, including his own ""Alien"" homage ""Event Horizon."" He is proficient with creating atmosphere and he keeps things moving along nicely, especially in the second half when the actions starts to kick in, but he lacks fellow ""Alien"" series helmer Ridley Scott's ability to build unnerving suspense, or James Cameron's all-out knock down actions scenes. From the ""Predator"" camp, he's also deficient in John McTiernan's gung-ho machismo.""Alien vs. Predator"" is not intelligent entertainment. In fact, it's unlikely it will have much of an audience outside the real die hards of each series. It's been 14 years since the last time Predators have been on screen, and seven for Aliens. Still, various different mediums have kept both series alive, and Aliens and Predators have battled before in both novels and comic books for the last decade or so.It's a fun movie to watch, and there are some unsettling moments. Also, there's one creature in the film that manages to come off sympathetic, or at least as sympathetic as either of these creatures can be. It's a nice, unexpected twist in an otherwise mundane plot.You'll either like ""Alien vs. Predator"" or you won't. There's not really much middle ground here. Plus, some of the hard-core fans may be turned off by the PG-13 rating, thinking it will be a watered down version. Rest assured though, there's still plenty of blood and gore, but mostly alien blood at that.While it is fun, the movie may also be a disappointment to those expecting some epic battle between the species. What we have here is an isolated pit fight, not an all out war like the ads seem to suggest. The fights are intense but usually one-on-one, and can be over pretty quickly at times. Still, for those of you who are curious, ""Alien vs. Predator"" is certainly worth hunting down.Six out of ten stars. A very fun movie to watch with great atmosphere, but it's not an all-out war between species and the human characters are just fodder to get between the different monsters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
AVP is a waste of my time,"Simply awful. I felt both hurt and offended by this lightweight, soulless attempt to re-invigorate a once great franchise. For the first time in many years I felt compelled to turn the film off before getting to the end. Not one character had anything other than two dimensions, shallow cartoony motives and a bare grasp on the leaden, unoriginal script.Only its familiar and favourite movie aliens save it from being an all out failure, an early clash between the monsters does provide a burst of excitement. Yet these also suffer badly with repetitive shots that have simply been re-cycled from the earlier originals, and with much less effect; the Predator removing his faceplate, a close up of an Alien, all goo and teeth. And the clumsy-looking, over-sized rubber Predator suit, that nostalgia will forgive in the original, here simply looks dated and lazy.Nothing here innovates in the way that the earlier films did, it is simply safe, by the numbers film making that could, and should, have delivered on the great potential it promised.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Never put ""vs."" in a title","This movie is not bad (if you liked Predator and Alien flicks). If you didn't like those movies you won't like this one. This movie wan't all that bad.

The sacrifice room worked. The ending was good. This movie would have grossed 10 times as much and gotten a IMDb review of 6.5 or higher if they would have picked a different title.

"Not bad, but could have been better","Alien versus predator was bound to happen and even back in 2004 its production wasn't a surprise with the 2 famous sci fi - horror francizes spawning lots of movie sequels and video games. When a ancient pyramid is discovered deep under the ice in Antartica a crew of scientists and specialists are tasked to investigate. As you expect from these kind of movies, nothing go as planned and the team is caught between the fight of the two alien species. The script is nothing special and has many holes but it gets the job done which is to provide a reason for the two creatures to fight each other while getting many people you don't care about killed. I must say the encounters between the predator and the alien are very well done and you will find what you are looking for if you are a fan. AVP is well paced and as soon as the action starts taking place you will enjoy it. The main problem of the film is that it lacks substance and you can see clearly that everything happens just to see the two creatures fight.
Overall AVP is not a bad movie and it is a decent effort to please the hardcore fans and entertain the average sci fi horror fan along the way. Just try not to take the plot too seriously.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

A complete embarrassment to both franchises,"I really wanted this movie to be good, I went into it kind of skeptical as a sort of defensive measure because it had the potential to suck even though I REALLY wanted it to be good. I'm a big fan of both franchises, I loved BOTH Predator movies, I loved the first two Alien movies, the 3rd and 4th were kind of meh. But no defensive measure could have prepared me for how terrible the movie actually is.Paul W.S. Anderson is only called in to do mindless mediocre action/popcorn flicks. In this case, the jerkoffs who decided to hire him are from Fox, they know that an Alien vs Predator movie is going to draw a fair amount of cash already, so they don't want to pay too much for a director/writer. I f*cking hate them for doing this, purposely making a movie that has no substance whatsoever just because they don't have to work hard to make a bunch of money because they know that many people will see it just because of the name.The movie features a crappy plot with a slightly interesting premise, terrible acting (although Anderson really doesn't give any of the actors anything to work with, just look at Lance Henrikson, he's a good actor but he had nothing to work with here, so the person to blame for the terrible acting is Anderson himself), horrifically crappy camera work during the fights, extremely cheesy scenes that are funny even though they aren't meant to be, and A LOT of errors to do with both the Aliens and the Predators.I give this 0 out of 5 stars, there is no excuse for this travesty of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

You need to think about the movie to realize it's good points. The good points of this movie are. Great special effects, awesome environment, and (the reason we all came to see this movie) The aliens and the predators duking it out. The alien and predators designs weren't that bad either. The weapons stayed the same as well besides a modification in the razor disc. I had been anticipating this movie ever since the jaguar game came out. And i was pretty happy with the results myself. The casting could have been better and the could have reserved the F-word for the ugly mother F---Eur line. But these things can be over looked.

One star for the original design of the creatures,"Which was done years ago of people who probably would want no association with this movie whatsoever. Its remarkably how they have managed to take these so perfectly designed horror creatures that has made so many great scares before and turn it into nothing. The action scenes have no impact, the camera-work is laughable and the editing takes away the suspense. About the humans? Well the woman is good looking at least. Mr Lance Henriksen should be ashamed. And I cant understand the point of making the predator so superior to the alien. Actually I thought that the alien would be far stronger and the predator would have to outsmart it. Then again, its a long time since I saw the original movies. Best bet to get some chills and see some proper film-making would be, I guess, to make an alien vs predator night in which you see Scotts 'Alien' original from 1979 and then see the original 'Predator' from 1987 and then discuss who you think would win.

Enjoyable fight sequences but everything else is quite boring.,"An expedition of archaeologists on Earth discover an Aztec temple hidden under the Antarctic circle, housing a host of Alien creatures. A group of coming-of-age Predators have also come to the temple, as it has long been a training ground for their race. From there on, it's Aliens vs. Predators, with the humans caught in the middle.This is a fairly hard movie to rate as I can easily say that I was disappointed with the movie as a whole but I thought the action/fight sequences between the Aliens and Predators were stunning. Clever use of slow-motion with bone crushing thuds everywhere as Aliens and Predators recklessly trash the set.Now that I've proclaimed my love of the action sequences, it's time to say a few things that I don't like. I don't like the fact that it took so long to get into the actual action. I'd say that it takes like 45 minutes at least just to get to the first action sequence. Yeah, from then on in it gets interesting but everything before it was pretty much a snooze-fest. I hated pretty much every single human character shown on screen. I actually prayed for their deaths... quicker would have been better and the lack of violence towards the actual humans also lets this one slide down the scale a bit. Don't get my words mixed up, there is quite a bit of violence in the movie, it's just not gory or bloody.There's also one thing about this movie that seemed to work well on me and that was the playing field. It seems that the Predators alone have an advantage over the Aliens in one-on-one situations so every time I saw a Predator get slaughtered, something inside of me stopped. I felt weird, I don't know how to explain it but it was a powerful feeling. Kind of like the feeling of a highly obsessive fans' favorite sporting team reaching the final game and getting their asses whooped! I hear a lot of people don't like the plot but it's not that bad and what a lot of people don't understand is that Anderson tries to tie the movie in with the comics, he may not have ended up with a masterpiece but anyone who's been a fan of AvP before the movie should know and respect this. Also, the fact that this movie wasn't even finished by its deadline is another reason why it got so sloppy. I'm not saying it would have made the film any better by giving it some more time though it may have given Anderson and his crew a lil' bit more credit where credit is due.Many loyal fans will be disappointed but hey... unfortunately that happens.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Bad, But Could Be Worse","Director Paul W. Anderson (the brains behind the awful Resident Evil films) tries his hand at a franchise woven into science fiction/horror history by such legendary directors as Cameron and Scott and the result is predictably bad.The plot involves a team of archaeologists facing off with the terrifying creatures from the Alien and Predator films.A major problem of the film is that it simply isn't scary enough. In fact, compared to the MA ratings of previous films in the franchise, this one barely warrants the M. It feels like a kid's movie. The creatures, while superbly computer generated, just don't feel gritty enough to produce the claustrophobic and arachnophobic intensities of the previous films. To put it simply, it isn't scary enough to be classed as a horror but falls way short of being an interesting sci fi. It also plays very superficially. The film lacks any real symbolism or depth.The film is set in the present day as opposed to the distant future of the Alien films, which may lead hardcore fans of the Alien films to take offence to Anderson's 'tampering' with the timeline, introducing new facts and theories into the fray. Some fans might have preferred no plot at all, I suspect, instead opting for an hour-and-a-half battle between the two creatures.Claims that it is the 'worst movie of all time' are great exaggerations, although any hardcore fan of the Alien/Predator films might come away feeling cheated. Far from being a masterpiece, but there are definitely worse ways to spend 100 minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Glad I bothered,"Understand and accept all the comments and criticisms of AVP. But when I finally saw it last night (alone, the only person in the entire theatre!) I actually rather enjoyed it. For all the ludicrous hokum of the script and set-up/back story at least there were some ideas on screen, unlike, say the very limited scope of Alien Resurrection. I also found the way the story, such as it is, resolves more satisfying than Resurrection. I agree that the fight sequences are somewhat inconsequential. For all that, some nice dramatic ideas, especially the pyramid reconfiguring - certainly more inventive than the confusing chase/decoy climax of Alien 3. The face hugger scenes are suitably horrible and the Predator space ships satisfy. Given the script, thought the cast did well. Was not convinced about Sana'a Latham until she played the more intense scenes (the brief moments where she starts to lose her nerve, or has no lines at all to work with in the climax). Good job. Also enjoyed the all too brief appearance of Agathe De La Boulaye. Bit of a franchise tradition here for me, prematurely killing off characters (John Hurt, Charles Dance) who I think are working well in the movie. I'd say the real victim of the movie are xenomorphs - inside the pyramid, they are not nearly nightmarish enough. Having said that (and not wishing too give away too much) the scenes near the end with whale bones work stand comparison with other memorable moments in the franchise. It's much more a Predator movie (and I didn't like either of the originals).On its own terms, as a B-movie, without AVP is enjoyable. Come on Ridley - let's have Alien World.",,Anonymous,Horror
A pretty good blending of two similar franchises,"It was an old idea, marrying two franchises that aren't producing and trying to stir up some life in them. Granted, it had been done before; Predators have been fighting Aliens for more than ten years in the comics. But this pairing made a lot of sense; both franchises started as semi-horror films (Predator, despite a grotesque amount of machismo, is essentially a horror film at its core) and graduated on to a sequel that was far more action than horror. So both franchises were a blend of the two elements, and since both dealt with creepy xenomorphs that treat us as prey, it only made sense to shove them together.AVP spends a fair amount of its abbreviated run time  87 minutes, including the credits  trying to prove its geek cred. There are numerous references dropped to Aliens, in particular (still a fan fetish fave) and they go through a fair amount of effort to show respect and knowledge of the movies that made this one possible. And then, wisely, they shuck all that out the window and just give us, essentially, a good old-fashioned shoot 'em up.Stuck in more for continuity's sake than anything else is Lance Henriksen, playing Charles Bishop Weyland (are you really trying to insinuate they would build an android three hundred years later that looked like the founder of the company? Come on), who serves as the plot motivator for this whole little shindig. The film follows a fairly standard formula; establish suitable creepiness in an unusual place, give us just enough character to make us care about at least a few of the people, and then drop them in a pit full of creepy crawlies and see who makes it out.What differentiates this film from the zillion others like it (The Thing, Ghosts of Mars, etc.) is that we sci-fi geeks have an avid interest in the two warring sides because we've sat through the twelve or so hours of prequels (more if you've seen them all on DVD) that set up this film. In a way, for sci-fi geeks, this is like that old comic book where the Hulk finally fights Superman and you get to see who's stronger. And therein lies the whole thrill.The writers do give us a smidgen of people to care about; chief among them are Sebastian (Raoul Bova) and Alexa (smartly played by Sanaa Lathan), whom we follow through most of the film; there are other characters, some even played by people you would recognize (one of the lesser hoods from Snatch; and one of my favorite not-yet discovered actors, Colin Salmon), but you've seen enough of these movies to know who's going to make it to the final reel and who's not by the time you're fifteen minutes into the story.Where AVP succeeds is in the way it spools itself out. There's a lot of time devoted to building tension, but it pays off nicely, even if it ignores all previously established continuity (and I say, go ahead. It's not like you're adapting the works of, say, J.R.R. Tolkien and you need to be precise or anything); all of the time exploring the creepy alien pyramid is well done (it's in the trailer, I'm spoiling nothing), and when the A's finally do get it on with the P's, the action is delivered in short, sharp bursts, the way it should be; no lengthy CGI battles, no utterly unbelievable sixty-foot jumps, just a couple of ugly butts slamming each other around.They do follow some of the conventions of both movies, but not slavishly, and I found that a nice homage. One thing I have always liked about the Alien films is their strong female heroine (even if it is always Ripley, or a derivation), and I was pleased to see that continue here; Alexa is cool, confident, capable, but very human.The movie speeds along at a decent pace, and is overall enjoyable as a summer flick and a sci-fi action yarn until the hideously predictable ending. You sort of know where it's going the second you see the Queen alien (may God damn James Cameron for that retarded 'innovation' to the Alien race), and you can see the ending choreographed a mile away. Which is a shame, because other than that, AVP is a pretty good film that achieves both its goals; one, to be digestible summer action fare, and two, to blend two similar film franchises into one, yet be respectful and dedicated to the conventions of both of them. Anyone who has read  or written  crossover fanfic knows this is not always easy to do, and the AVP folk succeeded marvelously on that score.Is it worth going to see? Depends on how much you like horror/action bug hunts. Of this type of film, this is a pretty good one. There are better ways to spend your $7 at the cineplex as summer is winding down, but there are far worse ones as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good action flick,"Firstly, it's obvious to me that Paul Anderson was not trying to capture the original movies in these series.He was going for something unique, and in his own style. This movie was meant to be an action movie, not a horror movie. It was meant to solve the question that has been asked on many occasions. Who would win? It was not meant to further the plot of each franchise. He did not set out to do this at all which he made plainly obvious.Take this movie for what it is worth. The acting is of an acceptable level considering the genre. This movie wasn't meant to win any acting awards. The acting is secondary, it's the predators and aliens themselves that this movie is based on. I can see that he is trying to turn this into a franchise. Not an aliens franchise and not a predator franchise, but a franchise all on it's own. As far as I am concerned, it has succeeded. The story made sense, the action was great, the effects were great, and the acting was fine. It set out to do what it was meant to do.I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't obsessive about either series. If you are looking for a predator 3, or alien 5 movie this isn't it. It's Aliens Vs. Predator. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pretty boring,"Alien vs predator is pretty boring. It has a very slow start, that is not interesting whatsoever, and it wasn't scary enough. It did have a really good story, good fight scenes, and an unexpected twist. Honestly this movie would've been more scary if it had lots of jump scares, for example there was a scene where I expected a jump scare, and they were building up suspense, and then nothing happened. They were staring into a foggy box, and none of them knew what was inside, they were staring for a long time, and then it turns out it was just some predator guns. I understand this scene was important to the plot, but because there was no jump scare, so there was no point of building up suspense.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
what is wrong with being worshiped as a god?,"the beginning of this movie almost kills it. rich men wanting to be the first to find something historic always seems to be a action movies theme. once the predators arrive on earth though, this movie is well done. to be honest, I have always hated the alien from sigornea weaver fame, this is the same one so I still hated them. The plot which seemed pathetic at first, to test the future predators against aliens, works out well after you watch it twice. Indian made young braves do the same, as did Aztec warriors, so why not an advanced civilization. the hike leader , whoever she is, is definitely the best actor in this movie. the cgi graphics are amazing, watching the predators come in and go out is fabulous. the ending watching the creature come out the injured or dead predator inside the predator ship lets you know there maybe a chance for a part 2. I hope so at least, but if there is, hopefully the writing wont let the cgi artwork be the only thing that shines!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why you shouldn't see this movie,"One word summary of the movie: Insulting. Or maybe blasphemous.Alien was a work of art, setting the atmosphere just right, along with a healthy amount of death. Predator was nonstop and stunning action, making sure you knew each of the characters before they died, and making sure that the Predator was as awesome and VILLAINOUS as possible.Alien vs. Predator did nothing of this.Acting: poor. I've seen better acting in soap operasPlot/Story: very weak. Predator's plot never really holds up to too much scrutiny, but it's so enthralling that you're willing to overlook that. AvP's plot is even weaker, but without the enthralling movie part. It's the kind of story a nerd in 7th grade might find cool, but the rest of us, especially those old enough to have seen the Alien and Predator movies in theaters, will break out laughing in the theater.Direction: It deprived the Aliens of all their horror and made the Predators less predatory and hunter-like. In short, it was boring, cheesy, and often insulting to both the Alien and Predator movie franchises.Effects: lame. Had the movie been rated R like all of the Predator and Alien movies, this might have been better.Overall: This movie really isn't worth your time. If you're not familiar with either the Alien or the Predator movies, you should stay away from AVP because it's not that good of a movie. More importantly, if you ARE a fan of either of the two movie franchises, don't see AVP or you'll come out of the theater wanting to tar and feather Paul Anderson, or maybe sic a face-hugger on him. He managed to take the two coolest movie creatures and transform them into something trite, stupid, and boring.Save your money. Don't see this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Entertainment,"I know many people were disappointed with the fact that this movie carried a PG-13 Rating rather than the eagerly anticipated R. I went to see AVP with my 12 Year Old Son and I must say that the rating faded into obscurity because of the action. Lots of folks were really panning this flick for its lack of cinematic quality. BS! This is a movie made to entertain and scare you. No one ever imagined this type of movie would be Oscar's Picture of the year! I say that the girl was sexy and tough, not realistic but in a fantasy kind of way. The Predators were Awesome as were the Aliens.

As I knew it was going to be bad before, my thoughts were right. The movie was just awful. No character development, a totally different story from the original classics, bad acting, and a lot of corny scenes. I was just mad by the movie, that they turned the whole stories around and made like Predator, the ancient gods which is really stupid. The only positives were the fighting scenes. They were cool especially when that alien kills one of the predators. Other than that the movie was a waste and I guess you might like this movie if your a die hard fan of Alien or Predator.Hedeen's Outlook: 3/10 0 stars F",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""How do you say scared shitless in Italian?""","""Alien vs. Predator"" is a crossover science fiction film that brings together two iconic extraterrestrial franchises, creating a thrilling and visually spectacular cinematic experience. Released in 2004 and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, the film pits the deadly creatures from the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series against each other in an ancient pyramid beneath the Antarctic ice. While not without its flaws, the movie offers a compelling blend of suspense, action, and fan-service.The primary reason to watch ""Alien vs. Predator"" is the excitement of seeing two legendary sci-fi species face off on the big screen. The film successfully captures the essence of both franchises, delivering intense and well-choreographed battles between the Xenomorphs and the Predators. The concept itself is a dream come true for fans who grew up imagining what would happen if these two formidable alien species were to collide, and the film doesn't disappoint in bringing that vision to life.The movie also introduces a captivating backstory, delving into the ancient conflict between the Predators and the Aliens, providing context to the epic showdown. The setting of the ancient pyramid adds a unique twist to the narrative, blending science fiction with elements of archaeological exploration. The film's commitment to expanding the lore of both franchises while delivering on the promise of epic battles makes it a worthwhile addition to the sci-fi genre.One of the notable weaknesses of ""Alien vs. Predator"" is its reliance on a somewhat formulaic plot. The narrative follows a group of humans caught in the crossfire between the two alien species, and while it serves as a functional framework, it may feel familiar to viewers who have seen similar survival-horror scenarios in both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises. Additionally, the character development is limited, with most of the human characters serving as cannon fodder rather than fully fleshed-out protagonists.The film's pacing can be a bit uneven, with moments of intense action interspersed with slower, exposition-heavy scenes. While the setup and backstory are necessary to build anticipation, some viewers may find themselves wishing for a more balanced rhythm throughout the film. Furthermore, the CGI effects, while groundbreaking for their time, may appear somewhat dated to modern audiences.While it may not reach the heights of the individual ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" films, it successfully captures the essence of both, providing an entertaining and visually engaging experience. Fans of science fiction, particularly those who grew up with these iconic creatures, will find plenty to enjoy in the film's thrilling battles and expanded universe.In conclusion, ""Alien vs. Predator"" is a cinematic showdown that caters to the inner sci-fi enthusiast in all of us. Its strengths lie in the excitement of witnessing these iconic extraterrestrial beings clash on screen, coupled with a compelling backstory that adds depth to the epic confrontation. While not without its flaws, the film stands as a testament to the power of imaginative storytelling and the thrill of seeing beloved franchises come together in a visually stunning spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This Could Have Been So Much More.,"I have always been a fan of the ""Alien"" movies. Even the weaker installments, I've found some traces of good in them. And admittedly, I found some parts in here that I liked....But you can already sense the ""but"" I'm about to interject, can't you?There were some gaping issues with this film, starting with the characters: You knew almost nothing about them, and what's worse, cared even less. Take ""Aliens"" for example. Every Space Marine, no matter how early in the film they died, you knew something about them. You knew about their motivations or relationships with the others, or even how they handled crisis situations. With the introduction of the ""best of the best"" hand-picked ""Jurassic Park""-esquire team of scientists, you don't even get that luxury, even with the drawn-out meeting and trip to the dig site. A few nice ""Bishop"" references, but that's about all the viewer gets for things to come in the series. There was one female character who talks about ""always being prepared"" as she brings her gun along, but with that hint of foreshadowing, you think she'd play a pivotal role in the film. Think again.And then the frustration with actual meeting of the Aliens. What did they do to the incubation period? I've seen bags of Jiffy Pop that don't complete as fast as the chestbursters in this film. What was an hours/day long process in the previous films was instigated and completed even before the researchers had time to leave the first room. After the long character set-up that established absolutely nothing, I can understand wanting to get the plot rolling, but you can't cheat the established ""rules"" of the characters to get there. But Anderson did anyway.I had issues with the Predators, save for one hardier survivor. So much for the ""great warriors"" that they've always been known as. The fight scenes (which should have been the whole meat of this film), were reduced to little more than spastic jump cuts that obscured the majority of the action.People have been waiting YEARS to see this, from all the video game and comic book stories, and it's reduced to a PG-13 slugfest that doesn't show the intensity and no-holds barred attitude that should have been there. Both ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" are R-rated franchises. They should have stayed that way for a reason. The main heroine was certainly no Ripley, which makes one wonder how she was able to survive through the continued challenges in the film. And lets not forget another ""Jurassic Park"" fight moment between the survivors and the Alien Queen. Anderson must love the JP films, because so many references were lifted from the first film.It's not that I hated this movie, it's just that after waiting for so many years, it wasn't what it should have been. They cheated established character rules. They gave characters you couldn't care less about. It took too long to get to the title grudge match, and even when it did, poor editing destroyed any intensity it could have had. And the ""surprise ending"" is what should have been done a few minutes before the ending, so that there would have been more to play with in the film. I wanted to see THAT as the ending conflict. Not a Jurassic Park tribute with the Alien Queen. They had so much to work with, and they didn't.The only positive aspect of the film were a few ""Bishop"" references, and a few cool moves during some of the conflicts.I wanted more. I got a little. Hopefully they'll do it better next time, or release a ""Director's Cut"" on DVD to actually make the fights worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Barely entertaining...,"Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Godzilla vs. King Kong, Freddy vs. Jason... it ain't new to confront characters from different horror ""franchises"", and they usually aren't very successful.

A good budget for a pretty bad movie. Barely entertaining, so (soooooo) far from the original Alien series and even from Schwarzenegger's Predator. Well, who cares? PS: Lance Henriksen, who played android Bishop in ""Aliens"", has a role in AVP too (the businessman who finances the expedition that will lead all the guys to the monsters).

"Paul W.S. Anderson, I want those two hours of my life back...","Sweet. Merciful. God. I don't know what I did to deserve seeing the abomination known as Alien Vs. Predator. Maybe I was just bored? Maybe I thought the movie would be as good as the other Alien/Predator films? I don't know. All I do know is that this movie spits on and destroys everything in the past movies. I would now like to make a few comments:1) CGI does not work. At the end of the movie, there are shots of a CGI Queen alien that looks like a T-rex from Jurassic Park.2) Total death of the Alien mythology. Okay, so now we have facehuggers who implant people and in less than 10 minutes, chestbursters pop out. What the hell?3) Many plot inconsistencies, including: the strange Predator vision that has been changed from the previous movies, the fact that at the end of the movie there is a person running around in sub-zero temperatures wearing nothing but a sweater, the aforementioned facehugger-to-chestburster timeframe, the fact that two Predators can get wasted by an Alien in a span of 5 minutes, the number of aliens running around does not correspond to the number of potential hosts (most of which were killed), the fact that a Queen Alien is still living after many centuries, the issue of Charles Weyland having already showed up (or somnething like him) in Alien 3, and many others...4) Cookie-cutter characters. Since this movie is only an hour and a half, no one really cares if any of the main characters die, Also, the acting is atrocious.5) PG-13 rating. Obviously Fox wanted to market this to teenagers, and as a result, much of the gore and violence that were present in the previous movies are gone here (with the exception of Alien-on-Predator gore).I wanted this movie to have an R-rating. I really did, and this is coming from a 16-year old. Being a person who owns the Alien Quadrilogy and has actually READ the AVP books (the same can't be said for many other people), I had high hopes for this. Then I realized that Paul W.S. Anderson (director of such box-office disasters such as Soldier and Resident Evil) was directing this. That's never a good sign.

"One plot contrivance leads to another, and the next thing you know a massive war between Aliens, Predators, and humans ensues.","Is there really any need for me to review this movie? Critics are gonna hate it, women and the elderly will try to avoid it, and fanboys will go see it no matter what. But I try to convince myself that my voice is *always* needed, so here we go.If you have no interest in seeing this movie, then I really have no incentive to convince you otherwise. If you've already cleared your calendar and got your tickets, well, you probably don't have a girlfriend. But that's irrelevant. Much like you have to do whenever you go on a date, I suggest you lower your expectations right now. If you do that, then you might just come away somewhat entertained. There's no guarantee, but at least your chances will be better. Certainly better than getting that second date. *rimshot* I'm sorry; I just like to give fanboys a hard time.AvP (as the hipsters like to call it) is not what I'd classify as a ""good movie,"" but at times it does pass for entertainment. I was never bored, and it kept my interest, so hey, I don't regret seeing it, but my biggest disappointment is that this could have been so much better.The plot is pretty hokey, but I won't give it away just in case you prefer to wait for the revelation during the movie. However, I will tell you that the actual revelation is beyond cheesy. Here's the deal. The humans make their way down to the pyramid, we find out that the mother alien is dormant in the pyramid, and we see that the Predators are in their spaceship and they're headed to ... yep, you guessed it ... the pyramid. So I'm sitting in the theater thinking, ""So what's the connection? I hope they explain what's going on."" No problem.Thankfully, a member of Henriksen's team can read hieroglyphics, and lo and behold, there are hieroglyphics in the pyramid! But wait, that's not the best part. Somebody actually took the time to write out the entire plot of the movie in hieroglyphics in the pyramid! So dude proceeds to read the plot summary to us as we're treated to a flashback. Give me a break. That's the best they could come up with? Couldn't they have, you know, put forth a modicum of effort and somehow developed the plot within the context of the movie? And don't get your hopes up, the connection between the three races isn't exactly sci-fi ingenuity.Some more laughable moments involve an Aztec calendar and the reconfiguration of the pyramid. One of the guys from the team claims that since the Aztec calendar was based on multiples of 10 then this must mean that the pyramid was designed around that. Of course, that's the solution to all their problems. This is supposed to explain why the pyramid reconfigures itself every 10 minutes. Whatever, man, just whatever.And yes, I realize that I'm referring to characters as ""dude"" and ""one of the guys,"" and believe me, you'll be doing the same thing if you go see the movie. Long gone are the days of Arnold and Ventura. Now say hello to... well, I don't really remember anybody's name, and I didn't really care to either. It's sufficient to say there's a bunch of people with accents, and we all know that accents are used in an effort to disguise bad acting.One good thing about having mostly unknowns is that you don't know exactly who will die and who will live. However, one bad thing about having mostly unknowns is that there's a good chance they can't act and most likely won't convince you to care about them. I shed not one tear over any character's death. Did Mr. Scientist Geek just get killed? Yeehaw. Go Predator.Oh, and I'm just curious. If you came face-to-face with an alien, and this was the first realization of alien existence, what would you say? Would you be speechless? Or would you say, ""You want a piece of me?"" I didn't think so.One other thing I need to address is the PG-13 rating. A lot of fans are upset about this, and well, you should be. The result is that this movie is fun for the whole family! Seriously, except for an ""f"" word, this is safe even for pre-teens. I don't think they should've had additional profanity (typically a sign of lazy writing), but this is a movie that should be overflowing with Alien/Predator gore and violence. Instead, we get a few sanitized fights with very little gore and very little slime. Some of the fights are cool, but there aren't enough, and they aren't as chaotic as they should be.I'm also not a fan of the Predator with a heart of gold. There was a scene near the end where, I kid you not, I thought the Predator and Sanaa Lathan were going to kiss. Somebody in the theater actually said, ""Oooh, she's gonna kiss him!"" Folks, if you're a fan of the original Predator then you know that there shouldn't even be the threat of that happening! I have no idea what they were thinking there.Let me end with a piece of advice for you. If you ever find yourself going one-on-one with a Predator and it turns its back and starts to walk away, man, just let it walk.THE GISTDo you love movies that are filmed in a lot of dark locations with a lot of spooky music playing in the background all while characters are walking around slowly? Does this scare you and keep you entertained no matter how simplistic and silly the plot is? If so, then Alien Vs. Predator should keep you entertained. However, if you're expecting this to just completely blow your mind then I recommend lowering the bar of your expectations before entering the theater and try not to sob too much over the missed opportunities.",,Anonymous,Horror
promising premise falls short of expectations,"The recent additions to the Alien and predator sagas have fallen short of their original first films. Alien, Aliens and the original Predator are the classics that set the stage for countless imitations. Alien 3 lacked the suspense or action that the first two films possessed while the 4 installment was so awful as to not be worthy of the being considered a true alien movie. Predator 2 also was a mediocre attempt at capitalizing on the first films successes (it should be noted that the original was Arnold's true break out film as his marketability rose substantially after this movie's release, a feat unable to replicate). In combining the two genres in the much anticipated aliens vs. predator we have a film that could have been much better, much worse but managed to be in the middle. First critical point was the overuse of bad music (why not keep with the original scores of either aliens or predator), another sore point why did the film take place on earth why not follow the plot of the hugely successful video game Aliens Vs. Predator 2, budget perhaps?, it also lacked the claustrophobia that the first or second films had, also the action started too quickly, the people died to easily for you to care. The dialog between the grunts lacked the authenticity of the rapport that bill Pullman had with his fellow marines in aliens finally the new heroine in this movie lacks the magnetism or authenticity that Sigourney weaver offered Ripley. In short go to see it to get out of the house not too view another classic in the making.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

painful,"I can take a lot when watching sci-fi films. I loved both the Aliens and Predator movies. And add to that the fact that I went into this movie with very low expectations due to the poor reviews I saw beforehand.And I still came out of it terribly disappointed. I would have walked out had I not been there with friends. It was so bad that I found it more interesting to eavesdrop on the couple sitting behind me than to watch the movie - and people talking in movies is normally a major peeve of mine.On paper this should have been a classic. The overall story concept wasn't too bad. The 'mythology' behind what was going on in the movie was clever. But thats about where the praise stops.The characters had no depth. I could have lived with that, but everything about them dripped of cliché. But you'd think the action would make up for it. It didn't. I didn't find the action in any way exciting. Bad direction or what, I don't know. I just know I couldn't wait for it to be over.Quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'd watch the D&D movie over and over again, straight for 15 hours, before I watched AvP again.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'd rather watch my balls in a blender,"I don't write reviews on IMDb very often. In fact I had completely forgotten that I even had a login name. Anyway, I felt compelled to write something regarding the awful pile of shite that is Alien Vs Predator. Although it was some time since I saw it, I feel it needs to be ridiculed again in light of the recent DVD release.AVP is without doubt the worst film that I have ever watched (and I've seen Police Academy: Mission to Moscow). I didn't even bother watching the last five minutes because it was just so terrible.I want to keep this brief but firstly I would like to make an appeal to all film studios the world over. Please please please stop giving W.S. Anderson work! He's clearly a talentless waste of space and his small but significantly crappy portfolio shows that.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great crossover,"I don't care what everyone has said about AVP, I thought it was pretty freaking good. I mean Paul WS. Anderson dosn't have the best movies, but this one was great! I mean, you got aliens and predators, fighting till the death, it was great! I mean sure it's not as good as the first 2 aliens, but it sure blows the hell out of the 3rd. I admit that it wasn't fantastically written, but, it was still really good.One huge thing I noticed was that they didn't use CGI for the aliens and the predators, which I thought was cool because when you see movies like that these days it's usually all CGI, none of that good old real stuff. I think that they did justice to the other films by doing this.Please go and see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gets better each time you watch it - extended version best,"Like many movies of its genre, this film is exactly as expected, so its never going to get the greatest accolades or win any Oscars. The first time I saw AVP, I didn't rate it that highly, though I thought it was OK. However, having seen it once or twice on TV I began to warm to it, so when I saw a cheap copy on Blu ray going in Blockbuster, I decided to buy it. The disc has two version of the film, the theatrical release and an extended version.In terms of the overall feel of the film both are similar, though the extended version does have some additional ""explanations"" which the theatrical version leaves you wondering about. Now I have seen this film 4 times, my initial feelings of disappointment have changed to thinking this film should rate around 7/10 overall - it certainly delivers what is expected with above average effects and storyline for its franchise mix.So don't feel put off by the low score on IMDb. If you like Alien and Predator and have a blu ray player then get the extended version - you won't be disappointed. Go on, give it a chance",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Damn You, Anderson!!!!","Paul W. Anderson, director of Resident Evil, has made a VS. movie, WITH VERY LITTLE VS. The plot, acting, directing and scripting is awful. He has disgraced both Alien and Predator franchises by inserting this load of crap.The story is about an ancient pyramid deep-below Antarctica. A group of Archaeologists set out to uncover it and explore it but surprise surprise, their caught in-between some ancient ritual between Predators and Aliens. Soon their fighting for their life to escape the pyramid.For a VS. movie, this has VERY little action in it. The few scenes of fighting that occur, are poorly directed. The acting is terrible, the scripting just as bad. The plot has many holes, the only thing that is good is the cinematography.Let's hope that if there is a sequel that Anderson will NOT direct and that someone can save the two franchises from utter destruction.1½/5.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolute crap,"My summary says it all. Only enjoyed fighting sequences with the aliens and predators. Even Predator 2 was a bit better than this. Arnie is just the best!!! It seems that technology is just taking over good acting and good scripts. The acting was just absolute rubbish, and I also feel that this type of movie is made to appeal to the masses. I remember when the original Predator came out it was a movie that your parents didn't want you to watch.Just feel that it doesn't have the dark, adult atmosphere that this type of movie should have. And of course they JUST HAVE TO throw in the line ""your one ugly....."" you know the rest. Sounded so cheesy coming from a woman.

Why was Paul W.S Anderson let any where near this film ?,"This was a film that was made for 12 year olds with no knowledge of either of the monsters .it should and would have been great if any other director would have taken it on, but instead fans of both franchises have been cheated !!!!!!!.......At only 90 minutes long there hardly any character development and at a PG-13 rating the action scenes are lame, The story is as predictable as the NFL playoffs.This should have been the mouth watering sci fi horror that fans have been waiting 10 years for since the Alien vs Predator comic and the Predator 2 movie (Danny Glover's glace at an Alien skull).If you want to watch a toned way down ,predictable,overall disappointment go see this film , 6/10die hard fans should wait for the DVD , hopefully there will be an unrated version with some well needed deleted scenes .(SIGH)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Rockn' Good Time!,"Weeks before Alien Vs. Predator was released into theaters, I was already laughing. If it wasn't bad enough to squeeze every last dollar out of little kids by toning down a should be R rated film to a wimpy PG-13, it was further blessed by Fox giving the project to writer/director Paul Anderson, who's ugly resume includes Event Horizon and one of the worst movies of 2002, Resident Evil.Happily, AVP prevents strike 3 for Anderson. It's a rockn' good time and one of the best monster movies since the all time great, Aliens.To keep up with the special effects and moderate budget, AVP has no familiar names such as Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts. Our main character is played by Sanaa Lathan (Alexa Woods), an expert mountain climber who has been called to the line of duty by billionaire Charles Bishop (Lance Henriksen). Bishop. Now why does that name sound familiar? (watch Aliens for the answer).It turns out one of Bishop's satellites have discovered a pyramid 2,000 feet below the earth core in Antarctica. Since Bishop knows others will soon discover it as well, he's willing to pay top price to anyone who will help him explore it. Alexa senses danger from every corner, but curiosity gets the best of her so she agrees to lead the expedition.Now we've got problems. The Predator's aboard their own ship have been watching from space and it turns out they are responsible for the re-appearance of the pyramid and when opened up, it's show time.Once inside, the crew finds out the the pyramid is a maze that adjusts itself every 10 minutes and when the first surprise unexpectedly hits, everybody gets separated and a few end up being hosts for the aliens who began to spread faster than a social disease.The best thing about AVP is the attention given to the aliens and predators. One disappointment about the original Alien was we never got a good look at it. Here we have an all out experience in virtual 3-D with in your face close ups of the monsters and the battle sequences with with alien and the predator are done to the cue. And we also find out that a dead alien can make one hell of a fighting weapon.A nice way to end summer at the movies._______________________________________________________________________I rate the entire Alien/Predator series as follows:Alien ***1/2Aliens ****Alien 3 1/2*Alien Resurrection ***Predator ***Predator 2 **1/2",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent special effects, horrible acting.","Overall I think I rated this a 4. I mean who doesn't love Predator, just to watch Predator alone it was worth the money. Die hard Alien and Predator fans will find this a must see but don't expect it to outshine previous releases featuring these two monsters. When it came to the dialogue and humor, this movie fell very short. Lines from earlier Alien and Pedator movies are reused and didn't get even a chuckle out of most of the audience. Though Lance Henrikson stars in AVP, (played Bishop in Aliens) he doesn't bring very much to the screen. Most of his screen time is spent wheezing and coughing. The heroin was overbearing and lacked sex appeal. Ewen Bremmer (Spud from Trainspotting) could have been a lot more humorous. Should you see it? Yes.But I would wait for it on DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great entertainment for die hard fans!,I suspect that hardcore fans of Alien and Predator movies will lap this up. I did.Paul Anderson delivers an action-packed film that has a game feel (just like Resident Evil did). OK so the acting is not the best and the plot is sacrificed for fighting but I really enjoyed it! Anderson is faithful to Predator and Alien folklore and he has respected that his audience will be mainly gamers or fans.Anderson has received a lot of stick for his films but they are always watchable and I will watch AVP again just for the cool fighting and salutory references to previous Alien and Predator films. No Alien/Predator collection would be complete without this.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great idea, badly done, but tolerable","AVP was hyped as much as the second coming. 2 of the biggest sci-fi horror franchises coming together in an amalgamated effort designed to cash in on both's fanbases while hopefully not alienating (No pun intended) either market. Freddie V Jason had already been, and frankly was quite a pleasing effort which managed to be both entertaining and gory while being acceptably contrived. So in the same vein comes AVP which sees a fairly mediocre cast brought together as a group of scientific experts on a mission headed by Weyland, boss of Weyland industries, played by Lance Henrikson (In pretty much the only single homage to either franchise) whose imaging equipment has uncovered something big in Antarctica. On the mission to explore it things start to go predictably awry, and before long it's a battle between aliens and predators for something or other.There's no doubt this film was great on paper - a cataclysmic battle between 2 of the biggest movie warrior-types around would make for a great movie if done properly. Problem is, not enough good work went into this.Firstly the dialogue is quite toe-curlingly embarrassing. Lines like 'I'd rather have a gun and not need it than not have a gun and need it' serve to make you cringe, and conversations between characters are absolutely appalling at times with some of them laughing where there's nothing even funny.Secondly the level of star here is truly b-movie rate. Even Lance Henrikson's appearance doesn't improve it much. Sure, there are plenty of folk you'll recognise, but their names will more often than not escape you. Only Ewan Bremner as Miller sprung to mind, and that was because I'd seen him in Snatch, and am myself Scottish so I know him.Lastly is the truly boring direction and camera work. For such allegedly exciting content AVP doesn't half do a good job of boring you rigid. It never grips you, it never amazes you, it barely even entertains you. Appallingly drab and 'by-the-numbers' direction and camera work makes dead sure of that.The last 20 minutes have to be seen to be believed, and while we can all take a little cheese in sci-fi, pizza-sized fromage frais does not go down well. Quite nauseating and ridiculously stupid is the last reel.The movie clearly takes itself way too seriously, and ends up being laughed at. It's not the worst film I'll ever see, but at times it wants to believe its the best.Shame.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated masterpiece,"I think the primary complaint about this film comes from either Predator or Alien fanboys b/c it doesn't really fit the lore. That's because this film and franchise is not canonical. That aside, there's also complaints this film is mostly taking place inside this one pyramid. It gives it a restricted background, unaccustomed to those who enjoyed watching Predators hunt in jungles.However, that aside, people overlooked one important aspect of this film that was done masterfully. As the title suggests, it is Alien vs Predator and the film gave us exactly that, with very strong powerful fight scenes between the two species. Not only so, they filmed it beautifully with each scene clear and crisp, even slowed down so we can see exactly what was happening. That should be noted because as far as I know, this is the first and probably the only film in which the ""Alien"" could be seen clearly.AVP2 gave us a much better and bigger atmosphere, a whole town and many more people. Yet in that film, it was dark and gloomy, hard to see for 2 hours. Not only was the whole film at night, it was raining, and even several scenes in dark hall ways or sewers. But most importantly, none of that awesome slow motion and focus during the fights which this movie, AVP, has done so masterfully.So for a Friday night with friends, this film will give you all the excitement you will need.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not that bad,"Actually I liked it. I don't know why Andersons Movies are all getting bashed by critics. They are entertaining, they do their job and so did AvP. I never liked Predator that much, but Alien I love since the series started. In this case its not a piece of art (Alien 3) or a comic fantasy (Alien 4) and neither the creepy Thriller (Alien 1) or the Republican Heroic Action Feast (Alien 2). It was just a fun to watch, if you did not mind all the little unlogical elements (Aliens breeding and growing in an incredibly short time for example).The acting was, well, okay and the FX were great. You never saw the Aliens that close and detailed. So, me as a Fan, I got what I wanted and expected. A little more thrill woulds been not bad, but hey, it entertained me from beginning to end.

The Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend. Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right. If You Give a Mouse a Cookie....,"I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Aliens or Predator fan.

So I didn't come in expecting a great movie. And I didn't get a great movie. But I got a good movie, a movie that is what it is supposed to be: a good action flick.The plot is about this group of adventurers who find a pyramid buried under Antarctica, or Alaska, or Alabama... I don't know. Doesn't matter. They go there to find a giant hole in the ground leading to the pyramid, a hole that wasn't there the day before. Down at the pyramid they find that it's an ever-changing--okay, so basically, it's a movie about aliens fighting predators. Some cool fight scenes, but it needed more oomph, and there was too much pointless backstory. I kept waiting for the Pepsi-Cola thing to come into play or SOMETHING to happen with that, but apparently the makers just felt like throwing a whole bunch of money around to make a rather expensive set for a backstory that isn't needed. Grr. Right, because we're supposed to feel for the characters... yeeeeeeah....Anyway, it needed to get to the aliens fighting the predators part quicker, and it needed more action, but sans those it was still a pretty good movie.

Better than you would think,"Aliens Versus Predator is an action movie with the 2 legendary movie monsters; The Aliens and the Predators(Alien from 1979 and Predator from 1985)The movie is based around Alexa Woods (AKA Lex) who gets hired by Weyland Industries.

A GOD AWFUL MESS!,"Paul Anderson's ""Alien vs Predator"" is one of the most insulting pieces of garbage that I have ever seen. While watching the movie one has to wonder, did the director ever see ""Alien"" or ""Predator""? Almost everything about the movie is wrong. The Script was obviously written on a Napkin in crayon by an 8 year old. The Characters are extremely unlikable and the story is stupid and boring. The Predators remind me of a cross between Super Shredder (from ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2""), and the San Francisco 49ers. As for the Aliens, they look suprisingly good, and even some of the Alien vs Predator fight scenes are cool. But even that can't save this turd. Apparently these aren't the same aliens as in the other movies, because they burst out of your chest within minutes of the eggs being layed. Errors in logic like that are unforgivable, especially when your making a film that all the ground work has been layed for.Seeing the once great Lance Henricksen in dreck like this makes me sick. Sadly it seems like he just showed up for the Paycheck.The movie just goes from bad to worse. Then Paul Anderson takes it one step further and makes the entire audience laugh in disbelief, in one of the most idiotic plot twists in recent memory. Oh, and Lets not forget him turning the Queen Alien into the T-Rex from ""Jurassic Park"". There's really not much more to say other than STAY AWAY.

When the previews were out and the rating was PG-13 I was like 'This can't be good....' and I was right. Without divulging too much (not that there is anything interesting to divulge anyways) all I can say is this is not your typical Aliens or Predators movie - and I mean it in a bad way. No gore, no violence no nothing. What there is are the following - lame characters, unbelievable sequences, lots of snoring during the movie. I am so sadly disappointed in the movie because it just wasn't well done in all aspects given the fact that they spent 17 years preparing for this. The PG-13 rating was also an issue because how can you have no gore/violence if it involves Aliens and Predators? These days all they care about is making money at the expense of everything else. Trust me on this - I am a HUGE fan of Aliens and Predators and have played all the games, seen all the movies, comics etc This movie is really bad. Don't waste your life/time/money watching it.

Not only was there insufficient battle scenes between the two species but we still don't know who won the battle between the two species.I think Anderson is actually hinting another movie by adding the sort of cliffhanger ending on it.But this movie has much to improve to rank up there with the other alien + Predator films and it is a disappointment but if you are a die hard fan of this then you may see better of it than me.",,Anonymous,Horror

A creature film where characterization is excluded !,"AVP is an attempt for prequel where Ridley Sir's masterpiece and Arnold's Predator are infused parallely, depicting a sci fi fantasy realm, where humans gets involved in an eternal battle between the two creatures from time immemorial. What happens then, is the main storyline of the film.The story, script are logical in progress, displaying some of the visuals in dark themes. The imaginative concepts are interesting, satisfying many conspiracy minds, also praiseworthy for its creativity regarding the underground pyramids and its layouts. The predators are shown as hunters, who let loose their targets, and then enjoy the challenge. A very big civilization threatening game, where humans were generally utilized for breeding purpose. But this time, the predator takes help of humans, a lady to be specific. This makes many differences.The film has nil characterization of people involved. Humans are viewed as inferior beings than predators who were worshipped as gods in pre-prehistoric eras. They let the dirtiest creatures to breed with human help and goes to great length, even self sacrifice to annihilate them tottaly. The creatures are nothing to design new, as evident from previously made masterpieces. But actions are new and watchable, not many times. For some perhaps it's not even once. The climax is shown as the beginning of a creature civilization in space.Does it mean it leads to Ridley sir's film ?Though many questions unanswered, still it's an action film where Paul Anderson uses already built up materials to suit a particular idea, not perfectly built but still watchable atleast once. You may watch it if you are OK with sci-fi fantasy dark horror themes. But caution is that the film gets dirtier with the creature appearance, gradually. A 6/10 and a 63 on scale of 100.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun,"Avp was never going to be a masterpiece. It was never going to have the majesty of Alien and the sheer terror of Aliens. No those things were never going to be in AVP, however AVP has its own little weapon. Its great fun. The story is the simplest of the year. A group of scientists find an ancient pyramid and go to explore. There they find themselves trapped in a war between Aliens and Predators and they are the bait. At 100 min long the movie moves quickly and the fights are furious. All aspects of Aliens and Predators are seen here from the chestbursters and facehuggers to the predators lethal arsenal of weapons. Sanaa Lathan plays the lead and whilst she ain't sigourny Weaver she makes a mighty fine fist of it. Its a pity everyone else is poor even the usually cool Ewan Bremmner. Lance Hennrikson is also on show but his appearance only causes you to make unfavourable comparisons to Aliens in which he played the Android. The beasts have never been nastier thanks to Paul Anderson who makes a decent directorial effort despite some sloppy editing. Its no classic but Avp is good fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a waste,...such a waste of a great idea...the human characters were under-developed and shallow. That was the great thing about the other films - we cared about the people more than these losers! there was no human drama and that creates audience engagement! It was more like a computer game! The music also made no sense to the slow motion (amatuern shooting) fighting scenes & the predators are killed too easily! ??? Eh???? I can't BUT want to to like this film...a wasted opportunity and also not violent enough in a horror sense! Comic book non-sense! We see familiar faces from lance Hendrickson etc and the dependable Colin Salmon - who gets diced again LOL LOL - that the reason to add an extra star!,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not terrible compared to the godawful sequel three years later, but definitely not that good either","In my opinion, this crossover isn't as bad as the critics say it is, but to be greatly honest, it certainly isn't that great either. Before I can get to the pros and cons, I just want to say that I only saw two Alien movies and have not watched any of the Predator movies along with the remake two years ago, so I didn't do anything to watch them yet, but I really plan to someday or soon, maybe. So, you get my point, right? Anyway, on to the movie.There are some let-downs that ruined the film for me. The story falls into the predictable zone (I liked the idea of Alien meeting the Predator, but the way.), the pacing's uneven, the directing is uninspiring, and the dialog is quite tedious. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no personalities and were just used as victims for the monsters and some of the acting is a mixed bag. Sanaa Lathan was very decent as Alexa and Lance Henriksen did a great job as Bishop, which makes them both interesting characters, but some of the actors just fell flat for me.Despite it's flaws, there are some redeeming qualities. The visuals are pretty, the cinematography's very nice, the make-ups for Alien and Predator are solid, and the music from Harold Kloser is pretty darn good. The action is very outstanding with the Alien and the Predator fighting against each other coming off as the best and the special effects are surprisingly good.So, is Alien VS. Predator bad? Well, compared to that godawful sequel that came out three years later, I say, ""No"", but in terms of story, it would've been so much better. It's a strictly mediocre film for itself. I'm sure fans of Alien and Predator will like it, but for others, I'd rather skip it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien vs Predator: how to ruin success 101,"Stripped of all fun and enjoyment and crushing the hopes and dreams of all existing Alien and or Predator fans, came the movie that was intended to be a blockbuster hit and revolutionize movies today. Probably the only redeeming quality of Alien vs Predator is that the Aliens and Predator are there, special effects are okay and character development is at an all time low which is a shame for coming after the classic Alien and Aliens movies and Arnie's Predator, I did enjoy the music score but that's not what makes a good movie. Sure there was action but it definitely wasn't to be considered good by any standards, but don't be surprised because Fox also just ruined The Fantastic Four reboot.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why Anderson, Why?","There are some films that are bad, and you think well that was a bit of a waste of money and then there are other films, films like AVP that, not only make you think you wasted money but that a section of your life has been wasted on what i can only describe as a putrid distillation of shite and vomit.I waited, along with many other loyal Alien and Predator fans for this film to be released and i can remember going to see it with my friends.(My friends it must be noted had not seen any of the alien or predator films and so went to it with an open mind) we sat in the cinema jaws dropped as far as the aliens in this movie, aghast at what was being played before us. my friend leaned over and said ""what the hell is this?, its crap, i might go"" and i was tempted but i stuck it out in a vain effort to find something to enjoy. but nothing.Paul W.S Anderson, why did you do this to us? you claimed to be a fan of both franchises, how could you make it so that i and many other fans felt ashamed to be fans of aliens and predators due to your now clear and obvious hatred of them.i also question why the studio bigwigs allowed him to direct, did his CV seem good to you?! Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil ring any bells.all in all one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune of seeing, and paying to see!

Alien vs. Predator - When Two Legends Meet and Shoot Themselves in the Foot,"When you hear ""Alien vs. Predator,"" you imagine an epic duel between two iconic monsters, something on par with a Dragon Ball Z final battle. And what do we get? A weird pyramid, a group of people exploring like it's Tomb Raider, and Predators who suddenly think they're Indiana Jones. Seriously, the poster promised carnage, but what we got feels more like a poorly organized cosplay convention.Sanaa Lathan does her best, but let's face it-she spends more time running than acting. Special shoutout to Lance Henriksen, who adds a touch of charisma to a production sorely lacking it. As for the rest of the cast, they're like free DLC in a video game: they do the job, but you'd never pay for them. And Agathe de la Boulaye? Eaten in two minutes flat, like an appetizer for the Aliens. Thanks for coming, bye.Paul W. S. Anderson clearly binge-watched Aliens before making this. He recycles everything: the isolated base, the monsters, even the concept of a ragtag team. The problem is that when Cameron does a copy-paste, he gives us Aliens. When Anderson tries, we get an Aztec-tech pyramid where everyone's running around aimlessly. It's like a Fortnite match where no one knows how to build.We were promised epic battles, and what did we get? Predators fighting like martial arts interns and Aliens that seem to have forgotten how to kill properly. Even the action scenes, while plentiful, lack any real impact. And the gore? Forget it. It's clean, sanitized, blood rationed out drop by drop. Mortal Kombat this is not.The pyramid's labyrinthine sets get the job done, but they're utterly lacking in charm. The lighting is often so dim it feels like someone forgot to pay the electricity bill. As for the direction, it's clunky, sluggish, and the fight choreography sometimes looks like it was done by drunk guys at a party. But hey, at least it's not AVP: Requiem, so let's be thankful for small mercies.Alien vs. Predator is like a boxing match where both fighters forget how to throw punches. Entertaining if your standards are low, but miles away from the masterpieces that birthed these creatures. Anderson promised us an all-you-can-eat buffet but delivered an in-flight meal instead. Watch it for laughs, not for scares.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"the enemy of my enemy, is my friend","This film starts with the same cliché idea as ""Armageddon"" - the team of experts. Its members are recruited from places all over the world in order to investigate a strange pyramid, found 600 m under frozen Antarctica, pyramid which embodies symbols and architecture of three ancient civilizations: Egyptian, Mayan and ancient Cambodian. The screen play is not so great, as it is almost the same as we've seen in many Hollywood movies. After some ""traps"" inside the pyramid are activated unknowingly by some crew members, thus bringing to life the Alien-mother, and after some Predators descend from space in order to eliminate the alien species, the humans realize that they can only survive if they team up with their enemy's enemy (the Predators). Overall, the movie is not so great, although well filmed. I especially disliked that it is too dark, as throughout the entire length of the movie the action takes place either inside the pyramid (the only source of light are flashlights or flares) or outside (where it is also dark, being night). It is worth seeing unless you have a better choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Predator Alien meets Indiana Jones,"Don't go into this movie with high expectations or you will be disappointed. The premise that Predators hunt the Aliens as part of their trophy in attaining the status of super warrior is awesome! I love it. The Predators are so cool and the Aliens are gnarly. Here's a short version of the plot: scientific team goes to Antartica to explore a strange pyramid found by satellite. They discover they are the bait in the Alien vs. Predator game. The rest is a slasher/alien horror (though not really scary) movie. You are not cheering for the humans but for either the Aliens or the Predator. It's Team Predator vs Team Alien. This isn't a horror movie but a game night movie. The question is will the Predators win or will the Aliens win and take over the world? Who cares about the humans..In fact, two of AVP's biggest problems seem to be the result of breakneck-speed sloppiness: 1. The Alien life-cycle is inexplicably abbreviated, with chest-bursts making their nasty debuts in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours; 2. The Predators' long-range weapons (e.g. spears and throwing stars) are acid-resistant, yet their close-quarters materiel (e.g. wrist blades and body armor) are not. All in all, AVP did its job. With the exception of a handful of (de rigueur) overly-jittery/super-slow shutter-speed shots in otherwise well-made action sequences, AVP is a polished piece of work. Thanks to Anderson's direction, the ADI FX Workshop was forced to abandon the Mr. Hanky-looking design of the creature from ""Alien 3,"" as well as the beastly, overly slimy appearance of the extraterrestrials from ""Alien Resurrection,"" and provide the silver screen with its best looking xenomorphs since 1986.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great movie if you're a teenager, horrible as it is","I must admit that i used to like this movie (like, a lot). At the time i first watched it i was young and didn't watch Alien or Predator, so i had no comparison point. Almost 11 years after, rewatching it and it doesn't feel the same, i get easily frustrated at the shots where it's almost pitch dark in a situation where nothing special is happening. AVP Requiem have the same kind of shady lightning and it's even worst in this one than the original. The actors are OK at best and the story is lazy. It looks, smells and feels like a generic scenario for a sci-fi movie who needs to fits two franchises together. Both series are good because of their ambiance ( the deep space in Alien and the tropical jungle kind of survivor feeling of Predator). AVP, in contrast, is in a pyramid they found in Antartica.... Neither Aliens or Predators ever are on Earth, it's Sci-fi, not a new episode of Ancient Aliens.So yeah, watch it for the kickass battle scenes between predators and aliens ( even if there is few and you mostly see nothing thanks to the great lightning, good job guys). Don't expect to see a masterpiece here, it's more for the fans of Ridley Scott who wants to see something unique, but for most of people this movie will probably not remembered.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as I expected,"I was pretty reluctant to even watch this one, simply because I love both the Alien- and Predator-franchise and didn't want to spoil it for me. After all: I kept reading so many negative reviews that I was surprised not to find AVP in the bottom 100 list on IMDb.Alien 1 and Aliens both were brilliant films. Totally different from each other, but both great. Alien 3 was not for me and Alien 4...oh well.. lol! Predator 1 was a great Arnie-vehicle, a typical late 80s action-blockbuster with tons of pumped up macho-""actors"", big explosions, shell-casings flying around and a huge body count. Predator 2 was like a rabid version of part one, with both gore and body count increased by a fair margin.What they all had was blood and gore in amounts ranging from ""adaequate"" (Alien 1) to ""nicely overdone"" (Predator 1+2).This, AVP can't offer. It's painfully obvious from the first kill that this film was either cut down to or always intended to be a PG-13 show. Hell, they even ""cut"" the famous Predator tag line (you know, the one about ugly people who make out with their mothers).After a while however, this bothered me less and less. I would've loved to see an R-rated AVP of course. After all: These are the two nastiest killers in recent movie history slugging it out. Lest I forget: We do get to see some nice blood and guts, but the blood is all green (Predator's) or yellow (Aliens'), and the guts/brains also belong to Aliens and/or Predators. But: No trophy-taking/skinned victims, no real chest-burster-scenes, no huge gunshot wounds...What the movie really lacks is sophisticated production design and a budget. This was obviously shot on a tight budget, and while the FX and sets look good, the lack of money does show. Everything looks quite good, but I couldn't stop thinking that with a bigger budget, everything would've looked a lot better.Let me conclude with the good stuff: Story is OK (for a movie like this), bringing the two...err..three species together in a relatively elegant and plausible way. Acting is mostly good also and the effects are (as mentioned earlier) pretty good for such a ""cheap"" movie.The first fight between the two creatures kicks butt, and should satisfy most of the Alien/Predator fans, it did satisfy me anyway.So, bottom line: Don't be confused by all the negative reviews, this movie isn't all that bad. It's not top-notch action-material either, and I'm positive that with other artist and more money involved, the AVP-idea could be turned into one kick-ass movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"worth a look, if you are a fan.","I had really high hopes for this movie I confess. Big fan of both franchises, and I honestly thought that no wrong could be done. I do not think its nearly as bad as some people do, and if you watch it with the right attitude, there are worse ways to kill an hour and a half.The biggest issue i take with it is the plot. It seems to be an excuse for the action, rather then make me interested in the outcome, or give a crap about the characters at all. Which could possibly be an unavoidable aspect of the idea to bring them together in the first place. I haven't particularly cared about the human characters in any alien or predator movie since the first one of both. Strike 1.The second biggest issue (which i think, could be considered the fatal blow) is the fact that it was rated PG-13. Im not too sure why Fox or Anderson felt the need to tone down the violence, but in the case of both franchises, even though the movies gradually went down in quality, you could always be sure of some good blood and guts, but I wasn't even getting that. Even if a movie has a horrendous plot, I can brush that aside for some amusing death scenes. So, strike 2.It gets walked, basically. If you really want to see some cheese and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then go for it. I think it was a serviceable film, but all in all I consider it a wasted opportunity. for the next one (number 3) sign on a good director, cast it with whomever, make it in outer space, build some freaking tension, kick up the gore several notches and you may have a winner. These two great franchises do not belong together until you stay true to the roots of both of them.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horrible in the wrong way,"There are Preditors and there are Aliens in this flick.

Good riddance.Two scenes stand out - first the satellite find a heat source in Antarctica - in 2004 which no one has ever seen before. OK, maybe it's because of the newly ""drilled"" hole. Anyway you spend the first 20 minutes trying to figure out why no one has noticed it in the age of satellites. Then heroine befriends a Predator - my god that scene is so horribly cliché you want it to change its mind and kill the stupid woman already.No, unless you are looking for self-punishment - this is something to stay well clear of.

Biggest monster of all? The director.,"All four Alien films, and even the first Predator film, were helmed by very talented filmmakers. Together, the Alien and Predator series have launched the careers of major talents, such as Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and John McTiernan. So who was the genius over at Twentieth Century Fox that decided to hand BOTH franchises over to writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson? Anderson's awful reputation as a music-video-style hack is not unwarranted. Anybody who actually saw Event Horizon, Soldier, Resident Evil, or any other previous efforts knows that this guy can make an unwatchable movie out of any decent script. To be fair, AVP begins promisingly- I actually really enjoyed the set-up in the underground Antarctic pyramid. And I was fairly pleased to see the filmmakers hold back on the CGI. However, the film really starts to lose its hold over a thinking audience when the titular monsters finally do face off- the first match-up is about halfway through the film. The editing becomes frantic, the story becomes silly, and the characters- well, they were unmemorable to begin with but these characters soon become absolutely unbelievable as well. I have a major problem with some pretty face of a heroine (Sanaa Lathan is NO Sigourney Weaver) making FRIENDS with a Predator. Blame Paul W. S. Anderson, who somehow got story, screenplay, and director roles on this long-awaited event film, for botching what could have been a great fight.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Anderson sustains they shall be cleared out in the integral version, on schedule to appear on the DVD release.

You get what you paid for..,"With a title like ""Alien Vs Predator,"" you're obviously going to expect some alien and predator battles, hopefully with some human interaction as well. AVP doesn't disappoint in that area. I thought the fight scenes were very good and the only saving grace of the movie. Other than that, well, there's nothing else. This is a bad movie.It starts out okay enough, the pacing is true to the original alien films. It's slow and builds up tension...only to use its first shock on a penguin. But oh well. It only gets worse from there, though. We're introduced to a bunch of characters we obviously don't give a care about and are more than likely to die in terrible ways. That begs the question, why exactly are we being told that they have loving families waiting for them at home? Are we supposed to feel sympathetic when they die? I mean, come on, it's all or nothing. You should either not care at all about a character and chomp on popcorn as they're brutally killed, or truly feel bad when they die. AVP put me in an uncomfortable position. I didn't feel bad but I felt as if I was expected to.The plot's ridiculous. I think anyone who's seen it and either loves it or hates it can agree with that. I don't think I've ever heard that it's a brilliant, original plot from anyone. But, honestly, I didn't really pay to see the movie for a plot.

The final battle at the end was especially good.Some of the fight scenes were a bit too blurry, resulting in you wondering what was going on.

"Not bad, but suffering from ""Coles Notes"" syndrome","Perhaps the best word to describe this movie is ""competent"".  It isn't bad. It isn't terribly good, either, but it isn't bad.The first act is perhaps the weakest, and is filled with scenes that feel as though they are the Coles Notes of longer scenes.  Once the main characters reach the pyramid, however, and the second act begins, the movie stops being choppy and flows very well.The story is fairly well thought out, and areas where I expected a plot hole (such as where the aliens come from, anyway) didn't have one.  The scenes in the pyramid are suspenseful to a degree, and each moment flows logically toward the next.Perhaps the thing that keeps the movie from standing up proud with the other Alien movies is the distinct lack of depth compared to every other entry in the series.  Far too many characters aren't fully developed, and only one of the two that are actually spends time dealing with anything.  This makes the movie an interesting diversion, popcorn if you will, but nothing more.At least it is entertaining popcorn.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A let down,"As a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator films, and the comic/video game version of the series, this film was a major let down. Although the creature effects of the aliens were amazing, the CG was top notch & the fights (though few) were pretty sweet, this movie lacked in two major aspects it needed most...good story telling and at least some what decent acting. I wish that director Paul Anderson had spent more time on casting and creating a complex story to tell then just effects, since so many questions have been left unanswered in both the series and as to how they truly come together. They could have went much more in depth with Henriksen's Weyland character, and established how, when and exactly why Bishop came to be. They didn't really set the time frame well either, as to how. I wanted answers as to how Weyland appears in Alien 3, assuming that is much, much further in the future, yet does not even make it half way through this so-called prequel.The first 3 Alien films had a strong lead character, Ripley, who really made the movie, Weaver's acting was great and really put you in the film. This movie tries to do so with it's new lead female character, but doesn't even come close. The film is way too rushed, in the prior Alien films, when a face-hugger attached itself to the victim, ready to lay it's demon seed into the unwilling chest, this was usually a long and dramatic time frame, while in AVP, the entire episode of being impregnated to having the creature burst through the chest literally came into play within seconds. When the anticipated scene of the predator removing his mask finally happened, frustration ran through my body. I thought we passed the point of bad creature design and effects when we left the low budget Predator 2 behind - the new predators, while they look amazing masked, look worse than the poor looking predators from the second film. The original 1987 predator still looks the best by far. The movie is worth checking out though for the effects (namely the alien) and fights, the last scene in the movie is awesome, and lives up to what the comic series intended. Although I was upset with how this film turned out, especially in the lack of story and horrible acting, I do hope it grosses a lot of money, in hopes that another sequel to the originals can come into play and hopefully succeed and live up to the originals.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie for fans of the Alien and Predator films and AvP comics and games,"As a fan of both the Aliens and Predator films, and especially the Alien vs Predator PC games, I thought AVP was a great movie. It wasn't perfect but it's far from the over-exaggerated garbage that most reviews seem to feel it is. Ideally, the Alien Vs Predator movie should have been set in the Aliens timeline, on some colonial world with the marines in the center of the conflict. When I first heard that AVP would be set in present day Antarctica, I thought that would be the biggest mistake of the film. But I think it worked out great. I especially love how the film establishes the beginning of the powerful and ominous entity later known only as ""The Company."" I've heard a lot of people complain about Lance Henriksen being in this film as though it breaks continuity with the previous films, but I think it works to establish continuity as it was intended to. Henriksen plays Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder of the Weyland corporation and the person that the Bishop android would later be modeled after and whose descendant would try to coerce Ripley into helping the company. The film begins with Weyland's company discovering a pyramid in Antarctica and building a team of scientists to go be the first to discover it. Meanwhile the predators are on their way to begin a hunt. They show up and resurrect a queen alien that's been kept frozen inside the pyramid. The queen starts producing eggs for the unsuspecting explorers walking into the pyramid. The characters are all pretty forgettable canon-fodder that get killed faster than they should. To the credit of the director, some effort is clearly made to develop the characters, but the very nature of the film restricts the amount to which one could do so. This movie is Alien Vs Predator after all, so a lot of it is going to be about them. My biggest complaint with the characters is that the one woman who brings a gun, which is pointed out in a great scene, never gets a chance to use it before being arbitrarily killed. The aliens look great in this movie and I love the idea of the hero alien with the cross-hatch markings on its head. Now the problem with the aliens is that they grow from facehugger to chestburster to full grown xenomorph in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days as in the previous films. This fact is made even more prominent by the fact that the pyramid changes every ten minutes, so it only takes about twenty minutes for the entire xenomorph life cycle. But the length of the alien life cycle is never really specified in any other film so one could assume that it varies depending on conditions. And, even though twenty minutes is a bit ridiculous considering the amount of growth they go through, it's a movie; it doesn't have to be perfectly believable. If this is the only complaint one could have with the aliens, then it's not enough to ruin the movie, unless you're the kind of person who wants to hate this movie. Then there's the predators. I'm not sure what's wrong with them exactly. They just seem to be too big. I don't think they're really much bigger than in the other predator films but they just seem bigger. It especially seems that they are too thin at the waist and too wide at the shoulders. But this is a minor complaint and barely noticeable if you're not obsessing over it. Now we come to the meat of the film: the fights. The big problem with the fights is that they happen to fast with the camera too close and shaking. This is something that's become all too common in a lot of action movies lately. Every new action movie has to be faster and more intense than the last. So to make it more intense, let's put the camera right into the action, so now you can only see an arm or a leg flailing about. But that's not intense enough, so let's shake the camera so it seems like there's more happening. All these things combined together make for a bit of a mess. But, again, I don't want to over-exaggerate this. It's not as though the entirety of the fights do this, just some parts of them. The rest of the fights are great, and there are some really clever things that we've never seen before (I especially love the slow motion facehugger scene). And that's about the extent of complaints one could have with this film. As I said, overall, this is a great movie for fans of the Alien and Predator franchises, unless you're the kind of obsessive fan who wants to hate the film before you even see it and who is going to get hung up on some small issues.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much better than you'd think!,"I'm watching all the Alien films in order. I feel this needs to be stated as normally I'd not be up for watching Alien vs. Predator, but I'm going in with an open mind. To be honest the Alien franchise already lost its way before this sidebar, so what's the harm in getting two classic 80s film monsters on the screen together. A team of archeologists are assembled in Antarctica by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen). He's the only holdover from what's gone before, the rest are brand new. We have Alexa (Sanaa Lathan), the guide on this expedition, Sebastian (Raoul Bova) the charismatic digger, Mark (Tommy Flanagan) the miserable muscle and Graeme (Ewan Bremner), the scientist goofball. Deep below the ice, they think they've found an ancient pyramid... possibly the first built, but by whom, or what. The set up is riddled with clunky cliched dialogue and it doesn't improve, but you're not watching this for its writing are you. Weyland is of course the company name from previous films and therefore assumed the bad guy, but not so. Here he's mostly just a rich old man, sick and looking for one last adventure to be remembered by. The pyramid when they reach it is like something from Indiana Jones, except instead of hieroglyphs of sphinx, there's Predator statues. Plus there's a defrosting caged Alien in the basement. A Queen! It's seems the Predators have woken the structure, as a team of them arrive from space. They gut the surplus cast and follow the human explorers into the icy depths. It's all a bit nuts, but I don't hate it. It's far-fetched, but not dumb, certainly not in terms of Alien films. It's a playful twist on the question of how the Egyptians built the pyramids conspiracy, it was aliens... according to this it was. The pyramid is a rights of passage colosseum for coming of age Predators, pitting themselves against the Aliens. It helps if you're familiar with Alien to follow this, it expects you to know that face-huggers are bad, although I guess there's little doubt of that. They get the Matrix bullet-time treatment here, which is pretty cool. Adele (Agathe de la Boulaye) gets the first honour of incubation, but doesn't do it nearly as well as John Hurt. I won't lie, the pyramid setting is a masterstroke. It reconfigures every ten minutes, with the walls grinding and shifting in ever twisting puzzles, separating those still alive into prey. Bang on the hour, the two species come face to face in a bonkers battle of brutal bloodlust. It's what you'd expect, but quite entertaining and it provides distraction for the few remaining humans to run for it. Shy on action it is not. A great film it is not, but compared to some other Alien films, it fairs better than you might think. It actually makes sense in a way and doesn't pretend to be anything but an action romp. This is my first time watching this spin off and I'm pleasantly surprised. My expectations were low and easily met, but freed of the weight of the standalone alone Alien films, this is quite good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

True to the films,"I enjoyed the movie greatly as a fan of the earlier Predator and Alien films.  Predators have to prove themselves as worthy warriors and what better way than using Aliens to do it. Needing humans to host the aliens, they manage to bring a team of humans there to let the hunt begin. It was good having Lance Hendrickson brought back and the rest of the cast be unknowns. I thought the plot was just fine having today's humans mess things up for the Predators so that it took a combined effort against the Aliens. It could have gotten to the ""fighting"" a bit sooner and maybe more of it, but other than that, I really liked the movie.

A Guilty Pleasure If There Ever Was One,"OK, let me start by saying that I LOVE Alien, Aliens, and Predator. All three are excellent movies, with great stories, characters, and thrilling action sequences and incredible suspense. And when this movie is compared to those sci-fi classics, this film absolutely pales in comparison. But, I enjoyed it nonetheless. When I first saw this film, I had never seen the original films, so I didn't know what to expect. Before I go any further, let me say this: AVP is not a good film. Not by any means is AVP even in consideration to be called a ""good"" movie. But, I still enjoy it. I mean, yeah, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, the acting is mediocre at best, and the story sounds like a crappy fan fiction written by some 12 year old kid. It's stupid, but, it's entertaining. It does feel like the violence is severely held back, but in the long run, I don't think it negatively affects the movie that much. This film isn't even in the same league as the original films, but I still enjoyed it because it's a fun, action-packed experience. I enjoyed it despite it's blatantly obvious flaws, and it definitely is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with its sequel that suffers even more from the same problems. In the end, AVP is a fun, yet unbearably stupid film. 6/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Whoever wins...we lose"" pretty much sums up the experience","How can Hollywood even get away with combining two rated ""R"" series FEATURES into a PG film?The AvP idea had so much potential and this is what comes out of it, and believe me the story was only a small part of the problem. The acting was so horrible that over half (yes half) of the audience, including myself, was laughing at what was supposed to be the somewhat frightening moments (notice moments is plural). I didn't mention the 3rd that walked out, sorry. Wake up Hollywood! When I first saw Predator, Alien and its not worthy sequel Aliens, I couldn't sleep for weeks, afraid of the dark, even getting a little freaked out at my dog cause he growled like the Predator. Even the second Predator and the 3rd and 4th Alien sequels had their freaky moments, but this movie....is for kids. Like Mortal Kombat, or Resident Evil.The Director, ahhh yes Paul W.S. Anderson, (Mortal Kombat, and Resident Evil) I would really hate to see a recreation of The Exercist Vs. Hannibal Lector....Rated PG.For the Predator fans, I definitely know that Anderson didn't watch Predator. Ohhh, by the way, thanks for re-dubbing the creatures scream from the first Predator on to your not so Stan Winston looking creature WITH BROWN EYES. Your Infrared thermal image vision sucks, what happened to the wonderful colors and the blue background, even the other vision modes (non of which I could knew off hand) sucked, and what hell happened to the original thermal vision sound effects from the first movie, for those who do not know what I am talking about, it's that constant humming sound and the creatures heartbeat, even that famous WHIP-SNAP (sound element used when changing to infrared) which was such an important suspense factor in the first Predator has been reduced to nothing. Ohh and by the way according to Anderson, the Predators in AvP were based almost entirely off of the creature in the original movie. I know that John McTiernan, if he even goes to see this movie, will probably fall out of his directors chair.On the flip side Anderson did a great job with the camouflage effect (thanks for not really changing it) especially on the weapons, which were another over-exaggerated element, nothing new.For the Alien Fans, I must admit they did a great job with the look of the Aliens. However, the sped up life cycle seemed quick and painless (which was another stupid idea) why couldn't the one infected team meet up with the other non infected team and then the chestbursters could come out. What about the Predalien?  I mean a full sized Predalien. What about the queen? How did she get frozen in the first place. I could go on for hours, and I won't.All in all, in the VS. debate, the Aliens did win this round. They killed two Predators in less then two minutes from each other. WOW, and the third Predator would have probably been killed in less the a minute after his buddies, if Anderson was also producing.Oh by the way Paul, the AvP comic book (as well as the movies) indicate that Predators can run faster then the average speed of a car, so why didn't the Predator just throw the girl on his back and run away from the blast. AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO BRING UP THE HUMAN/PREDATOR INTERACTION ISSUE, THIS ISN'T AN ""E.T.""/""Close Encounters"" FLICK. THAT IDEA REALLY SUCKED.For the humans, I said it before, and I'll say it again, the actors performances where horrible. I can't make it any more clearer. Lance, buddy, what you needed the money or something????? Come on, you know better then to call on a 7-foot plus tall monster. Didn't they teach you that in acting class.As for all of you that liked this movie. Hey I am glad you liked it. At least there is someone out there who did.As for all of the so called ""AvP Haters"". I can only hope that if a sequel is in the works, please don't, but if it has to be done......James Cameron where are you!!!!AVP - Alien Vs.

"""The enemy of my enemy... is my friend.""","FILM: 6.0
Rewatching Alien Vs. Predator, I'm reminded of just how much potential the concept had and how much it ends up just scraping by. Seven years after Alien: Resurrection did more harm than good for the franchise, Fox decided to bring back both the Xenomorphs and the Yautjas for what should have been the ultimate monster showdown. The premise is exciting on paper-two iconic creatures going head-to-head in an ancient battleground. But then, they handed the reins to Paul W. S. Anderson, who has a knack for turning exciting ideas into just okay films.Anderson's track record has always been hit or miss for me, with Event Horizon and Soldier being the only two projects I think actually rise above middling. Unfortunately, Alien Vs. Predator doesn't break his streak. The action sequences do deliver some fun moments, and there are definitely a few impressive shots, particularly in the underground temple setting. The production design there is visually striking, with a lot of attention to detail that adds to the film's atmosphere. However, that's where most of the praise ends.The cast is, for the most part, wasted. Sanaa Lathan is decent in the lead role, but she doesn't quite have the presence to carry the film. There are a few colourful characters sprinkled throughout, and the actors do their best to make them memorable, but the script doesn't give them much to work with. Lance Henriksen's return is a nice touch, and he brings some gravitas to his role, but even he feels underutilised.Ultimately, Alien Vs. Predator does what it says on the box-it brings the two franchises together for a monster mashup. But it never really rises above just meeting the most average of expectations. It's a fun enough rewatch for fans of the franchises, but it doesn't quite live up to what it could have been.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 7.5

Death knell of two franchises?,"One can only hope not. I held off on watching this one until I found it at the library, and for once was not overly distraught that it was a full-screen copy. Widescreen would have been a negligible improvement. Paul W. S. Anderson is not one of my favorite directors, though there were bits and pieces of films like ""Soldier"" and ""Event Horizon"" and even ""Resident Evil"" that I enjoyed. He has a good visual flair, if nothing else. However, he's not much of a screenwriter. ""AVP"" plods, to put it kindly. The characters are pretty much made of cardboard, and the plot, such as it is, is uninteresting and derivative. Anderson plays fast and loose with the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" mythoi and fails to bring anything new to either one. The action was a rehash of previous ""Alien"" set pieces. Much whining has been heard over the PG-13 rating, but for the level of violence, I was surprised that it didn't get an R (and here I thought even one use of the F-word would guarantee that--guess I was wrong). I imagine AVP played better in theaters with speakers booming, but on the small screen it was remarkably unexciting and uninvolving; I put it on pause numerous times to go smoke a cigarette. Our doughty female lead played her part above and beyond the call to duty, but no Ripley was she. The rest of the cast was essentially faceless but tolerable (the little spiky-haired blonde was a cutie, I will confess; I'd like to see her in something with genuine substance). Lance Henrickson was obviously collecting a paycheck. Even the ""surprise"" ending was cliché (and highly illogical). Overall, it played like a fanboy comic book aimed at the pre-teen set. I gave it a 5 only for high production values and excellent FX.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Flawed but entertaining,"Let's clarify this right up front: I know that this movie isn't particularly good. Not only does it suffer from plenty of logical issues and some questionable directorial choices, but it doesn't fit with established Alien lore. And on top of all of that, the decision to make a PG13 crossover out of two R rated franchises is insane.All that being said, the movie is surprisingly fun. The entire point of movies is to entertain, and every time I watch the movie I'm sufficiently entertained. Not all the directorial choices are bad, there's some tense sequences throughout the movie. And I have to applaud the heavy use of practical effects, with many of the creature interactions being practical costumes/puppets. And at the end of the day, seeing these two iconic movie monsters on screen together is a fun time.This is a movie that demands ignoring logic most of the time, so if you can't ignore the logic inconsistencies with the plot/script then you'll have a bad time. But if you can turn your brain off and enjoy seeing the crossover (while having some appreciation for a commendable amount of practical effects) then I can easily recommend it!The sequel, on the other hand... don't bother. AvP Requiem is just outright bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
AVP 1: The Beginning,"Keeping this one short and sweet, AVP rides the pure, unabashed fun of having the xenomorphs battle the predators to carry what is a pretty mediocre, even underwhelming movie.

Really everything but the titular aliens here are of underperforming B-movie stock but there is just no denying how fun it is to watch these sci-fi film icons during it out. Go into it with low expectations of a flimsy plot and characters who only serve as light explanation for why these creatures are fighting and just enjoy the action.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Rather Good,"Before going into the cinemas to watch AVP, I heard a rant of negative reviews about the movie. I went in with zero expectations but walked out pretty happy witnessing a fast-paced action with arguably two of the best characters and villains in Sci-Fi. There were really no boring bits, they had a good plot to go with, some biological history to back it up and the fighting execution was done rather well. Shame, but this movie had a dull rating of PG-13, which limited more detailed and bloody fights which was unfortunate, considering the Predator and Alien movies are pretty gruesome at times. Apart from that this movie was rather enjoyable, the Predator and Alien returned since their last unsuccessful installment in their series to deliver a good action flick. A recommendation to all Sci-Fi and Action fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
30 more minutes would have made a good movie.,"If this movie had been 30 minutes longer, with more fighting between the Pred's and Aliens (with the predator's holding their own ALLOT better then they do in the movie) it would have been a really good film.For whatever reason they decided to make a movie that had nothing to do with the books. Then make The Predators, the greatest hunters in the universe, into lame wimps. Sure, this was a ""rites of passage"" hunt for unproven Preds, but they have hunted these things for eons so the slightly more then 2 to 1 odds don't seem overly great to me. Maybe the people that make these movies should read the books first, that way they have a clue before they start.Oh, before i go, this is just one of many mistakes but in one scene the Predator uses his wrist blades on an Alien only to have them melt from the Acidic blood of the Alien, but the Spears they use are just fine after being thrust through an Alien, don't they know about the acid blood and make the weapons out of the same metal??

Not completely awful but a missed opportunity...,"Alien vs Predator as a concept goes all the way back to 1989, when Dark Horse comics pitted the 2 extraterrestrial monsters against each other in a pretty awesome comic run. Since then we have had books, toys, video games... but it took almost 15 years to finally get a film adaptation. Was it worth the wait? Well, it was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, so you probably have a fair idea...The film followes a group of various researchers lead by Charles Weyland, as they investigate a newly discovered pyramid structure buried deep underground in Antarctica. While noisily and haphazardly clanging about the structure, they discover some alien eggs, which of course result in impregnation, followed by aliens. Then some predators show up, because it turns out that this is an ancient hunting ground for young predators to prove their worth. And so begins a battle between the predators and aliens, with the humans mostly just getting in the way. Except for our final girl Lex, who goes all stern faced and does her very best Ripley impression while battling a queen. With just a tank top on. In the Arctic. Hmmm...I wasn't very impressed with this film when it first came out. I felt the story was... eh... the characters... meh... and the film suffered hugely from it's PG13 rating, meaning massively toned down violence from what we have come to expect from these IPs. However, I have recently watched it again (the unrated version this time) and it is marginly better than I remember. The action scenes are enjoyable enough and I quite like the setting, with the ever shifting pyramid providing a nice sense of isolation and claustrophobia. The characters aren't as annoying as I remember either, with the main alien and predators being fun to watch. Even the final battle (stupid dress sense aside) is quite entertaining, with Lex and the predator working together to take on the queen.It still has issues though, the characters have no depth or development, the dialogue is about as natural as blue hair, and the CGI effects... well lets just say they have aged. I'm not a big fan of all the slow mo effects either, which in hindsight is a bit of a Paul Anderson staple, like he's trying to be John Woo or something.Overall it's a passable experience with some good moments, but ultimately feels like it falls a bit short. If you are up for a bit of a brainless slug fest between 2 of the most iconic cinematic monsters in recent memory, it delivers... just... but can't hold a candle to the best entries in either individual series. On the plus side though, it is miles better than its sequel...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

I thought this movie could have had much more depth and especially in regards to Weyland and the seeds to ""The Company"" from the Alien series. I did however like the a much bigger view into the history (althought the storyline of aliens traveling to ancient time on earth is getting really old) and a look into their lives, when they are aboard the ship. I did however lose a lot of mystery and intrigue with both species. The thing that was great about the alien series was ya never knew anything about the history of the aliens or where they came from. AVP doesn't answer where they came form but showed a glimpse into their past. I also don't like movies where the characters have to explain what everyone or everything is doing in the movie as if we cant figure it out (example: when the Italian guy said the predator was marking himself, a thing great hunters do) I said I don't think the movie was horrible but someone that isn't a Alien and/or Predator fan will think its crap and wont be turned onto either saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nobody Wins in this Battle of the Titans,"Your enjoyment of this film will depend on whatever expectations you have going into it. As a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises, I had hopes for this one. They weren't high hopes, but I wanted something that I could at least say, ""well, that was pretty cool"". I also expected a decent kill factor. Not much of any of the above happened.Lance Henricksen, in a non ""Bishop"" role plays a scientist who leads a team to Antarctica to discover what is supposed to be the first pyramid. Naturally, there is reluctance in the main expert (Sanaa Lathan). The team needs to get 300 feet underground to reach this pyramid and avoid any other explorers on the same mission. Little do they know that the other ""explorers"" are about 8 feet tall and comes from outer space and carrying many sharp weapons and ugly fangs. Apparently the Predators want this pyramid as well. This pyramid is being guarded by some other bad asses. Those would be the Aliens led by big bad mama. For reasons that are explained not very well, the two species don't like each other very much.The battle scenes are few and far between. There needed to be more of them and they needed to be better. The audiences of these two franchises are very familiar with these guys and something new needed to be offered instead of the typical popping out of nowhere and showing it's big fangs. These bad guys weren't very interesting.What I did like was the pyramid that they were all stuck in. For someone as claustrophobic as me, I found the pyramid was very very creepy. The scientists all got trapped and stuck in various parts of this thing and guess who was waiting for them.This movie isn't horrible, but it isn't any good either. It falls in the middle between garbage and an OK rental. If you like either of these franchises, it's worth a look just to satisfy your curiosity (**)",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not so bad.,"Just saw AVP last night. My friends dragged me to see it despite my numerous complaints and suggestions to see other movies.I expected it to be total s**t, but I ended up kind of enjoying it. Its trash, but its trash made by talented people. People in the theater near us were making wise cracks (a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"") which added to the overall experience. I couldn't help making a few myself.Its the kind of movie where the entire audience laughs at what's on screen, despite the fact that the filmmakers may or may not have intended it to be funny. I saw it in Burbank, CA in a theater with a pretty hip audience of teenagers and college students.

Agad....,"I'm a teenager, and on the flip side of fan-boy I despised this pathetic kindling sack of wasted opportunities and shattered dreams. My father took me to see this movie in August 2004, and I enjoyed it. Please note that it was my first foray into the Alien world. I had watched Predator already, and after AVP, I asked my father to rent Alien and Aliens. Words cannot express how much I loved those movies.Next, I decided to rent Alien3. That film made me weep (in a positive way mind you). The Alien franchise was growing on me. Eventually, I got around to Resurrection, which, despite it's MANY flaws, was semi enjoyable. By this time AVP was coming to DVD. I wanted it badly, to see if my viewing experience could denote if it was worthy of it's predecessors.It was not.Aki, first up; the script. It resembled some cheesy 80's action flick, courtesy Roger Corman. Dialogue was off-kilter, lines were flubbed, and that one guy wouldn't shut up about his kids. I have news for you pal, your kids are not winning you anything by referencing them all the time.Secondly, the acting. Most of it was fine, but the secondaries such as Thomas (someone's assistant, I can't even remember his name), Quinn, and that one girl with the freaky hair gave such wooden performances I'd not have been surprised if the wind knocked them over and they were revealed as cardboard cut-outs.And the effects. I'm noticing a disturbing trend nowadays. Films are using too much CGI. When used in moderation, CGI is a wonderful tool- it can convey a greater sense of realism when used properly. Jurassic Park did it right. AVP did not. I silently tapped two fingers on my sleeve, but didn't applaud at all, Anderson's decision to use suits more. That however doesn't subtract from the fact that there was still too much CG.In closing, there are many things wrong with this film. If you can spot them and still enjoy watching this movie then you have an okay attitude. If you can spot the errors and heckle them, you have an even better attitude. And if you can invite Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, and Kevin Murphy over to watch this then you have the best attitude of all.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

But to my surprise, its not that bad!The Bad: Directing was a bit weak, a film of this stature required a much more talented director..but most any director with some talent could have done a better job, at least one whose skill was equal to the hype of the film.The Humans, their dialogue is just plain stupid. Character development is near nonexistant as well.The Good: Aliens PredatorsCONSISTENCY!!! When combining two major series, especially such as this, plot holes tend to appear left and right.

A new story of Alien and Predator that has an aberrant ending,"Basically, forget the characteristics of previous versions of Predator and Alien, because they are very different in this movie. Forinstance, Predator is human friendly, it can appear in cold environments, and the creatures have been worshiped as Gods by humans in an ancient time on earth...Confusing? Yes.On the other hand, why complain about it? It would, in my opinion, be boring if the creatures were exactly the same. Besides,there are some nice scenes when Predator really rocks with his cool weapons.However, I am, like the rest of the audience, dubious to the behaviour and features of Alien and Predator. I've always feared Predator and had nightmares about the monster. Now, however, he (or whatever it is) is friendly; I could almost imagine myself drinking coffeewith him...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"So bad, it's good.","Similar to Starship Troopers, you can tone down your IQ for this movie and enjoy it. What the movie does poorly is everything. What it does excellently is that it does everything to the *same degree* of failure.A lot of terrible movies combine a lot of different ideas that don't flow contiguously. Transformers was an example of a would-be amazing movie that went horribly wrong because only only two actors were competent enough to fulfill their role, and neither had but a few lines and they were in the beginning. They were Shia's friend and his teacher. The movie is such trash that I can't stomach it unless I fast- forward through 90% of the movie, and that just isn't fun.I had high hopes for movies like Transformers. Thankfully, this movie promised nothing. It was a guaranteed flop, and exceeded those expectations. The five-cent quality of this movie carries its own.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien queen scene is worth 3 stars - rest gives me constipation,The final battle at the end is fantastic. Love it. You can find it on the internet to watch.Everything before that not so much.How can one mess up the Alien universe?The set of characters names should be ' placeholder 1 - 8 ' . Not sure if there even is something that can be called story.I have to admit that the scenery and setting is great. There was a lot of potential for using it and making it either scary or more engaging.Sadly it did not happen. Overall if you drink and eat with a couple of friends you should watch it. If you are passionate about Aliens better avoid it.,3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Appealing concept but Bad Execution.,"AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) is an ambitious movie. The concept is appealing, but the execution didn't exploit it to the fullest. The place where the action happens fits perfectly! It offers the film the unpredictability, confusion, and panic that it needs! I wish there were more interactions with this ""10-minute"" mechanic that gets introduced in the movie. One important aspect when it comes to films with monsters is that you need the human side to have a worthy hero to root for. Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver that! The characters are boring, unappealing, and filled with cheesy lines.All in all, this movie was entertaining! It is a lower-tier movie but, it has some good aspects to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Schlock.,"There are AVP comics, novels and video games dating back to the early 90's. All of them are better than this bad movie and it's terrible sequel.Instead of adapting one of the comics or making an intense and gory R rated action/horror movie we got a movie made for kids.The violence is toned down so the studio could secure a PG rating and the characters are one-note. Their only traits are - Black woman, nerdy guy, old guy, white guy and another white guy. They only exist so they can be killed.There's no gore and when the Aliens fight the Predators it looks like a slightly more amped up episode of Power Rangers. It's unintentionally funny and goofy and i'm surprised the soundtrack during the fights wasn't a cheesy nu metal song to make the 14 year olds the movie is aimed at cheer. The movie also looks so dark that sometimes it's actually difficult to tell what is happening and the fast editing and shaky cam is just obnoxious.Is that one of the ways they managed to secure a PG rating? I mean, the movie can't get an R rating if you can't see it!Lance Henriksen is in it, he's awesome as always and the Alien and Predator costumes and special effects are mostly good but those are the only positives.Alien: Resurrection was a weird movie with cardboard characters but at least it tried something new and had pretty awesome gross effects whereas AVP is like a live action cartoon.Paul W. S. Anderson was clearly the wrong director for this and it should not have been a PG rated movie.Go and watch the original Predator or Aliens again, you'll have a good time and be reminded why this used to be a cool franchise.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A fun Alien movie in franchise, which has aged well","This movie is a thousand times better than Prometheus and Alien Covenant. Why? Because it is everything those movies should have been and were not.I remember when this movie came out 19 years ago, I enjoyed it, but I thought it was lacking something. I guess I thought the premise of Aliens creatures vs Predators, was off putting for me. The genre was moving from horror to fan-boy porn. And at the time, it didn't appeal to me.But having set through the abysmal Prometheus and Covenant, the last through years, this movie has aged excellently.First off, the action in this movie is fantastic! The creatures look great, the fight scenes are entertaining and tbh the storyline, given the premise, was really well pieces together! Combined with the sets, for example the moving pyramid, as well as some decent casting - Sana Lathan, Lance Henriksen and the guy from resident evil, this was a creative movie. It is an excellent popcorn Alien movie.And one of my biggest gripes with Prometheus and Covenant, is the cast made stupid mistakes. And they had ZERO IQ. In this movie, most of the cast are not dumb.So 19 years later, in my opinion, this movie has really moved up the Alien ratings board. Possibly number 3 for me, after Alien and Aliens.It's a great example, of how Hollywood 20 years ago, was still original.Like I said above, this movie is all round entertaining and has aged really really well. And I think it deserves higher than the 5.7 rating it has. At least 6.2/6.3.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A major disappointment---6/10,"I was really looking forward to an all out Alien vs. Predator clash of the titans, complete with decapitated alien heads and exploding predator torsos. What i got was a kinda decent flick, but with really only one or two fights that were pretty good, but just too few and far between. Another thing that brought the movie down was it's PG-13 rating. It really held back what could have been a classic. Especially, after four R-rated Aliens movies and two R-rated Predator movies. Also, the movie ran about 100 minutes, but the writers tried to develop the human characters when they should have had more of the monster face/offs. Nobody came to see Alien vs. Predator to see the humans. Except to see them die violently. Overall, it may be worth a rent to see the title characters fight, and be introduced to a new badass Predator. Otherwise, it is a disappointment. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
They tried for years to get this film made....so this is what we got,"They have been trying for years to get this film made....so what did you think of it? Is it what you expected? Is this the film you would've'e made if you were in control? If you are like most of us then your answers to the above questions are probably No, No, No and No However it is not all bad ....in fact there were parts of this film that I really enjoyed. My biggest disappointment is that it didn't follow the ALIEN VS PREDATOR story lines that I have learn to enjoy from the paper back novels and comic books.I wanted to see a movie about humans in the future who are at war with the predator race in space and both are using the alien as a weapon against each other (just like in the novels) Needless to say that isn't the film they made.....I'm afraid this film falls under the category of movies that i like to call ""what could have been...films"" Had they followed the story lines used in the paperback novels this could have been the birth of a new major sci-fi franchise that would rivaled the likes of Star Wars, BattleStar Galactica, and Star Trek.Instead we get to see a gang of twenty somethings go glob trotting in Antartica in a underground pyramid (and most of them are killed off before you even get to know the characters) --and the rest of the movie was just a special effect show At least it was entertaining..and it did have some decent special effects I gave it 5 out of 10 stars",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Falls in the category of what could have been!,"Both films have a cult following and when you put both together for one gigantic battle you are hoping for something equally special then someone like Paul WS Anderson signs on the dotted line to direct. I am not a keen fan of his to say the least but I loved Event Horizon which is his best work to date and by the way he's going it will be forever.With something like Alien VS Predator you have to have a director who knows what he's doing. Because Paul Anderson directed films like Mortal Combat and Resident Evil so the studio bosses are likely to go with someone like Anderson, I think it's because he's cheap and not just in directing. I think everybody expects to much from a film like this, you just have to look at how Freddy VS Jason was treated. What I expected was an all out no holds barred action gore fest and I don't think I even got that granted that the theatrical version is not Anderson's full cut. Still since PG-13 and 12A were exposed over the years studio bosses know they can make more money if kids can get the chance to go and see it just like adults can, make it one big happy family occasion so when Alien VS Predator was announced with these certificates I straight away expected no gore but I would have least liked some action. The first fight we see between the Alien and Predator was quite good and it had me pumped up but they are not long enough to satisfy my needs.In the middle of nowhere a pyramid buried thousands of feet under the snow lies a pyramid. Weland Bishop and his company come across it and want to lead a team down there to see it for themselves. There is not much information on what they are going to do when they get there, only to go down into this long shaft tunnel thing and look at it and apparently make history but of course this is not long lived. I don't want to say to much as the plot is quite interesting when it comes to the history of the Alien and Predator and you should see that for yourself really. I don't think this film is as cheesy as some say, the acting is very good and is hard to criticise, but what makes this film not that good is the plot holes which really leave you quite frustrated and wanting more. It's not as bad as they say and is highly enjoyable in parts but we really have expected a lot but the reason for this is there is so much to work on to make it quite epic especially when you learn how this all came about thousands of years ago so you can't help but feel cheated in that aspect.Watch it and you will like it, but if you're a hardcore fan you are likely to dislike most of the film all together and we have Paul Anderson and Studio bosses to thank for this, Resident Evil anyone?",,Anonymous,Horror
A different vibe but not bad.,"At the end of the day, this an idea spawned by comics and the film has a comic book sensibility. Some of the characters are bad and a lot of the dialogue and beats are very difficult for the actors to sell: Reducing Tommy Flanagan to a onenote screeching guy probably wasn't the best shout. Great actor, poorly utilised and the same can be said for many of the cast. That aside, gotta say, I did really enjoy the first half of the film. The manner in which the set up revealed itself was interesting. The second half of the movie gets a bit too daft but overall, I did enjoy this film. It was fun and to put it simply, you just can't take it too seriously. Don't go in expecting anything like the tone of Alien 1 or 2/Predator because this just isn't that movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A fine merging of two of Sci Fi's most popular franchises,"I went into this moving hoping for Aliens or Predator 1. I went in expecting Freddy Vs. Jason. Meaning bad acting and terrible attempts at humor to mask a lack of story and disappointing wash ending. What I got was closer to my hopes than my expectations, surprisingly good action and better acting than I would have expected. I was overjoyed to see a movie that leaves out cheesy laughs and Danny Glover. The aliens really came off well, much more active and vicious through the magic of C.G. It was nice to see the queen in realistic action rather than a large costume with mechanical limbs. The predators were what you'd expect and stayed true to the previous films. My only beef with the movie is the bond that forms between the lead human character and a predator. However the fact that a single female is the surviving lead stays true to the alien franchise and the respect shown by the predator is not new to the Predator franchise either (i.e. the elder towards Glover in Predator 2). The story in my opinion was an interesting and unique way to bring the franchises together. Overall I think AVP is better than Alien 3, Resurrection, and Predator 2 but still behind the others (which are classics). This movie for me puts Paul W.S. Anderson at par for films. The Good (AVP, EVENT HORIZON) The Bad (Resident Evil) The Ugly (Soldier).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up,"2/5  Alien Vs. PredatorTake two well-known sci-fi franchises and merge them into a film in such a way that you can be assured of a huge audience, but also, that the sum is greater than the parts.  Or as great.  This film isn't it.  Alien Vs. Predator is a cold, calculated `product' that is too contrived and formulaic to provide much intrigue or entertainment value.  And the most amount of suspense is provided courtesy of a penguin.A corporate satellite, searching for evidence of natural resources, detects a significant amount of heat coming from an island in Antarctica.  The billionaire head of the company quickly hobbles together an expedition team to investigate what appears to be a pyramid with Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian traits, located 2000 feet below the surface.The pyramid contains walls and floors that shift every ten minutes and hieroglyphics that are interpreted by one of the crew, to give them some sense of what they have found.  The maze provides so much overkill that an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider fan would blush. The humans get into the maze, the face huggers do their thing and you have a nice population of Aliens for the Predators to hunt.It takes one human to `birth' an Alien, so why are there so many Aliens in the place?  The gestation period took hours in the first Alien film, but here they seem to pop out with greater frequency.  The dialogue appears to be written by a 6th-grader.  There are no outstanding characters in the film, like a Ripley from the Alien series, although they try to create one in `Lex' Woods, played by Sanaa Lathan.  There's virtually no character development, so when they get killed, you don't feel anything.  Lance Henriksen plays the billionaire.  In one scene, he briefly does the `knife' trick from the Aliens film, where he played a `synthetic human.'This film is an empty-calorie spectacle that doesn't satisfy, yet it promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up.  At least we find out who taught humans how to build pyramids.Review by Triniman",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Any Predator in the theater would have blown it up in despair,"When I entered the theater I expected the worst: my nice little Aliens and Predator universes being dismantled by some sort of commercial sell-out. Er, ... exactly that happened. BUT to my surprise the two monster characters had even enough great aspects to save my evening from being a complete disaster. Right, the dialogues were quite ridiculous far too often. The shape-shifting of the pyramid seemed a very stupid idea to me  why the hell should the predators have invested such an amount of energy, know-how and time in a construction like this? They are supposed to be hunters, not scientists! The alliance with a human being on the other hand is a nice idea if you ask me, as long as the Predator has some good reason to respect the others' fighting capabilities, cause only this way one seems to earn his right to live in their view. So if this human can fight, why shouldn't she be respected?Another funny idea came to me watching the Predators dressed in their thongs walking antarctic territory: ever heard a Predator sneezing?  Must be a funny sound! Don't catch a cold out there, man! Up to now it was said they prefer REALLY hot summers... But I have to conclude: this movie is really a damn sell-out. Nearly all the elements of tension and atmosphere that made the earlier movies the legends they are today are missing: the facehuggers almost haven't fallen off their hosts' faces when the babies burst out  no incubation at all, compare this to 'Alien 1'! The predators don't behold anymore  they prefer making a mess wherever they pass by. The Aliens' blood that was capable of burning holes in a number of decks (!) on the 'Nostromo' has turned now into some kind of skincare, as our hero is marked by her companion from outer space: she takes no damage, does not even squeak. Things like these disintegrate the great pictures of the two species drawn by others in their superb movies before. And therefore I really dislike this crap!!! The cuts of the battle scenes are often indeed far too quick to recognize anything  you could as well have saved the money for a better script and shown a black screen with some 'uh', 'ouch', 'kaboom' and 'inkelklink'. On the other hand the camera has caught some wonderful scenes: the icebreaker in full moon night, the flare sliding down the unknown tunnel, very atmospheric I can say! So the scenery has been chosen fine (if the predators had had some thermos pants), the historical story is a nice idea I might say, apart from this awfully plump melting of three ancient cultures and their languages even in single inscriptions without the slightest difficulty to read for someone who only knows some parts of the younger civilizations. Again, scenes like these flatten the whole plot (to lowest Hollywood level). If there ever will be a sequel the fans may really expect a reparation for this one!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Could this be the end of the genera,"The feeling I got when I first experienced the Aliens and Predator are gone. Don't get me wrong there are still a pleasure to see on the big screen. But it seems that with every new flick since Resurrection that has either of these characters in them the scare factor diminishes. Its been awhile since seeing the Predators, so it was more pleasing seeing them again. As far as the other characters in this movie , I think there were to many of them. Then again, its always nice seeing humans get slaughtered by the extraterrestrials. There's a cameo with the human explores that was also in a previous films.As far as adding to the story of both the Aliens and the Predator this film does real well, it's like the comic coming to life. So much so I think there could have been a film based on just that backstory.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not too bad, but pg-13 rating let this film down a bit","I just finished watching the movie and i have been left with mixed opinion. It reminded me very much of a resident evil scenario, typical as Paul Anderson is back on board to direct and Colin salmon has a role in the movie. I liked the idea of merging the two alien races together since the trophy room scene in predator 2. This movie is satisfying good and starts off really well. at 87 minutes long until the credits, this felt a bit rushed and could have been 10 minutes more to help explain a few things. OK though. The money has been well spent and the film looks like delicious candy. Great idea to put lance Hendrickson on board, i so admire the actor, and even give the scar faced tommy Flanagan the role of verheiden, that actor gives a very menacing feel to the screen, i hope he gets bigger roles soon. The film played OK throughout, effects top notch guys, but due to the pg-13 rating, i bet tons of footage was cut and it is pretty obvious a lot of the time. In some battle and attack sequences, they are too instantaneous and before you can work out wtf is happening, were on to the next bit. The script was OK but the character development was not here at all. Most of the soldiers don't have names, you don't see them all die, and they all disappear to quickly. I think about five people die within a minute here. The cast goes from around 16 down to 2 in 25 minutes. Anyway, if you read this, see the film, it is a good film on the whole and leaves room for a sequel, though one i feel is not needed. I don't think Oscars are on the horizon nor great reviews, but this was a good 90 minutes.Overall rating, 6 out of 10, mainly that damn pg-13 rating took it down!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"What could be""The Definitive ""Vs."" Movie""","An incredible and horrific adventure begins when billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland gathers an international team of archaeologists, scientists and security experts, led by environmentalist and adventurer Alexa ""Lex"" Woods , to investigate a mysterious ""heat bloom"" emanating from deep under Antarctica.What they witness 2000 feet below the frozen surface at first excites, and then terrifies them. They discover a pyramid bearing a mixture of Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian cultures. Inside the pyramid they find a matrix of chambers so technologically advanced that it becomes obvious that an extraterrestrial influence has been at work there for thousands of years. The chamber walls reconfigure unexpectedly, trapping members of the team and cutting them off from their colleagues.Moving from chamber to chamber, the horrific truth finally reveals itself: Predators have been keeping alive a captive Alien Queen who lays eggs at 100 year intervals. Young Predators warriors are tested by fighting the Alien offspring. The team stumbles into the middle of an incredible rite of passage -- and a war between Aliens and Predators.The iconic monsters from two of the scariest film franchises ever, battle each other on Earth for the first time on film. 14 years in the making, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" (The movie) has been rumored to have been in production ever since the skull of the Alien Queen appeared in the sequel to ""Predator"", ""Predator 2"". The AvP phenomenon has found it's way into the media, in every shape or form. From Trading Cards, to comics, to video games, and finally, the big screen! But was it worth the wait?Well first of all, having the ""Alien Legacy"" being my favorite film series, I am a HUGE fan of these movies. I was very happy to learn that this movie was actually happening. I could care less what it was rated. Although gore is a high priority in these films. I was scared that I would be disappointed with this film considering I'm not a huge fan of Paul Anderson.I would have loved to see Micheal Mann or Brain DePalma take on the franchise. I knew it wouldn't happen.When the news came that it was indeed ""PG-13"", I was disappointed, but honestly, I expected it. I first saw AvP the Sunday after it was released. I loved it! In the very few moments where the two bad-ass sci-fi titans are allowed to do their thing, the films shines.BIG TIME! The acting is much better than I expected from no-names. The story is simple, yet smart. The film was heavily cut according to... well anyone involved in the filming. The R-Rated and proper version will be released on DVD, so take a breath, it's gonna happen. Although us Alien-nerds will never have the satisfaction of having the ultimate ""Aliens Vs. Predator"", this will have to do. And that's fine by me.AVP is actually far better than it could have been. For weeks I've been hearing terrible buzz about the film. It is actually better than all that. It's fun to watch and, even when the plot gets really hokey, it's easy enough to laugh it off and prepare for the next epic monster battle. To be honest, to me, it's the definitive ""Vs."" movie. We'll have to wait for the R-rated version. Better than Freddy Vs. Jason and the other Vs. movies. It is a very well done flick and one of my favorites. I would love to see more AvP films in the future with more different types of ""Alien"" species.***1/2/*****",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ultimate Showdown,"Alien vs. Predator is precisely the kind of movie I had expected. It's gritty, action-packed and dark but filled to the brim with cool moments that make it fun to watch. As this is a Paul Anderson film the visuals and the sound have been done brilliantly but its also structured and paced in a very cool way.Actually I was a little concerned that the movie was a quite bit shorter than the other movies in the Alien-franchise, but the usual 90 minute-structure of Anderson's films is nice in that the movie never feels like it's dragging along. The film also has many humorous moments to keep it from becoming too serious.The only criticism I can point out is that the film does feel a little too much like a blast from the past. Alien and Predator were both more effective back in the days of Cameron and that's probably a feeling that isn't gonna go away no matter how much you like the film.All I can say is that Anderson did a great job in bringing the two franchises together and created a film that is fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch the Fight Ignore Everything Else,"Alien versus Predator, what's not to like? Let's make it happen: Ali v. Frasier, Tyson v. Holyfield. All we need is a serviceable premise to pit these two against each other and we're talking about cinematic gold!Well, therein lied the problem. The story around having these two iconic creatures fight was awful. An underground pyramid has been accidentally discovered and a wealthy businessman wants to be the first to discover it. He hastily assembles a team of explorers, scientists and the oh-so necessary terrain expert, Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan). Of course instead of getting to brag about his landmark find, he finds he and his team are nothing more than canon fodder for the extra-terrestrials.Between the acting and the lazily developed story I was ready to scream. For thousands of years these inter-planetary predators would every so often visit Earth to harvest aliens in order to hunt them. What!? And as a parting gift to the humans that worshipped them they taught them how to build.

Definitely worth the wait. **** out of 5,"I felt Paul Anderson was the perfect choice to direct this film. You'll find lots of controversy of this, because most people either loved or hated his previous films like Event Horizon, Resident Evil, and Mortal Kombat.Story wise, I felt this film was very clever. I think some people were disappointed that it didn't revolve around the comics and novels based on the same theme, but I felt it was an OK move.One of the things I was most impressed with was the mixture of real tangible special effects and CGI. It was a grand blend and executed in such a fashion that you couldn't distinguish the two from one another. It's something we don't see enough of in science fiction and horror films these days and I can't praise Anderson enough for making this wise decision.The acting wasn't bad either, I thought everyone did a fine job. Especially the great Lance Henrikson. And newcomer composer Harald Kloser provides a score that totally deserves to go alongside Goldsmith's, Horner's, Goldenthal's, Frizzell's and Silvestri's work. I suppose the film isn't entirely flawless. A friend of mine pointed out that the alien chestburster cycle went way too fast. I have heard that there is a deleted scene that explained the reason for this, but I'm not sure how it would have fit in with the film itself. This could be just a rumor though. However, I think any flaws that there are are petty and don't detract from the over all film itself. Some people griped about the lack of blood and that it was the first Alien and Predator film to get a PG-13 rating rather than an R rating. Let's be honest, this is a movie about two alien races fighting against one another. Lots of slime, goo, and green alien blood. Besides, I believe it was a smart move to go for a PG-13 rating to ensure wider audience appeal and gross.I think the film definitely has a vibe that's reminiscent of 'Aliens' and the first 'Predator'. This is a great Science Fiction film, and the best Summer Action Blockbuster of 2004. It stands alone, but serves as a worthy addition to both the 'Alien' series and 'Predator' series. As an avid fan of both franchises, I couldn't have asked for more!",,Anonymous,Horror
A disappointment for true fans,"I wanted so much to like this movie -- after all, fans of both the Aliens and Predator franchises had been waiting for over a decade for the two to clash on screen. While this movie might appeal to new fans, I doubt it will satisfy people who have been following the franchises since their inceptions. While the effects and creature designs were decent, this movie lacks one thing that makes some of the older films (most notably Alien, Aliens and the first Predator) fun to watch over and over -- the characters are, almost without exception, one-dimensional and unengaging. There isn't any really unique character in this one, like Ripley in Alien, Newt and Hicks in Aliens, or the triple threat played by Arnold, Jesse and Carl Weathers in predator. I honestly didn't care who lived or died.Speaking of deaths, I know i wasn't the only one disappointed by the studio's decision to make this a PG-13 film. While some clever cinematography made it seem like you were seeing more explicit violence than actually was shown in frame, it lacked the stark, dark realism that was especially effective in the first Alien film. Add to that the incredibly short running time (well under 90 minutes if you were to remove the end credits) and you have a film that could have been, should have been able to do a lot more with a cool story concept than was the result. Hopefully, the inevitable special edition DVD will restore some sequences that were cut from the theater, help to flesh out the characters, and provide a bit more blood for hardcore fans of gore.

Its members are recruited from places all over the world in order to investigate a strange pyramid, found 600 m under frozen Antarctica, pyramid which embodies symbols and architecture of three ancient civilizations: Egyptian, Mayan and ancient Cambodian. The screen play is not so great, as it is almost the same as we've seen in many Hollywood movies. After some ""traps"" inside the pyramid are activated unknowingly by some crew members, thus bringing to life the Alien-mother, and after some Predators descend from space in order to eliminate the alien species, the humans realize that they can only survive if they team up with their enemy's enemy (the Predators).By the end of the film, only the female character survives and is awarded a Sci-Fi weapon by Predator beings. Overall, the movie is not so great, although well filmed. I especially disliked that it is too dark, as throughout the entire length of the movie the action takes place either inside the pyramid (the only source of light are flashlights or flares) or outside (where it is also dark, being night). It is worth seeing unless you have a better choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Alien vs Predator: a literal event film.,"Alien vs Predator came about circa the Dark Horse Comics storyline in 1989, and of course it proved so damn popular a movie was optioned almost immediately after it turned into a runaway success. I'm 2004, it finally debuted to strong box office numbers but critical drubbings; and it's now become an 'on-the-radar-so-so' film that simply exists in Hollywood's ever-growing stream of multimillion-dollar projects.This film is... okay. A film like this was never gonna be evaluated as some 'misunderstood masterpiece of cinema' and the novelty of the Alien & Predator crossover charm has well and truly worn-off. Maybe a third one COULD have the same kind of success, but it'd have to be a critical darling and have strong audience responses in a post-2024 landscape of entertainment. Event films can't have so-so responses these days if they want excellent numbers or longevity.Alien vs Predator definitely helped franchises like the MCU and other shared-universe properties take shape at the movies, and maybe there'll be an attempt at 'revitalising' the Alien vs Predator franchise in the future, but who knows?Alien vs Predator gets 6/10 IMDbs. 3/5 stars. It's comfort food made for the big screen, and nothing more than that. The franchises are still better when they're self-contained stories anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A message to the studios......,"The Aliens don't look right they never have since 'ALIENS' the movie go back to the men in suites. In this case (and alien 4 oh and alien 3 whilst we're at it) the cgi aliens aren't as good as the costume aliens.This should have been an awesome film the potential for the plot was massive but the the story doesn't deliver. There isn't enough story and the film is too short, the big fight seens aren't big and there are no really strong characters.ShameLet's hope aliens 6 or predator 4 will be better (if they ever make then).My recommendation to the studios go out and hire the same team that made ALIENS because ever since then none of the series has been any good.Hey you never know it might be like that games AVP was crap but AVP2 was AWESOME :) Here's living in hope :)Plot for AVP 2???The aliens are taking over earth and the humans are loosing but the predators come to the rescue of the human's who were their former slaves. you can work some plot twists in there if you like. For example a human/some humans save the predators or something. Anyway there must be massive fight scenes with a scale like troy. Aliens running up and down buildings all over NY??? or some other large city and predators, hundreds of them engaged in fighting them all over the city/country. Massive battles :) oh year and the human space marines giving them some too :) you could just call it ""Alien 3 Earthbound"" lol and forget the other crap you've made :D or call it AVP and forget the first one was ever made too JUST LIKE THE GAMES IN FACT LOL.HAVE A STRONG MALE LEAD no offense to all the women out there, Sigourney pulled it off like no one else can and this has to be one of my all time favorite characters ever but any other female actress in the role just wouldn't or for that matter couldn't match up in the lead role.......Bring back the aliens team, bring back the space marines with big fights and big guns and make my movie!!!!!!!!I'll even write the plot/story if you need some help :DBrian",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
An excellent sci-fi action film!,"Ever since the comic books came out, I have been waiting for this movie to hit the theaters. The film did not disappoint! A research group is sent to Antartica to investigate a strange heat source under the frozen ice. Little do they realize, they are about to be thrust into the middle of a war the world has never seen.Great special effects and an interesting story makes this one above average. It is no where near the original Alien or Predator film, but it is great entertainment. My only complaint is the fact that they changed how the Predator looked. It would have been better if they kept the original design.If you are a fan of sci-fi action, definitely pick this one up. If you expect a film to match the original Alien or Predator movie, you may be disappointed.

A good premise but short of reward...,"Alien vs. Predator had the potential to be the best film of the lot. An interesting concept, smart back story and adequate special effects could have made this a blockbuster. Sadly, this will not happen. Where to begin with this movie? First, 87 minutes was too short to properly establish the movie. Basically, it starts off with who's who and next thing you know they are in Anarctica. OK, that's fine. This isn't a think piece. But in an action film, action is required. The title of the movie was Alien vs. Predator. As I sat in the theater watching this piece of crap I thought I was watching the live action scooby doo movie. Thirty minutes of the movie was spent with the cast wandering around the temple falling through trap doors and falling walls. If I wanted to see The Haunting I would have rented it. We get about 5 minutes of Predators vs. Aliens. What a waste! I have two major complaints besides the lack of action. First, how quickly the scientist figured out what was going on. That's phony and secondly, why are the plasma cannons hidden in the temple. That's just stupid. The most interesting part of the movie was the last 30 seconds. I just hope they get someone else to write that movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
We really are a weak race!!,"We really are a weak race!I cant understand why this movie is getting such a beating! I am by no means one of those people, who only sees these kind of movies in the cinema, but i feel i have to defend AvP for some of its criticism. AvP is not a film born out of a great story or plot, you have to see it as what it is, a video game turned into movie script. Lets examine what the video game is about, oh yeah, kill everything that moves, and what is the movie about, funny enough the main scheme is also to take lives in a very painting and acrobatic way! If you go and see these kind of movies, leave your brain at home! and if you are more of a Howards End meets Titanic, then don't see this movie!! As for the movie, I can only conclude one thing out of this movie, boy we really are a degenerate race! with out ruining to much of the movie i can say that the humans in the film do a lot of healthy running, as for the aliens and predator, they have a more kill-the-one-your-with approach to life!

I am a Aliens and Predator fan so, I like the idea of creating more movies. Humans as partners to the Predator, I like that too. Lets see it again. I have ideas but I am sure that the creators have better ideas. Lets see Humans go to the planet where the Predator comes from. How about humans helping them.

not worth a 2nd view,I saw it and had no real high hopes for it and it still did nothing for me in terms of action or anything else. hey i like so-called mindless films too but this goes beyond that. the story is my biggest problem because if you have seen the 1st 2 of both films you have a idea of what to expect (but its i guess this is from the comic book of the same name or something like) but if you know the story of the other films you will be disappointed. predator 2 started the whole thing about these two creatures in perhaps in a battle of some sorts in the past so why not jump on that idea instead of this? and this story does not even make sense and also the time frame and the whole bishop thing i'm not even going to get into and besides i thought that the predator likes very hot or warm climates.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Okay, but not impressive.","Well, there isn't much to say about this one. It is an okay action movie. The special effects, and costumes were fabulous, but the rest didn't measure up to it.Lance Henriksen gave probably the worst acting performance in his career. He always seems to have a very strong presence on the screen. This was not the fact here. He seemed to almost disappear in all the ruckus. As if he were bored to hell by the whole movie. I was actually relieved when his character died.The woman that had the lead role, sorry I don't remember her name, performed much better. Although by no means worthy of even looking at an Oscar, her acting alone saved this movie from being a total let down. Even though she gets totally squashed by the looming shadow of Sigourney's Ripley character, she does deliver the goods in a convincing manner. Instead of trying to act like Ripley, which would have been a catastrophe since no one can fill her shoes, she chose to do it her own way. And it worked!But the camera work were too bad. I got totally confused, trying to find out where the heck they were! There seemed to be no point what so ever, what way they walked. they just stumbled, ran and fell around, with no plan! Luckily the sole remaining young predator seemed to know where he and the environmentalist went. But it didn't help on me almost getting a vertigo feeling. And we very seldom got to really see the hieroglyphs, as they always were too far away or in an impossible angle to see. Mostly they just looked like decoration, ugly decoration.Still, all in all I enjoyed the movie, with all it's weaknesses. Let's face it, one doesn't go to this kind of movie, expecting to get a excellent written plot. The plot here were minimal, but did work to some degree. Although, I never understood why that Alien Queen never had escaped before then. And I am wondering why that queen didn't die from all the bullets and energy blasts she got struck with in the end. If i don't recall wrong, Ripley killed queens left and right with a gun. Not to mention that there was no way in hell this queen could survive the blast from the predators bomb! It was designed for that purpose, for crying out loud!!! As the queen was pulled down into the deep, the possibility of a sequel were jumping almost painfully at me. THE ALIEN QUEEN RETURNS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TO SEEK HER REVENGE!!!! BWAHAHAHA!!!!And finally, the one thing in the movie I really couldn't swallow, the ending. It just HAD to come! AN ALIEN/PREDATOR HYBRID!!!!I enjoyed this movie, but I hope to God they never make a sequel.Thats all, folks.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another long-awaited crossover film!,"ALIEN VS. PREDATOR was a long awaited feature film crossover for me, this was after 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason"", which I previously reviewed.The film is set in the year 2004 and it follows a group of archaeologists assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland for an expedition near the Antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal.Weyland hopes to claim the find for himself and his group discovers a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station.Hieroglyphs and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface.The story is amazing and the direction is okay. The cinematography has that gory atmosphere and creepy feel in the second and third act, but it has that snowy Christmas-like atmosphere in the first act of the film. The problem that had film critics hammer this film was the PG-13 rating, to be honest, I don't mind this film having that rating because I understand what Paul W.S. Anderson was going for.Other problems was the dialogue. Sure, the dialogue feels out of place, but I like the script written for the film. The other things were cardboard characters, the fast-paced editing during action sequences and lighting.The lighting is a distraction, but that does not stop me from watching this movie. THE FILM IS RATED PG-13! GET OVER IT, PEOPLE AND CRITICS. The fast-paced editing during the fights are awesome for this film and I don't mind this at all. The production designs and special effects are amazing and I could not have seen better.The characters are not cardboards, they're characters that I can relate to while watching the film. The acting is okay and the performances are amazing. Alien vs. Predator is a film that really needs to be remembered better than it has been.

My expectations were not that positive. I hoped it would be worth the 90 minutes watching it though, and it does feel a little bit like a ""must see"" movie, since if you're born in the early eighties you're grown up with the Alien series and the Predator series. I was a little bit surprised by the actors list, but it mixed up rather well with this film. Overall it's worth it's 90 minutes of action, but it's nothing special or anything at all that I would buy when the DVD is to be released.

A commendable film for both Alien and Predator Franchises,"I enjoyed watching it. It keeps the same tone as both the Aliens and Predator movies that precede it.It certainly is better than the original Predator movie with Arnold (now, THAT was a schlocky (bad) film). This is far better.A few things. People speak as though this started with Aliens in 1986. I found myself thinking ""they must be VERY young."" The original film is ""Alien"" - from 1979. That film was the basis for MUCH better sci-fi that followed, although the subsequent Aliens movies were not as good (until the last one).What's to say? This had good action sequences. The humans, as usual, do the dumb things human usually do in this movie: call out to others when they should shut their damn mouths, or touch something they shouldn't touch. (It's astounding how stupid humans are in films like these: they just reach out and touch something without thinking there will be any consequences). And, as usual: they die!I didn't think the dialogue overly absurd, unlike reviewer gogoschka, who references the horror films of the 50s and 60s., All I can say about that is that sci-fi of that time involved the screaming woman in danger (I rolled my eyes even back then: who the hell just sits there and screams as the Creature From the Black Lagoon is advancing on you? I would've been, like ""ZOOOOOMMMMMMMM"" out of there. And after all, we were innocent in the 50s and 60s, unlike the supercool I've-seen-it-all crowd of youngsters today So, the dialogue is exactly what I'd expect.The director went through the logical sequences, killing off people one by one, with a few surprises in there. Not that Saana Latham surviving was ever in doubt in anyone's mind: if the Black woman is the protagonist, she is NEVER going to die. That's also par for movies of this time period. (Actually, come to think of it, I can't recall ONE movie where the Black female action hero(ine)) EVER died. And that's good. Why should our movie lives have to be like our REAL lives?? It's good to see the person with the most sense is the Black woman! That's why Kamala is VP now!This is a good popcorn edge-of-your-seat film. (Almost) never a dull moment.There were far fewer of those ""Jesus Christ, how-stupid-are-they"" moments in this film than most of the ones I've seen in the past 69 years (Lord, I'm THAT old? Yes, I guess I am...)
Try not to be so uber-sophisticated while watching this and you can have an enjoyable two hours. It beats anything in ANY of ""The Fantastic Four"" movies (truly badly done, and that's by someone who started reading them in 1965), or even the X-Men (whom I like, but really, their reaction time is slower than most 70 year olds who are friends of mine (and that's DAMNN slow!!!); ""Doom"" (an utterly insipid sci-fi film), or ""2012"" (as dumb as a bag of rocks. Who flies a plan 300 feet above ground, in between falling skyscrapers?!?! Wouldn't ya think, ""PULL UP, YOU FOOL!! Get us up to 2000 feet, at least!!!!!'), or most ANYTHING on CW, superhero or otherwise. (Like Supergirl throwing one punch, than standing back as if she's waiting to see what happens next. Is this what people do when they fight, or do they beat the crap out of the other person (we're talking superheros, remember) until the person is unconscious and we're SURE they're not going to get up as soon as we turn our head and knock us out and then shoot/stab/behead us? Well, if you can look at CW, then more power to you, but this is far better to swallow.",,Anonymous,Horror
A good action flick but obviously don't expect anything else,"This film has a story that you can actually follow and a plot that isn't as all over the place like a cat in a tumble dryer, as the film Predator 2's was. Throughout the whole of Predator 2, I kept thinking ""is this a comedy? is this satire?"". But AVP (2004) fortunately has a story/plot that is competent enough to keep the viewer's attention for the full 95minutes runtime.You're not gonna cry due to the feelings it evokes or be taught any new earthshattering life lessons or learn something new about the human psyche... but you're going to be entertained for most of the 95minutes and that's good enough for me.If you compare this film to all action films before 2005 then this film is pretty high up there and that's why I'd recommend that you watch it. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Something that is fund to watch but not your high quality stuff...,Out of the Sci-Fi pictures today there are few that are quite as memorable as the Predator and the Aliens. When they go head to head this seems like it would be a match made in heaven...well it was an interesting fight to be sure.Introducting in the red corner the Aliens a race of multiplying killers with little in mind other than laying their eggs in your chest and watching the gore start to pour out. In the Blue Corner we have the Preditors a race of hunters that take their work very seriously with high tech weaponry that would make Robocop seem tame. But oddly enough we have another group of fighters in the fray the human targets! Ever the victims of these two warrior races.I wonder why it seems always necessary to throw in a few token humans to kill. This movie would have been just as enjoyable (If not less disturbing) with just the Aliens and the Predator. These humans are a bunch of explorers trying to unearth an ancient temple of some sort which has them end up in the middle of a fight between two nasty sci-fi critters that don't care what gets in their way.The effects on this movie and the combat scenes are very good and exciting to watch but the plot is cheesy and any person expecting anything really good from this (though I can't say why) will be disappointed. But if you like combat and gore then this is a good movie to watch. My suggestion though is to rent this one first.,5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good addition to two franchises,"A lot of pressure from fans of the AVP game went into the making of this film.And it all started because of the cameo of an alien - skull in the predator spaceship at the end of predator 2.I never understood what the complaint about this movie has been, it follows all of the rules of any alien/predator film. For one thing and has a strong female protagonist, Sanaa Lathan is our Ripley in this. We also have the earliest rendition of ""Bishop"", The real human Bishop, Charles Bishop Weyland... The Weyland half of Weyland-Yutani.Pepper in a few pretty decent character actors of the time like Ewen Bremner (from ""the runaround"") and Maximus' servant from ""Gladiator"" Tommy Flanagan, and then you have those two actors developing a kind of bond even though they represent two completely different kinds of people, geek and mercenary... it means that you've got some pretty fabulous character interactions going on.Of course most of the cast are alien and predator fodder.And of course we get to see the alien queen in action once again. And we understand something else about the queen, as to why she was restrained in aliens, when Ripley meets her. She is similarly restrained in this film, although in this case it was not by her own choosing.As with every predator movie, there are improvements in the predator hardware, in this movie we get the invisible ""wolverine claws"" - that you don't see until after they have been used to skewer a victim.Of course the ending of this movie sets up a premise that we have wondered about it, ""what would happen if a face hugger got stuck onto a predator?""For the answer to that you would have to watch ""alien versus predator: requiem"", which isn't really as good as this... it's a bit too complicated. This film is perfect, because it gives us the answer as to why predators are always hunting aliens. It does not presume to do anything else but to tell us how and why this happened.Maybe too many people had ideas of how they wanted this film to be, before it was ever made and therefore this didn't match up to their expectations, so that's not the fault of the filmmakers in this case.One thing I noticed was that, due to alien canon, the alien queen would not have been attacking a certain protagonist in this film.But I can't tell you who that is...",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"not bad, things could have been better","i liked the film, but then again I'm always a fan of the predator. just one thing that kinda sends me off. after thousands of years of fighting the aliens why didn't the predators design a weapon that didn't become damaged from the aliens acid like blood. i did like the predator teaming up with the human. shows the same remorse they did to danny glover in the second one. in the first film we just see the predator fighting in the jungle without reason. the second film and avp kinda give them a reason for being here. from the movies you would think the predators age slowly or adulthood comes late for them. for they only have the coming of man(or warrior) only 100 years. its a big deal for them. i say its a good film, but could have been better. but thats the same with any comic book, video game or sequel out there. it sure stayed more true to form then constatine did. which i also liked. but thats for another message board. have a good one. -mike",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
They have forgotten what made the Aliens and Predator films great,"It was only a matter of time after that Alien skull cameo in Predator 2 that someone made a movie pitting the ferocious Alien xenomorphs against the vicious Predators. Already that one scene spawned a number of video games, novels and a slew of comics, some good some terrible. It is quite disappointing that this movie would have to veer dangerously into the ""terrible"" range.Alien Vs Predator starts off with the discovery of a pyramid deep under the antarctic ice. A team of explorers are sent in to investigate. Lo and Behold, they discover that the pyramid belongs to a space-faring species of hunters (the Predators) who use it to breed another type of Alien (the Aliens) as opponents/prey for their own hunting rituals. As usual, the humans screwed up what was to be a standard hunting trial for 3 young Predators by stealing their plasma weapons and unwittingly setting the Aliens free ahead of schedule. What follows is a frantic free for all as Humans, Aliens and Predators duke it out in one surprisingly bloodless fight after another.Now of course coming to a movie with ""versus"" in the title would imply lots of fighting right? wrong. Alien Vs Predator is absolutely BORING for the first 45 minutes or so as we are introduced to one bland B movie stock character after another. Lots of talking, which no doubt the writers thought could pass off as ""character development"", happens but nothing else substantial aside from a little nod to Aliens fans in the form of Lance Henriksen playing the role of a character named ""Bishop"" again.When the action finally does come, it is more bark than bite and ultimately not worth the 45 minute wait. There was only ONE actual bona-fide ""Alien vs Predator"" fight which is dressed to impress. An epic crescendo in the otherwise mediocre movie background music accompanies the very first big-screen face to face meeting of the two movie monsters. Fantastic fight choreography coupled with some clever use of slow motion makes that one fight very satisfying to watch and it is actually quite a nail-biter as you would never know who would turn out the victor until too late. However, any of the subsequent action sequences lack that level of intensity and actually seem a little ""cartoon-y"". Also some scenes involving the Aliens look to have been ""sped up"" in post production, possibly to make those scenes feel more frantic.Sorry, but that one good fight just does not make up for the other disappointing ones. In fact, the creative team tended to be more partial toward the Aliens. The Predators are a far cry from the unstoppable killers in the previous movies. Here they are presented as big bulky bullies who pick on helpless humans with ease but are constantly being overpowered by their half-sized Alien opponents. It has been confirmed in behind-the-scenes interviews that director Paul WS Anderson is a bigger Alien fan than Predator fan, basically making the entire movie like a ""fixed"" fighting match with a biased referee.Lots of action is a good thing, but action was NOT the only thing that made the Aliens and Predator movies the classics they are. Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" film managed to keep up its eerie atmosphere and genuinely scary feel while giving viewers some well written character drama, James Cameron's Aliens upped the action ante and threw in some very memorable and likable characters with an impressive production design. Alien Vs Predator had none of these. It was not scary, the characters were under-developed, the pacing was erratic. . . Even the 1987 Predator had better action, characters and some memorable movie dialog. The dialog in AVP is just too wooden to be memorable.Failing to live up to the hype, Alien vs Predator is a big let-down for fans of the franchise. The entire premise, complete with hokey back-story about the Predators teaching ancient humans how to build pyramids, feels like a rejected video game. No doubt the set designs for the underground pyramid interior and the snowy antarctic scenes look awesome but that is where the praise usually ends.There is an ""unrated and extended"" DVD edition that adds in some CGI blood and some longer scenes of fighting but a disappointing movie is still a disappointing movie no matter how you try to coat it and market it.

Released in 2004 and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, the film pits the deadly creatures from the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series against each other in an ancient pyramid beneath the Antarctic ice. While not without its flaws, the movie offers a compelling blend of suspense, action, and fan-service that makes it a must-watch for fans of both franchises.**Why You Should Watch:**The primary reason to watch ""Alien vs. Predator"" is the excitement of seeing two legendary sci-fi species face off on the big screen. The film successfully captures the essence of both franchises, delivering intense and well-choreographed battles between the Xenomorphs and the Predators. The concept itself is a dream come true for fans who grew up imagining what would happen if these two formidable alien species were to collide, and the film doesn't disappoint in bringing that vision to life.The movie also introduces a captivating backstory, delving into the ancient conflict between the Predators and the Aliens, providing context to the epic showdown. The setting of the ancient pyramid adds a unique twist to the narrative, blending science fiction with elements of archaeological exploration. The film's commitment to expanding the lore of both franchises while delivering on the promise of epic battles makes it a worthwhile addition to the sci-fi genre.**Weaknesses:**One of the notable weaknesses of ""Alien vs. Predator"" is its reliance on a somewhat formulaic plot. The narrative follows a group of humans caught in the crossfire between the two alien species, and while it serves as a functional framework, it may feel familiar to viewers who have seen similar survival-horror scenarios in both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises. Additionally, the character development is limited, with most of the human characters serving as cannon fodder rather than fully fleshed-out protagonists.The film's pacing can be a bit uneven, with moments of intense action interspersed with slower, exposition-heavy scenes. While the setup and backstory are necessary to build anticipation, some viewers may find themselves wishing for a more balanced rhythm throughout the film. Furthermore, the CGI effects, while groundbreaking for their time, may appear somewhat dated to modern audiences.**Conclusion and Rating:**""Alien vs. Predator"" deserves a commendable 6 stars for its ability to deliver on the promise of an epic crossover between two iconic franchises. While it may not reach the heights of the individual ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" films, it successfully captures the essence of both, providing an entertaining and visually engaging experience. Fans of science fiction, particularly those who grew up with these iconic creatures, will find plenty to enjoy in the film's thrilling battles and expanded universe.In conclusion, ""Alien vs. Predator"" is a cinematic showdown that caters to the inner sci-fi enthusiast in all of us. Its strengths lie in the excitement of witnessing these iconic extraterrestrial beings clash on screen, coupled with a compelling backstory that adds depth to the epic confrontation. While not without its flaws, the film stands as a testament to the power of imaginative storytelling and the thrill of seeing beloved franchises come together in a visually stunning spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Final Scene is Worth the Price of Admission,"The problem with the Aliens and Predator franchise is that, in my opinion, the first films were so extraordinary and the bar is so high that it's unlikely that any subsequent addition to the series is able to approach them. This film stands up well enough when compared to any other sci-fi or adventure film. It just can't approach the early entries in the Alien or Predator series.The flaws in this film have been addressed ad nauseum in other user comments. I do have to say that I thought the fight scenes between the predators and the aliens were well worth the price of admission, especially final battle between the alien, the predator and the human. It's okay to skip past all the build up and junk between the fight scenes. You won't miss anything. I recommend this film on the merits of the fight scenes alone. The blend of CGI and live-action are extraordinary.By the way, Ewen Bremmer is great. He's quite fun in this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well worth seeing in the theatre. At least on a matinee.,"As I am a longtime fan of both the Alien and Predator series (even the Alien3!), I admit I'm a little biased. This was one the best deliveries since Aliens. Not as good, mind you....but still pretty d*mn good. Good storyline, good cgi, good casting, reasonabe writing. I always looked upon the Predator series with almost a B-movie fondness, but AVP is definitely ""Top Shelf Sci-Fi""! Though, I have no idea why they gave it a ""PG"" rating.

I'm a fan... and I hated it!,"My Take: Good special effects can't save this crappy AVP.Honestly, I am a big fan of the ""Alien"" films. I remember watching ""Aliens"", the 2nd in the series, and really enjoyed it, so what do I do? Watch it over and over again. Easy for you to say that it was one of my favorite films of all time, but too me, ""Aliens"" was a lot more, as in other films I consider ""the best"". I like ""Alien"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" too. I wasn't as much of a fan of the ""Predator"" films though, but I think the 2 films were awesome action adventure/sci-fi hybrids.So with all the facts mentioned, it's easy to say I'll be enjoying ""AVP"" that much as I did with the originals. But sad to say, I didn't. In fact, what a letdown! Well, as much as I'd expect or as I did with the originals. Why? That's it, it's pretty hard to say how such a film that aims so low still falls short of the mark. Was it the story? Well, the story was about a group of renowned adventurers and explorers summoned by billionaire Charles Bishop-Wieland (the man who designed an android version of himself to hide his identity in two of the ""Alien"" films) to join an expedition in Antarctica to investigate an Aztec pyramid, which sent them a mysterious message. So was it the story?Was it the acting? Sanaa Lathan was the lead actress who, by any chances, makes an alliance with a Predator to fight the Aliens to hell. She was pretty heroic, but her acting, not much Sigourney Weaver-like heroic. The rest of the supporting cast was a mechanical and awfully boring (both characters and acting), for a lackluster film as this. So was it the acting?Or how about the over-abundance on special-effects and under-emphasis on a better plot? Well, that may be the biggest explanation, but was it the element that screws this all up?Perhaps it's a little bit of all the wrong things about this movie that left me totally disappointed. It's a movie about Aliens battling it out against Predators! Who could you screw that up? But don't let my comment stop you from showing this to the kids. They may be the ones who'd enjoy it (anyway, it is PG-13 so why not?). It's pretty hard not to like a package that offers you two of your favorite film creatures facing-off, but it is easy to mention the bad things about this so-called ""film"" (in my opinion, it's on the wrong threshold between movies and video games). Bad acting and bad plotting. I am a fan of the ALIEN series, and I did like the two PREDATOR films, but AVP is still a total letdown, and for those who haven't seen a single ALIEN or PREDATOR film, it's still bad enough for you. In fact it may just get worse than it is.Rating: * out of 5.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Crossover if You Turn Your Brain Off,"A fun premise that's pretty dull in the first half, but lives up to its crossover potential in the second half with some pretty epic crossover alien & predator action. The lead character is also refreshingly competent for a horror protagonist (especially one in the early 2000s lol). I also like the nuance of the surviving human and predator teaming up to fight the Alien Queen. Pretty cool setup, not gonna lie. It's not amazing, but it's a pretty fun guilty pleasure if you can overlook its shortcomings and accept it for what it is. But I can understand why fans were disappointed compared to what they could've had and what they already received in the spinoff comics that sparked this idea in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What you'd Expect,"This movie is exactly what you would expect it to be when putting it on: aliens fighting predators.

Good. But could have been better!,I did not expect much from this movie.I bought the AVP unrated 2 pack from my local HMV for blu-ray but to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would have!The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because the story of how it all started was explained way to fast and if the movie was a bit longer it would have been much better in my opinion. The only other problem I have is the acting. Some times i just didn't see the fear of being trapped in this pyramid.Over all I give this movie a 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fits in nicely.,"Alien Vs. Predator (AVP1) (2004) -I love the concept of this film. It was a great idea to bring these two iconic creatures together and it actually seemed to unite both stories very cleverly. The hunting element that the Predator brings is well represented, building upon what we found out about their trophy collecting behaviour in 'Predator 2' (1990) and the aliens being contained in one controllable area, as they have been in the other films is utilised properly too. In other words they keep it true to what we have already witnessed and make sure that things are explained and clear as to why we didn't find out about the aliens until Ripley's encounter over a hundred years later.While it is a simple storyline, it can't have been easy to come up with something that would showcase both of these excellent alien life forms without favouring one over the other and incorporating the human element as they did, so I have to praise the story creators and writers.I did kind of want the aliens to come out on top after the way that they were treated by the predators.In some ways it was more gross visually than any of the other films, but I like that they didn't go over the top with CGI.I personally still think that the rubber suits work far better than the computer created images anyway, they feel more realistic, but that may be a generational thing as it was what I was brought up on.It could perhaps have been improved with a slightly stronger cast. It almost felt as if they weren't prepared to put too much money towards acting costs in case it failed, but they all did well and I liked that they brought Lance Henriksen in to ground it within the existing universe and enable further stories to be created.Also Raoul Bova is hot.I'm actually looking forward to the 'Requiem'.829.75/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Credit Where It's Due,"The story is dumb. The characters are terrible. But, the action sequences (for the most part) are pretty fun to watch. Any time you see he Predators are on screen, you're guaranteed to have fun with that. However, it's by no means good. Mediocre, it is. I wish that Fox would've treated Aliens and Predators with some respect, and we got this. In the end, though, I really, really liked any parts with the Aliens and Predators fighting, so this mediocre mess gets a six. At least it's better than the sequel, I guess. Then again, that's like saying that getting the bubonic plague is better than getting ebola. Ugh.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too many unnecessary issues,"First of all, this movie satisfied my expectations as to the conflict predator/alien. Great special effects, the monsters are just as you would want them, really neat hand to hand combat between the two, but ...A number of things bothered me greatly.The first was in the 'sacrificial hall' where one of the sci guys immediately jumps to the conclusion of 'heart sacrificed' and is told that that is not where the heart is and bones turned outward blah blah. Full stop. You'd expect some kind of discussion at that point but sorry, they just leave it at that. I guess THEY didn't see the original alien movies ...Then the archaeological type reads all the symbols like they're a book in plain English.He warns to not take the predator shoulder rocket launcher type thingy; But not the first, no, not the second either. He doesn't utter his warning until the last one is taken. Oh, well.This is an odd bit, about the predator shoulder rocket launcher type thingy. It seems that is their primary weapon. Without it, a single alien whacks two out of the three predators in short order. Leaving those thingies down there for us mortals to completely screw up the whole plan of taking them once the predator apprentices get there is just plain stupid.Then nothing was more obvious than the last predator getting 'seeded'. Now, this last predator sees the gestating larvae in the human victims but in the end they take his seeded carcass without inspection? They have to, like, not look at him to miss the damn thing wiggling around his bronchial tube! And what happened to aliens not attacking seeded hosts?I am not going to mention that one of these predators would never ever ally himself (herself? Their are certainly bitchy enough!) with a human 'breeding tube' for their favorite prey. OK, so I did mention it.After all we saw about alien(s), do we really think going down in water is going to kill one of them? Especially the queen bitch? Schit, a whale will dive 5000 feet to hunt pussy (the octagonal kind) ...regards, Mac",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very entertaining, but too short and too many flaws...","AVP seems like a movie that was inspired by the comics and the computer-games by the same name, but whose script was ""edited"" to fit a more mainstream audience and taking some sidesteps to get around the horrid resurrection.As a sci-fi action flick, it was very entertaining. As the meeting of two story lines, it is found wanting. And 90 minutes, by today's standards, is a little short for a full-length motion picture, isn't it? Of course, nobody promised epic alien battles, but somehow I expected, well, more...Read the AvsP comics for the storyline that inspired the movie. I think they are, storywise, better.

It's not that bad.,"A piece of advice: Try to see it with an open mind.Many of the people who hate this film were planning on hating it well before it was released. Paul Anderson did a good job with this one. He has a very engaging visual style which really shined in Event Horizon, lagged in Resident Evil, but shines again here. The pacing is great, as Anderson understands the value of building up suspense and developing the story before truly unleashing the action. The acting in the beginning of the movie is a little rocky, but quickly improves once the plot gets rolling. In my humble opinion, AVP is quite exceptional, and will grow on audiences over time.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Celebrity Death Match,"The knives were out for AvP before a single frame of film was shot. The news that Paul W. Anderson was going to follow in the footsteps of Scott, Cameron, Fincher and Jeunet was met with disbelief in some of the more rabid corners of fanboydom. They needn't have worried though, their beloved xenomorphs have such a minor presence in AvP that it barely registers as an official part of the Alien cycle at all. Things actually start rather promisingly, with the intriguing premise that the Predators may actually be responsible for the first sparks of human development and civilization. This was touched upon in the first Predator movie (and lifted, of course, from 2001) but is expanded on here. In a piece of casting that suggests some intriguing plot twists (Which, needless to say, never materialise) Lance Henriksen plays Bishop Weyland, a billionaire industrialist whose spy satellites discover an ancient temple under the Antarctic icecaps. In opening sequences blatantly reminiscent of Jurassic Park he assembles a group of 'experts' to join him on an expedition. This long-ish introduction sets up the predictable, but enjoyable, scenario. Unfortunately they're a rather colourless gang with only Henriksen and Ewan Bremnar's Geoff-Goldblum-Alike having any spark about them. Once they reach the site of the temple both logic and interest begin to wilt somewhat. Why has nobody previously mentioned the whaling station which by amazing coincidence was built slap bang on the top of the site? Of course, the whole thing is a cunning Predator trap to breed new Xenomorphs for an intergalactic game of Battle Royale. It's giving nothing away to say that Anderson kills off his best characters far too early and leaves us with a very poor Ripley clone. The films real problem however is that it is actually a premise in search of a plot. This is real video game material but the film's wafer-thin storyline simply can't stretch even to a meager 90 minute running time. The title, too, is more accurate than you might imagine - those expecting huge swathes of aliens and legions of predators in some kind of Helm's Deep style kick-ass showdown are going to be sorely disappointed. Rarely do we get more than one of each species on screen at a time, which is probably why the movie isn't titled Aliens vs Predators, but feels like a con nonetheless. Anderson appears to believe that his trump card is the big Alien Queen/Predator/Ripley Clone showdown but he then completely flubs it with the most unspectacular of anti-climaxes and an alien queen who seems to have borrowed her motion capture from Jurassic Park's T-rex. Ultimately AvP provides such a poor use of both franchise's that one can almost forgive the slow decline into mediocrity that has previously blighted the Alien cycle.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Very underrated, but most of the criticism is true","This movie in my opinion is underrated, for the most part people say, ""not enough gore"" well, just look at what it's rated PG-13! If you want gore than just go to the sequel (which in my opinion is a bad idea because it starts where the first ends)People say the acting is horrible, well, actually, that's not much of what it sucks of. The acting was pretty good, actually, the actors really seemed to care for each other. But that brings me to the bad part, NO CHARACTERIZATION! So when somebody dies, the audience doesn't know enough about the person to really care that they're dead. Now onto the aliens and predators. The aliens in this movie are great. People say, ""they just go around killing"" actually, the need to harvest people, and the creators of the alien said ""they kill any threat"". Now onto the predators. One word: wow (sarcastic). The predators kill to live, in which a sense they did do in the beginning of the film, but then onwards it just got unrealistic.

AVP (Alien V Predator) is it a good film?,"AVP (Alien V Predator) has some brilliant monster design, great use of CGI and models which are all put to good use. AVP isn't that scary compared to the original films. It might scare a nine or ten year old but it does have a 12 rating. It does show all the monsters key traits, such as the Aliens ability to climb along walls and the Predators unique hunting weaponry. Whenever an Alien appears and something bad is about to happen the shot cuts away, this is frustrating. There is a lack of gore but loads of alien goo. The characters in this film aren't all that interesting, there are only 3 that really stand out. I found some of the characters annoying and the rest were just there to die. The story is good, set in 2004 on Earth a satellite passing over Antartica discovers heat signatures resembling a pyramid. Wayland Yutani, owner of the satellite, sets up a team to investigate. They soon find themselves locked in a battle against the Alien and Predator. I recommend this film, if you are interested in the franchise buy it, if you just want a good action I suggest you rent it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Third best in BOTH series, behind 'Aliens' & original 'Predators'.","I'm still scratching my head as to why folks didn't like this movie. It's got a great story, good cast, top-notch special effects and the action and fight scenes between the two infamous creatures is thrilling. It's definitely one you want to sit down with your kids and a pizza and enjoy it for what it is...a great sci-fi action flick, that will not make your top 5 of favorites of all time, but is definitely worth an evening in front of the tube. There are some unrealistic scenes, but we're talking about a movie where humans are unwittingly trapped between two alien species battling in a gillion year old pyramid under the Artic Ice Caps....were you expecting Lord of the Rings or Schindler's List? 
Anyway, this is one of the best examples of why you should ignore the whiners that thought this movie strayed too far off the original story of the aliens, or the critics that panned it for, well, whatever the so-called expert critics panned it for. The story does nothing to change the whole story of either species in the previous movies and is actually quite original. Sanaa Latham does good in the pragmatic and brave 'Ripley role' this time. Lance is great as a sick billionaire that can't wait to get down there and discover something that will change the history of humanity before he dies with cancer and Italian star Raoul Bova is great as another scientist that the team is glad that they brought along for the adventure. 
Watch the Director's Cut as it shows some more stuff that explains things a little better, about what happened to the first unfortunate souls that got caught in the crossfire of the two species.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good idea - but comic books did it better,"Scientists discover a structure under an Antarctic island and investigate. They find suggestions of Alien life form which seems to be blooming since the structure was opened to explore. Little do they know they have stumbled into a hunting ground for other coming-of-age aliens (well... Predators), who are there to get some skulls for trophies. Unwittingly the humans are caught in the middle of an Alien vs Predator conflict.The look and feel of the film is great. The action is great. The combination of Aliens and Predators works well and follows the source material pretty good. All in all so far, tick. The main issue I had with it was the stupidity of the humans and the average script the actors were working from. It seemed too cliché in places and almost cheesy. Saying that though, I didn't dislike the film for that, I actually enjoyed it. It could have had more blood, guts and horror in it - but audiences have changed and the rating system this film tried to achieve meant it had to be less gory that previous Alien or Predator films. I actually played the titular console game of this and it was hell of a lot more scary than this film. I think there were some opportunities in the film to make it better but they were missed and this also affects the pacing slightly - it takes a while to get to the action and then when we follow the humans it can be a little stop/start.One of the issues with this film I have found is the divided fan base. Fans of Alien films want this to be another Alien film. Likewise fans of the Predator films, want this to be another Predator film. Truth be told, it's neither and both at the same time. Watch this as a new film and it's a good action romp. Watch this with expectations of it being an out-and-out Alien or Predator film and you won't enjoy it.I give this 6 out of 10. Good, but not outstanding.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Okay, Could Have Been Better","This movie was okay, but it could have been much better.Let me start with the bad news:1. Predator Vision Should have used infrared (red & blue), not orange. Plus the was not much sound at all.2. Character Development Terrible. I felt like we only get to know 2 or 3 characters in the movie (Lex, Sebastian, Weyland). Since the movie was too fast, Anderson should have spent more time developing the other characters. I just got tired of seeing humans getting picked off and not knowing their name, motivation, etc.3. Killings As mentioned above, humans got picked off too quick. I wouldn't even know half their names if I had not read the book and the IMDb credits.4. Cinematography Camera was too quick.5. Score Sounded awful at key moments, like the first Predator death scene. Also, sounded really corny when Predator showed his face to Lex. I thought they were going to kiss or something.6. Fight Scenes Only like 2 or 3 Alien/Predator fight scenes. Since this is an AvP movie, there should have been a lot more. Maybe if he'd of stuck to 5 predators and didn't make them get killed so quick, then we would have more fight scenes.7. Contradictions In Alien 3, were learn that Aliens don't kill humans who are carrying alien embryo. We know the Predator is carrying one, but aliens try to kill it, and eventually do.Lex said that the cold could freeze you in 3 minutes. But she seemed to be out their with the Queen a lot longer than 3 minutes.8. Flat Out Ridiculous If Predators can see aliens inside of humans, then why the f*ck would they bring a dead predator on board their mothership when he has an alien inside it?If the water is frozen, then how the heck can the Queen drown so deep?Now the good news:1. Plot Thought it was decent and interesting. Could have been better if the movie was longer to allow the tension to build up.2. Shifting Pyramids The claustrophobia adds to the suspense. But again, the movie was just too short. They could have extended it. For instance, when Verheiden and Miller were trapped, Verheiden should of at least killed some of those aliens.But here is the kicker. Despite the disappointment that this film was, the audience actually clapped at the end. I am not kidding, no one walked out like I hear others did in other theaters. The question is, were they clapping because they were entertained or were they clapping because it was finally over?In conclusion, Anderson sucks, f*ck you Fox for ruining my summer and 14 years of anticipation, but it was okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oooh! Acid-Blood Here! Acid-Blood There! Acid-Blood! Acid-Blood! Everywhere!,"*Possible Spoilers!*Have you ever noticed that the bigger the budgets have gotten for these tiresome Alien movies the worse and more convoluted their story-lines have become?And, if you, yourself, haven't grown totally sick and tired of the whole rehashing of the Alien story - Well, I certainly have.I don't know about you, but, I now find that this once hideous-looking creature's image has become so familiar that it no longer has the ability to generate any awe or fright, whatsoever. It only looks stupid, almost laughable, with its excessive drooling, its mouthful of projectile teeth, and its watermelon-shaped head that appears to be without any eyes. (Like, how does this creature actually see what it's doing?)And, speaking about stupid-looking (and, I do mean ""STUPID!"") - When the dread-lock headed predator removed its helmet I know that I was supposed to be aghast with horror at the sight of its intended ugliness - But, when the big moment of unveiling came, I, literally, burst out laughing at this wheezing, pig-faced, prong-toothed bozo. I really did.And, to add insult to injury here - Wasn't it awfully clever and cute how Pepsi-Cola managed to make its underhanded, little product-plug in this terrible excuse for an Alien movie-sequel? Yep. I thought that it was pretty damn low and completely humorless that a frickin' Pepsi-Cola bottle-cap turned out to be the great, all-important find discovered at an archaeological dig amongst some ancient ruins in Mexico.And, yeah, it was bad enough that this blasted bottle-cap made one appearance in this movie, but, it actually showed up 3 more times. It was all because the dude who initially uncovered this precious (?) item kept it on himself as some sort of a lucky charm, making certain to pull it out and clutch it possessively whenever the going got rough.Ho-Hum!Anyways - I've just about said all that I want to say about this tres disappointing Sci-Fi blunder, except to add that I thought actor Lance Erickson, as the Weyland character, looked like death warmed over. In fact, his ravaged face was 10 times more frightening to behold than either that of the Alien's or the Predator's.And, finally - Let's face it - The mousy, little Sanaa Lathan, as the heroic ""Lex"" Woods character, certainly turned out to be a mighty poor replacement for the overbearing and aggressive Ripley character who had appeared in the original Alien pictures.How the hell Woods managed to actually befriend the ferocious Predator creature was truly ridiculous beyond words. By the end of the movie I was half-expecting these 2 bosom-buddies to join hands and go merrily skipping down the set's darkened corridors together, so pleased with themselves in their happy, little bond of brotherly/sisterly love.All-in-all - It would be an understatement to say that AVP's screenplay could've been a whole lot better - But, with that said, it certainly couldn't have been much worse considering its big-bucks budget and the apparent combined talents of the production team who were there in the driver's seat, making all of the important decisions.Yep.

"Great comic tie-in, lousy Alien film.","Its difficult to review this movie, you don't really know what it is, another Alien movie? or a comic tie-in? if its the latter then it fairs well enough after a slow start it serves up the action in high doses(albeit slightly bloodlessly, in the interests of a kiddie friendly rating presumably). there's nothing revolutionary here, the creature effects are of course improved but not supremely so, it merely reflects the improvement in FX technology over the years, and these new and improved creatures are largely wasted in the hands of a mediocre talent like Anderson. And this is the problem, the movie would stand alone fine if it was not for the huge weight of expectation that has crushed every alien movie since Aliens, there are visual ques and references to Alien here and there but they serve to remind you of what your missing rather than tying the whole franchise together. (forgive me for concentrating overly on the alien aspect rather than Predator, i was never a fan of the latter and have only watched those movies once or twice when they were on TV)unfortunately this franchise is a victim of its own success, the 1 st movies were genuine works of genius, from 2 very gifted but very different auteurs, the perfectionists attention to detail and application of Lucas's ""used Universe"" of Scott's Alien stands as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, and when the grandiose kinetic technophile Cameron came on board he wisely shifted the direction of the movie and delivered the only truly satisfying sequel, he made an original work that did not try to be an homage to 1st film.its a little sad that Alien movies, like star trek movies, have become forgettable multiplex fodder and nothing more, which brings us to AVP i saw it 2 days ago and can barely remember a thing about it, though i do remember thinking ""this isn't that bad"" while i was watching it.all i can think of to say is if your under 25, or you liked the comics A lot! then this is for you and you won't be disappointed, but if like me your a fan of the original movies then its maybe worth giving this a miss and re-watch the 1st 2 instead, it will make for a far more enjoyable time.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
wow...

(It should be noted that others share the shame in the writing credits.) This plot would be cheesy even in a video-game... and its not the story from the AVP comic that green-lit this movie! Just putting familiar props in the background does not capture the essence of the source material. I wanted to see my favorite movie monsters back up on the screen, but not like this; as props in a by-the-numbers plot. I also find it odd how Paul W. S.

Not overdone,"Alien vs Predator was not overdone, which is the main point to its success to deliver a great movie, that involves crossover characters. It's the beginning of an franchise; the intro to an everlasting battle of superiority among species, Predators being the instigator by proving their worth as the universe greatest combatants and hunters. This is just a tip of episodes explain thru the comics; looking back at Predator 2, when Danny Glover entered the Predator ship he noticed skulls, behind a glass like case, from different creators across the universe including an human skull and an Alien skull. This is something already in the works since then, it makes sense; instead of senseless killing- it shows the history and elite tactics that Predators use to hunt their foe who are of great intelligence and instinct whether human or alien or whatever else in the universe they may find. It is a well done movie in which movie goers can look forward to a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A noble attempt,"Overall, it was about what I expected. Action-packed, little character development (from the humans that is), and a high enough body count to keep the fans happy. Non-fans will not enjoy it much, but they should know to stay away. A few scenes are laughable (not in a good way) but it should satisfy the viewers. PG-13 wasn't the way to go--it looks like a pale attempt to draw in families or teenagers.There were a number of characters that had some potential, but the vast majority of humans didn't last long. When are producers going to realize that people need to have an emotional connection to the characters or we don't care when they die or are in pain, etc. I understand that the Aliens and Predators are the central characters but they are one-dimensional, we need more from the humans. Hopefully, a high-level director will want to take over either franchise. It can give some much needed life into the series.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Incredible! Anderson does extremely well...,"to completely omit any suspense, intelligence or excitement from combining two of the adult franchises with the highest longevity value.First things first, Alien, brilliant. Aliens and Predator, great, Aliens 3, better than it was given credit for. Admittedly Predator 2 was a bit poor, and Alien 4 was... well... tits. While an AvP movie was probably long overdue, the franchises were a little bit weak at the knees and needed a bit of a revitalisation. A film that captured the suspense and aggression of Alien, Aliens and Predator combined could be memorable if even half done correctly.Step forward Paul WS Anderson. I liked Event Horizon (probably because Fishburne, Neill and Pertwee were eye-catching), but lets face it his other movies are tripe.There is an awful lot wrong with this film, and to be honest, you could tell exactly what they would be when you saw who was in charge of the project. Contrived dialogue, rushed scenes, bad editing, bad acting, desperately unengaging lambs-to-the-slaughter characters who are capable of collectively superhuman perception and insight (mainly for plot development) and also astonishing stupidity at the same time, a terrible premise, shotgun character development (many scenes have only a handful of quasi-emotive lines batted back and forth with questionable effect) and a total lack of any realism whatsoever. The predators are somehow irritating (you can imagine them being voiced by Chris Tucker if PWSA gets the sequel), they now have the strength to boot people through the air, and can also diagnose heart defects, while the aliens gestate instantly and are fully grown within around 4 minutes. Both creatures have also abandoned the simple virtues that made the first films so great.Potentially, we could have had a study of two different types of hunter, one with limited scruples, the other with none. Instead it's like a video game, lurching from one 'cool' use of a weapon to another. In fact, you get the feeling that Anderson used the game for reference material, rather than the original films or comics or anything.If they did the same with Alien and Predator that they did with Batman, i.e. shelve the turkeys and get someone competent in charge, hopefully they could erase the memory of this rubbish",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Much Better Than Expected *phew* (Careful, refers to a specific part of the film)","I'm a huge Alien fan (with the obvious tag-lines ""seen all the films, many times"") and I was nothing short of euphoric when I heard that the Alien saga would be extended with AvP. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I feared that it would only be a low quality spin-off with a lot of action with no brains behind it. Fortunately, Mr. Anderson gave a work of art to the fans on both sides and provided an interesting story behind the action we see in the film. So, now we see the cons. I have two main criticisms for this movie. Firstly, a technical mistake in the incubation period of an Alien. When the first Alien comes out of 'Adele' the other members of the group who were attacked by face-huggers at the same time as she was still have it stuck on their faces. Now, as I know it the fecundation period of an Alien has four main phases 1) the face hugger infects its victim 2) the face hugger dies when the fecundation is complete 3) the victim awakens 4) the young Alien comes out a few hours after the victim awakens. In the film, the time lapse between phase 3 and 4 is practically inexistent (app. 43 seconds). Secondly, as a fan, I felt that the film was too short. If the director expected this film to be an epic he should have tried to produce more than 101 minutes of runtime. But, as I said the second point comes from a fan's greed for more. Mr. Anderson wisely preferred quality instead of quantity, but both would have been great in my opinion. To conclude, I would give this film a 9 or a 10 rating because I got what I wanted after all these years of waiting. If you want to comment on my review be free to do so at the e-mail which you should find with this rundown.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film is as pathetic as it is insulting,"This film is as pathetic as it is insulting. Way to kill two franchises at once, huh? This was to put it bluntly a waste of a time. I wasn't even mildly entertained. No atmosphere, no tension, and no intelligence -- just dumb (And I do mean dumb) half-assed action that plays more like a video game and doesn't deserve the title Alien vs. Predator. I know this is a popular thing to do bashing this director and all but in this case he deserves it. Paul W. S Andersen, why is this film so bad? Why can't you for once in your career make a meaningful movie, with say meaningful characters? I challenge you Paul, a decent film is all I want.

"Not as bad as I remember, but still quite a stinker","Lacking any intelligence or tension held from previous entries, Alien vs. Predator is mostly a full on dud, with a handful of interesting moments. There are a lot of problems I have with this film, starting with of course the fact that the aliens are somehow on Earth despite not being discovered for like another 100 years or so. Like I get that they could have been here before, but it just feels so forced and illogical- it's hard to ignore. The action scenes are cut down tremendously in this entry as well, because for whatever reason Fox thought it would be a good idea to give a PG-13 rating to a spinoff of 2 R-rated franchises. Never before was there a PG-13 entry, and never thereafter- so the only question that prompts me is why? It's not worth it either, less violence just led them to try and gross out the film as much as possible. I don't think anyone in existence ever thought these films needed more slime or watching the birthing process for the aliens- I mean seriously? You took all the charm out of these ideas! That all being said, the beginning wasn't half bad- ironically though neither the alien or the predator play a part in that. Sure the setup is generic and predictable but at least it was entertaining and it provided enough to prove to be more than just filler- although ultimately that's what these characters became anyway. The special effects are really well done for the most part, and i'm honestly impressed at the technical achievements this film could manage in 2004- when things come out today that don't look half as good. It has some interesting concepts and worldbuilding here and there, but ultimately it just seems rather forgettable and a rather jagged missed opportunity. In the end, Alien vs. Predator suffers from poor execution and lack of what made these films great in the first place. The magic is lost, please let these poor creatures rest.My Rating: 3.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Reasonable, but great for kids","If you like action and thriller movies, I'd consider this worth the money. Its one of those movies that are probably better seen in a theater unless you have a state-of-the-art theater system at home because of its special affects. I don't recommend going there with expectations it'll knock the pants off any of the former Predator or Alien movies. Its more-or-less what you'd expect if you've seen the others. If you go there just to enjoy it, then I'm sure you will. I enjoyed it, and its pretty much average with other action/thriller/sci-fi movies I've seen.The female, the chemical engineer, Italian archaeologist and the business owner (forgot their names, so forgive me) play their parts well. All the rest seem to be unimportant to the plot of the movie and more extras than characters. It perhaps would be nice to develop their characters more so we could feel sorry for them when they are killed. :-)I think its a good movie for kids, not only because it'll probably be more exciting to kids who haven't seen this sort of thing too often, but because I could tell kids enjoyed it by what they said with each other when leaving the theater. For adrenalin junkies that have seen a lot of movies like the Alien and Predator movies, it probably won't be too shocking, but might keep you entertained. I don't really think its necessary to have seen Alien or Predator movies prior to seeing this one, but it might enhance your understanding a little, or alternately might spoil it a little... Depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a movie to portray a battle between alien and predator in the way you'd expect, than you probably won't be disappointed.I agree with the previous reviewer that it took too long to get to the action, but it does serve the purpose of making people relaxed before the carnage starts, which might get their hearts going. Unfortunately, they could have developed this a little more and made the transition a little more pronounced, so it'd be like having someone blowing a horn in your face while you are meditating. They gave us a little too much warning. Adrenalin junkies might find a new roller coaster more scary and startling.I think the supposed history of the Predator race and human civilization is plausible and interesting if you ignore that the scientific knowledge and puzzle solving skills of most of the characters in the movie seems to be contradictory -- sometimes brilliant, sometimes pathetic, sometimes wrong (like with the Mayan long count) or insulting our intelligence (like with the aurora). That's about all I can say without spoiling parts of the movie. I recommend not to pay too much attention to the scientific background of the movie, and simply enjoy the action. Another reason its probably better for kids who won't over-analyze the sketchy scientific and archaeological background.So anyway, I think you'll enjoy it, but keep your expectations to the level of remembering you are going to see a combined sequel of two series that already have sequels and that there were already video games on this theme.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good action movie,"I really liked this movie. I thought the action scenes were excellent, and that the creatures looked amazing. One thing I hate is when filmmakers overdo it with CGI effects, as well as when you can actually tell the CGI effects from the rest of the film, and, in AVP, all the creatures looked very organic. I also loved the references to the original movies.As for the actors, Sanaa Lathan rocks in every movie she makes, and makes for a terrific action heroine. Ewen Bremner was very good as the chemical engineer, and you really sympathized with the guy. The rest of the actors were not given much to do, but they did well with the screenplay.Overall, a fun movie. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a Tiresome Spectacle,"OK. We've got these two movie entities: Aliens and Predators. What would happen if they faced off against each other. This sounds like something Cliff Klaven and Norm Peterson would discuss as they swilled beers at Cheers. A bunch of rich guys decide it is necessary to investigate some heat coming out of the ground in Antarctica. They spend a whole bunch of money to see what's there. They also hand pick a group of disparate characters to investigate. It is the usual assemblage of clashing personalities. They are also terribly short sighted and pretty incompetent. Of course, once the Aliens and Predators arrive on the scene, the humans become things to be killed. Those bad boys begin to do their things based on their particular properties and then...it's over, I guess.

Actually very good...,"I eagerly anticipated this movie long before i can remember, being a big Alien fan. And though my expectations of the movie must of helped (being incredibly low), i really enjoyed it. I think the first three quarters of the movie are superb, the plot is functional, the look and feel of the film is awesome, despite the lack of development i liked the characters, and, the action is mostly superb.I'm not a big fan of the certificate the movie received though, it's almost liked it's been dumbed down for kids and despite Paul Anderson saying it isn't bloodless, it certainly isn't as bloody as the previous films. I thought the team-up was a b*llocks idea, and could potentially have destroyed the movie, yet it is done pretty well despite being annoying.I've gotta congratulate Harold Kloser on delivering one of the best scores throughout the seven films, it's both elegant and rousing.

Great film! ....not,"After successfully messing up film versions of both Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, Paul W.S. Anderson has been hired to helm another project that should really make itself; Alien vs. Predator. The mind boggles, it really does. How this man continues to get work is anyone's guess - I don't doubt that his films make money, but surely the powers that be would be far better off hiring a director that knows what they're doing. Projects like this one and Anderson's video game movies were always going to make a profit anyway, so I cant understand why the studios don't hire someone good. Anyway, as the title suggests; AvP finally sees two of cinemas most menacing creatures face off! As a big fan of all the Alien and Predator films (with the exception of Alien 3, for obvious reasons), I was very much looking forward to this movie, even though my expectations were low, and alas; it didn't even meet my low expectations. I was expecting at the least to be entertained by a little bit of alien fighting; and although the movie has that and it's not boring; it also has lots of trite and dull moments and on the whole this film is one gigantic failure.The plot isn't very original, but at least it gives the film the basis for an intriguing set-up. It preaches that the Predator's are coming to Earth on a hunting trip and, as they are the ultimate prey, they've re-animated a bunch of Aliens to fight with. The 'fun' doesn't end there, however, as a bunch of researchers are on the Predator's patch after discovering their hunting ground under the ice in Antarctica. This isn't a bad plot; it's not particularly intelligent, it's very simple and, as mentioned, it's unoriginal; but still. However, Anderson still manages to mess up even this plot with an awful 'revelation' part way through, a very trite and dull first half and an ending that is an absolutely huge cop-out, and doesn't do justice to the series' that spawned it. It's almost like Anderson got most of the movie completed, and then just decided to get the movie over with quickly. Maybe his dinner was ready or he just got offered another franchise to mess up, I don't know. Aside from all the stuff mentioned, though, the most annoying thing about the movie is the terrible characters and the even worse script that they had to work from. Quite why Lance Henriksen accepted this movie is anyone's guess, I know that he probably wanted his paycheck, but man, where's the self respect? Anyway, this movie isn't recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining at best.,"Let's get something straight, the acting in this movie is not bad. It's horrible. One exception though, Lance Henriksen. Too bad he could not save the movie.I'm not a fan of director Paul Anderson. Not at all. But he has made one movie that's scary and amazing: ""Event Horizon"", an amazing scifi/horror. If you haven't seen it, check it out as soon as you can. Anderson's work on ""Alien vs Predator"" is good but not as good as an Alien/Predator film deserves to be. With an R rating a better cast, who knows how good this movie could have been.The film has many flaws. Worst of all: No gore! What were they thinking? You put together two of the greatest monsters in filmhistory, both featuring in r-rated franchises and you just throw that overboard for an pg-13 rating. Damn you 20th Century Fox. This is not only a disappointment but also a huge slap in the face for the fans.The female lead of the film is weak. Especially when you're used to the awesomeness of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley. What they should have done is take a actor or actress from the previous films, maybe Weaver or Schwarzenegger and put them in between the two monsters. True, the movie is not about the humans, it's about the Alien and Predator kicking each others butt, but still.On the positive side: the creatures look good, thank God.

About as bad as I feared.,"Well sir, I don't like it. This may, MAY contain a possible spoiler, so that's why I have a warning up here... not that it really matters, as there really isn't a damn thing in this film that's redeemable.I'll make it easy, here are the good points: -Decent looking aliens. -Some very mild violence, some fairly interesting fight scenes. -None of Paul Anderson's bloody techno music.Didn't hurt it, didn't help it:-Very standard 3-D Animation.-Nothing new about the Aliens.-People die.-Decent special effects--no better than ""Aliens,"" although sometimes they seem ""not as good."" -Mildly interesting story--but--The BAD: ---the story lists 3 ancient civilizations, including the Aztec--claiming they built the pyramids in Mexico, when in fact, those structures were built by the MAYA, and the Aztec simply took over many, many years after the Maya disappeared.-Story is loosely explained, as if it was made for a child to follow fairly well, and think is ""cool.""-Story centers on an archeaological expedition to Antarctica--a land with no native human population to fear--what's with all the machine guns and assault weapons?? (Note: I was watching my kid run around screaming, so if it was mentioned & I missed it, it wasn't decently explained it would seem)-Crappy acting.-Uninteresting, uninspired characters with no depth--when they die, you just don't care.-Use of, God help us, Bullettime during a scene with face-huggers. Yes, Hollywood's cheapest trend badgered it's way into the Alien/Predator franchises.-Dialogue apparently ceases after the first third of the film.And the Ugly Nasties:-Yup, it's PG-13--and I watched the so-called ""Unrated"" extended version--it's still harmless, PG-13, kiddie trite.-Use of the ""F-Word"" a whopping one time.-18 ounces of human blood, no human-related gore whatsoever, and that means---NO CHEST-BURSTING &-NO STRUNG-UP, STRIPPED AND MUTILATED HUMAN CORPSES, A LA ""PREDATOR""-Several Predators suddenly seem to be 9 feet tall for no reason.-The Alien Queen is also grossly over-sized.-The intelligence of the Aliens, which we witnessed in all prior films, is now relegated to that of ""really smart jungle cats.""-More than once, a weapon is pierced into an Alien--and the acid blood queerly causes it no harm.-An insult to those of us that are adults and grew up with the Alien and Predator franchises, despite the relatively crappy Alien: Resurrection and Predator 2--at least they were still R-Rated.-Remember that horror-film hint you get from previous films, where everything was introduced gradually to build tension? None of that here. -Face huggers have suddenly gone from spending a couple days on someone's face to a mere couple minutes.-Young Aliens are born in a couple ""hours"" rather than a couple ""days.""-Young Aliens become adults, apparently, if you blink more than once while looking at them.-Little story continuity--people get separated constantly, but you're never quite sure how, or for that matter, where they are, and then they die--but you never liked any of them anyway.-Lead female character will set back Women's Lib about 20 years with her dullness and occasional incompetence--she's unlikable.-Predator - human alliance? No thanks.-Several Predators seem infinitely strong, while Alien numbers seem to grow unchecked--and unexplained--there weren't nearly enough humans around to make all these adult Aliens.The one surprise I didn't mind:-Predalien--although, it's host was stabbed through the torso, and thus, the creature should have died...I watched this movie for free (checked out from a Library) and if you're interested in it, I suggest you do the same, it's really not worth paying for.

However, I must say that there is a paradox for directors and writers when converting and abridging such a deeply complex series into a two hour movie. I've also seen this with the other series' I've read that were turned into movies. Like Harry Potter and sorts. I think the only director I've seen effectively do a book justice is Peter Jackson with LOTR, and that was largely to do with the fact that, in addition to being a very gifted director, he being given a blank check by New Line (only to be screwed later by them), and making a very long movie so he could fit in most of what Tolkien had originally written. Yet I have had to learn and except that most of the time that movies that are converted from beloved books and comics are not going to be close to what we envision when we read them.

I have seen the reviews and this film has been completely slammed. Well, I enjoyed the directors previous work. Resident Evil, Soldier, Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon. He has some pedigree and even though these films did not meet the critics approval, they met with the approval of the public, and to be quite honest, that is all that counts. Go watch this film as it deserves a sequel. If you thought Freddy V Jason was worth it! You ain't seen nothing yet!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lazy,"How many situations can you invent as an excuse for wringing very last drop of blood from an audience, or an alien for that matter? This is scraping the barrel really, with a rather flimsy plot to explain why aliens and predators might be brought together.Watching it the first time, I was mildly entertained and curious to see how things would turn out. There is an element of intrigue, especially if you're familiar with aliens and predators battling Ripley or Arnie. Clearly all the sequels to those originals were flawed, cynical and lazy attempts to prolong the life of an ageing cash cow.Frankly the only reason I bothered watching this all the way through a second time was Sanaa Lathan, who is one of the more attractive monster bashers and is pleasing to watch, although she fails to get her kit completely off even when splashed with acid blood - shame.As impressive as the effects are, the story is weak and the acting pretty much non-existent. Should have been a much better movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film. I was proven wrong.,"I have been a fan of both franchise since I was first introduced to them. I have always followed the plans for them to make a film pitting the 2 against each other. I have the books and the games. When I first heard of this film, I was upset. I thought it was gonna suck. I didn't agree with what direction paul anderson was gonna take these franchises.I was proven wrong. This film was excellent. I loved it. It was full of action and it was a wild ride from start to finish. He put the stories together perfectly. I admit, I would have rather seen more fighting, but other then that, It was a great film. Never in my life did I think they could pull it off, but now, anything is possible.I hope for a Sequel someday that will be even better then this. 5 out of 5 stars, I applaud Paul Anderson.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This should get you to see this film!,"Considering its ""PG-13"" rating, this movie is surprisingly very good!  Being that the previous ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" movies(""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Alien3"", ""Alien: Resurrection"", ""Predator"", ""Predator 2"") were all rated ""R"", I thought that this movie wouldn't stand up to its predecessors with the ""softer"" rating!  I was wrong!  I believe that you have to have seen at least a few of the other movies of both creatures in order to truly appreciate this one(just like ""Freddy vs. Jason"")! This movie is packed with the action that only these two beings can generate!  The best way to enjoy this movie is to pick a side, ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" and see if you're happy with your choice at the end!  No matter who you choose, you will enjoy the battle! A must see movie for fans of the two creatures!  You will not be disappointed, trust me!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A lukewarm sci-fi film and a big disappointment to alien and Predator fans,"Sigh................when i saw this movie for the first time, i was blown away, how, how could they possibly screw up a movie as bad as they did. I was speechless, any plot that the movie was supposed to have they threw right out the window. I mean, WHAT the hell were they thinking using the kind of storyline that they did. There was no depth to it, and they simply crammed it in there because they had to. It was pointless, except for explaining why the aliens were hunted.The first mistake they made was. hiring Paul W.S Andersmuck, sorry, Anderscum, argh, Anderson. He is the director from those, thoughtless, awful, and pointless resident evil movies. That boy has no idea how to make a good sci-fi movies, and focuses WAY to much on the visuals instead of story.their second mistake was the cast besides Sanaa Lathan (who i thought kicked butt) the rest of the actors were just out of place in the whole thing, saying stupid pointless things, making stupid decisions, and just being complete idiots.Mistake number three was the predators. Come ON people!!!! They were AWFUL!! compared to the original predators, they were kittens! and......and LOL! HAHAHA!! they were Teenagers! There is NO WAY that the original ones would have given a second thought to having a human ""Side Kick"", or saving its life for that matter. There is a scene in the movie where i thought that they were going to kiss! They lacked the ferocity that they had in the previous movies, and their independence. They were always only on the ""half-alert"", and many times they were ambushed by aliens, and surprised by people! Anderson made them into the prey by the end of the movie! The aliens were tolerable, except that they were brainless a lot of the time. Which clearly insulted the aliens in the first two alien movies. I will give him this though, some of the fight scenes in the movie were pretty well done, and the visuals spectacular. Somebody who has never seen the original Alien and Predator movies may find this movie somewhat entertaining. This movie is not all bad. There is some impressive stuff that has to do with visuals and violence. But that is ALL. To those who have seen the original Alien and Predator movies, I would highly suggest that you stay away from this movie. The storyline, the actions and nature of the predators, and the dialogue is a huge kick in the groin to the other movies. It will insult your intelligence. If you have seen the original movies and liked this one................well...........what the heck, it takes all kinds.A disappointing, very poorly directed film at the maximum, and a huge bucket of water thrown on the flames of the Alien-Predator legacies.Ĕ¥Ё Дм ₤ệğəŋđ",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just No,"Sadly just a way too simple structure with not much happening between the force in reality. Also the lack of dialogues for most of the movie limits the interest in a great way. There is some good action sequences with interesting sound effects, but that's pretty much it. The sum of things is clearly not better than each of the parts here.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as bad as some people think.,"I took the chance and watched this film; mind you I was somewhat apprehensive from all I had read about it. I should know by now not too take too much notice because everyone is different in their views. Like I was with mine and I didn't think Alien V Predator was all that bad. It had pretty good GCI effects and the storyline was sensible which kept me interested. The characters were all fairly decent, and I thought it was a nice touch to have Lance Henriksen cast. I do like him as an actor.The film starts off with a group of expertise professionals investigating an unknown construction (pyramid) located in Antarctica. The only problem, it's about 200 ft below the surface. The situation becomes quite interesting when the aliens and predators start to appear. As I said, ""not a bad effort"", I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
In a Time When Sci-Fi Action is Plagued With Overt Religious Symbolism and Wire-Fu...,"It's refreshing to see a straight forward science fiction action flick. The Plot: Predators use humans to breed Aliens for a hunting ritual in an ancient pyramid. Simple. The twist: the humans take the Predator's guns, thus leaving them ill equipped to fight the Aliens. And the Aliens are pretty mad about their imprisonment and slaughter and are looking to tip the scales. But why should we care about a couple monsters slugging it out? Because there are still people in the pyramid and if the Predators all fall, then nothing will stop the Aliens from killing them and moving on to the rest of earth.With the dark and haunting atmosphere, chaotic combat scenes, believable characters, and the realistic special effects; Alien vs. Predator is the perfect movie for a Saturday night or whenever you want a cool action movie with a plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
got a few things to say,"i like this site, lets me no bout movies before watching them so then from there i can review and rate for my self and compare but the things people have been saying about AVP is o its so bad and disappointing i like it i thought it wasn't the greatest acting or that the main hero was a ""chick"" anyway everyone that thinks its a bad movie think what u want say what u want but u should be happy we got to at least see a predator in 04 last time we saw one was 16yrs ago so i also liked th fact that they showed so new gear,helmets,wrist blades, and smartdiscs, so i say deal wit it watch it and take it for what it is i thought it was good and its pretty dam good on home theater system too so if u got a system I'm telling u pick this movie up and put your volume up loud, thats all for now,",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Doesn't come close to Alien or Predator,"Where do I begin? The plot is obviously told by the characters, but the dialog is so bad that you get bored and disconnected from the movie before the action even begins. But when the action actually does eventually come you totally forget there was a plot to the whole situation. I mean at one point in the movie I took out my slinky and was more entertained by it than the movie. So I waited for either Alien or A predator to enter the scene and was slightly not bored, then they left and I went back to slinky.But Sanaa Lathan, who played Alexa Woods the experienced guide(or in other words the main character) I am no means a fan of hers but even if you took her out, I wouldn't be able to decide who to put in to fit the script. Maybe Monkeys? It would be more entertaining.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
only good for fight sequences,"If you're going to watch this movie in hopes of seeing well developed characters or a great plot then AVP is probably not the movie you want to see. However, if you can get past that and want to watch great fight sequences between two bad-ass aliens this movie is for you! I do consider this movie to be better than Predator 2 because, unlike Predator 2, it portrays both alien species very accurately, and doesn't demean their abilities. Although I must admit I never start this movie from the beginning, I just skip to the part where the Predators come in so I can see two aliens kick the crap out of each other, but still unlike most other Predator movies this movies fight sequences are filmed and choreographed very well!! Although the human characters and storyline aren't treated with much respect, the aliens certainly are!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
As a major alien fan...,"... I was very, very disappointed. I could write a whole book on how awful it is, but I don't really feel like it so i'm gonna keep it simple.Awful storyline, bad acting, poor character development, awful dialogue, Way to fast paced, Inaccurate (Mr. Anderson claims to be an alien fan, yea it really shows *cough*), Generally poorly directed.ow wait, I do have a positive remark;Great FX, but it ends there.If I'm asked to describe the ""movie"" in one word;Rape.3/10 for the effort.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
It had potential but they hired Paul W.S. Anderson,"When I was a kid I only liked the action parts. Same holds true now that I've grown up.It's mostly a boring slog with uninteresting, annoying characters.The dialogue is atrocious.Unnecessary exposition.Lex, much like the movie itself, had potential and even some good moments but was only compelling for a short time.The kills are not satisfying.From a lore and writing perspective, there are so many things that don't make any sense.A lot of lines are obviously re-recorded.The Predator costumes aren't that convincing. Especially after Scar takes off his mask. Also, why did he roar at Lex?There's a lot of stock sound-effects.The quick cutting and shaky-cam is disgusting.The CGI is garbage.Some weapons are acid proof and some aren't? Give me something consistent!I HATE it when a sequel references its predecessors by quoting it in an unearned manner.I like the moments of visual storytelling.I like how Scar makes a weapon and shield out of the Alien corpse.The sets are cool.Some of the cinematography is nice.The practical effects are really well done.This is the only movie by Paul W. S. Anderson that's actually worth seeing. But that doesn't mean he isn't a hack because he is.The last good Predator movie was Predator. And the last good Alien movie was Aliens.

Ouch for Fox.,"I think the other user comments have pretty much said it all...so I'll keep this short.To those who are fans of the ""original three"" movies (Alien, Aliens, and Predator), this is how I would describe this movie: Imagine if you were given the job of directing and/or producing AVP...think all of the cool stuff you would do with it...Now, take everything out of your movie that could possibly bring the audience any feelings of excitement, suspense, or entertainment whatsoever.With a lot of hard work, and a little luck, your movie might then be as bad as this craptacular effort.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
It was OK,"This movie was simply OK. Maybe not the right director for the job. The movie had its moments but it could've had a lot more.It isn't Alien, Aliens, Predator, or Predator 2. But the movie is better then crap like Aliens 3 and Alien Resurrection two movies that destroyed a franchise, and two movies I don't even care to own in my library.This movie did move too fast for an hour and 40 minutes, I could have seen it at 2 an a half hours, being a better story, a longer time frame for things to occur, and more intense fighting with more Aliens and Predators.The Aliens were near flawless.The Predators didn't use their cloaking enough, in a situation where they need to prove their worth. They know the Alien species is a far more superior species.Yet the hunter in Predator used it all the time against Arnold and his rescue team.I know I waited a long time for this movie but I could have waited a little bit longer for it to be thought out a little more.The good news is that it wasn't so horrible that someone else can't pick it up and make it a huge blockbuster sequel with a big time director and a big time actor.As far as the timeline is concerned it is accurate as can be. The Weyland-Yutani company would still know about the Alien species through Alexa with her story, the Alien tail spear, the Predator spear, and come on you think they won't try to go after the Queen alien in the ice.Let's see a sequel on the Aliens home planet, or Predators home planet or some other worldly planet set just before Alien to describe the crashing of the ship. We all know that wasn't an Alien ship because that's not an Alien flying it. This is Ridley Scott's creature feature Alien prequel now throw in a human crash landing freighter with Hugh Jackman and you got a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Much better than it sounds.,"I loved Alien. I loved Predator. I was dragged to this movie. I thought it would be something akin to the Mummy battles Frankinstien. The writers did an excellent job of stitching such an unlikely plot together. Unfortunately that was where their creativity ended. Nothing new, nothing unusual. Low on blood and gore. No tension between the three sides. Good concept but too much time was necessary to make it possible to develop any characters or conflict. Special effects were good. What would a movie be without the overdone and boring explosion(s). One day soon they will make a movie with no characters and just show stuff being blown up.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Always Will Make Money,"Read reviews. What the director does do, and to some extent he said so himself, just make money. He explores scripts, movies or franchise movies if you will, that were already successful or at least in the public consciousness. These movies he does, and this one AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004), all will make money just on their merits alone. Just like if I was to make a King Kong vs Gozilla movie. I would bet you the bank that I would turn a profit. 
By picking an established ""character"" it then becomes how can I make 10 to 15 minutes of suspenseful scenes, albeit not Hitchcockian, and maybe 6 or 7 minutes of action (fighting between the Alien and Predator), so as not to raise the budget to high where the profit will be reduced. And, as in all of his films, almost all has achieved success. He makes movies, his words (and I am paraphrasing), that are not for the critics, this websites reviewers, but to make the majority of the audience happy, thus, having a profit and allowing future investors to allow him to direct because he is a ""profitable"" director, albeit with already proven "" stars"" or ""monsters"" or a universe set up. The directors highest rating for a movie, on rotten tomatoes, I think was 41%. Most of all the other movies were in the 20 to 33% range, yet some of them turned a profit, case and point. When you make movies that appeal to the lowest common denominator intellectually, well, it does a disservice to those with an intellect. But, as usual it's not about making a great, new, provocative movie, it is about (this director at least) making money. Now that's okay but you are making money, as I said before, on an already established ""franchise."" Too be a really great film maker one has to explore their own interior and make that movie or movies that have no previous formula, but only your own creativity. From idea to script to pre-production and so on and so on till the movie, your ""baby"", is completed. Then and only then will you truly be called a film maker.
Until then, money aside, you are part of the assembly line and not the stand alone artist.
Further, the people calling the ""monsters"" classic are way off base. When this movie , AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004) was made it was only 17 years removed from the first one and the creators didn't, at least I my opinion, think is was going to be anything more than one movie, much less a ""universe."" You need at least 25 years, in cars at least, and certain states at that, for something to be a classic.
So simmer with the classic thing.
Also, again the director knew what he had and that's why she (""The main character "") can stand around in the Antarctica without a hat or a coat and have a 118 pound woman survive where (in the original Predator) three guys (Blain, Dillon & Mac) who are taller and in some cases a better athlete (Weathers) than Arnold not come close to surviving. Oh, and they are specially trained for this. But that is the way of Hollywood. Try to shape society and stop the social ills even if the truth be told, that most pilots flying the aircraft's (stats by the government) are 95% male worldwide. 
The movie, as a movie, isn't a on the edge of your seat thriller or a turn away, I'm scared movie. The acting, agian, think budget, because these ""Joes"" are not Gielgud or Olivier. For that matter they are not Bill Duke or Carl Weathers.

Alien vs Predator,"This movie was well made. Well worth the money when I saw it in theaters for the first time. I mean the level of detail in the alien queen was amazing.

I mean the pyramid was cool and the level of detail. The look back during the time Egypt was around was cool. The soundtrack is very beautiful.

What happened here?,"Well, Paul W. Anderson just killed two of my favorite movie franchises in one foul swoop. I'm sure AVP looked good on paper or even sounded sweet in theory, but in the end it just doesn't match.There was so many continuity and plot problems, I'll just stick to the basics because there is a 1,000 word limit here. The plot was a bit of a stretch. Basically, Predators having been harvesting Aliens for centuries in a pyramid located in current Antartica. The Predators used humans as slaves and hosts for the Aliens, in which the Predators would hunt for skill every 100 years. Now, a group of scientists have discovered the pyramid as the Predators planned out, jump started the process too early and started an underground squabble with Aliens. Now, if Aliens have been the ultimate adversary for centuries, why were the Predators wasting their time with inferior humans in the previous two movies? And, since the Predators like to hunt, why are they harvesting Aliens and hunting them in a controlled environment?Too put in bluntly, this movies was WAY rushed. It is barely 90 minutes, and by the time the action starts it ends. The action scenes were the least bit dramatic, completely relying on unrealistic CGI sequences. Since when do 300lb+ Predator preform spin moves in mid-air like an Olympic ice skater? There was also no suspense factor which makes up most of the previous Alien movies. An Alien stalking a Predator is just not that suspenseful. The continuity with the Aliens was a debacle. The first human host had an Alien bust out of her rib cage in 5 minutes and the Alien was full grown in 10 minutes. The previous movies took hours. Another problem was the fact that there was more Aliens than hosts. The Predators didn't seem all that prepared either, with the majority of their weapons melting from the Aliens acid like blood. These invisible, stalking Predators that have been battling these Aliens for decades and can travel at the speed of light and create a weapon that's acid proof? But, if you're not really picky, the last 10 minutes put the bow on this beautiful gift. The last Predator puts their differences aside with humans and teams up with a woman to conquer the Queen Alien hand and hand with a Alien tail for a spear and an Alien head for a shield (don't ask.) The idea of it was bad enough and now seeing it will probably give me nightmares. After all is said and done, you treated to a glimpse of a possible sequel with a half Predator and half Alien creature sprouting out his gullet.What this movie needed was a better director, more plausible screenplay and a little bit more time put into to it. I would only recommend this film for die hard sci-fi action buffs.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great effects with horrid dialog and acting.,Only the true fans of the Alien (1st 2nd 3rd) and Predator (1st 2nd) franchise were upset with this movie. Paul W. S. Anderson almost sunk 2 franchises with this crappy PG-13 nonsense movie. The special effects are great and that's the only reason I gave it a 4. The acting is horrible and the dialog is even worse.

AVP: Alien vs. Predator,"If Paul WS Anderson had just taken a moment longer to look at the casting here, he might have had a decent property. A solid conflict between the ultimate ninja ""Predator"" and the ultimate killing machine from ""Alien"". Why didn't he? Instead, we find a truly C-list bunch of acting fodder exploring a temple wherein, aeons ago, these two titans of terror battled it out. On arrival in the sacrifice room, they inadvertently release some eggs, and some ""Predator"" creatures, and soon some of them are on the menu for both as a battle royal looms. The special effects are good, and the action elements work fine too. I even found myself taking sides - just not with the humans, who deserved every tortuous chewing, stabbing and nasty involuntary caesarians that they got. It's paced well, it looks eerie and sinister, and the ending is quite exciting - it's just a real shame the writing and the acting are really mediocre. Teed up for a sequel too - I can only hope it ups it's game for that!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun Sci-Fi film for fans of Alien and Predator,"I went out and saw this film with an open mind. I'm a huge fan of the Alien and Predator movies, and when I heard that the film was coming out I was ecstatic. I had no idea what to expect, because there have been so many Alien vs Predator stories floating about. The games, the books, the graphic novels...What I was presented with was an enjoyable movie that kept me entertained. Of course it had it's typical ""horror"" cliché's, as demonstrated by the penguin shuffling around the kitchen making the audience think it was a face-hugger. But that made it all the more fun. I absolutely loved the idea that the Predators used the Aliens for training. Paul Anderson done a fantastic job with the film.I've heard people complain about the film, but it's just another monster movie. It's like any monster movie. If you watch it just for fun, then you will enjoy it. I think the main mistake people made was that they were expecting a film that was like the game. As I mentioned earlier, Alien vs Predator has had a lot of different styles/plots. You can't just focus on one telling and call it the original idea. Paul Anderson has just made yet another story and style with his film.I give it a solid 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I loved the special effects, the storyline, the characters, and the way it ended! I really don't get all the poor reception this film received. This is just pure fun and a very entertaining action/horror film! The movie made you care about what happened to the characters, and made the leads very likable. It gave the aliens and the predators a backstory about where they came from, and how everything all started, which I really liked. I think the actors did a pretty good job of portraying their individual characters. The action was non stop and very intense, lots of slime and gore, and weapons being thrown left and right.

Alien Vs Predator Insult to Fans,"Many people like myself check the rumor mills and online for any news on movies like this. Being a Big Jason Vorhees fan who hated Jason X and loved the old character and liked Freddy some expected a lot from Jason Vs Freddy and it deliver. Being said I am a huge Predator Fan. The first predator movie is a classic to me. I like Aliens as well.The movie was made for one reason MONEY $$$$$.The plot of the movie was rushed and didn't make much sense. After seeing how good the predator hunts in the 1987 original I expect a lot from them and 2 out of 3 of them are killed within 3 minutes on the screen. The third one then teams up with the last human alive to battle and kill the aliens they breed for hunting. The characters have no good lines and are not memorable at all. The female lead is a horrible scaled down version of Signori Weaver's original character.The PG 13 rating will make Fox a lot of money, but it made me feel like I was watching a movie on TV and all the good stuff was edited out. Its like seeing your fav dirty comedy on TV and all the stuff is edited or voiced over and your feel incomplete.Besides the fact there really is no over the top Big Battle, they really isn't any long Fights between Aliens and Predators.There is a scene in the end when the woman is running from the Queen Alien that reminds me of Jurassic Park.I felt the woman and the Predator became friends too damn fast after the Predator killed off the rest of the group. I even thought they might of made the beast with two backs.This short movie jumped right into the pyramid and never left, and Fox did it again the Predator in this movie is like Jar Jar binks. It ruined the movie and hurt the franchise. If you want a good time Rent Predator (1987) or the original Alien. If you want to Spend $10 on a ticket and another $12 or soo on food and throw away $20 some bucks Check it out.I hated the movie, but did notice a few 11/12 year olds coming out saying it was ""cool"".

Skrew Hollywood Grub Grabbers,"This film is utter shite, Paul Anderson knows nothing of character development, plot, etc. he just knows how to direct a cheesy FX ridden turkey.....just look at almost all of his films- total garbage. This film probably should have never been made, at least in live-action it shouldn't. It just can't work, neither of them is scary anymore and even worse this film lacks what could've been it's ONLY minor saving grace (you know, keeping me from walking out of the theater)- relentless violence and gore. It's nothing more than a sterile, Disney-style version of an even far superior comic book series. Both franchises are dead, and neither should be resurrected (no, not even by Ridley Scott). Just like 50-something rockers shouldn't reform and tarnish a great bands legacy. Let's stop the raping. I, for one, thought Freddy VS Jason worked, for one reason- the films it was based on SUCKED, therefore it seemed to as more of a potent satire and spoof than a serious film. These Alien and Predator films however, did not deserve this tragedy.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awful, awful, awful movie. Short though.","My God, how this movie blows.If you have any fond memories of previous Alien installments (even the atrocious Resurrection) don't go see this movie. If you are more of a Predator fan, don't go see this movie. Even if you are a fan of the AvP computer game, don't go see it. Actually you should see this movie only if you are under 13 and suffering severe ADD so the only thing that keeps you calm is constant action, jumping, flashing, firing and shouting, preferably for not much longer than an hour.Which is precisely what this movie is - an extended computer game cut-scene with paper-thin characters who get killed off one by one in many boring ways including spears and alien tails, and mostly off-camera. There is some ""plot"", if you can call it that way, and it involves an ancient pyramid on the Antarctica which is used by Predators to hunt aliens for sport, and some humans who just happen to come by. We get introduced to this characters (human, that is) in the first few short expository scenes, and than they go to the pyramid to get slaughtered by whomever they come up first. Eighty minutes later film ends. With what's probably the stupidest ""shock"" ending of the 21st century.This movie is the perfect example how a short movie with constant action can also be incredibly boring. I was mildly interested by the introduction, then yawned through the rest of it. It felt like I was watching a movie on fast-forward, which is not so strange, since almost every rule set by previous alien and predator movies is broken so the action wouldn't stop accidentally and the characters could get - God forbid - some depth.Let me just give you an example what this movie expects are to buy - the gestation period of the alien is probably around 15 seconds, upon which he bursts from the abdomen and needs about 30 seconds more to achieve full growth. And predators are not that bad once you get to know them and kill some aliens in front of them. Blah.See this movie only if you have about 80 minutes to kill, you've just popped the last bubble on that bubble-wrap and EVERYTHING else is already taken from the video store, including Freddy got fingered.2/10, and only because I save the 1's for movies which make me physically attack my TV.P.S. Oh, I forgot to mention that Bishop is in this movie. Ya know, the android from Aliens? Gee, now you MUST see this one, don't you?",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected,"After reading several reviews for this movie, I decided to wait for the DVD release. All of the reviews that I had read were universally savage. After viewing, I must say that I found it to be a lot better movie than I expected. I am not alone in this assessment. I have talked with at least six other viewers ranging in age from 22 to 57 and we are all in agreement that this film got a bad rap. No it is not Alien or Aliens but then they were fresh and new when they debuted.It is hard to successfully continue a series with the same character. But I feel that this movie is a welcome addition to the Alien franchise and hopefully will do well enough on home video to justify further Alien movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty mediocre,"AVP takes some of the greatest movie monsters of all times and places them in a film that, at best, is completely mediocre. It's such a big shame since this could've been amazing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
