A touching romance and a gripping human drama,"Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in ""Mrs Brown"". ""The Young Victoria"" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria's natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford's attempt on Victoria's life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria's accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a ""Regency Order""; the Duchess's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a ""Danger! Major clich√© ahead!"" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in ""Moulin Rouge"").The main reason for the film's success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make ""The Young Victoria"" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Emily Blunt Shines as Queen Victoria,"Sometimes I'm glad that my grasp of English history is pathetically feeble. It makes movies like ""The Young Victoria"" much more suspenseful than they might otherwise be. I of course knew that Victoria reigned for a large part of the 19th century and that she died in 1901; I also knew that she was a renowned and powerful monarch. I didn't know much about her love life, and ""The Young Victoria"" filled that gap in my knowledge nicely.Emily Blunt plays Victoria with a distinctly modern edge of feminism which may feel a bit anachronistic to picky historian purists but which also works. After all, women like Victoria WERE the feminists of their time, forced into making their mark in what was largely a man's world by a man's terms. I'm convinced that Blunt is one of the most promising of today's young actors. She has tremendous presence on screen; while she's on it, you don't want to look anywhere else. That presence is somewhat wasted in this movie, because her biggest competition comes not from any other actors but from the period sets and costumes. But she gives this rather light and inconsequential film some substance by virtue of simply being in it.Rupert Friend plays Albert, the man Victoria eventually marries, while Paul Bettany plays her chief adviser and confidant, the man angling to get himself married to her for his own political gain. The cast of British regulars also includes Jim Broadbent, who gets crazier with every role he plays, Miranda Richardson, as Victoria's doormat of a mother, and, notable in a small role, Harriet Walter as Victoria's widowed aunt and the only person other than her eventual husband who gives her any advice that's worth a damn.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,History
"To be Blunt,  haha, Emily B does beautiful work in this lovely bit of historical drama","Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the ""regents"" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the ""right"" advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Better than I expected,"I went into this expecting not to like it; I figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest, and rather plodding and dull.It's actually far better than that, and I found myself really enjoying it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever after. Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact I found myself wishing I'd seen more of the story, and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point.Visually the film is stunning. The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top. The acting is top notch from everybody involved.In a word, it was great!",,Anonymous,History
"Victorian Rebel without a Cause, but a Crown","Greetings again from the darkness. Emily Blunt would have stolen The Devil Wears Prada if not for the queen of screen, Meryl Streep. Here she competes with no one and does a nice job of carrying the film based on the early years of Queen Victoria. If you are rusty on your British sovereign history, she ruled from 1837-1901.For 20 of these years, she was married to her true love, Prince Albert (played well by Rupert Friend). While the two meet as youngsters, the bond between them comes from their letters ... an early precursor to eHarmony?? We know Victoria mostly from royal portraits, so it's nice to see her as a rebellious youngster trying to learn the tricks of the trade, even while being manipulated like a pawn by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and her lover (Mark Strong). We get to see her tenacity blossom as she matures and literally grows into the monarchy.While Ms. Blunt's performance is strong, Julian Fellowes' writing is not at the level of his previous work in Gosford Park. We do get some of the same power plays, but it is missing the nuances of that much better film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A warm and moving love story, beautifully acted by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend","Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A love story that happens to be true.,"The Young Victoria (2009) directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e, is a love story between a young woman and a young man. What makes it an interesting movie is that the young woman happens to be the Queen of England. The love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert has been told many times. This particular account of their romance succeeds because of several factors. It has great production values, it has reasonable historical accuracy, and it has Emily Blunt as Victoria.The production values are what we expect from a BBC-style historical drama. It's impossible to deny the pleasure of watching actors wearing period costumes as they move through great English manor houses and castles.Experts in Victoriana point out lapses in historical details, but, as far as I can tell, the main historical aspects of the film are accurate. More importantly, the plot goes beyond politics to emphasize the stultifying atmosphere in which Victoria was raised. Until she reaches her majority, her life is ruled by her overbearing mother. The fact that Victoria survived this upbringing with her psyche more or less unscathed is a testament to her psychological resilience. This makes the story more than simply a historical drama.Emily Blunt is perfect as the young Victoria. Her attractive features are enhanced by her flawless, glowing complexion. She does, indeed, bear a likeness to portraits of Queen Victoria as a young woman, and she is as convincing in her role as Helen Mirren was as Queen Elizabeth II.This movie is worth seeing as a love story and as a study of the psychological attributes of a young woman whose circumstances have made her a queen. It will lose something on a small screen, but it's worth seeking out on DVD if unavailable in a theater.P.S. A special exhibition of art collected by, and portraying, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert will be shown at the Queen's Gallery in London through October 31, 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,History
England and history deserves better !,"This is a movie that deserves a better direction, specially a much better art direction. The history of the Queen Victoria is fascinating and deserves a better director and better casting. The role of King Leopold from Belgium was given to Thomas Kretschmann. Could this be given to a worst actor ?! Hard to believe how someone can be so least convincing. Some great actors nonetheless (Jim Broadbent, Mark Strong) save the movie and make it worth while but still, this important period of England and Europe history deserves a much better casting and directing. Stil a movie to see, maybe on DVD at home instead on a theather !",6.0,Anonymous,History
A fine period film and a wonderful love story,"I just came back from seeing The Young Victoria. What a beautiful movie! Despite some flaws, I think it's probably the strongest costume drama we've had since 2006's Amazing Grace, although unlike Amazing Grace I don't think it's going to become one of my favorites. Let me set out by stating my problem with the movie: the pacing (also a common criticism of AG, but one that I considered unfounded in that instance). A large portion of it consists of a flashback, and a very awkwardly set up flashback at that; however, even putting that sequence aside, the narrative structure is just odd. The various scenes and plot threads just seem to be cobbled together without any dramatic purpose. But then again, I caught myself thinking that this approach‚Äîwhile questionable artistically‚Äîmight better reflect real life than a more typical scriptwriting/editing job. The ending, too, doesn't feel particularly conclusive, but again this seems to be a conscious decision. Whether these things sink the movie or not is debatable, but they certainly distracted me.However, The Young Victoria is also one of the best, most human love stories I've seen on the screen in many years. If what it shows us is factual, Victoria and Albert were a couple who really loved each other in every sense of the word, in spite of each others' mistakes, and in spite of the political maneuvering going on around them. Their refreshingly chaste courtship makes the intimacy they achieve in marriage that much more beautiful and satisfying: many of the scenes during their honeymoon period are highly sensual without being explicitly sexual, and the whole presentation just reeks of taste and class. But their relationship isn't idealized, either. They fight rather bitterly at one point, but make up later. (This scene does go rather over-the-top when Victoria accuses Albert for walking over her simply because she's a woman‚Äîa comment that seemed a little too modern in a movie that otherwise sticks close to the values of its period.)Emily Blunt and Rupert Fiend do a beautiful job portraying this fascinating couple. Blunt manages to make Victoria a strong woman without falling into many of the standard Hollywood Strong Women clich√©s; again, she seems to be very much a woman of the period, but one with her own moral convictions. Friend's performance is similarly refreshing. Too often men in period movies are so charismatic and ""in control"" that they don't seem quite real; Friend's Albert, on the other hand, is timid, quiet, and has struggled with many of the same social inhibitions as Victoria. At the same time, he never comes across as a ninny. Kudos to them both!The rest of the cast is quite strong, with Paul Bettany, Miranda Richardson, Mark Strong, and Harriet Walter all giving laudable performances, but not star turns. This too is in keeping with the film: it is Victoria and Albert whom we are supposed to remember. The costumes and cinematography are simply gorgeous, and the soundtrack by Ilan Eshketi (whom people may know from Stardust) is going straight to the top of my wish-list.Recommended to all costume drama lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Prince Rupert,"Rupert Friend gives a performance, as Prince Albert, that lifts ""The Young Victoria"" to unexpected levels. He is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and looking into Ruper Friend's eyes I understood. The film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. An act of love. I believed it, or I should say, him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good but I didn't believe for a minute she was Victoria. No real sense of period. It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.","The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vall√©e who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert, The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure's entire life, Vall√©e instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. Vall√©e takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800's Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria's story without ever over-encumbering it. Indeed, while watching Vall√©e's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there's the film's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes' script. Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri's original work just as well.Yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor here‚Äîand indeed to most period dramas‚Äîare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. Between the sweet, budding romance of Victoria (Emily Blunt) and Albert (Rupert Friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic ""nice to look at but dim underneath"" affair so common with these outings.In the end, it's hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria. It's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. Of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. Vall√©e never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. Somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies The Young Victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,History
Another solid historical drama.,"""You are confusing stubbornness with strength, my dear. And I warn you, the people will not like you for it.""I think I've seen more of these British historical/period dramas in the past year than I had seen in the entirety of the previous twenty-three years of my life. I guess I've become somewhat of a fan of the genre.¬†The Young Victoria is similar in quality to the two prior to it that I've seen: The Duchess and The Other Boelyn Girl. I've actually given them all the same rating; but for different reasons.As in those movies, the crucial performance of the film rests on the shoulders of a young actress, and I thought that Emily did an admirable job. I'd put her turn as Queen Victoria slightly behind Keira Knightley's role ¬†in The Duchess, and slightly ahead of Portman and Johansson as the Boelyn sisters. She expertly handles the role of a very young, inexperienced woman who steps into position of huge power and must deal with the countless suspect influences of those around her.The settings and costumes are as opulent as one would expect from a movie like this, and perfectly serve to immerse the viewer into upper crust nineteenth century England. The story is also what one would expect, with all the drama and focus on romance that these sorts of movies are known for indulging it. I found the last 15 minutes or so to be slightly disappointing, as they devolved into overly melodramatic romance and a sort of clich√© montage that was at odds with the quality of the scenes that preceded it. That earned The Young Victoria a slightly lower score, but it's still a minor complaint.I recommend this to anyone who has a preference for these kinds of romanticized takes on the nobility of yesteryear. It's still not the truly great entry into the genre that I'd like to see (I've heard that Elizabeth is very good, perhaps I should try that), but fans of similar movies won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Well worth watching but is something missing..,"Enjoyed the movie very much. Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization, particularly of the shooting event? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at? Prince Albert's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here.The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production (which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York? i.e. Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole(?) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full?'Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie, or indeed in her shoes at all. Yet loved the casting of the principals, whose acting was convincing, so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well? I always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so than with ""Mrs. Brown"" or even ""The Queen"". Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen, except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Lovely to look at, but ultimately disappointing","I had expected great things of this film. The costumes and sets are rich and sumptuous. All the actors are excellent. Emily Blunt makes an appealing Victoria. The mise-en-scene is certainly easy on the eyes.BUT ... The pacing of the plot is just s-o-o-o slow, like those oh-so-earnest BBC television adaptations of great novels. Perhaps if I had seen it on television in installments, I would have enjoyed it more.In addition, there is too much jumping around from England to the continent and back, as if the scriptwriters couldn't settle on what sort of story to tell. Perhaps they were trying for a personal story set against a backdrop of political intrigue, but I'm sorry, it didn't work for me. I found it confusing and difficult to follow.

A Nutshell Review: The Young Victoria,"The cinematic interests in the British monarchy continues with The Young Victoria (1837 to 1901), after having seen in recent years, the efforts with Keira Knightley's The Duchess, Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth films, and Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman's take on the Boleyn sisters with The Other Boleyn Girl. More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death.Each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas (ok, so some may dispute Johansson) or were the flavour of their moment, and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured, and in fact Elizabeth had enough to span two films. However, The Young Victoria, as the title already suggests, is a lite-version of the young queen's life, and if you're looking for that definitive event, or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady, self-serving politicians, unfortunately there's nothing of depth here.That's not to say The Young Victoria is without. Directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee (best known for CRAZY) and written by Julian Fellowes, this film chronicles in very plain terms, ,the life and times of Victoria (Emily Blunt, soon becoming the new It girl) when she was a child, the troubles she faced before Coronation such as the eagerness of her mom The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) to appoint themselves as joint-Regent to her throne, as already planned for by reigning King William (Jim Broadbent). As if that wasn't enough, the political power play enters the picture with Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) being a Prime Minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new Queen, and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace. On one hand you'd understand the need for a young, and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions, but on the other, are they really acting in her interests, or in the interests of others?Even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film, and pretty much everything already included in the trailers. For both, they've been brought up under the influence of others, and told each step of the way exactly what to do. Even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance, if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding, and to do so with the help of each other. Instead of being pawns, there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling, and at times absurd, rules and regulations. Trust also becomes a much valued commodity, and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean.However, all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative, from childhood to romance, marriage and children. In fact, there's so much fast-forwarding here, especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles, that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more, and room of course for another movie, which I suspect would probably not see the light of day, but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response, and come out with a mini-series or such. It's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes, sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues, that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary.With its star-studded cast, one would expect more, but one would be left wanting more instead. Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy, only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A touching, pleasing historical epic.","There's something about historical epics that make us movie fans flock to the movie theaters in raw expectation, and stop my beating heart if that historical epic were to be an accurate, well-researched and moving romance. What greater delight is there than watching a nice, good romance while learning a good portion of history, all enveloped in an exquisitely-crafted film? Jean-Marc Vall√©e's charming ""The Young Victoria"" skillfully lives up to the aforementioned characteristics, and creates a feel-good movie experience that has your heart guzzling and your mind racing in excitement throughout its entirety.Yes, we love monarchs and their epic, larger-than-life experiences. One such monarch we all fondly remember is Queen Victoria, born in 1819 and assuming the throne at a very early age. King William (Jim Broadbent) is soon to die, Victoria is soon to come of age, and all around Europe rise interweaving conspiracies and plots to have Victoria sign an order of regency extending her powers to someone else and/or having someone seduce her with wit and modern political ideas and therefore influence her reign towards favoring a particular country or political party. But Victoria isn't as silly as everyone thinks, and she has a mind of her own...which is constantly been careened back and forth between diverging influences such as the Duchess of Kent's (Miranda Richardson) trying to make her renounce power to the evil Baron Stockmar, or Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) gaining her favour to help establish himself as Prime Minister...or Albert Conroy (Rupert Friend), King Leopold's nephew, who begins to fall in love with her while being part of a plot to earn the queen's protection of the Belgians.Among all these conspiracies and mind-boggling plots is the shy, growing romance between Victoria and Albert. The film is about history, politics and the nature of regents, but above all these subjects the love these characters feel triumph above all else and end up in one of the best regencies England has ever seen and one of the best love stories ever told. Jean-Marc Vall√©e does a wonderful job in toning down the film to a light-hearted level, where the history is enjoyable and where the love story unfolding isn't stale and clich√©d but original and refreshing. And Emily Blunt's performance as the young, strong-willed and charming Victoria is excellent and enthralling; she wins you over from the start and opens up Victoria's heart and mind to the audience, making it easy for us to love Victoria the Woman and to relate to her and her life problems, no matter how epically different they are from our own.The screenplay is dazzling, such as we've come to expect from screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), and the film has that sublime, breath-taking, age-old beauty we can expect from lush, sweeping cinematography, mellow and inviting score and top-notch costume design. It's a film that doesn't depend on the acting, screen-writing or directing alone, but whose every part fit perfectly together into a pleasing, well-coordinated whole.The film never lags, but sometimes it carries a particular emotion too far to the point where it loses it strength, or sometimes it cuts abruptly between scenes (and countries) in its attempt to fully involve us in every conspiracy or in every character's setting that we lose interest in most of the secondary characters and await impatiently to the flowering, letter-driven romance between Victoria and Albert. And what's with the rushed ending? You're enjoying the film, completely taken in by the story, and all of a sudden we get a black screen with an epilogue. It's not a grand flaw of the film, but it does inhibit it from becoming a masterpiece to rival such productions as ""Shakespeare in Love"" or ""Elizabeth"".I highly recommend it! It's a crowd-pleaser that will make you smile.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A new look at a well-known queen.,"This film tells the events surrounding the ascension to the throne of Queen Victoria of Great Britain, one of the most striking and well-remembered queens that the country has had to date. Directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e, has a script by Julian Fellowes, the direction of Sarah Ferguson (former Duchess of York) and features Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend in the lead roles.Although the film doesn't have a completely neutral script, it sought to portray the truth of historical facts, even failing to judge them impartially and having some historical inaccuracies in the middle. When a historical film is made it shouldn't change the history portrayed, even for dramatic purposes. But this unfortunately costs to understand for most directors and writers. The sets and costumes are excellent and are fully consistent with the time, the picture isn't surprising but does what it has to do, the soundtrack uses reasonably well pieces of classical music in vogue at the time. Most actors fulfill their functions, especially the rotten duo Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong. Emily Blunt, however, has earned stardom by giving life to a dreamy and passionate Victoria, still ignored by us and obscured by the queen she would become later. The film managed to capture the relationship between Victoria and Albert in a very forceful way, such as the importance of that for the re-popularization of the monarchy during that time.This film tries to be a historical drama with deep touches of romance, taking the lives and loves of Victoria to show us that a monarchy is not only gold, sex and scandals. It fulfilled that purpose appealing to the audience's heart with a Victoria who we managed to like, and that's far from the unpleasant old lady that comes to our minds most of the time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
adequate but slight,"this movie looked gorgeous and most of the acting, especially from blunt and bettany was very good but it was too heavily edited. i watched the DVD extras and most of the deleted scenes in my humble opinion should have been left in, especially the lady hastings affair. while watching the movie the affairs of state come across as confused at times due to the lack of depth in the story. now i understand this is mainly a love story about the queen and albert but w/people of such monumental historical import the backdrops and intrigues can only enhance even a love story if handled correctly. still, an enjoyable biopic just not definitive.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Victoria stationary,"Yet another historical costume drama this time focusing on the early years of queen-at- eighteen Victoria and in particular her burgeoning relationship to her adored Prince Albert. Cue the soft focus and romantic music as Hollywood trains its trademark feather-light examination on the UK monarchy, having the too pretty and much too old Emily Blunt play the title role and Paul Bettany much too young as the elderly Prime Minister Lord Melbourne as her mentor and escape route out of the clutches of her weak-willed mother and the grasping, ambitious Sir John Conroy as the latter's controller and alleged lover.Somewhere beneath the well-presented pageantry and pomp, there probably is a good dramatic story trying to emerge but every scene it seems has to contain a resonant phrase or utterance to make you admire the writing, rather than allowing the characters to reveal their true selves with more everyday speech.I didn't like the shallow, showy acting of Blunt and Rupert Friend could play his part in modern dress, so little does he connect with the time and place of the action. Jim Broadbent gives his typical good turn as the blustering King Willam IV but Miranda Richardson shows that she played costumed nobility much better for laughs (as in ""Black Adder"") than here when she plays it straight, although that tricky German accent might have thrown her off.No, for me this too sanitised, too fawning, too calculating production looks all too much as if it was aimed at either the Academy and / or the US box-office, which I'm not unhappy to see it failed in both respects.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Great acting,"I don't think the film really sets itself apart from other period-bio films from its ilk. It has the usual sort of sentimentality. But, that doesn't mean it's not a good film. Rupert Friend is his usual pretty self, very hot, but he does bring a lot to his role. He can usually be very stoic and emotionless while being just decorated as pretty, but can often not bring much to the table. Here, he absolutely does. He's able to paint the shades of his character well, even if another more talented actor could've brought even more to it. But really, the film belongs to Emily Blunt, a severely underrated actress who brings so much to her roles, and in a leading role, she can knock it out of the park like she does here. She's incredible, definitely snubbed of an Oscar nomination.",,Anonymous,History
Victoria¬Ö not quite as special as Elizabeth,"THE YOUNG VICTORIA (2009), directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e, is a simple love story and performs a great job at romanticizing such by wooing the heart of many a teen and twenty-something girl who still wish they were a princess with a showcase of glamorous balls, elaborate costumes and a good-looking prince with a sharp accent. For every other demographic watching the film, this reviewer included, the political intrigue of a dying king, an overbearing mother and a manipulative PM, however, isn't quite as rewarding.Emily Blunt, who, as it has been noted, fought for this role, passing on the opportunity to co-star in the comicbook film IRON MAN 2, proved that she had every right to play the monarch and did so with a beautifully royal countenance. Along side of her, Rupert Friend is both dashing and enjoyable as her loving paramour bringing an elegance to an otherwise everyman role.Where the film fails, if the telling of two people successfully in love is a failure, is that aside from the romantic yearning and positively ‚Äì ahem ‚Äì Victorian dating rituals practiced within, the viewer does not get to witness the social policies that her reign was responsible for or any true conflict thereof. She has almost already won before the film ends. In contrast, Shekhar Kapur's ELIZABETH (1998) weds the yearning of romance with hard, state-wide deliberations and a very dangerous conflict, thus creating a more compelling film.The conflict in this film comes as a result of two different characters and types of love. The first is Paul Bettany in an outstanding performance as Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's PM. Melbourne courts Victoria and offers love but his is a love of power with wedding Victoria as a clever and manipulative means to grabbing all. The other is King William played by Jim Broadbent, truly the king of acting nobility, who loves his niece and realizes that his own paternal instincts were denied by allowing the Duchess of Kent, her mother, to control every aspect of the young soon-to-be-queen's life. Alas, Broadbent's scenes are shorter than a drink of champagne and Bettany's are as political as the U.S. President in any Jerry Bruckheimer presentation.THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an enjoyable, romantic film to watch with clever dialogue and outstanding locations. However, the Young Victoria will always be a girl when compared the rich majesty that was Elizabeth.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A nice story with lots of evening wear,"The Young Victoria luckily has a story, and even better than that, it has good actors. That's where a film like The Other Boleyn Girl fails. The acting just didn't match the characters. Emily Blunt, who has quickly risen up the ranks into Hollywood A-list status, gives one of her better performances, worthy of her Golden Globe nomination, as the famed English monarch Queen Victoria.The film follows Victoria in the year leading up to her coronation and into the first few years of her reign, including her relationship of Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Victoria was a very protected and sheltered princess who was under constant surveillance by her mother and close friend and adviser. Victoria was next in line to take the crown once the King had passed, on so naturally a lot of attention as to when she would ascend to the thrown and how was being discussed. One thing is clear; Victoria does not want to be treated like a child.Her budding romance with Prince Albert starts before she is made Queen. The Prince is selected to try and win her affection as a political ally, but one thing leads to another and the two become smitten with each other. Albert is aware that the two of them are very young and must look out for one another, especially in the realm of politics. So called ""friends"" can become powerful influences on the crown, especially in the case of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), who imposes his political party's agenda upon the queen in a back door sort of way, surrounding her with his own people.Victoria learns quickly, and so do we, that the game of politics is a dicey one. It's hard to see which side people are really on, and by the time you do it might be too late.I was pleased with the pace and direction of this movie. It could have been too much about the fashion or too much about the politics, but it balanced the two out pretty well. Blunt and Friend are fine opposite each other, playfully going back and forth with their Victorian era flirtations. There is a definite bond their that shows up well on screen.The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Bettany, Miranda Richardson as Victoria's mother the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy, the Duchess' adviser, and a nice cameo by Jim Broadbent as an ailing King William. Bettany in particular plays his role quite well, never really telling us whether he is helping the Queen out or trying to do good for himself alone.The costumes are quite authentic and well made. They don't always distract the viewer's eye but at times they are a bit showy. I guess those were the times. The sets are incredibly detailed. I particularly liked the attention paid to the little knick-knacks and pieces of furniture in the bedrooms and studies. It felt like people were living there.It wasn't a perfect film and it did have it's dull moments. I thought it ended nicely and didn't wander off to take us places where we didn't need to go.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The perils and pitfalls of being a young monarch,"One of the pitfalls that a lot of biopics fall into is that they try to do too much, e.g., telling someone's entire life story as opposed to a part of it. Thankfully, THE YOUNG VICTORIA avoids this mistake by choosing to focus on the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. The source of dramatic conflict is how, as a young monarch, she was pulled this way and that by advisors and politicians who were all vying for control and influence. Meanwhile, she finds a friend (and eventually, lover) in Prince Albert. One thing the film does really well is show the difficulty inherent in being a leader, especially when one is young and viewed as inexperienced. Emily Blunt pulls off the role admirably and shows the chops she would bring to later performances such as EDGE OF TOMORROW, although her character here is a little more vulnerable. I thought she showed both sides quite well. Rupert Friend also did a great job as Prince Albert, who provided much needed solace and counterpoint to Victoria. Mark Strong also did well as the slimy John Conroy, who pressured Victoria to establish a regency with her mother, the Duchess of Kent. Also worth noting is the excellent production design and costumes which faithfully (I assume) and beautifully reproduce Victorian England. There is also an incredible score and soundtrack with (mostly) period classical music. Put together, this creates a rather handsome period costume drama and romance that should appeal to a large swath of the movie-going public.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Needs more beheading,"It is a tricky thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress has to be majestic and imperious, and on the other, she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds, since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line.Emily Blunt is quite radiant as Victoria, but it's not as full a performance as I'd like, no blame to her. I can't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth. Hence Blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions, at least not to the full extent, since she's, y'know, the young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check out Mrs Brown.Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie. He last did C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and propelled him to fame. It was quite a different movie but I remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., this one was by Julian Fellowes, and though I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. I soon got lost with all the governmental politics. Maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy. I'm just saying.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Very good on the whole,"I love a movie with lovely costumes, sets and music, so naturally I had my eyes set on this film. When I saw it, I really liked it. The pacing I agree could have been a little brisker, and the story is somewhat thin with some scenes in need of more drama perhaps. However, the production values are terrific, as I have said already so many times you can never go wrong with costumes, locations and cinematography that are stunning and The Young Victoria scores very highly here, and the music is stunning. The script is also intelligent, sweet and thought-provoking, and the direction is good. The performances are a vast majority of the time great. Emily Blunt is wonderful in the lead, and she is supported solidly by the likes of Miranda Richardson, Paul Bettany, Mark Strong and Jim Broadbent. Overall, this was very good if not perfect. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,History
worth watching for Emily Blunt and the whole Victorian Set up.,"THE YOUNG VICTORIA ‚Äì CATCH IT ( B ) The young Vitoria is one of the period movies which isn't about throne or fight the Queen to save her throne, it's more about Coming of Age Teenage drama. Based upon the true story of Queen Victoria the movie's substance is fascinating, romantic and there are moments in the movies which really touches you. The cinematography, sets and costumes deigns are top class. The only thing I didn't like that it was slow and the story was way too simple to present a live of Queen Victoria. Emily Blunt is a soul of movie, she adopt the persona of the young Queen with utmost perfection. Emily Blunt is one of the few actresses who are extremely talented and thanks God that in Hollywood talent doesn't get wasted. Rupert Friend got his first major role as the Prince of Queen Victoria and he performed really well. He was charming and really strong in front of Emily Blunt. This movie is worth watching for Emily Blunt and the whole Victorian Set up.",6.0,Anonymous,History
It's not easy being Queen...,"Having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up and down stairs? Having others taste your food before you eat it? Everyone (including your overbearing mother) dictating how you live? These are only a few of the obstacles which the young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there's also the various power struggles going on, as well as attempts on her life). Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.I had only previously seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). As she was in that film, she is once again the standout here. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria, and thought she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the film to the Queen Victoria she becomes later entirely believable. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control). Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. She's - quite simply - exquisite, commanding your attention every second she's on screen. She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film.Rupert Friend proves to also be well-cast as Victoria's love interest (and eventual husband), Prince Albert. The actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but you can tell that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this film. The less-focused-upon people are well-portrayed also, given what little screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is memorable and makes an impact in the film.Although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead *tells* us what happened (with her and Albert) on screen, what matters the most is what we actually *see*. This is, after all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle-Aged Victoria', nor 'The Old Victoria'). While there are some embellishments made on history with this film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power.The movie looks amazing, the costumes Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film, never detracts from it. It's powerful (especially at the beginning when Victoria is crowned), it packs an emotional punch where needed and the end credits song performed by Sinead O'Connor is one you'll want to sit through. Like the film and lead performances, 'Only You' is simply beautiful. The movie is exceptionally shot and, unlike a lot of films these days, it is actually a good length, as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out.It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt. She's in fine form here, turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been, had another actress been cast in this rather important/historic role. This is one finely-crafted film, with excellent performances, that should definitely be seen. If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history, this is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,History
emily blunt,"I first became aware of Emily Blunt in the film MY SUMMER OF LOVE. Obviously a strikingly beautiful young woman, Ms. Blunt is a remarkable actress. The camera loves her and the way she uses her eyes is singularly unique among many actresses. I know that i am not going out on a limb to say with Ms Blunt its a matter of not if she will win an Academy Award but a matter of when. Patting myself on the back i also saw that same quality in Natalie Portman in the movie THE PROFESSIONAL and Amy Adams in the movie CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. There is something different about Ms Blunt though. Of course her looks are a factor but having said that i cant take my eyes off her while she is on screen which is the hallmark of extraordinary talent.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A great production,"This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain.""The Young Victoria"" has amazing production. Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make ""The Young Victoria"" very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.Overall, ""The Young Victoria"" is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush.",,Anonymous,History
Rather Charmless and Forgettable....,"Don't get me wrong, Emily Blunt seems perfect as the young Queen, her diction exemplary, her poise Regal. As are all the leading players are (not diction, or poise!) very good in their roles from our favourite big and small screen stars - Miranda Richardson, Paul Bettany, Mark Strong, Rupert Friend, Jim Broadbent etc.There are lots of reviews up here and so I won't want to repeat too much of they say, but somehow, the very high standards of production, often very glossy (and Oscar winner for Costume Design), plus the lush and swelling stereo (surround) sound, take away the tactility of both the subjects and the film itself. Not that I'm necessarily wanting to get back to the VHS quality of 1980s 'costume drama', mind you!Maybe it's because many of the characters are portrayed as hard-nosed and bitchy, out of date and greedy. This does highlight the romantic side of the film, though, between Victoria and Albert, as they get to know each other, but this takes a good while to reach and isn't as clammily awful as it could have been. Endearing almost, which is a bit distant from the often perceived hardness of the monarch in her more documented reign of later life.It's entertaining enough with some gorgeous photography of some lovely stately homes and is perfect fodder for a dark early winter's evening. There's no sex or violence, though adults will be in no doubt when those bits take place, hence the PG certificate.As a history lesson, it's OK, it's never rammed down our throats and if we choose, we can just let it run and simply enjoy the surface sheen. The acting never really is raised beyond what is needed - Jim Broadbent as King William IV shouting very loudly at a huge banquet might be considered as full-bodied acting but it's not necessarily good. The two main players do have their moments but Julian Fellowes' (writer also of Downton Abbey) screenplay is necessarily rather clipped and to the point - I don't think small-talk was the done thing in Victoria's household!So, good solid entertainment that's good to look at and which should please the Period Drama brigade as well as reaching a wider - and younger, audience. The Sinead O'Connor end titles song is a beautiful and fitting climax that firmly tells us that this film was intended to be a popularist one, which, I think is a good thing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!!!! Great movie,"One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in, it ends much to soon! Than were left looking at the screen like, ""No they didn't!"", lol. Good performances all around! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young Victoria's regality, temper, and vulnerability through out the entire movie. Also, the production is outstanding in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children. It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen's attention, than securing her love, before Lord Melbourne(Paul Bettany), was engrossing to watch. Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, which was fury at times, as with her mother and King William (whom also disliked her mother). The acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era, and indeed, anyone who loves a compelling true romance story",8.0,Anonymous,History
"If you like Emily Blunt, you should give this a go as you see more of her personality than the Queen Victoria.","Reviewed June 2010Though this movie does not enlighten you more than a single glance at wikipedia, it does charm you with the talented Emily Blunt. Though she is not pinup poster beautiful, she grows on you with every movie through her confidence and impeccable voice diction. As the name of the movie suggests, it is the story of Queen Victoria just before her coronation to a few years into her marriage with Prince Albert. The love story is mature and educative of the period's tradition in proposal and approach.What does not augur well in this storyline than most of the other British Royal movies is that, it is a very personal story of Queen Victoria and is told in a way that they knew her. So that thought in mind makes you feel this entire thing is too fabricated. It features apt support performances and production does not leave anything out to show the richness of it's dynasty.

Beautiful,"When most people think of Queen Victoria, they probably think a fat little prudish woman. That was certainly her image as she got on in years but by focusing this on when she is a young woman (and played by the beautiful, slim Emily Blunt) she definitely has more appeal to audiences. The movie is gorgeous, beautifully acted (loved Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy. He's much better playing villains like this and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes), and really romantic. As a historical work alone it's probably not the best but as a historical romance it's great! The costumes are all really eye-catching. I was surprised at how much I liked them! It's my least favorite era in fashion history and most of Victoria's gowns are borderline gaudy (she is the queen after all!), yet the costume designer and Emily Blunt managed to make them work.",8.0,Anonymous,History
more royal drama,"The Brits do so love their celluloid royal myth-making. With The King's Speech bullying the awards season as I write, it seems the appetite for dramas on the human frailties of these oh-so-put-upon super-rich pampered layabouts has yet to be satiated.Dodgy socio-politics aside, this is an entertaining representation of the challenges faced by a young woman who most think of in terms of an icon of empire and grief. Emily Blunt, so erotic and chilling in My Summer of Love, is much more gritty here as the young princess stifled by the competing claims of wannabe advisers and mentors. Rupert Friend is given the daunting task of bringing to life a man most famous for dying on his wife. Albert's challenge is less to win her heart than to win her mind. In that he competes with Lord Melbourne (a perfectly restrained Paul Bettany), and that three-way intrigue throws up enough drama and twists to compel viewing. In wonderful counterpoint to this is Jim Broadbent as a mad King William, played full throttle for camp.Engaging enough as royal dramas go, the high production values and fine performances make Young Victoria worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Emily Blunt is lovely,"The main mistake of this movie is excessive pandering to modern audiences. It is understandable that they are trying to bring the actions in the movie closer to today's world. For example, the latest version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that is elegantly done, while ""The Young Victoria"" remains overcrowded with glamorous details. The costumes are good. Each dress is impressive to observe, you will appreciate their effort, but when you look closely you will see a film that often promotes luxury at the cost of being authentic. Why should you watch this movie? Definitely not for the sake of new knowledge, but for the understanding of someone who was unable to find his way in the role that was premature given.

The Young Victoria,"Billions of people from around the world loves the British royals and watches everything about them. They want to know what is happening with them and the history of that incredible lineage of royals which came during the history of that rainy island.The story of Victoria and her early love affair with Albert is in the center of this film. She later loved him so much that when he died she had his clothes taken every day out of the closet and laid for him on the couch. It also deals with fight of her custodians to try to gain reigns of power from her. It was avoided since the previous sovereign lived enough for Victoria to turn 18. Britan became super power during her reign and it is interesting to see how the early years of pre reign passed. Acting is excellent, costumes have to be excellent, it is a costume drama after all, and all is in red, color of the British royals. If you are into British royals, and you probably are, since half of the world is, it is a film for you. It is interesting to note that during Victoria time Britain was devoid of the fight for throne like in the earlier centuries, and the question of religion is not as acute as during the reign of Henry VIII or Elizabeth I.",6.0,Anonymous,History
see it for the music and costumes,"This movie is all about atmosphere. It very successfully recreates the era of Queen Victoria's early life, just before and after her coming to the throne. The performances by the main characters are generally good though not spectacular. The only ones that I found particularly endearing were King William (Jim Broadbent, has he ever been less than brilliant?) and Viscount Melbourne (Paul Bettany), neither of whom were principal characters. And the story line has some weaknesses: it seems to peak a little early, and ends at what seems like an arbitrary moment in history.All that being said, there are many good reasons to see this fabulous film: (1) the costumes are just absolutely gorgeous, and there are so many of them. Scene after scene is filled with gowns that are to-die-for. (2) the gardens and palaces at which the movie was filmed are also beautiful; many are recognizable landmarks in their own right (Ham House which stands in for Kensington Palace, Hampton Court). (3) The period atmosphere is impeccably presented, transporting the viewer to another world.But most importantly, (4) the soundtrack. I was blown away by the way in which the music integrates themes from classic compositions (Handel, Dvorak, Schubert, et al.) and weaves them into new forms that align perfectly with the action of the movie. You hear the music, and for a while you think, ""hey, that sounds familiar, have I heard that before?"" and soon it transforms itself from a contemporary composition into the actual classical piece. My explanation doesn't do it justice, you'll have to see/hear it to understand.Altogether, a rich, lush, very romantic movie about the early Romantic period, a delight for both the eyes and ears.",8.0,Anonymous,History
delightful courtesy,"the most noticeable thing in the young Victoria is its majestic decorum and vividness. The movie reflect the very first years of the longest lived heirs of the English crown., and since youth was the subject matter of the movie it was colored likewise. quiet cheerful romantic and rebellious and different parts of it as the queen reject the regency to govern her country on behalf of her and stood up to take her own responsibly, she insisted talking to her husband Albert"" if there are any mistakes to be make, they will be my mistakes and no one else, no one, not even you"" . we could see that the movie tend to be a tribute to her majesty more than taking side for any ideological point of view. so Mr Vall√© occupied himself by depicting the grandeur and beauty of such life. too flawless and simple that's my judgment as a critic, Vall√© movie can a show as that we might have an accomplished work without making it too complicated or dense, without getting ridiculous. yet, the only thing that could be taken on the young Victoria is that it might got too romantic, for handling a life of such a historical figure should be rather more serious, it's true we saw some drama here and there with the gun shot and the regency issue, but it did not get the attention it provokes.

A Good Period Piece Depicting Queen Victoria's Early Life,"This is first of all a beautiful period piece, with exquisitely designed sets and costumes. Set in the period just before and in the early years of Victoria's reign as Queen of England, there is a definite sense of authenticity that flows throughout this movie.The story itself revolves essentially around two aspects of Victoria's early life. The first deals with the troubled relationships that existed within the royal family. Victoria's uncle was King William IV - a man who only became King at the age of 64 and had a touch of eccentricity about him. Since William was childless, the heir to the throne was his niece Victoria. Victoria's mother and her partner Sir John Conroy (who many believe was her lover) conspired to take control of England themselves by convincing Victoria to establish a regency. William, however, survived until Victoria's 18th birthday, and Victoria - hostile to Conroy and unsympathetic to her mother - refused to consider a regency, instead reigning in her own right. This was an interesting view of royal life and of some of the intrigues taking place behind the scenes, as well as a somewhat rare depiction of William IV, who's largely forgotten today. The second part of the story dealt with the growing relationship and eventual romance between Victoria and her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe, Coburg and Gotha. This took up the bulk of the movie, although I would say personally that I found the political machinations within and without the royal family more interesting. It was, however, a good (and corrective) look at a side of Victoria rarely reflected upon. The image we have of her tends to be of her later life - after Albert's death, when she went into extended mourning. Her name sums up an era (the Victorian) widely seen as passionless and, frankly, somewhat dull. Thus, it's refreshing to see Victoria shown as passionately in love with Albert (which she was in truth.)Emily Blunt's performance as Victoria was top-notch, with Rupert Friend offering a very good performance as Albert. Friend was appropriately in Blunt's shadow for most of the movie, just as Albert would have been in Victoria's. This is an interesting take on Victoria's early life. It's not especially exciting, and adds nothing really that anyone with knowledge of the outline of Victoria's life wouldn't know already (which, of course, also means that it isn't hopelessly romanticized, although the scene in which Albert takes a bullet for Victoria is complete myth, as was the idea that was mentioned that Victoria's marriage made her more popular, when in fact her marriage to Albert was not popular at first with the public) but it's still a good watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Finally, a satisfying Royals story","Princess Victoria (Blunt) becomes Queen of England, and later marries Prince Albert (Friend).I always like movies about the Royals. You get to see the palaces, castles, manicured gardens, the furniture, over-sized mirrors and the spacious rooms. I am reminded of a Nick Faldo (golfer) story he tells when he and his daughter went to Buckingham Palace for him to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth. As they walked through the palace, his young daughter exclaims, "" Daddy, this is where we should live."" Indeed.(Bob, is Helen Mirren in this?) No, that comes at a much later time in a movie called The Queen. (You sure?)Moving on. The young Victoria at age 18 is a feisty one and won't sign papers to install a regency until she is 25. She decides to wait until she can become Queen when her loving uncle King William (Broadbent) dies, and surprisingly, he does rather quickly. Now, as Queen she has to handle things with little experience, but she learns. We are only privy to the first few years of Victoria's reign. The notes at the end of the movie tell of her accomplishments with Prince Albert later on. They were good Royals.Good chemistry between Blunt and Friend and that is what makes this a most satisfying story. Also, the entire cast performed well. Excellent direction, cinematography and good dialogue helped a lot and the editing process didn't let a scene linger too long. Good job.And, for the Jeopardy fans, Queen Victoria was the first sovereign to occupy Buckingham Palace.Only one downside¬Ö. (here we go). With all the movements throughout the palaces and castles, I didn't see one painting on any wall. Hmmmm¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö And, I wouldn't have minded if this lasted another hour. It went by too fast.Violence: Yes, Prince Albert gets shot. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The 12 Faces of Emily Blunt,"What more can be said? I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses), the roles are complete polar opposites.Simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you. This isn't to say that the script or direction was bad, its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I, Anne Boylen, Henry VIII, Henry V, Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane. These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British ,and in most cases, world history. Victoria, in contrast, ascended the throne without incident, she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy, her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians, and she married young had a harmonious family life. The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of.The heart of the film, aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne, is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story. Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion, yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life. Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert. I was very taken with Rupert Friend's characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind, patient, somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man, looking to"" do good in the world and help"". In short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around, but as that is not the point of the story, that does not matter. The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend's understated yet earnest performance.As for the Queen, well..Emily Blunt is sublime. Her beauty cannot be denied, but she is more than something pretty to look at; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness. The slightest arch of the eyebrow, glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much. Again, this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas, its not that kind of movie. But what Ms. Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety.For example, we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria's mother ( Miranda Richardson) and her scheming adviser/lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog. We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him. We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension. And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous, happy, and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her, a proposition so ridiculous for those times( and some would say now) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say ""marry me"". Again, this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions, but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.So, overall, I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7. I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development, namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal. Again, the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters, but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment. Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert, but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt.In summary, don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures. I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances, brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt. And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them, you will be touched by the end of this movie. God save the Queen.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Emily Blunt shines as 'The Young Victoria',"Before seeing this film, my only experience of Emily Blunt acting in anything, was a horrible performance in 'The Devil Wears Prada', in which she was either miscast, or just didn't have the acting skills to convey. All of a sudden, here she is as 'The Young Victoria' and she's nothing less than sublime. The same can be said of much of the cast, I've never been a huge Paul Bettany fan, but he captured just the right balance of love/hate for his character. Mark Strong also, who seems to always get the baddie role is good. One questionable piece of casting, Miranda Richardson, forever 'Queenie' in 'BlackAdder' is also very good and i didn't find myself thinking of Baldrick or Edmund at all. The film is essentially, at heart, a love story, and a very good one it is. There's some great inventive camera work at times, which is never over indulgent, but actually serves the scenes well when it's sparingly used. The script is very good and the locations are grand and impressive. For anyone that loves this sort of thing, or just wants a brief history lesson, there's lots of offer.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stately portrait of a young queen,"Taking place in the mid 19th century and at the height of the British Empire, THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a film that explores the early life of one of Britain's most famous monarchs. It's a beautifully shot film with a stately feel that moves along in its own time, building a tapestry populated with foreign princes, conniving politicians and overbearing family members. How much you'll enjoy it depends on your tolerance for pomp and splendour, because THE YOUNG VICTORIA is absolutely packed with it.Given that the movie takes place during one of the most reserved eras of British history, it's no surprise that most of the cast give carefully mannered and subdued performances. Emily Blunt feels sufficiently regal in the part, although I never warmed to her character; her entire career seems to consist of playing a snob, and there's no exception here.Rupert Friend, Paul Bettany and Miranda Richardson all get important parts but are basic window-dressing, while Mark Strong is a shoehorned-in villain. Jim Broadbent has one excellent outburst during a dinner scene which really shakes things up. This film may not be entirely historically accurate, but it provides a neat counterpart to the popular royal topics in recent time s(i.e. 20th century or Tudor monarchs).",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not the 'old woman in black' I once was taught about...,"I am not sure why I love this film and have, without thinking, seen it several times. Maybe it is because of Blunt's moving and darn right brilliant performance as a naive girl turned passionate, confident, and loving queen who chooses to find love in her own time, and finds a great man to share her life with. Or maybe it is Friend's handsome and yet vulnerable Prince Albert, who's charming persona is something any woman would fall for lol Each supporting actor was very well laced and acted. I love Paul Bettany, and Melbourne's calculating acting had me guessing for a minute about where his allegiance lied. Strong's performance in this film is great; he keeps getting better and better! While I love Miranda Richardson in this, I had mixed feelings about her character....or maybe we were supposed to feel apathetic towards her yet pity when her daughter resents her for not comforting her during Conroy's rant. The visuals as amazing, the performances superb, and it's easy to see how much England (from what I saw in London in my short time there) appreciated & admired the Queen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
solid historical drama,"Queen Victoria (Emily Blunt) was born in 1819 and gains the crown in 1838 after her uncle King William IV (Jim Broadbent)'s death. One year earlier, she is controlled by her mother Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her husband Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). They want her to sign over her powers by declaring a regency. King Leopold of Belgium wants to secure the crown by sending his nephew Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) to seduce Victoria. She falls under the influence of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany).This is a solid historical drama with Emily Blunt bringing a solid performance. In the end, it is more of a history lesson that needs more drama to make it compelling. It's a stoic biopic. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vall√©e does a competent job bringing out the regal palatial glow. The story needs to zero in on the essential relationship that it wants to bring out. I'm not sure Albert is the most compelling although it's the easiest for a historical romance. I would have liked to see Victoria through Melbourne's eyes instead.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Blunt scores as the young queen,"""The Young Victoria"" takes us back to the 1830s, when England's future queen was a mere princess of seventeen - yet all set to take her rightful place on the throne, soon to be vacated by her ailing and childless uncle, King William. However, such an ascension was easier said than done, for there were those who believed that the sheltered young woman was just a bit too na√Øve in the ways of the world to successfully carry out the duties of a leader of the British Empire. The movie also focuses on the romance between the princess and her German cousin, Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), who sees in Victoria a woman of independent thought and strong will - a quick-witted individual who has the ability to see through much of the palace politics and behind-the-scenes machinations going on around her. Yet, the fly-in-the-ointment comes in the form of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), Prime Minister of England and a first-class manipulator, who charms his way into becoming the young queen's personal confidante and helper, largely in control of the people she sees and the decisions she makes - a relationship that ultimately threatens to bring on a constitutional crisis for the nation and that finally comes to a head once the queen has chosen Prince Albert to be her husband.Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, ""The Young Victoria"" is a visually opulent costume drama that, nevertheless, manages to keep its characters relatable and life-sized. This is due, in large part, to Emily Blunt, who makes of the queen a modern, forward-looking young woman who takes her royal duties and her commitment to her subjects, especially the downtrodden ones, with the utmost seriousness. The always reliable Jim Broadbent also scores as the aging and irascible king who precedes her on the throne. Still, the screenplay by Julian Fellowes could probably have done with a little less fawning over the royal couple, as I'm sure their romance was not quite as idyllic or their lives and personalities quite as unyieldingly noble as they are depicted herein.Stylistically, the movie may be elegant and stately, but it's rarely stilted or stuffy. The royal stratagems and political power plays can sometimes be hard to follow for us plebeians in the audience, but armchair historians will find much to whet their Victorian Era appetites here.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Lavish costume design & art direction, and Blunt was impressive, but that is it, period!","The British Queen Victoria was infamous not only for her long run of sovereignty but also because she took the throne at a young age. Many thought she was an inexperienced spoiled child who would not be capable of such responsibility. No, this is not The George Bush Story. Queen Victoria showed all her naysayers and her country that she was a powerful and endearing leader. The first years of her rule are chronicled in the period movie ""The Young Victoria"". Emily Blunt stars as the titled character, and she continues to prove most worthy of her acting range and that she thespian rules! Director Jean Marc Valee' assembles the movie more as a love story than a power monarchy struggle. In other words, Valee' parks the narrative mostly as Victoria's relationship with Prince Albert. But nevertheless, ""The Young Victoria"" still has plenty of the formulaic reign jealousy that is incorporated in most period movies. So I am sorry Jean Marc, but maybe you should Valee' your period movie creativity in unchartered historical waters. In other words, develop something that has not been included in this genre for your next period flick. The ""Young Victoria"" is based on a true story and you cannot defy history but you can spice it up with a little novelty for viewer enchantment. Jean Marc, I would give the same advice to your fellow filmmaker Julian Fellowes, who scripted ""The Young Victoria"". Fellowes' past scripts have been a bit more jovial and less melancholy, so maybe its time for Julian to be once again a ""jolly good"" Fellowes in his screen writing contributions. Blunt was impressive but the rest of the cast was a bit too robotic for my taste; which included: Rupert Friend as Prince Albert, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mommy), and Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne. Lord o lord, must these actors always use the same expression throughout the movie! I did enjoy the always charismatic Jim Broadbent as King William, but he was very much underutilized. I must coronate ""The Young Victoria"" with some positive feedback on its vibrant art direction and opulent costume design; but then again those are pretty much sure things when it comes to period flicks. ""The Young Victoria"" is what it is, not a victorious movie but a divine pleasure to history buffs and those who love a period love story (""Carrie"" not included). *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Beautiful, but lacks substance","With beautiful costumes and exquisite set and art design, The Young Victoria is visually wonderful to watch. There was so much hype about Emily Blunt getting an Oscar nomination for it, but she wasn't given very much to do. What she was asked to do, she did well, but the movie itself felt a little thin. It felt like a watered-down television script, or a highly fictionalized biopic from the early 1990s. Although I am aware screenwriter Julian Fellowes took great care to make sure it was historically accurate, somehow the finished product seems sensationalized for Hollywood audiences. In fact, if I hadn't seen his name in the credits, I wouldn't have known The Young Victoria was a Fellowes work.This sounds highly critical, but with all the detailed, epic historical dramas about royalty, there's room for audiences to pick and choose which are more enjoyable. Since many movies about the same subject were made in quick succession, it promotes nit-picky criticism. ""She looked more like her,"" or ""That scene was more romantic,"" can shift loyalties in the blink of an eye. Between 1997 and 2017, there were five biopics of Queen Victoria: Mrs. Brown, Victoria & Albert, The Young Victoria, Victoria, Victoria & Abdul. With all that competition, Emily Blunt only stands a 20% chance of standing out. She might not have made the Academy's cut, but this movie opened tons of doors for her and she rocketed to stardom - so hopefully, she's grateful for the attention she did get.In the supporting cast, you'll see Rupert Friend as Prince Albert, Jim Broadbent as King William, Miranda Richardson, Paul Bettany, Mark Strong, Julian Glover, and others. Once again, it's very pretty to watch, but director Jean-Marc Vall√©e seemed more interested in capturing young people's attention than creating a historical epic to stand the test of time.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Utterly dreadful,"I went into this film with an open mind, hoping to enjoy it as I have enjoyed other films about Royals, such as The Queen, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and Becket, among many others.However, this film is a tedious bore, and the price I paid with my boredom was abused by feeding me key moments of made-up fiction to try to punch it up. I do not take kindly to that. If you're going to make stuff up, it ought to at least be good, not try to cover for the fact that the story itself is completely boring.I could never figure out what this film wanted to be. Was it a story of a young Royal learning her position? Was it a love story? Was it a story about self-confidence? Was it about palace intrigue? Was it about republicanism and assassination attempts? Was it about someone interested in the poor, the arts, and science? Well, you got me. It seemed all of that, and therefore none.I felt absolutely nothing for the main character, nor for her supposed love interest. In fact, I was most disappointed at a certain time when it seemed the dreaded film might be over, only to discover that in fact it was going to drag on yet more. I started hating the couple, because they were delaying my exit from the cinema.As I left, I heard many complimentary things said about things like costume and makeup, but nobody said anything about the story or characters. Unfortunately, for me, I don't go to the cinema to see shiny dresses. I can see that at the better shops in the mall.

"Beautiful Film,  but Could Have Spent More Time to Flesh Out the Characters","As I had always written in previous reviews, I am very fond of watching historical films. When I saw this on the list of Qantas flight home from Sydney yesterday, this was the very first one I watched.This film tells the story of Victoria from the days prior to and during the early days of her being a queen. Apart from the political intrigues surrounding her ascendancy to the throne, the film also shows us her love story with Prince Albert. As the film covered a lot of time, I felt that the story-telling was rushed through. You just get the main story, but not enough development of characters and exposition of their motivations.Some characters are clearly villainous like Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), and her nasty adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). However, the character of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was of nebulous motivations. The character of King William was very well played by the unrecognizable Jim Broadbent, but I had never actually seen a king address his enemy so scandalously on a banquet table! As expected, there was beautiful cinematography, as well as very colorful period costumes and elaborate set designs. The acting of Emily Blunt (whom I only knew from ""The Devil Wears Prada"")as the young Victoria and of Rupert Friend (whom I never saw before) as her consort are very lively and strong. Their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. But again, the hastily edited final sequences and the abrupt ending left me unsatisfied. I was expecting more.

Almost perfect...,"This is not a bad film. As a glorified fluff-piece somewhat respectful of historical fact yet conducive to the erotic reveries of well-bred adolescent girls who still believe in Cinderella and Prince Charming, it can't be topped (please see ""user ratings"" by age and sex). It boasts art direction that can rival any Vincente Minnelli production and I'm really proud, as a native of Quebec, that this project was helmed by a compatriot, Jean-Marc Vall√©e (""C.R.A.Z.Y.""), who gave its story-telling fluidity and believability. The only points I subtract are for the decision to eliminate the Lady Flora Hastings subplot, probably because this real story of ""pride and prejudice"" (slander against a worthy woman) would have been difficult to justify and integrate into Victoria's proud but saintly persona. I would have liked to be a fly on the wall in the room where the decision was taken, probably for crassly commercial reasons, to sweep the whole downer of an affair under the carpet. Some of that story, however, still makes it into the Deleted Scenes of the DVD. It would ultimately have given the story much more weight and resonance about what people mean when they say ""victorian"", especially in a script written by the very thorough, witty and erudite Julian Fellowes, one of the last representatives on this planet of the ""educated scriptwriter"" species. It would have shown Sir John as somewhat less of a villain and Victoria as a bigot falling prey to appearances and gossip. The good news is we can still expect even more interesting work from Vall√©e and Fellowes.P.S.: Prince Albert was never shot or grazed during any assassination attempt on young Queen Victoria, although there were several of those.

Stately Though Uninspired Look at a Beloved Queen's Budding Years Ruling the Empire,"All the period detail certainly looks right in this 2009 historical drama, but it amazes me how bloodless and staid the story feels under the pedestrian direction of Jean-Marc Vall√©e. That's unfortunate given how lively Emily Blunt can be in any number of on screen roles she has undertaken (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""Sunshine Cleaning""). The key problem is that Julian Fellowes' sensitive albeit dull screenplay focuses on what was obviously a happy marriage between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the consequence of which doesn't give rise to much dramatic fire unless wrapped conveniently in political intrigue, insanity or war. Attempts to add sharper edges to their love story wring hollow because at heart, Victoria is not presented as that compelling a historical figure.Because of her station in life, the teenaged Victoria is unable to rebel with any conviction. Her scheming, Machiavellian mother, the Duchess of Kent controls her every move, while her adviser John Conroy manipulates the duchess and her daughter with strong-arm tactics with the aim of forcing Victoria have him rule in her stead before she can mature into her role. However, Victoria steadfastly declines his directives in favor of ascending the throne herself upon the death of her beloved uncle, the cantankerous King William IV. Although young and naive, she rises to the challenge of becoming her country's soon-to-be longest-reigning monarch. In the midst of this transition, she falls for her cousin Albert even though he has been aggressively coached by her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to ensure a match occurs.Once Victoria confronts Albert about his ruse, their affection builds and turns into a marriage of mutual devotion with a common dedication to the expansion of arts and science in the empire. The only compelling barrier to Victoria and Albert's happiness is the cagey Lord Melbourne, her trusted, almost-Svengali-like adviser, whose motives remain murky and highly suspect throughout the five-year span of the story told in the movie. Blunt handles her stately role with aplomb, injecting the right level of vulnerability to a character whose ultimate calling came so early in her life. Unfortunately, compared to Cate Blanchett's meaty opportunities in the first ""Elizabeth"", she is not given any scenes that take advantage of her innate fieriness. By comparison, Rupert Friend comes across a bit too pallid to make any real impression as Albert.Other worthy actors are given too little to do to strike more than single notes in their performances, for example, Miranda Richardson's petulant turn as the duchess, Mark Strong's Conroy trivialized into a stock villain, and Paul Bettany almost too subtly ambiguous as Melbourne. Only Jim Broadbent stands out in just three scenes as King William. The production details are executed just right from Hagen Bogdanski's clear-eyed cinematography to Patrice Vermette's sumptuous production design to Sandy Powell's pageantry of costumes. The 2010 DVD includes 22 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, a standard making-of featurette, a short comparing the movie' title character with the real Queen Victoria, in-depth looks at the film's coronation and wedding scenes, and a final piece that focuses on the costumes and locations. The film is a tepid entry into the genre of British historical dramas.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Sovereigns for the masses,"The usual problem with films concerning sovereigns is that they are reluctant to fully take charge and do what they have to do with their subject, whatever it is they want to do; the result is, invariably, melodramatic with a numbing streak, unless one is a fanatic for picturing the life of kings and queens on a middle-class level. I, for one, like films that would have me forget that the people depicted are sovereigns, so engrossing the ritual of power should be, but not for constantly reminding me that they, too, are humanely human people, after all.They are not, or, rather, were. Once upon a time they had specific symbolic mandates, that nowadays seem imported from another solar system. But this little film wants to be luminous as the sun, no matter the solar system: miss Blunt's cheeks assure us for it, as if she was illumined by an inner thrust, and that's all fine, as is the obvious, layered effort a person of power should handle concerning all matters that entertain his acuity (or her blossoming femininity), but it is not enough.The film, although guided by a director that shows a nuanced, sometimes on the verge of grand, assured grasp on compositional level (especially the sense of architectural building up in the first scene), falls allover the place. What is its subject actually? Nuance and variety of subjects cannot be the case. A bit of romance, a bit of machinations (but straightforward please, so as not to make it too much of a burden for young Victoria, after all, it's the ""early years""), stunning costumes, matching sets, an entertaining Jim Broadbent as King, some romance, some royalty, etc. but it's a bore.Abide on the surface, and it will tell what it has to. Paul Valery once said, ""there is nothing more profound than surface."" Why should we try to humanize it? What we get is a colorful, shining, unimaginative bore. Iznogud (know the comic?), if you get the homonym; like Rupert Friend, positively unassuming as he is, but isn't he like Orlando Bloom in the place of Orlando Bloom? Contrast to that the ever-effective Mr. Bettany as usually polishing his unsympathetic self, and the thing is already edgy as a lump.Fluffy, too (one muses over how much importance did the casting gave to miss Blunt's chin resembling the one Queen Victoria had, and abides on the memory of that old 'French and Saunders' romp ""me likey! look alikey!"") and then oops! we have fallen into the carriage.An attempt has been made toward our person.Of course, no such thing in the affair called biography-must-show-integrity has the melodramatic accuracy exemplified by the film, but who gives a damn if the historic Albert was never involved in such a thing, since one can please the masses with such a dramatic pinnacle!That slow-mo pinnacle condemns the film as a hoax, if not as the perennial ass-kissing aspiration to a monarchy we never witnessed, let alone had.The film is a stately nuanced execution, but in a mocking manner, of what the philosopher Hegel, upon witnessing Napoleon passing on his horse, said: that he saw the State passing. If only we had that kind of awe-inspiring effect ensured by a film. But it seems the sensibility we get is like the one John Waters attacked in 'Serial Mom', in the scene where the inane viewer goes for one more round of John Huston's ""Annie"". Do you want to be polished, but still corny, albeit with a royal alibi? Is no good.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent History Period Movie,"I have watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now,the first time, I watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. an engrossing entertaining film, thank god no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing. Might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne",7.0,Anonymous,History
Real-life royal romance,"The only living descendant of her uncle King William IV of UK, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent (Emily Blunt) was groomed to succeed the throne since childhood by her mother Duchess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (Miranda Jane Richardson) and household comptroller Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). She was raised like an extremely fragile china doll. She slept in the same room as her mother. Her hand needed to be held when she went up and down the stairs. She did not have friends her age. Her mother and Sir John Convoy expected to control her when she gained the crown.Had Victoria been less intelligent, her mother and John Conroy might have succeeded. When she finally became queen, she distanced herself from her expectant controllers. She made fast friends with Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany),One of the greatest fortunes that came Victoria's way was the handsome, intelligent and sensible Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Rupert Friend). He truly loved her and his loyalty and support were what the young queen needed most at that time. Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend played their roles to near perfection (if only he had a more conventional hairstyle). They were able to portray sincere and passionate love but with appropriate restraint and elegance called for by their roles.The movie depicts the turbulent early years of their marriage including the political situation and Albert's attempts to be useful in their household. It ends when he finally showed how useful he could be.I love the combination of history and romance in the movie. I just watched it a third time and my admiration has not waned.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Strong Presentation but Lacking Depth,"19 June 2010. Perhaps it's not so much the script, director, or actors, it's more likely that Queen Victoria herself is to blame for the impossibility of any movie to truly depict the grand scope and breadth of her transition to and reign as the Queen of England. Somehow YOUNG VICTORIA seems diminished and small compared to the awe and Majesty of the real reign. While YOUNG VICTORIA provides a small glimpse into the fascinating political intrigue with fine, unspoken nuance and Emily Blunt dazzles with her innocence and solid performance, the movie fails an epic, too short on matters of consequence and the truly great events that unfolded during Queen Victoria's reign. Many of the noble and worthy events that provided the Queen with her greatest were given to ending footnotes in the backwash of history.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Young Victoria,"Historically - as far as the cinema is concerned - Queen Victoria was born well into her seventies. Rarely has anyone tried to depict her early years and sadly, this is a rather shallow attempt so to do. Emily Blunt portrays the Queen with some fortitude but the rather soppy performances from Rupert Friend and Paul Bettany don't give us anything like a proper comprehension of the struggle she had, as a (young) woman, to establish herself at the head of an empire riddled with chauvinism, ambition and pomposity. Miranda Richardson as her mother takes up some of the slack in this lacklustre effort with the occasional, wise, contribution from Harriet Walter as the dowager Queen Adelaide welcome too. If it is a love story, then it just about works - anything else is just too far out of reach.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The delightful part was that they truly loved each other,"It's a romantic drama set mainly in England from ca. 1836 to 1842. It follows Princess/Queen Victoria's (Emily Blunt) accession to the throne after her uncle, King William IV's death in 1837. We meet her mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), and her manipulative comptroller, Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). The Duchess and Sir John severely raise Victoria before she reaches age 18, as they wish to control her first years as Queen as Regents.Other players trying to manage Victoria's marital/political future are another uncle, King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann), who plans to marry his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg (Rupert Friend) off to Victoria. Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), a prominent Whig politician and Prime Minister, is also Victoria's confidante as a protector from Conroy.The film follows Victoria's fallout with her mother and Conroy, her carefully managed courtship with Albert and eventual marriage, early political mistakes, and the ultimate shared vision held by both Victoria and Albert.""Young Victoria"" is entertaining. Blunt, Friend, Richardson, Strong, and Bettany give good performances. To heighten and tighten the drama, Fellowes takes some historical liberties. Prince Albert was not injured by an anarchist's shot at Queen Victoria. Lord Melbourne was not a slightly more mature possible love interest; he was 40 years older than Victoria. Victoria's and Albert's marriage was assumed by many for years. But the delightful part portrayed in the movie was that they truly loved each other.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Boring...,I found no interest whatsoever in this story... It's messy. It felt like there is no script and just a montage.No chemistry between the 2 leads. This movie has no point. We don't see anything worth watching about her first years except some random scenes edited one after another.I don't see the point of making that film.,2.0,Anonymous,History
Reasonably accurate account of young Victoria,"Emily Blunt is way too good looking to be really convincing as the stoic Queen Victoria and there is little chemistry between her and Rupert Friend as Prince Albert, but that aside, this is a fairly good account of how Victoria's young life must have been, just before and after she inherited the throne at the age of just 18. Miranda Richardson as her mother, Mark Strong as her mother's advisor/lover possibly, Paul Bettany as Victoria's adviser and Prime Minister all turn in strong if a bit wooden performances. I don't know how real life is in the Palace so its hard to tell if the severity of life as its shown here is how it is between members of the Royal household but it makes me wonder if that's what was so difficult for Princess Diana and Meghan Markle. Maybe they couldn't conform as they had not grown up with it. The rules here are so strict its quite eye opening. Beautiful sets and costumes add to the grandeur and over all a fairly satisfying factual movie apart from an incident involving a firearm which does steal a bit of artistic licence but it's the only hiccup I noticed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Accomplished retelling of an interesting story,"A great script, lovely cinematography and excellent casting are among the many positives about this quality film. The writer is Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey) and director Jean-Marc Vallee, both very good operators. Emily Blunt is excellent as Queen Victoria - portraying her as a young human being and not some lofty deity. If anything, Blunt could have made her a little more posh. I don't think Blunt's accent is quite as correct as it should be. As Prince Albert, Rupert Friend is fantastic, too, although it is a somewhat straightforward role with little expressive room. Miranda Richardson is a great support as the meddling, attention seeking mother of Victoria, the Duchess of Kent, as is Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, the initial prime minister. Bettany tries to play Melbourne as a person not used to working with a young woman as his sovereign, or as someone in authority, which must have been strange for him. Best of all, the movie tells the tale clearly and entertainingly, and the pomp and ceremony and the music do not overwhelm the human side of the story. For example, the coronation is just a few scenes and does not drag on.",7.0,Anonymous,History
When Did Emily Blunt Become a Great Actress?,"She was outstanding as young Victoria. Deserves an Oscar nomination, absolutely. It seems I was just watching her as a working class lumpen prole in ""Sunshine Cleaning"" and now she's pulling off this role. It's simply incredible. I am now a devoted fan.The character who played Prince Albert was also outstanding. He really did an excellent job and played it perfectly I don't think your average movie goer can appreciate what an outstanding movie this is. Like it's earlier historical movie gem, ""Bright Star"", this film was simply mind boggling in its ability to portray life as it was back in the 1830's (""Bright Star"" was a tad earlier, 1820's).As for the rest of the film, it was first rate. The screenplay and cinematography was first rate. I am a devotee of historical dramas of this type, but it was truly an outstanding film and brought to life the relationship of Victoria and Albert.

Unnecessary - watch the TV mini-series instead,"I can only wonder why they bothered making this film so soon after the excellent and far superior 2001 TV production ""Victoria and Albert."" In comparison with that version, this one fails on almost every level. The lead performers have very little chemistry, and the episodic plot has no real through line. I got the feeling that the film had to be reworked in post production, given the choppy editing, the strange structure (the first half is presented as a flashback for no apparent reason), and the reliance on voice over to explain who's who and what's what. The director really likes to rack focus, which becomes incredibly annoying. And the digital backgrounds and compositing are quite obvious and distracting. There are some nice sets and excellent costumes, but that's no reason to waste 100 minutes of your life on this dud. Instead, rent the mini-series or one of the documentaries about Victoria if you're interested in the subject.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Like The Moves On A Chessboard,"With all of the films of recent,dealing with the British Monarchy,is it really time for another? Answer:YOU BET! The Young Victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from Britain dealing with the Royal family. In this case,it deals with the early life of Princess Victoria,and events leading up to the Coronation of her becoming Queen of all England,as well as her romance & eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both England's Queen & Prince,as well as several other events that transpire (political turmoil,etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth,while Rupert Friend is her beloved & best friend,Prince Albert. The rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of Miranda Richardson,as the Dutchess of Kent,and the always welcome on screen,Jim Broadbent as King William,as well as a cast of others that shine on screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.,Loser Love),directs from a winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair,Gosford Park,Separate Lies). I absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look (by cinematographer Hagen Bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look (with the help of production designer,Patrice Vermette),as well as some tight editing (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes' script is the use of a game of Chess,as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a Chess board). This is smart,well written,directed,filmed,edited & acted entertainment (and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema.

This Year's Costume Period Piece,"THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vall√©e of stalwart Julian Fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become England's longest reigning monarch - Victoria. Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend.

Visually stunning film with solid performances,"when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.To me the film feels like unfinished.

Splendidly Royal,"A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most people's cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne, and early years. Blunt's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could of been a throw-away role.Though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic ""acting"" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing. There are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing, the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period. The set design and costumes are outstanding.This film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history, period dramas, and of Blunt and the other actors. Heartily recommend.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,History
I absolutely loved this movie,"I really thought that this movie was superb. Not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert.The technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well. I appreciated the beautiful score, which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009's best!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A true story that seems fictional,"8.0 stars.Watching Emily Blunt do this movie is downright amazing. I was not really aware of who she was at the time this was made, although she was on the rise quickly. I am just now seeing this for the first time 14 years later. I believe it will be difficult for any filmmaker to equal or surpass this rendition of Victoria's life. The acting is superb, the set pieces are unrivaled, the emotional impact left me in an altered state for a while after. I kept forgetting that this is based on a real person, it felt like such a powerful and magical High Fantasy and yet there is no magic, or wizardry. I believe this was probably the movie that propelled her career, because it is probably my favorite movie of hers, if we are focusing specifically on her performance and character expression alone. As for movies in general, when it comes to period pieces, this one stands with the best of them, and I remind you, the competition is stiff.I wish all the European period piece films had such pristine cinematography as this. If they measured up to be as competently handled, we would all fall even more profoundly and helplessly in love with Anna Karenina, Elizabeth Bennett, and Jane Eyre than we already have.

Informative but insufficiently engaging,"Queen Victoria was Britain's longest-serving monarch, reigning for an incredible 63 years (1837-1901) and the abiding image of her is an aged and dour woman, but this film presents a very different picture, the run-up to and the early period after her taking the crown at the tender age of just 18. It was a challenge for Emily Blunt, still only in her mid twenties, to carry a major movie in this way but she gives a fine performance, by turns vulnerable, assertive, impetuous, and amorous.Diana, Princess of Wales, famously asserted that there were always three people in her marriage to Prince Charles and her royal predecessor Victoria - albeit in a different sense - had many people in her courtship with and marriage to her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Rupert Friend), most notably Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), and this account makes plain the personal and political manoeuvring around the teenager as she sought her independence.It is a fascinating history tale by French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vall√©e but, as a film, fails to excite or engage, since the script by Julian Fellowes does not come up to the standards of his work for ""Gosford Park"". Splendid settings and costumes are not enough.Footnote: Sarah Ferguson, once a member of the British royal family, was a producer on the film and one of her daughters, Beatrice, has a non-speaking and uncredited cameo role as a lady-in-waiting.",,Anonymous,History
Solid Take,"What better way to follow up a binge on George III than to watch the wrangling as his many children fail to produce an heir, save one.Victoria has been depicted so many times that the story itself is certainly familiar. Tune into this one for the keen ear on dialogue and the filming.Details are seen to. Actors are believable.(Remembering that this is fictionalized drama, not a history class.)I'd have liked a bit more of a taste of the larger family.However, Victoria's own close family--mother and advisor--is complex enough. That the Queen managed to take the throne at such a young age and keep it is incredible.A solid couple hours of storytelling. I do recommend a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Worth watching just for Emily Blunt's performance,"An interesting life story of Queen Victoria is presented in a rather dull way in this film. It feels as if the director did not know what he wanted to tell us. We see numerous times long and often boring shots of things that are best said once and quickly (queen's dog, stairs, or just nothing in particular), all at the expense of character introduction and development, and story.Most ""beats"" in the film have been flattened by heavy weight of dullness, important moments are downplayed, some less important ones are overdramatized for no reason, and the biggest satisfaction of watching this film comes from performances of the two young actors - Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend.While all actors did a great job, which is one redeeming quality of ""Young Victoria"", Emily Blunt steals the show yet again. To see her go through full transformation of her posture, walk, accent, facial expressions, even the way she cries, laughs and yells for every role, is enlightening. As much as I chose to watch this film because of her, I was immediately absorbed in her character and forgot that it was Ms. Blunt I was watching, rather than her young majesty.Fortunately, Emily Blunt's performance makes up for most of what is lacking in this film, so it is definitely worth watching (those five stars I gave to this film were mostly earned by Ms. Blunt).
