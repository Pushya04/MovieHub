Not  as good as 11...Much better than 12.,"Normally the sequel to a movie is a let down. Especially if the first part was really good. I think that's what's happened with Ocean's 12 for many but l hope this doesn't mean that they won't be watching '13'.I was happy to see all of the same characters and actors together again because that is one big cool cast. Not to mention Al Pacino...icing on the cake.Who could resist?For those who are in doubt about Ocean's 13, i hope you're not affected by some bad reviews because history doesn't repeat itself with this one. It's got an interesting story and some fabulous actors and acting. Don't miss out.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end,"'Ocean's Thirteen' marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy in a good way.It's slightly below the level of 'Ocean's Eleven' but does better 'Ocean's Twelve'. As with the preceding two, the cast elevate these films up with strong performances from George Clooney & Co. In regards to O13, I feel the plot is a tad drawn out though it does deliver by the end with its entertaining outcome.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining Yet Forgettable,"I went to see this movie with only one expectation, surely it cant be as bad as the second film. On this front i was greatly pleased as the sense of smugness surrounding twelve has been completely lost. The only real problem i had was that after the film finished i really struggled to remember anything particularly about it.The performances were all OK but no one really stood out, whereas Matt Damon was the only person i didn't want to slap in twelve, he never gets the chance to shine. Al Pacino has no chance to make a memorable villain out of the limited screen time leaving you not really caring if they can pull off the job or not. Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script, but it never rises above OK.The area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big, while inventive and different in the first film, just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters, when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.While flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Slightly Better Than Its Predecessor But Still No Match To The Original,"Slightly better than Ocean's Twelve but still not close to Ocean's Eleven, the third & final entry in The Ocean's Trilogy finds the original gang returning to Las Vegas for one last heist as things get a bit personal in this concluding chapter. Retaining the cool style & lighthearted vibe of its predecessors, the film does many things right but is still forgettable in the end.The story of Ocean's Thirteen is set in motion when one of the original eleven is double crossed by his former business partner who now owns his new hotel-casino. When the gang finds out about it, they decide to avenge him by concocting a plan to spoil the new hotel's opening night but to pull it off, they turn to a foe who shares their contempt for the common enemy and offers his assistance.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Ocean's Thirteen marks a little improvement over its predecessor and, by taking a persona route, brings something new to the table. The light, playful tone remains in tact but the premise is more involving than it was the last time. Also, unlike the previous entry, the new addition to the ensemble plays a key role in the plot and has an interesting arc of his own.While the story has an interesting outline, the writers still end up making the plot complex and not easy to follow. Not every twist n turn makes sense, some moments are as ludicrous as the second film's museum robbing sequence, and it expects the viewer to just go along with everything that's unfolding without questioning the logic of it all. Sometimes, it does work. Other times, it doesn't.Coming to the performances, the original eleven return to reprise their respective roles once again. Vincent Cassel also makes an appearance while the most notable amongst the new additions is Al Pacino who plays the antagonist and utilises his infectious persona to great effect. Clooney & Pitt once again lead from the front but Damon gets a promotion as well while the rest play their part as expected.On an overall scale, Ocean's Thirteen is a satisfactory conclusion to the saga of Danny Ocean & his associates, if not a memorable one, and offers a good, lighthearted dose of fun & amusement just like its predecessors. It corrects a few mistakes that were made in the second instalment but also ends up creating some new ones which stop it from reaching the heights & delights of the original. Nevertheless, it's worth a shot.",,Anonymous,Crime
Hits the Jackpot!,"I was a huge fan of Ocean's Eleven, it was smart, witty, funny and in my opinion the best remake I have ever seen. The great cast and the smart dialogue just made it a pleasure to watch, leading my expectations to reach phenomenal levels before seeing its follow up, Ocean's Twelve. So perhaps that is why Ocean's Twelve seemed such a let down, my expectations were to high. As a result of this originally my expectations for Ocean's Thirteen were horribly low, I contemplated not even seeing it at one point. However after re watching Ocean's Eleven, I decided to give it a chance, perhaps Soderbergh at made an effort this time, perhaps it would reclaim the glory of the original movie. Thankfully it has not only reclaimed my respect for the series, but also produced, in my eyes, the best entry so far. The return to Las Vegas has also seen a return of a great script, a plot that is followable, decent jokes and also just a sense of fun that Ocean's Twelve was sorely lacking. In many ways this makes up for the mistake that was the past movie, this is the sequel we should have had. In actual fact, apart from maybe a couple of details, this movie has next to nothing following on from the second movie. This is a good thing as it allows more people to see the quality first movie and then not have to worry about seeing the horrific second one before seeing the best of the series.Ocean's Eleven worked particularly well because of its starry cast, and the fact the cast were clearly having an absolute ball making the movie. We had George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and loads more. Ocean's Twelve saw the inclusion of more stars, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel. In Ocean's Thirteen two of the cast members have gone, thankfully the lack of Julia Roberts and Zeta-Jones doesn't leave a mark at all. In fact it seems a bit of a breath of fresh air, and even fresher when the reasoning for them not being in the movie is explained with one line of dialogue. But to make up for their disappearance we get Al Pacino in their stead, and trust me he more than makes up for it. Andy Garcia was a great villain in the original, but he lack the menace that Al Pacino has. He easily steals the beginning of the movie, and he threatens to steal it for the whole movie as well. He isn't overused, and he's certainly never underused. He's the best villain this series has had and it makes the quality of the movie increase. But of course this is still the original elevens' movie, and all of them get their moments to shine. George Clooney is still the best, he's such a great actor to watch as he just oozes star quality. He's the kind of person you wouldn't mind meeting in real life because he seems a genuinely nice guy. He's also used more in this movie, unlike in Twelve where he seemed to co-star in a movie with his name in the title. Brad Pitt is used less than Twelve here, and thankfully that works as well. My biggest problem with Twelve was the fact Rusty took centre stage, and in my opinion Rusty isn't an interesting character. In small doses he's brilliant, but in large doses his character just isn't good enough. Matt Damon has some great comedic moments here and there, Andy Garcia continues his role with style, Eddie Izzard's character actually seems to have a point here, and all the rest of the cast just carries on perfectly. They're all having a blast and they put their all into this movie.So what of the actual storyline then? Well the actual motives for this movie seems to have improved a lot. Ocean's Twelve's storyline just didn't work for me, I liked the fact that they had to re-pay their money to Bennedict, but I didn't like the fact it got all involved with Vincent Cassel's jewel thief. Here though its all about revenge, and it works better here. It also helps that Al Pacino's Willy Bank is such a jerk that you can't wait to see the gang exact their revenge on him. How they do it, and if they do it I will leave as a surprise, and trust me there are a few little surprises install along the way. Some characters show up that you don't expect to show up, and also the movies pacing is tremendous. It throws you in at the deep end, the planning stage isn't very long, its all about the actual heist pretty much. The opening and the first half is generally talking, which some people might dislike. I personally loved it as the conversations were brilliant, and the quick fire dialogue a welcome relief from the clunky blockbuster stuff I'm used to at the moment.Overall Ocean's Thirteen is a masterclass in smart, silly blockbusters. Its storyline is preposterous, and how the heist goes is a bit silly, but that's part of the fun, that's what makes the Ocean's series in general such a blast. The movies ooze style (yes even Twelve to some extent). If this is the final movie of the Ocean's series, and I personally believe it is, then they have the left the series on a very high. This has the potential to end up being the best Blockbuster of the summer, a surprise as I really didn't expect much from this. I highly recommend it, its cool, funny slick and most importantly of all, very cool.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Suave but a Bit Flat,"I liked ""Oceans 13,"" but I wanted to love it.I love the handsome stars, the great clothes, the nifty sets, the music -- David Holmes' score is a really fun, retro trip back to 1965. I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: ""I just bit into a pepper,"" a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.But I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous ""Ocean"" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.There is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.There wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in ""Ocean's 11"" or Vincent Cassel in ""Ocean's 12."" ""Ocean's 13"" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.Al Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.The movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman ""of a certain age."" ""Oceans 13"" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Really good,"They are back and now there are 13...The movie is any day better than ocean's twelve (which i think was really bad) but still not as good as the original! All of them are back and why not with such an amazing director and support group who wouldn't come back. Al Pacino is fantastic as always and adds that extra bit to the movie.Story is actually at par with the first one and 20 times better than the second movie! Got to see an early screening and loved it. I don't want to spoil the movie. But one thing is true that the story is again complicated and its for the better only as the more complicated the better. Acting as always amazing.After disappointments of spider-man 3, shrek 3 and to some extent POC 3, this one s easily better than the above three and thus this is a must watch 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good closing,"This movie is at the level of the first.With an exciting story that captivates the viewer, the film manages to give us a good robbery story, with well-executed plot twists, good story development, good production design and funny moments.

Lucky Number 13,"Danny Ocean and his Eleven are back in Las Vegas. This time, Danny tries to talk sense into Willie Bank, the owner of a series of highly rated ""5 Diamonds"" hotels who double-crossed one of Eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), on a hotel deal causing the man a heart-attack and coma-like state. After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben ""rolls over and dies"", Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night.The third Ocean's movie is great fun and a wonderful mixture of genres that works as comedy/crime/thriller/revenge. Vegas is spectacular. The jokes are funny, the dialogs are witty, the directing is first class with the split screens, unusual angles, and the camera that always moves fast but does not rush. The acting is terrific. The absence of Julia Roberts and Katherine Zeta Jones is more than compensated by the presence of great Ellen Barkin who is a better actress than two and a hot beautiful woman, the real ""cougar"". Besides Ocean and his Eleven (who all have fun with their parts but this time Carl Reiner was simply outstanding), it was good to see David Paymer as an unlucky (or was he?) hotel reviewer and Eddie Izzard as a famous computer hacker. Did I mention that Al Pacino took the role of Willie Bank and he was excellent playing in his quiet mode without screaming which I like a lot? There are certainly the holes in the story and the absence of logic but I did not care a bit. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not about logic or plausibility or realism, it is all about fun and entertaining and it entertains admirably. It is a very successful and enjoyable sequel in the series of Ocean's movies and we all know that good sequels don't happen too often.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Good Movie To Watch And Multi-Task With,"Have you ever watched a film while multi-tasking? Well if you have, you should do it again but this time put on Ocean's Thirteen. I would not describe myself as a fan of the Oceans' movies but I have pretty much enjoyed all of them. In light of that though this is the worst one of the series.The movie is very well acted in that it appears the whole cast has fun with the material from top to bottom. That does not make it a good film though it just makes it a nice to get together. One thing I could say though was this time around I actually noticed Casey Affleck because of his recent breakout performances in other films. So with that, he and Al Pacino just adds to the fun of watching all the great actors and stars in the film. The script is very witty at times and did have me chuckle more often then not. What was missing though were the star actresses. Tangle in all the fun of a crazy scheme to rob a casino, gambling and just Las Vegas is the women. It would have been great to see Julia Roberts or Catherina Zeta Jones or even both back for the film. Instead we had to settle with Ellen Barkin who has not nearly as an impressive career or persona as her counterparts.As the rest of the series this film really is not too thought provoking or deep. It won't inspire you to do something so honestly it won't be too necessary to focus all your thoughts on this film. This is an entertaining film considering George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac and Casey Affleck are in it but yet it isn't as well made or enjoyable as its predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great design, great technical realization, good actors but weak story","Since I am a fan of the first two movies I expected a funny and thrilling film. What carried the viewer through its predecessors (great retro design, music etc.) now isn't enough for a really good movie. The story itself could be summed up too quickly. The preparation for the big thievery starts almost from the beginning of the film and it's justification is really poor. What can be really enjoyed are the colorful visuals and a bunch of stars that seem to enjoy themselves. All this prevents a worse vote. To me it seems that Hollywood is running out on ideas at the moment. Sequels are obviously attractive from a financial point of view but bear the risk that they are produced and conceived not careful enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen.,"""The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief."" Shakespeare's OthelloAndy Garcia's wealthy Terry Benedict is financing Danny Ocean's Vegas heist from casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino) in order to get the last smile of vengeance, thief to thief, while Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) exact their own revenge. No honor among these slick reprobates, and good time is had by all the men and, this time, not Julia Roberts, but Clooney's real-life squeeze, Ellen Barkin, as Abigail Sponder, tough right hand to Bank.I go to most movies as a film critic with my sensibility well-guarded against the fluffy confection of just another heist. But the Ocean's franchise, like the Bond's, has a cachet all its own with eye-pleasing duds, high-tech high jinx, and self-referential dialogue. Thus I am free to enjoy without feeling as if I'd sold out to crass commercialismI have, but willfully and pleasurably.I guess I'm sucked in like everyone else at the movies, even with as many as I've seen and written about, because I want to go where the director, in this case the estimable Steven Soderbergh, wants to take me. In Ocean's 12, it was all over Europe; in Thirteen it's the entertainment Mecca of the Western world.No deep thoughts come to mind, just summer mindlessness dressed up for partying (Pitt and Clooney very nicely decked out, understatedly). Clooney's musings about the changes in Vegas since guys like him had shaken Sinatra's hand serves as ""change"" leitmotif lighter than air. Twenty years from now we'll be talking about the iconic Pitt and Clooney in the same nostalgic way. Ocean's Thirteen reinforces its place in popular culture as a repository for our transitory adulation of movie stars and the escapes they gave us long ago.At the end, Matt Damon exits with ""See you when I see you,"" a fitting piece of noncommittal that may promise another Ocean's installment or just more star sightings. Clooney says goodbye to Pitt with an in-joke the world is in on: ""Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Pitt retorts, ""Have a couple of kids."" This is typical of the low-key, sweetly narcissistic third installment.Ocean's hits a lucky thirteen this time around without a big jackpot but a great deal of good will.",,Anonymous,Crime

Gone...,"When I visited the Warner Studios in Los Angeles last year, my family and me had a tour; the guide was explaining to us that most of the stages, at that time, were being used for the movie ""Ocean's 13"". I recognized the Bank Casino in the film; I saw it when they were constructing it. My point is that if they were using all these stages for one movie, it involved big money, big production. Was all of this money unnecessarily spent? No, because they're getting it back with interests.However, ""Ocean's 13"" is, by all means, an unnecessary film. We keep getting all these sequels (there are more coming, don't count them) and it's hard to see one doing things right. At least this Ocean travesty is not the embarrassment that was ""Mission Impossible 3"", but it's too much for Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the guys; they've taken it too far.I invited a friend to watch the film and he said he didn't want to because he hadn't seen the first two. Well, you don't really need to watch the first two installments to watch this one, if you date to plan to. You see? The only connection between the three pictures is the cast, the director and David Holmes' entertaining and very loud score. The three films were written by different people and involve one or more big heists that develop throughout the piece; you don't need to be a genius to write something funny and the effort is less if persons like a relaxed Clooney, Pitt and Pacino (what a waste) are saying your lines.The formula worked well in the first two movies. A lot of people didn't like ""Ocean's 12"" because they said it didn't take itself seriously, and because it used Julia Roberts as herself for a very funny scene. The truth is that ""Ocean's 11"" didn't take itself seriously either; it was just Soberbergh and his actors having fun. And the fact that they wanted to travel to Europe and that they invented a plot line to pull the second film off there is so joyful; because cinema can be about having fun and that's the formula these guys chose: slick fun.But when ""Ocean's 13"" begins, you can sense something's missing; it's the fun. Maybe it's because the script takes itself too seriously, maybe because it tries to be funny at the same time, or because the actors are not feeling their characters any longer. Maybe the whole movie takes itself seriously (which I doubt), but that naturalness and coziness I mentioned is gone; and the film just doesn't flow.Fortunately, Soderbergh's camera is still a highlight, filling the piece with complex and riveting shots, and the old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould have a blast; but Casey Affleck's Spanish speaking and an entire Mexican plot line is completely out of place. Let's just hope the honorable Soderbergh doesn't get the team back for a fourth round: it's not working anymore.One more thing: there's a character played by David Paymer...It must be one of the most unfortunate characters in movie history...Watch and tell me if I'm wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Excuse to Hang Out in Vegas,"It's been about 48 hours now since I saw ""Ocean's Thirteen."" I saw it with a group of people (the only way to see a movie), and the movie took so long to get going, I really got the impression that my friends were hating it. The theater didn't laugh very often, I laughed less, and when the lights came up, my friends told me what a good movie it was. ""Definitely better than the second,"" they said.I disagreed, but it took me a while to figure out why. ""O13"" isn't bad, per se, and I didn't really hate it while I was watching it, though it did take a while for it to get going. I think, ultimately, the reason the first movie was so good, was because it was fun, funny, and witty, but still knew the difference between ""when to be funny"" and ""when to not be funny."" Andy Garcia's character was dangerous, and treated as such. The situations were potentially dangerous, and you got the sense of real peril for the characters. You knew what was at stake. It was a real movie, and just as good on repeat viewings, due to a really original and fresh approach (as well as some great one-liners).The second movie wasn't reviewed nearly as well, and having watched it again since, it's really not bad either, except for the huge and sudden changes in tone throughout, as well as the fact that it pulls the last 10 minutes out of its rear end. It was originally written as a different movie, then re-tooled for the ""Ocean's"" cast, and you can kinda tell; it's darker, tries to be more clever than it actually is, and as a result, is a lot less fun.Whatever strengths the first two movies may or may not have had, the third is lacking them all, except the actors. Everyone from Clooney on down, including Pacino, Vincent Cassel and Eddie Izzard, all bring their A-game, and are pleasant to watch. But the plot is minimal; whether there was a screenplay or not (and there was, from the writers of ""Rounders""), you still get the impression that this is just an excuse for buddies to hang out in Vegas and shoot a movie, a la ""Blue in the Face"" back in the mid-1990's. No one has to do any heavy lifting, and the only actors who even try are the bickering brothers of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan, and of course Pacino, though he could be phoning it in too, and you'd never know it.Whether you're a movie fanatic or not, the three films can still be summed up by their opening shots. In the first film, cut to: a chair. Clooney sits down in it. The movie itself is really about him, and what makes his Danny Ocean tick, not just before, but during, and after the action. In the second film, cut to: a magnifying glass. Brad Pitt walks into a room, and the next 100 minutes is a closer look at Rusty's life and his relationship with the woman he wakes up in that first scene. Third film? Cut to: a toy store. Yeah, that sounds about right. Soderbergh ain't so dumb.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sexual Editing,"Is this the most valuable franchise in film? Will it last for a decade?I like Soderbergh. I even like him when he has no goal in the world but making money through simple entertaining.I like him because he actually thinks about film. About the bullets the towels. The phrases and melodies.Superficially, this has two overt components. One is the well established con form. The strict version is that we don't fully understand what is going on and ""see"" it only at the end. Then it all makes sense. This is a weaker version where we see some of the plotting and problems. This is where the jokes are.The second overt component is simply coolness. Its the sort of coolness that Apple-inspired ad editing has given us, in opposition to the heavy rap-gangster intimidation-coolness of the last great sales cycle. This is referenced within the movie with a bit about an all American black jumper (with a Jewelled flag on his teeth). Its colorful, fast. The pace is translucent with the music. Vegas Cellophane. The actors are cool. Even Matt Damon, who knows cool, plays uncool with coolness.But its the technique here that impresses. Shots have shape and how those shapes are modulated (as they usually are not) and then assembled with those shapes forming new ones, is a matter of unique style with this filmmaker. Look at how fertile soft ends are punctured by sharp beginnings so that the very passage of time in the eye here is a matter of conceptual copulation.Look at how many shots end on one of those colored artificial flavors and create a romantic movie at the atomic level as if a John Coltrane was compressing a thousand easy ballads into a few moments. This takes knowledge and the filmmaker has to actually operate the camera to pull this off. It was in his ""Limey"" and not in the other Ocean's.And it takes an editor who knows. The best editor was found fresh off ""Babel"" which among other variations, had the three segments vary on shotshape assembly. This matters.

Yawn !,"Its time now to end the series NOW before it causes any more embarrassment. Even an entire troupe of stars cannot save a movie if it lacks a soul.Oceans 13 is all about a star studded cast doing their own thing. Not one manages to create a connection with the audience. Even the great Al Pacino has his limitations when the script does not allow any scope for character development.This time around the pack wants to settle the score with sly and hardboiled Willie Bank (Al Pacino) for duping their colleague Reuben (Elliot Gould). The plan is simple. Willie Bank has to go bankrupt on the opening night of his casino.To narrate how they go about it, the movie drags through the first half, and then drags some more during the second. There are just too many characters around and many more angles to think your way through.I give this movie a 6/10 just for giving the audience the likes of Pacino, Clooney, Pitt, Matt, Don Cheadle and Garcia to feast their eyes upon.Chill out on your bean bag and wait for the DVD release to watch this flick.

Can't wait to see what 'Ocean's 20' will be like in 10 years.....,".....I guess Carl Reiner will be about 115 years old by then. His son must be so proud.I liked this film. The ensemble cast, as usual, was true to form and all interacted well. Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and the Asian guy (whose name, regrettably, I don't remember) in a much appreciated somewhat expanded role, among others, all shine in their performances. I liked watching these GUYS on screen in concentrated form. David Paymer as the long suffering hotel reviewer gets the Best Actor award for this film. He's very good and fun to watch whenever he's on screen. There was a noticeable lack of a strong female presence. Weakest links...Pacino, doing his same old Al Pacino thing in a really bad toupee, Garcia, paunchy acting, paunchy looking, and especially Ellen Barkin whose performance seemed stilted and wooden. Guess she needs to get some remediation at Lee Strasburg's since she's been out of it for so long. Additionally, some of the camera angles employed in her scenes make her look very old, and there are a couple of shots where her breasts look like coconut halves glued to her chest. I enjoy Bernie Mac's presence and expressiveness, but will someone please get him a gift certificate for elocution lessons for Christmas? I can understand only about half of what he's saying when he speaks.The plot development was pretty good and, as in the previous two installments, I enjoyed seeing the plan come together. I thought, however, that the initial premise for the heist was a bit weak...poor, poor Elliot...but how could he NOT see that coming ?! I tried to forget that the Chunnel drills were left at the bottom of the English Channel, since they CAN'T go backwards or be retrieved after the job was completed. The strike at the dice factory was fun to watch unfold and the monetary resolution made me laugh out loud. And just HOW long will Barkin and Damon sip wine before finally 'gettin' down to binness'? The movie's very glitzy and Vegas-y and made me think that I'd like to visit Vegas again after not having been there since all those renovations have taken place, about 14 years.The main objection I have is the cost of the experience. $8.50 to get in, $5. for a SMALL popcorn, I brought my own bottle of water....$13.50 total!!!

slow and steady,"The thing about these kind off movies is that when the plot get hyped up, that's when it gets slowed down. So the momentum is not consistent which is why I sat at the edge of my seat during this movie.Al Pacino did well for his part as Willy Bank. Any role given to him, will be done flawlessly. The casting for the Ocean's series is as usual, excellent. People might think that this is a flop, simply because they compare it to the first movie. If you do not like, slow and draggy movies, and all you want is action packed crap with explosions and fireworks, O13 will offer you very less of that. The slow pace of this movie has its reason because it is the calm style the director wants to put in.Comedy...is maturely done and I was laughing out loud because of its precise delivery.All in all, Ocean's Thirteen may not be as good as the first movie, but its a good way to walk around with style.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Much better than 12.,"Having recently decided to watch this trilogy I had no expectations hitting this third one as I found Ocean's 12 to be quite a poor film. But they have done a great job of returning to its roots and making an entertaining heist movie again.So first off a welcome change from the other 2 is that it binned off any sort of romantic storyline and focused entirely on the heist. I never got drawn in by them so for me this is a big positive.I found the film jumped right into it. No messing around, you know the deal 2 minutes in. And for a sequel I think this is a good thing. We know the deal, just get on with it.I also find that focusing on the heist (which is what they did throughout) is just so much better generally. You watch these kinds of films for the heist and the action that follows. So it's nice to watch and I found it very entertaining.Beyond that, the acting is very good. It's a pleasant ending with no unanswered questions and it's an interesting plot that wants you wanting to know what's going to happen next.The one thing I thought they could have done a bit better is that the characters are quite forgettable so when one isn't on screen for a bit you forget their existence. I stated that the first film did a very good job of avoiding exactly this, but unfortunately it didn't land as well.But yeah, it's a very good film and a good trilogy on the whole. I personally find that the 2nd film lets it down and stops it being in the loop for great trilogies. But this and the first instalments are very very good and I'd recommend to anyone.Ps. I'm also glad it stopped here, an Ocean's 14 would have killed it off completely so they stopped at the right time.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
it works,"""Ocean's thirteen"" is a good way to spend a movie - going evening. This extension of Danny's gang story is pleasant, makes even laugh and stars many unbeatable actors. Story is not badly paced, although some twists are really stupid; it doesn't have the magic that would make it a perfect movie but it's pretty involving and has some good thrills as well. Different from other stellar movies since it's not pretentious and can give a light buzz too; expected a more likely plot (how can they break those safes, crash those security systems?) but found it enjoyable. Its only problem is maybe the story moving too fast and some jokes ending up being too silly",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Better than 12 but too much going on,"Despite everyone slagging off Ocean's 12, I quite liked it. It was fun and silly, as opposed to the fun and cool of Ocean's 11. 13 definitely goes back to the first's style. However, it never really felt like it got going.Ocean's 11 was simple idea - steal money from a vault in a complex way. Ocean's 13 was similar in that its back in Vegas, they're stealing money but this time the stakes are higher with revenge on the cards.Spoilers However, despite it having this stronger motive, you never really felt that everyone was really up for it. The plan has too many aspects to it (the fixed tables, the jewels, the reviewer, Andy Garcia, the earthquake, the Mexican factory) and so lacks focus and a really good pay off.As for Garcia, he's barely in it. I'm not sure why the felt they could write Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones out in one line but have to keep Garcia in (answer: money).However, apart from its faults, it was better than 12, but not as good as 11. The revenge aspect does ad really drive to the story, but it ends up pushing it off in too many directions.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Funny Popcorn,"When Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) is double-crossed in a real state business with a luxury hotel in Las Vegas by Willie Bank (Al Pacino), he has a heart attack. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) plots a heist with their friends to revenge Reuben breaking Bank's casino.The first point that calls the attention in ""Ocean's Thirteen"" certainly is the constellation of stars in the cast. The shallow screenplay makes this movie a funny popcorn, with a reasonable story and good acting. The producers that invested a high budget in the cast could have been more ambitious and selected also a better screenplay and director. Anyway, in spite of being disappointed with the flawed story, the film is entertaining and it is worthwhile watching it.

I wish I hadn't bothered. So many thing annoyed me about this movie-1. George Clooney and Brad Pitt (Especially Brad Pitt!) Far far far too smug!!!2. No Story, and I mean NO STORY, pointless almost, well except for the heist that is.3. Al Pacino wasted, a very subdued performance from a great actor. Poor character development.4. Too long.5. Too smart a**ed, they had an OTT answer for EVERYTHING, and it started getting irritating after 10 min's of the movie.6. SMUG............AGAIN..............!!!!7.

Matt Damon, under used but really quite good when on screen.2. Ellen Barkin, funny and a great character.3.........No lets just stop at 2, can't think of anymore.Overall I hated this movie, will give it 2 stars for the two ""good"" points.Keep your money in your pocket and avoid this self obsessed, over indulgent mess.** out of **********",,Anonymous,Crime
"Very cool, chic and fun but not great","I have been a fan of the Oceans franchise and this latest installment was quite a let down, It follows the same formula as the 2 previous however to myself it really felt rushed. There was no area where you thought how the hell are they going to get out of this one as in previous movies, you sort of new exactly how it was going to happen.There seemed to be just far too many characters and because of that the actors have no time to develop any depth to their characters.The best points in this movie as always for myself is the wonderful dialogue between clooney and pitt, and the ultra chic music that thumps along and makes you want to run off to vegas and join Oceans team lol.At no point in this movie did I exclaim ""What The ?"", was more like ""cool but i saw that one coming"" Overall this is a wonderful, fun filled ride, however ultimately it brings nothing new to the franchise and adds nothing fresh.

Unlucky 13?,I saw this film on a plane and fell asleep multiple times. There was nothing to keep my attention and the story seemed to be hastily cobbled together so the team could capitalize on the previous two films. Many mysteries remain for me - who kept calling Brad Pitt? What did he and Clooney keep talking about? What exactly was Matt Damon doing in the film? I only realized just now that the villainous guy who double crossed Eliot Gould was Al Pacino! So Al acted well enough to camouflage his usual persona. That is a plus.The software guy first went on and on about how the system was unbreakable then Bingo he had a way to break it! The other cast - who knows what they were doing - some guy used to keep dealing cards and getting them all over the floor.I have to say that star power is an awesome thing - even with complete lack of coherence and intelligence in how the plot was cobbled together every time I woke up either Matt or Clooney or Brad kept my eyes glued to the screen for a few minutes before the snoozies set in. Any other cast and no one would look twice at this film; heck they would walk out in the first 20 minutes.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"I hated ""Ocean's 11,"" I hated ""Ocean's 12""....","...but I loved this movie. So take it from me. Being that I wasn't a fan of the previous two movies, I was mainly wanted to see it because Al Pacino's in the cast. Well, as usual, Al gives a fine performance, but that wasn't the main reason I liked it. I don't know what this film has that the other films lacked, but it just clicked for me. The story was tight, the gags worked, I loved the fast-paced, quick-witted dialogue (the characters speak like those out of a 1950's movie), and there were only a few dull moments. This time I actually found myself cheering for the guys to pull off the heist. Everyone in the cast gave it their all, never upstaging one another. Maybe part of what worked was the absence of dull subplots. I didn't care much for the relationship between George Clooney and Julia Roberts in the original film. This film mainly focuses on the big score. So go see the film! It's a great popcorn flick that never drags. It's all you can ask out of a summer blockbuster.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tight Script Was Perfectly Executed,"I'm not going to waste anyones time with a brief summary of the film but i will say this: This movie was extremely fun and enjoyable from beginning to end.To begin with, nearly the entire movie is the team pulling the job against Willie Bank, and thats perfectly suitable because their was a lot to tell. Looking in at the entire scheme of things, their were a lot of little mini-jobs the crew had to pull off to make the whole thing work, and it was very fun watching them do it.Granted the script was globe-trotting a bit and did have some minor plot ""incontinuites"" but any simpleton should be able to decipher it and appreciate it. All the humorous inside jokes and funny one-liners are back to. The Cinematography was elegant and the music (composed by David Holmes) was second to none and blended nicely with the films late 60s early 70s motif.I for one loved Ocean's Eleven and really liked Ocean's Twelve (believe it or not).

"Where are all the women? Oh, there they are, taking their clothes off...","Much can be said regarding the problems with the two Ocean's sequels. They are gratuitous, seeking to indulge viewers in the personality traits and in-jokes we found charming in the first film, but which have now become overdone and drag down the films' humor. Premises and plot lines have become bloated and ever more unbelievable, crammed so full of twists and intricacies that any given detail is under-explained to the point of confusion.Generally speaking, Ocean's Thirteen is better than Twelve in all these respects. However, this one sinks to a new low: our heroes drug a woman (with pheromones) so she will engage in sexual activity with one the operatives and bring him into a private area where he can pull off a heist.In other words, producers hired just one woman actor--so that they could write a sexual assault plot about her.

We've been mugged,"At the heart of this film is a robbery that is just too easy to carry out but nets huge proceeds - and that just about describes the movie itself. ""Ocean's 12"" was so disappointing that it did not merit a sequel, but clearly the franchise was just so profitable that nobody could resist the temptation to milk the audience one more time.In fact, ""Ocean's 13"" is not as bad as ""Ocean's 12"" with a much simpler - arguably too simple - plot, but it is nowhere near as good as ""Ocean's 11"".It is such a lazy work: the same director and the same stars back in the original location have just spun the wheel one more time with no thought for more characterisation or some originality. The main stars, George Clonney and Brad Pitt, are more than pretty faces, as we saw in ""Syriana"" and ""Babel"" respectively, and Al Pacino and Andy Garcia are sadly underused, with even the one female character Ellen Barkin utterly wasted.Yet, as before, Steven Soderbergh keeps things moving along and gives us plenty of flashy scenery and camera-work, so many viewers will not notice that they've been mugged.",,Anonymous,Crime
An Above Average End To The Trilogy,"Now I have finished the original Ocean's trilogy with the film Ocean's Thirteen and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the crew aim to complete a heist for revenge, to do this they must team up with former enemy Tony Benedict.Main Character
George Clooney and Brad Pitt are back as Danny Ocean and Rusty and it is easy to see they are having a great time in their roles and there great chemistry is still here for all to see. The reason I have put them together this time is that neither character is really given much development to work with. There is one scene together that works well but there isn't enough and like I said in my Ocean's Twelve review it feels like there characters aren't interesting but you like them because of who the actors are.Supporting Characters
Matt Damon is given more to do in this film and the film actually gives him a bit of a character amd personality and it is nice to see, he has a story throughout the three films and it is nice to see it conclude in this film. Al Pacino plays the bad guy in the film and he is really fun to watch, he is a dastardly buisnessman but he is very entertaining and it is really fun seeing him react to what exactly is going on in his hotel. Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle and Casey Affleck also do good jobs in there role in the team and it is entertaining to watch them with the crew. Andy Garcia back as Tony Benedict is pretty entertaining to watch, I mean he doesn't do that much in the film but I like watching him interact with the crew.Story
The story has a more personal feel to it, there is a real reason for them attempting the heist and especially at the beginning of the film I was behind the crew in there plans. But honestly the rest of the story is a bit of a mess, it is just way too convoluted, the crew are split up with their prep work and it just takes ages. The first film was intelligent with its story but doesn't make it absurd, this film is even worse then the 2nd film for this, it is crazy and actually a bit hard to follow. It also becomes ridiculous that they could even have planned for certain things that take place. Also this film has the generic idea with the good guys teaming up with a former foe to take down a new bad guy but it isn't the worst part of the film.Script
The script for me is the worst one in the series so far, the comedy is at the lowest comedy yet. I don't think I laughed at all even when the film really tries and goes overboard with it, plus the drama is thrown out after a time and you actually forget why this is so personal to the crew after a while. Also this film tries to be too smart and just becomes really convoluted and too much to care about and get invested in.Style
The style of the film returns to Las Vegas which is nice to see, it feels like an homage to the first film and at times it sometimes has that feel to it. But as mentioned the pacing is a bit all over the place it just takes too long to plan and then takes a long time to execute and that makes this film feel a bit boring at times.Overall
Overall, I actually think this is an above average film it has some entertaining moments but doesn't live up to Ocean's 11 and is only really worth a watch if you really love the first film.Rating - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Oceans 13: A Success, But Please..............No Oceans 14!!!","After the debacle that was Oceans 12, in addition to the recent lukewarm trilogy's this summer, it was good to see the boys back on track in this slick prequel.The writing, script and general interaction between the characters seemed more worthwhile than its predecessor. However, despite the vast improvement, there were some elements of mediocrity. The middle portion of the film seemed laboured and haphazard. the plot becomes too confusing for its own good; but fortunately, it leads to a conclusive, if slightly unsatisfying finale.Nevertheless, it's a good movie to kick of the summer, and will very emphatically erase any memory of the over-indulgent Oceans 12",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tribute to the 1970s hit movies, its sole purpose is to entertain and generate profit for the studio that produced it. Unlike Ocean's Twelve, the public have a lot more fun","The action of Thirteen Men and a New Secret is brought from Europe in the previous film to a typical American scene, also present in the 2001 production: the city of Las Vegas. Known as one of the right destinations for those interested in fun, the location is ideal for Danny Ocean's gang to not only materialize their revenge plan, but, above all, to have fun. And that is what they seem to do together in this film, more than ever. Consequently, the viewer is also able to revel in the elegant and tasteful entertainment offered by Ocean's Thirteen which is much more dynamic and lean compared to the previous production.Thirteen Men and a New Secret decides to close the trilogy with a return to the origins, with nothing to add much quality to what has already been shown. Like a pale shadow from the first film, this third film is direct with its audience, acting as the opposite of the second. A hit, since the focus of Eleven Men was one of the strengths of his success. A mistake, however, in setting aside any explanation, betting on a crazier plan than usual and neglecting subplots and details that would enrich the film. Eleven Men brought, with the pardon of the pun, the secret that was able to deepen the fun and call the spectator along the journey. In short, Thirteen Men makes no effort to hide the mere copy that it is: more faded, more hurried and less spirited.Somehow, paradoxically, this lack of pretension works better on some points than the arrogance of its predecessor. The European adventures of Twelve Men and Another Secret are left behind, and the romantic messes of Eleven Men and One Secret: what matters now is the pure and immediate revenge, the blow well done and all the elements of the plan working out. content. And who wins with that is the spectator, who is attentive to each movement or new situation. An important point, present even more strongly, is good humor. By focusing again on a single shot in Las Vegas, the film speaks the language it taught its audience and delivers what every fan expects. It is impossible not to have fun with the cast holding the ends, just as it is impossible to have more fun in this film than in the first. Pieces on the table, the emulation of the first film entertains. It is obvious that the addition of Al Pacino to the star mix is a hit. Linus gains more prominence while Rusty and Danny share the lead. In addition to the subtle evolution of such characters, some others are better used - it is great to see Bernie Mac in the casinos in one of his last films in his life.By the way, Ocean's Thirteen, a character turns to Danny Ocean (Clooney) and says: ""You are analog players in a digital world"". For the phrase, used there to demoralize Ocean and her group of ""high-class picks"", stating that they are outdated, is actually the great compliment and defense that can (and should) be made from this series. In full force of the dictatorship of computer graphics and special effects as the main audience attraction for ""summer films"" (which is also referred to in the film, when colleagues enjoy their Chinese partner, a film stuntman, for having made a film with digital effects), Clooney, Soderbergh and company seem to derive an extra pleasure from reaffirming themselves as analog products in a digital world. All its attraction comes down to elements as old as the dominant Hollywood cinema: absolute mastery of the narrative, scripts full of great insights and dialogues and, most of all, a lot of charisma from the actors who play with their own image all the time, thus assuming that they are much more than just characters on the scene, generating several internal jokes (Clooney recommending that Pitt should marry and have children, reference to the actor's marriage to Angelina Jolie and the various children that the two have, adopted or not) ), remarkable reunions (Pacino and Ellen Barkin again together, eighteen years after Victims of a Passion, 1989), comments from other films (Pitt recommending that Clooney lose his belly, which the actor would have won to make Syriana, 2005, the Damon's fake nose that should have appeared in The Brothers Grimm, 2005) and even the absence of stars Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones contribute to having a leaner film, concise in its proposal and more dramatically successful. And if you don't have a good laugh even with the participation of Oprah Winfrey, then it's because you don't understand anything about pop culture.In fact, the series about Ocean and his colleagues has exactly that of ""old fashioned"": it proposes to the public and its directors nothing less and nothing more than two hours and a little (for some) and a few months of filming (for others) of great fun. Some of the series' harshest critics argue that the filmmakers clearly have more fun than the viewers. In part, this is probably true, but it cannot be denied that the films just want us to have fun watching them have fun - hence the profusion of scenes with the most absurd disguises. Don Cheadle playing the ace of the motorcycle; Matt Damon as the servant of the Chinese millionaire; Carl Reiner playing the fake British journalist; Casey Affleck as the leader of the Mexican labor rebellion, Pitt as a seismologist (in shorts): each of these sequences does not exist as a force or potency in its relation to the plot, but rather in a universe of its own, whose meaning and grace resides and ends in itself. same. In a way, we are in the domain of a cinema of attractions, as in the first cinema: our pleasure in each of these moments, is thought to be as primal and direct as possible. To observe each of these actors as a marvel in itself, like sketches of a show without much responsibility for the whole.Director Steven Soderbergh took great care in making and making his actor friends completely at ease. Be veterans or little known. Stars or supporters, everyone has their moment. But the ones that matter are George Clooney (as the leader of the group of robbers) and his companion Brad Pitt, both extremely relaxed, at ease, with great naturalness (but without losing the timing of humor). The merit of the new screenplay by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Letters on the Table) is to show that in addition to being mere thieves and swindlers, the 11 friends care for each other, to the point of reuniting when one of them, Elliot Gould (Reuben) he has a heart attack and is on the verge of death when he is tricked by a gangster who owns a new casino (Al Pacino). Then everyone is back to elaborate and costly revenge, which will also include former enemy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) partly out of jealousy of having a rival in the hotel business, partly because he sees the chance there to steal a fortune in diamonds.It is important to emphasize, however, that several action passages are not clear. All members of Ocean's gang will engage in the plan, each with their specific role, infiltrating the casino hotel staff and spying on Bank's every step. The unfolding of the plot, as in the other films in the series, is not so important. Even because what matters is how far each stage is unlikely. If I were to follow the primer of realism, Thirteen Men and a New Secret would certainly not have the slightest grace. However, the plot supposes an infinity of ""subplots"", developed with such speed that we do not even get to retain because at such times one of them enters a ventilation tube or another sells a game machine. It is not a narrative problem: it is not the least bit important to know what each one is doing. It matters that we know the purpose of the plot and guess its conclusion. Thus, the role that screenwriters play, and very well, is to come up with unexpected and humorous situations, in a predictable framework.The technical part of the film is absolutely impeccable. Steven Soderbergh didn't have much to do here in terms of directing actors, so he can do an exercise in style, taking advantage of the variety of scenes. Realizing some great sequential plans, like the one that reveals the confusion that occurs in the Mexican factory or the one that shows Danny's plan in action at Bank's casino, the filmmaker looks more like a child on the playground, taking advantage of all the busiest scenes for "" play ""a little. In addition, he gave Vegas a very special color, also acting as cinematographer for the film under the pseudonym ""Peter Andrews"" - something recurring in his filmography. Despite the speed of reasoning of the characters and the various situations occurring at the same time, the film is never confused, maintaining an agile and constant pace, thanks to the great work of the renowned editor Oscar Stephen Mirrione, who was nominated for the award for ""Babel"" and is an old collaborator of Soderbergh, having worked on all the features of the franchise. Another thing that gives the series a special charm is the great soundtrack by David Holmes, which does not disappoint in this third copy.It is this disguised and skewed criticism of neoliberalism that makes the film grow and become more and more interesting. By showing the most luxurious Las Vegas casinos, Soderbergh's camera captures its regulars, the winners of capitalism, who, however, do not seem to know how to spend the money: they are easy prey for Americans, who manage to sell them a a certain ideology of hedonism for consumption which, whether it makes sense or not, is out of the question, but is grotesquely in bad taste. The dilettante cynicism, clever jokes and the dazzlingly cheesy Las Vegas portrait are still sharp - but they are still shallow and shallow like the rest. Tribute to the 1970s hit movies, its sole purpose is to entertain and generate profit for the studio that produced it. The advantage is that, unlike Ocean's Twelve, the public can have a lot more fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Honest Review,"Come on, be honest, you wanted Pacino to win didn't you? I mean, Brad Pitt is good when he's not doing the fluff action movie thing. He can act when he really wants to. Matt Damon is the same, when he wants to act he can act and when he wants a paycheck he does a boring action film. George Clooney is cool, he does some mad roles......but, I mean, they are up against Al Pacino. It's hard to hold your own against them man.Other than that it is leagues better than the second film and still not as good as the first.The first had some real heart, the third had some great jokes, but you got the feeling that they were grasping at straws.

Brad Pitt is always chewing something and is always so close to Clooney that they could become a duo if not a pair. Matt Damon tries a nose but it won't have the repercussions of Nicole Kidman's. Here the nose is strictly four laughs and it almost succeeded. Ellen Barkin looks smashing for a woman of ""her age"" and rich, she looks rich. Andy Garcia walks through it well dressed and trying to cling on to something. His Oprah interview got me to laugh a little bit. Al Pacino, well, I don't know what to say. I'm not saying he should be angry with his director but should sue the Director Of Photography. At times he looked like my late aunt Margo. What was that? Listen, I'm not being facetious.

"Not great, but a little better than the second film, at least","It's quite funny how this movie essentially acts like Ocean's Twelve doesn't exist. Maybe they're all meant to feel like standalone films, in a way, but having seen that second film recently, it does feel noticeably disconnected.It's ultimately okay, because Ocean's Twelve wasn't great. Neither is Thirteen, but I'd say it's a slight step up from that one. It's more comparable in structure to the first movie, with one main job focused on for the whole runtime, instead of.... whatever the plot of the second movie was. That one was all over the place.The blunt simplicity of Ocean's Thirteen means there's nothing surprising or truly thrilling about it, but it remains a decent watch. It's perfectly serviceable fluff/entertainment. I would say it's unpretentious and no-nonsense entertainment, but the cool, detached tone felt a bit smug to me here, rather than effortless or sauve. I just wish one character acted like a real human being, even for just a moment, rather than them all being perfect, well-groomed quip machines 24/7.But it's still decent. It's well-paced. The directness of the narrative is mostly a good thing. It's hardly ever boring, and as I expected I would, I enjoyed Al Pacino's inclusion as the main villain. But there's nothing great about it, and I'll probably live the rest of my life without ever watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Thirteen"" Greater Than ""Twelve""; Equal To ""Eleven""","Steven Soderbergh returns to Vegas for the third installment in his Ocean's trilogy. The original ensemble is once again robbing a casino, this time targeting a brand new hotel owned by billionaire Willy Bank (Al Pacino). In this intricate heist, the team devises a plan to steal money right off the casino floor, rigging the tables to their advantage in plain sight.Because of this ambitious set-up, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the most complicated movie in the franchise so far. There is less cutting into safes and more convoluted espionage as the heist film dips into the spy genre to pull off its layered narrative.Nevertheless, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" still fell more in line with my expectations than ""Ocean's Twelve."" ""Thirteen"" levels the playing field between style and substance. I felt that Soderbergh got too artistically quirky in ""Twelve,"" straying from realism in the service of cinematic experimentation. ""Thirteen"" amends this imbalance for a broader appeal.It does not skimp on Soderbergh's trademark humor, though. In fact, I found ""Thirteen"" to be the funniest of the three movies. George Clooney and Brad Pitt reprise their charming performances as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively. Meanwhile, Matt Damon - whose star power now equals (if not exceeds) that of Clooney and Pitt - stands out far more amongst the ensemble.However, it's the addition of Al Pacino that really takes the cake. Pacino's affinity for character-acting needs no introduction, and he clearly has fun playing this villain. Willy Bank is essentially a more threatening upgrade from ""Ocean Eleven's"" Terry Benedict. To demonstrate this point, Andy Garcia returns as Benedict in this film, but plays more of an antihero, willing to team-up with Ocean to take down Bank.In total, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" exceeds ""Ocean's Twelve"" and lands on par with ""Ocean's Eleven."" Like the first film, it is very approachable and makes the most of its dazzling cast. Barring a few moments, it is not as jaw-droppingly twisty as its predecessors, but still throws the audience a few curve balls. Soderbergh is at his best yet again, but instead of Clooney stealing the show on camera, it is now Clooney, Pitt, and Damon as a leading trio - that alone is pretty darn enticing!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Yikes this one's pretty bad!,"I love the eye candy, retro feel and wink wink humor of the first two. Fun casting. Great use of settings. Big splashy Hollywood hokum.By far though, this one's the worst of the three. Very dull. Nothing's going on. Little storyline. There is absolutely no electricity between the actors. Mainly the movie's weak due to the bad script. All the actor's though seem up to the challenge.

"Maybe went over the heads of a lot of people? Holds up well, anyhow.","Holds up well. Not as tight as the original because the original had surprise working for it. You know the formula now, so there is nothing for it but to sit back and enjoy the show.So we go back to Vegas, we leave the girls at home this time, and line everything up for exquisitely executed revenge. It's a lazier, less suspenseful pace than the first film. It's not the ""if"" but the ""how"" that matters, and what good lines characters will give us as it all goes down.I find I remember 13 a lot better than I remember 11 now. I like many of the scenes more, and I like many of the characters more. Ellen Barkin is a particular treat to watch. There is a lot of absurdest comedy, and lots of great, quotable lines.

Third time not a charm,"When Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau made ""Out to Sea,"" very late in their careers, and not very long before each passed away, it seemed that they were simply performing parts they could have ""phoned-in,"" and perhaps add a few million dollars to their estates. Same for their original ""Grumpy Old Men"" flick, and even more so for its sequel. But a lot of that could be attributed to their ages, and to the fact that they had worked so much together - from earlier days through middle age and into their twilight time.""Godfather III"" was terrible, despite its two predecessors both winning ""Best Picture"" Oscar. And the recent ""Spiderman,"" ""Shrek"" and ""P.o.C."" flicks certainly have all proved that in sequels, the third time certainly ISN'T the charm.This movie seals that principle in concrete. With the ever-expanding ensemble cast, it's different from a two-person, buddy/rival offering like Lemmon/Mathau's or a larger, but somewhat-altered cast as in the Godfather movies. All the ""Ocean"" films have included the main group of hunky males and beautiful females, in their primes -- many of whom have been the ""before-the-title"" leads in their own individual work.The problem is, the premise is exhausted; it's difficult enough to make one good major picture, and seemingly impossible replicate a third time (plus, the second/middle ""Ocean"" was even worse than this one).But a main complaint, in my opinion, is that despite being younger, with flesh still firm on their faces and mid-sections, and without advancing age providing any excuse --- Clooney, Damon, Pitt, et al, seem to be performing barely a small notch above phoning in these roles, here. And the older Pacino and Gould almost seem to be attempting a parody of the roles they've been assigned, as opposed to straight acting. In terms of the plot, as another person commented here, it seems downright silly that the wise, caper-connected Gould character would be duped by the likes of Pacino's character in this story.It might rate a 4* or 5* mark only -- I'd give it a 6, simply in view of excellent photography/scenery, and the lavishness of production.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Danny Ocean and his team go out on a high,"After the disaster of Ocean's 12 there was only one way: up. Therefore, Ocean's 13 inevitably improves although it's not surprising Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones dropped out. The ridiculously likable crew are back, getting revenge on a businessman (Al Pacino) who conned their friend. It relocates the action back to Vegas, where it belongs, and this time they were polite enough to actually include a heist. Concluding the trilogy in better than expected fashion, O13 restores the trilogy to glamorous, slick, stylish glory and still shines brighter than the majority of the lights on the strip. It doesn't measure up the original. Don Cheadle is as jarring as ever and there are some irritating jokes and the heist sometimes feels lost in the comedy. It can be overly confusing and it's sometimes difficult to understand where the plot is going. These various flaws don't stop it from being a solid 4 star crime flick.The characters are still entertaining and likable. This time, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are actually likable and aren't just smug. Matt Damon is still bland though. It's well directed by Steven Soderbergh and has another fine musical score. There's also a sense of finality and it wraps up the trilogy very well. It's not as surreally enjoyable as the first one, but it's humorous, slick and offers plenty of the escapist fun that the first did. It doesn't suffer from the laws of diminishing returns and does the formula of the first one without adding to it but also without copying it and doing a turd on it. This isn't the strongest or bravest second sequel out there but it deserves a lot of respect for being entertaining and learning from the mistakes of the awful Ocean's 12. Nothing memorable or daring, but O13 provides plenty of stylish and sub zero cool heist based fun. At least there's a proper heist set piece.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Steven is Obi Wan,"Steven is kind of like an idotsavant; I can never really tell what his motivation is behind his films, only this one was easy: pimp the pretty boys of Hollywood, stack cheddar (make money) until he's ready to do his normal avant-garde film masterpieces. One of my favorite film of all times in the history of film making, that I've seen in my limited and speck of a life times was Soderbergh's Limey; In my opinion it crushed Johnathan Glazer's Sexy Beast in its portrayal of old tuff guys. Steven is Obi Wan and given the ridiculous premise behind the Ocean series he's able to deliver what the people want: handsome Clooney and Pitt looking like GQ models and heart throbs while exercising genius level intellect in making hundreds of millions dollars from their enemies. Their are tons of aerial shots of Vegas which captures it's sheer immensity and focused invention of just having fun; sort of like a playground for the LCD/Plasma television generation. Images become boring after a while; even a gigantic construction machines can't make the small world of this film any more interesting. This film in no way exhibited the enormous potential of talents of this director. Brad Pitt was a little tongue tied in this film when delivering his lines; sort of like he has problems with large technical words. His acting; I'm sorry: his walking on the lot and collecting 20 million dollars was awesome, only he left nothing in return: non-existent performance. George Clooney was really good. He appeared to be working at making this Ocean work, but with no love interest there was just no charm or magic; yet he was still the sharpest tool in the shed. Clooney has yet to deliver a performance that has impressed me as a film lover; will this ever happen. Matt Damon always has a good while acting; it's natural, as if he's got nothing to prove. I love how he makes himself look like a complete ass in the Ocean's series, and this one may be his best effort yet: complete with props and new persona's. My favorite Damon film without hesitation or doubt has to be Good Will Hunting, just for the sheer fact that he made everyone look so good, thus ""good will."" The MVP of this film was Casey Affleck his character situation was the most hilarious. I seriously wanted to see how it all was going to play out. I'm not a big fan of the Affleck's but his character actually had me add some stars to this movie. Ocean's is a great weekend film, you just want to relax and rest your mind, unfortunately their isn't enough eye candy; their could've been at least 500 hot scorching babes to balance the scenes with all the hunks in this movie. I just can't believe out of all these unmarried men their was no hook-ups in Vegas; such plot deviations might've added to the humor and the feel of Vegas - OK flick; would'nt watch it again though.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic.","Ocean's Thirteen reviewed by Samuel OsbornBack to basics. This seems to be the mantra for Ocean's Thirteen, which marks the end of the Ocean's trilogy. Twelve, the widely despised sequel, made the mistake of getting creative. They changed the recipe and it made the people squeamish. Critics and audiences alike were held utterly aghast. I went back to it earlier this week in preparation for Thirteen. Watch it again, I dare you. It's easily the best of the trilogy. The film is fun, inventive, and loaded with more style than a fashion magazine, which is more than I can say for Ocean's Thirteen.It's not that Thirteen is bad. No no no. It just follows in the shoes of all the other franchise letdowns to have been released so far this Summer. Between Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, Pirates 3, and Ocean's Thirteen, a 24 hour depression hotline will have to be launched to service the needs of millions of disappointed adolescent girls.As in Ocean's Twelve, Thirteen doesn't waste much time with back-story. Director Steven Soderbergh starts the ball rolling at once. His obsessively inventive camera zooms, tracks, dollies and swivels its way into Danny Ocean's life with great immediacy. Longtime friend and criminal companion, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), has fallen ill. His business partner, Willie Bank (Al Pacino), has conned him into financial failure and left him on the brink of death. Bank is posed to open the hottest hotel on the Vegas strip, looking to nail another Five Diamond Award to his pedestal. Without family to assist him, Reuben turns to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew of thieves for help.The idea is revenge, but the sort of revenge that doesn't involve a funeral. Not the sort that ""is best served cold,"" as Tarantino would have put it. Danny wants his revenge served steaming in a fajita of clever wit and tact. His plan, hatched with longtime partner, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), is to break the Bank (their pun, not mine). To rob Mr. Bank, they plan to rig each game on his casino's floor for a small window of time. Within the window, with every game rigged, and with thousands of gamblers winning rigged games, Bank could stand to lose a half billion dollars on the night of his hotel's grand opening.As you might have noticed, the Ocean crew has abandoned the foreign vaults and international heists for a second romp in their hometown, Las Vegas. They're doing what they know best. For Steven Soderbergh, he's just doing what worked the first time around. This is fine, even if the execution is uninteresting. All the same motions are processed successfully, except that the heist, maybe due to a strangely passive Pacino delivery, comes off somewhat ho-hum. There's no big reveal at the end. No twist or turning of the tables. The heist either worked or it didn't. And that's all.What you might not have noticed, however, are Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who play the wily love interests of Danny and Rusty. Their characters are all but absent. We find the men commiserating the complexities of relationships between blueprinting their heist, one always finishing the sentence for the other, but Ms. Roberts and Ms. Zeta-Jones never show their faces. This seems to be a shame since the sly push and pull of the romances in the earlier films made for some of the more satisfying sequences. The chemistry worked. But Danny resolves to not involve Tessa (Roberts), saying ""it's not her fight.""Also missing is the humor. All the old jokes return for repeat go-rounds, including the deep male camaraderie of Rusty and Danny, Linus' (Matt Damon) need to impress his thieve parents, the jock-nerd matching of Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), and all the rest of the inside jokes Ocean fans will fondly remember. But new stabs at humor--including a bizarre sub-plot involving the violent strike of a dice factory in Mexico--fall flat. The boys are all fine at the charming and the chemistry as always, but the new material needs work. Julia Roberts posing as Julia Roberts from Ocean's Twelve was brilliant. Such comic invention seems to be on near-empty here.What the Ocean's franchise has going for it, luckily, is its cast. Put Pitt, Clooney and Damon in front of a camera for long enough and something worth watching will happen. They're the charmers of Hollywood. Just having these three on screen all at once makes for compelling film-making. So, in all actuality, it was never possible for Ocean's Thirteen to be flat-out bad. I guess I just expected something flashier; something as mischievous and as neat as Ocean's Twelve. What Ocean's Thirteen achieves is something standard, something basic.Samuel Osborn",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good...and familiar.,"In this sequel to a sequel, Danny Ocean and their friends are angry. Why? Because their friend, Reuben (Elliott Gould) is a nice guy...and he's been screwed by his very dishonest business partner, Willy Bank (Al Pacino). It turns out Bank has a history of dishonest behavior by stabbing his partners in the back...and Ocean's friends are determined to take Bank down. The money isn't their goal...destroying Bank and his fortune is!Like a typical heist film, the story is rife with technical jargon, near exposures of their plan, and unexpected complications. A few times, I felt the jargon and technical aspects were a bit confusing. But overall it's an enjoyable though derivative film. After all, it's the third in the series and there is the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" from the 1960s. Worth seeing...but mostly by die-hard fans of the series...though even a non-fan should enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
problems throughout but the cool style will carry you if you switch off your brain,"When Reuben is double crossed by hotel and casino owner Willie Bank, Danny Ocean comes to see if he can appeal to Bank's code of honour and make him do the right thing. When this rather naïve approach fails, Ocean calls in his gang to organise an incredibly elaborate sting on the things that Bank cares most about  his money, his awards and his reputation.The Eleven remake was like a guilty pleasure  all slick and stylish but with no substance but yet still fun and effortlessly enjoyable. Twelve was more of the same but a messy plot did suck the life out of it and meant it was significantly less fun. I came to Thirteen off the back of good reviews, but then that was the same story with Twelve so I did have some degree of caution. Thirteen sort of sits in the middle of these two films, not quite as messy as Twelve but not quite as slick and fun as Thirteen. The reasons for this are many but I must stress that the film more or less still works as a popcorn movie that is a welcome sight after the parade of rubbish threequels so far this summer (Shrek, Spiderman, Pirates).The problem I did have with it was that it seemed a little bit less like they had come up with a cool narrative and then build around that with as many stars as possible. Rather, they knew the stars were there for it and it was a matter of coming up with a plot. Sadly the plot doesn't totally ring true because there is too much in it that I questioned. Of course the first film wasn't set in the real world but it had the pace and cool points for me to just go with it. Here the whole drilling thing was an issue for me and the ""con"" was too elaborate  even by the standards of this film series! A little too much going on in that area does rather mean it sags as soon as it takes its foot off the pedal  even if that is only for a second or two. Mostly the material here just retreads the ideas from the first movie, but makes everything a bit bigger to try and make it have the same effect. It doesn't totally work as you can see the stretch marks on it and how worn some of it feels. It does lack freshness and it is telling that the only bit I thought was really quite imaginative and original was also pretty amusing was the wonderful absurdity of Virgil's part of the scam stalling as he leads a fight for worker rights.Of course it helps to have Soderberg on board as director because, as his own cinematographer, he makes the film look great and the post-production draws on this with great music and effects which really make the whole thing look and feel like it is being project onto the finest silk. Even when the material is weak (and at times it is very weak), the style and the slick delivery really carry it. Of course for many viewers this will be far from enough but, as much as I hate to admit being won over by style without substance, it does work here.Helping build this feel yet again is a cast list to die for. This is obviously a big selling point of the film but it does have its downside. Mainly this is in how little everyone but Brad and George actually has to do or say and this has the knock-on effect of making the film feel a bit like a red carpet parade rather than a story. Pitt and Clooney are great in it and show why women everywhere love them; they are slick and smooth throughout and have the lion's share of the film. Damon's material is weak and he was only OK as a result  he didn't convince with Barkin and why he was wearing the nose from The Hours I'm not sure. Pacino is a good addition and works well on screen without really trying  however it might have been more fun to give him the material and let him loose. Cheadle has scaled back his accent and also has very, very little to do or say. Qin is OK, as are Gould, Mac, Affleck, Caan, Reiner and a few others  nobody really ever threatening to steal the film. Izzard did well to get as many scenes as he did while Julian Sands managed to not be the kiss of death than he is known for being (although he was hardly in it) I thought Ellen Barkin looked great (not ""for her age""  just great) but the material given to her is weak as her strong and sexy character is reduced to stumbling around panting by some unknown chemical. Garcia wasn't used that well either but compared to the pointless bit for Cassel he is the heart of the narrative.Overall then, this is pretty much what I expected and I quite enjoyed it when it was slick and fun but it is hard not to see where the lack of substance is causing a void that sucks everything else back a bit. Eleven was a mindless pleasure and although Thirteen is not quite at that level it is certainly better than Twelve.",,Anonymous,Crime
"At last a ""Threequel"" that delivers","After the dullness of Spiderman 3, and the shipwreck that was Pirates 3, it was with much trepidation that I went to watch Ocean's Thirteen. The first (Clooney) film was frothy fun, the second an indulgent, over-stuffed turkey. Thankfully Soderbergh and THAT cast have returned to Vegas, pared back the tiresome romance aspects that so bogged down the second one (no Roberts, no Zeta-Jones), and upped the joke quantity and quality. Yes the plot is over-complicated and un-believable. Yes it is frequently preposterous, but you just don't care. There are quality jokes throughout this joppy jape, and are perfectly delivered by the cast - all of whom are at the top of their game. It is telling that Pacino - so often blasting his co-stars clean off the screen - is almost sidelined here. He's good, but a bit flat. Ditto for Barkin, who just can't do ditsy and sexy and professional and bitchy all at once, which is a shame because her scenes with Damon (also excellent) are great fun. Add in the terrific double act of Casey Affleck and Scott Caan (with a whole Mexican sub-plot to themselves that is hilarious), and the film is already on the up. More quality characterisation from Eddie Izzard, a nice expansion on Terry Benedict from Andy Garcia, and Carl Reiner delivering his usual class. But the dependable double act of Clooney and Pitt help keep the film whizzing on. Delivering quality lines and preposterous exposition with perfect deadpan faces and sublime timing (one word - Oprah!) it makes you wish they would make more movies together. Soderburgh shoots with his typical style and colourful eye and the film moves a decent clip. The best threequel of the year and second best 'Ocean' movie. Fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A perfect ""Good Sequel"".....","One things for sure this is ""the year of the sequels"" and you only need one look at the big movies this year to agree with me, whats even more surprising is the number on the sequels, trilogies are the new flavour of the decade, what was once the right of only the greatest and most groundbreaking films (and offcourse the most B-rated), is now the birthright of every other movie.Whats even more surprising is that the trend has finally managed to catch the attention of mainstream movies everywhere, even British and Indian cinema where sequels were few and far between now have sequels to big films (Dhoom2, 28 weeks later).NOt surprising then I found myself watching yet another sequel, and no matter what they say there was no way i was going to allow myself to expect anything more than ordinary for this movie especially in the light of Oceans 12 and the other sequels this summer.Like other sequels this one has also taken the safe root by banking on the stars and characters created by the earlier movies instead of focusing on the script.The characters have been given so much credit that this is almost not a heist film.Not that im complaining, the dialogues were hilarious, the quirks of every character kept you interested throughout, the hilarious interplay between characters is what makes this film with a one page plot watchable.Other than the big stars, the main character for me was Casey Affleck has the hilarious Malloy, he was the best thing for me in this movie and the hilarious Mexican Fiasco around him made the movie for me.However no credit must be taken from the others and this being a character based film, everyone has risen to the part and done a good job.Acting obviously is top-notch with some hamming that can be ignored if you see this movie as the character based comic caper that it is, dialogues are hilarious in all scenes even if they don't matter.Technical aspects are OK, the plot being wafer thin, and the heist taking a back seat, the few special effects that are there are tastefully done especially the rendering of the hotel in Vegas.The movie has loads of plot holes, useless scenes and sub-plots, like the one with french thief which i didn't figure out till the end, AMPLE SEQUEL PREPARATION WILL ENSURE SUCH OTHERWISE IMPORTANT THINGS Don't SPOIL YOUR MOVIE.The lesser said about the con the better, its not important in the film and not worth discussing here either, as a heist film this movie would s^&*.Background score was very effective with the songs really complimenting the scenes.Comparisons with the original are useless and will only spoil this movie and this review.In all a good sequel if you go with the correct expectations and realise the true nature of this film.PLEASE Don't BE MISLEAD BY THE HIGH RATINGS THAT MERELY REFLECT THE FACT THAT THIS IS In fact THE BEST OF THE SEQUELS THIS YEAR NOT THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE MOVIE.Give in to the hype and watch this movie.-s loads of plot holes and useless sub-plots and scenes, the con takes a back seat and is badly executed, not a heist film, some acting could be called hamming,MYSTERY INTRIGUE AND TENSION ARE NON-Existent.+/-s quirky character based comedy caper with the background of a heist, hilarious unrelated scenes (oprah and all), good sequel almost different genre.+s top-notch acting (considering the type of film), few but good special effects not at all jarring, lots of really humorous scenes and dialogues, very good background score.total 6.5/10 (7/10 factoring in expectations which was strictly OK. i expected a six and got slightly more, albeit from a different kind of film, please don't expect a good heist film or you may be disappointed. expect less get more).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Thirteen (2007),"Coming off the muddled misstep of OCEAN'S TWELVE, Soderbergh proves that he can still produce high-quality Hollywood fare when he puts his mind to it. Alleviating most of the problems that plagued the second installment, he uses his star power cast much more efficiently, delivers a scheme that's complex without being confusing, and takes a step back from making the characters superhuman. The glitz and style and polish help make this a very entertaining flick, perhaps the best in the series (though I must confess my memories of the first one are fuzzy). My one beef would be that Danny Ocean has it a little too easy this time, and while I enjoyed his easygoing cleverness, I wished for a few more obstacles in his path. Any snags in the plan are deftly overcome, and Al Pacino's character does not make for an intimidating protagonist. Still a very fun ride, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Safe Hand,"I am a member of minority group. This group is made up of a small number of people who actually enjoyed OCEAN'S 12. Sure it was somewhat unbelievable and occasionally ridiculous but it kept a good groove on while filling the screen with some slick style. The boys all looked like they were having a good time, perhaps too good a time. Maybe audiences felt like they had taken it all too far; that the Ocean gang was having fun without them. And so, a director and a cast who generally don't seem to pay much heed to appeasing the masses, have returned to the original scene of the crime, Las Vegas, for their third and final caper in OCEAN'S 13. The main goal for this reunion is to make up for their supposed misfire last time out and every possible effort to do so is made diligently. With the exception of Julia Roberts, the original players have all returned. From Clooney to Pitt to Damon to Affleck (no, not that one, the younger one), the stars are all out. Even Al Pacino has come on board to lend more weight to this already heavy load. And with Mr. Style himself, Steven Soderbergh, at the helm, the dream is kept alive. So why then, with every element so perfectly placed, has the fun disappeared almost entirely?Perhaps perfection is part of the problem. The Ocean gang is a smart bunch, crafty fellas. They are also often prone to making mistakes. The situations they find themselves in stem from their own decisions and almost always lead them to the brink of unraveling. The cracks they need to squeeze through get tighter and tighter, creating both intrigue and urgency for the viewer. OCEAN'S 13 finds Danny Ocean et al plotting sweet revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino) for putting Ocean member, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), in the hospital after screwing him out of a huge hotel/casino deal. The plan is to ruin his prestigious grand opening and milk him for hundreds of thousands of dollars all in one night. The execution is vast, ranging from rigging the dice at the source of manufacturing in Mexico to orchestrating an earthquake to disarm the stronghold security system that stands between them and the prize. Clearly, the good guys are going to win but never does it feel that there is a chance this might not happen. The urgency and intrigue were bet and lost.Pacino is a welcome addition to the mix. His portrayal of hotel mogul, Willie Banks, is so sinister and egotistical that you can't wait for the Ocean boys to bring him down. However, while Pacino is stepping it up, Clooney and Pitt might as well have had their stand-ins play their parts. The camaraderie that brought such joy and laughs to the Ocean film experience in the past has grown tired. When the boys laugh now, it almost seems like the joke is on us; that getting us into the theatre with their pretty faces was all they were obliged to do. Once there, entertaining us was not part of their contract. These two haven't left it to just showing up for work in a while and the effect weighs you down. Luckily, Damon, Affleck, Scott Caan and Don Cheadle are still working for their paychecks, bringing wit, charm and humility to an often-lifeless script. Sadly, the sporadic laughs are not enough to call this film funny, or even fun for that matter.So if OCEAN'S 13 isn't fun, what is it? Well, it's neatly packaged and pristinely presented. Soderbergh has a fantastic eye. He has a knack for crafting colorful films that are visual worlds unto themselves, which draw the viewer in to a point where the real world can look somewhat drab in comparison once you leave them. Only this time out, he spent too much time setting everything up that no room was left for error or chance. It's like a perfectly dealt hand that just isn't played with any finesse. It's ironic really how a film set against the gambling capital of the world takes so few risks. Soderbergh sets out to distract the audience with OCEAN'S 13, like any good casino would. With all the flashing lights, pretty colours and fireworks, you might not realize that you've been playing the slots for longer than you should.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Return to quality,"After the disappointing Oceans 12"" this one is a pleasant surprise. The magic is back and it was once again fun to meet with Danny and his gang.

Their plan is complicated and they will have to face many obstacles. Sometimes the story is illogical in few places and little predictable. It is however much better than the overloaded story in ""Ocean's 12"".If you enjoyed the first movie , you should enjoy this one too. The acting is very natural and the dialogues are witty .

Better than 12 but not by much,"Ocean's Thirteen was better than Ocean's 12. That isn't saying much since O12 was horrible. O13 was a tad better. Al Pacino helped by creating a character who was believable and entertaining. Ellen Barkin was terribly miscast. Her role would have been played better by some riper, younger actress. Brad Pitt look very please with himself and George Clooney avoided being too smug. Neither were all that entertaining and the movie focused on them most of the time. I thought the movie was slow. The caper consisted of solving a series of problems in rigging all of the gambling at Al Pacino's casino. The rigging was accomplished with a bunch of unexplained, magical devices. It felt more like Wily E. Coyote's Acme products than actual plausible products. The mine digging machine was ridiculous. It was way too fantastical to be believed. The rigging of the diamond prize was clever and believable. The trouble with sequels is that the characters are not developed further but are just referred to in a kind of role shorthand. The whole screenplay was a shorthand version of a caper movie. The Ocean story is that these really clever guys have to rob an entire casino against great odds which they accomplish with neato devices and tricks. This movie followed the outline but failed to develop the robbery techniques beyond magical Acme devices. How did pouring powder in the dice raw material actually make the dice roll over by pressing another magic device? It wasn't engineering it was magic. The movie required one to suspend too much belief in reality to make the caper work. A drilling machine in the middle of a major city, that breaks and has to be replaced in a day, and bores a huge tunnel under the city with no one noticing. Come on! It would take months for a team of engineers to accomplish the task of just getting the machine started. The caper just didn't work. The ensemble casting wasn't an ensemble. It was three stars with other people around. The acting wasn't terrible but just egocentric. Wait for a dark and stormy night and rent it.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
revenge,"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Al Pacino, yes folks Al Pacino,, odd choice for this movie I thought,, and also stars Ellen Barkin,, this time the crew is out for revenge as one of the original members from Ocean's 11 is ripped off on a casino deal by arch rival Willy Bank ,, played by Al Pacino,, also involved in the shenanigan's is our old pal,, Terry Benedict,, the odds in most casino's are roughly the same,, but folks ,, those aren't Terry Benedict's casino's.. reference to Tony Reali there. So our crew is set and they go after Willy Bank and try to crush his new Casino opening up,, the man that was going into business with ,, one of the original 11 ,, he caused the man to have a heart attack, and he is lain up in the hospital,, our crew enlists the help of Terry Benedict,, who also has a score to settle with Bank,, not a bad movie,, pretty good actually,, but I felt that Pacino could have done a bit of a better acting job.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Surprisingly Different,"I am a HUGE fan of Oceans Eleven.. i love the cast, oceans twelve was just alright though- so with oceans thirteen coming out i think it was necessary for them to redeem themselves. I loved this movie- some argue that the plot was the same as the previous two movies but i believe that it was surprisingly different and that made it all the more entertaining. the writing and the acting in all three of these movies is great. Ocean's Thirteen is not as good as the first (then again...what is?) but it definitely surpasses the second in so many ways. i definitely recommend going to see this movie- whats not to love? its fresh, funny, and it makes you think. and come on...who doesn't love George Clooney?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Are you watching Oprah?Ocean's 13,"Many people I have heard from plain despised Ocean's 12 when they saw it. They complained of its weak plot and unreal goofiness. However, I found it to be very entertaining despite all of that. What the first film had as far as intelligence and wit, the second had in cool and fun. Sure the story was far-fetched and convoluted, but I'd pay to see these guys having fun on screen anytime. I don't go to a film like this to be intellectually stimulated, I go to be entertained. What all this really boils down to is that I was looking forward to the third installment, appropriately named Ocean's 13, to see where these characters would go. Steven Soderbergh does not disappoint and, in fact, creates a nice mix of the first two movies. We are given a smartly orchestrated heist along with the great one-liners and facial expressions that made the second such a good time. I may say it is the best of the three, but if not it is at least as good as the first.Once again revenge is paramount. Our crew's backer, wonderfully played by Elliot Gould per usual, has been double-crossed and bedridden by a heart attack as a result of another casino owner played by Al Pacino. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and their cohorts offer Pacino a peace offering, but once that is thrown in their faces, the movie starts hitting its stride. Stylistically you can't argue about the structure used to show the viewers how the plan will work. While trying to speak about a problem that needs fixing to a friend, Clooney and Pitt go through how everything will go down while we are visually shown the progress in each. This maneuver is at first a tad distracting, but once you get used to it you find how effective it was in getting a whole lot of info out in a short amount of time. The rest of the film then just leaves the boys to make sure the job gets done. There are pitfalls and unforeseen alliances that come into play, and of course comedy follows them all.As with the first two films, especially the second, we have a lot of characters that just cannot get ample screen time to really be effective. It is not as noticeable here, though, because they are oftentimes on screen separately doing what they have to do rather than all together with only two of the group talking. Everyone gets a decent sized monologue or gimmick to show their stuff, and I'm sure all were satisfied as a result. You know these guys have to be having a ton of fun because with the sheer amount of talent involved, they can't be making too much money. Now with the addition of Pacino, who plays himself again like most films he has done in the past couple decades; Ellen Barkin, a tad over the top, but then she was drugged for most of it; David Paymer, in a funny bit part/running joke; and Eddie Izzard, somewhat underused here; the multitude of characters can be a bit overwhelming.Overall it all worked for me. The plot twists are never too out there that you shake your head, many times you actually smile thinking that that was how it would be anyways. The filmmakers don't go out to confuse you, they just tell it how it has to happen and let the pieces fall into place. All the acting ends up being real good, maybe due in part to everyone having shortened time to not risk screwing up. My favorite is still the sarcastic banter and education void between Casey Affleck and Scott Caan. These two really have a great rapport with each other and every line out of their mouths is hilarious. Just watching them running through the halls of the casino when they have multiple tasks to accomplish made me laugh out loud.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Getting to the end was a bit tedious,"I was transported back to the early sixties during the opening credits to this film. The big band sound saturated you with that Rat Pack sensation where you almost expect Sinatra, Dean and Davis Jr. to walk out into the theater and serenade you with some new material. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen, and if I had a copy of this movie, I would have to play it a second time just to be able to play along with the new establishment of the Rat Pack. I have to interject a side story that seems to have paralleled the filming of this movie, so bear with me because I think it probably helped to guide this movie and probably saved it from some film making pitfalls: The new Rat Pack consist of primarily George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon with charter memberships with Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Bernie Mac (who recently announced his retirement from film - we'll see if that's true eventually). The reports say that during the shooting of the entire filming, they had one huge high steaks poker game going on that the entry fee started at $50,000. Sometimes I wonder if their heads were in the movie or the game. There were more than just the Rat Pack in play here, and most of the cast had it's opportunity to cash in on the game. I guess my problem with this movie was the cohesiveness of the script. Sometimes it just had the Valley Girl mentality to it: ""And then he went:""Whoa"", and then the other dude said: "".. but then this guy said this, and everything feel apart"", and then the first guy said: ""DUDE! He should have talked to me first"" and then.... The timing sequences were OK save the somewhat arbitrary plot tanglers that almost plagued this story like clockwork. BUT!!! The ending is always so much fun, and the final insults of retribution so well planned that you just can't help enjoy yourself to the point where the film almost redeems its self. As usually, it seems that Clooneys' Ocean has ever been calculating all possible angles to this objective that the ending satisfies anyones annoyance at paying taxes. The bad guy (Pacino) gets reamed, that's all that matters. Also, I have always been an Ellen Barkin fan. Even though the use of this woman is extremely limited in this film, does anyone know where I can get a pheromone injection like Damon uses during the latter part of this film? Again, not quite thumbs up, but definitely not thumbs down.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Definite Improvement Since Ocean's Twelve,"Ocean's Thirteen (2007, Dir. Steven Soderbergh)Danny Ocean's team of criminals are back and are composing a plan more personal than ever. When ruthless casino owner Willy Bank double-crosses Reuben Tishkoff, causing a heart attack, Danny Ocean vows that him and his team will do anything to bring Willy Bank and everything he's got down. Even if it includes hiring help from one of their own enemies, Terry Benedict.The first movie, 'Ocean's Eleven' was a success and very enjoyable. 'Ocean's Twelve' although was fun but very confusing. 'Oceans's Thirteen' was definitely an improvement over the second film. The story was more structured, and although still contained flashbacks, was still easy to follow. The cast are all back and still great. Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are missing from this film, but it is no great loss, and Al Pacino are certainly someone who would make up to it. His scenes are just great and some of the best scenes involve him.

I come away from this movie thinking that it was just a grand boondoggle where everyone involved had a great time making it, probably were paid extremely well (or maybe donated their time and labor to the producers/ director). I doubt this film will ever make any money. There simply is no substance. I have trouble trying to understand how many of these fine actors ever got involved with this project.",,Anonymous,Crime
lucky 13,"Ocean's Thirteen is a vast improvement over the disappointing Ocean's Twelve. Like the first Ocean movie, it's set in Vegas, and the plot such as it is, having only one setting to worry about means more time for the characters to interact, with each other, and also set in motion the revenge heist.Al Pacino is the big name added to the cast here, and I think it's his least intense performance for awhile. I got the impression he enjoyed not being the lead and had fun as Wily Banks, the villain of the piece - though in truth even the good guys are bad guys when you get down to it.As for the main gang, although Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle and Garcia are all good, the movie is actually stolen by Casey Affleck as Virgil. The little story he gets set in a Mexican factory not only is very funny, but nearly steals the movie. One of the things I've always admired about this series (and other big movie sagas), is the way they can get all the actors to return for each movie. For some movies, it could be due to being signed up for more as part of the deal, but here I think it's simply the fact they enjoy working together and it shows. The chemistry between them seems effortless, and also the fact that they like to poke fun at each other helps. Listen to the last exchange between Clooney and Pitt and you'll see what I mean!The actual plot about getting revenge when one of their number is cut out a big deal is not really that important. What's important is the fun you have simply getting to enjoy it being played out. It may not be up there with the first one, but as I mentioned, more than makes up for the disappointing sequel.If this is the end of the series, then it's a worthy finish.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

More Stars and Gadgets Do Not a Better Movie Make,"In another era, this is the kind of studio-made Hollywood movie where you would expect to have little boxes of the stars on the official poster, á la many-a murder mystery or disaster flick of the 1970's. (If you're not familiar with this, check out the original posters of movies like ""The Towering Inferno"" or the Agatha Christie murder mystery of your choice, like ""The Mirror Crack'd"".) I once read there was a tendency for such movies to be marginal. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is certainly a decent two-hour escape and you will get your money's worth. And even a bit or two is worth the price of admission. But within this escapist entertainment movie was probably a better movie wanting to come out. More stars and more gadgets do not necessarily a-better-movie-make.Essentially the plot is simple. Al Pacino, magnificently cast as the no-holds-barred Godfather of Vegas, double-crosses and then strips casino-investor Elliot Gould of his money and his dignity. Pacino already owns a half-dozen or so other casinos, and he does this just for spite. I guess it's personal. Not very healthy for Gould who lapses into a coma. Pacino is not just corrupt, he's not just a thief, he's the kind of son-of-a-bitch who would sell his own mother down the creek for a big win at the Black Jack table. So what else is new? That's what casino owners are. The only thing Pacino doesn't know is that Gould is friends with Danny Ocean (George Cloony) and his gang of casino-busters (Pitt, Damon, Cheadle et al). Right away we learn this is a revenge movie as a motivation for the heist.There are a few bits that will stay with you, particularly Matt Damon playing Linus Caldwell playing the lackey of a supposed Chinese Billionaire, Dr Weng, played by Shaobo Qin out to put 10 million on a single play. Damon's nose alone is worth the price of admission as he attempts to seduce Pacino's wife, played by Ellen Barkin. And the reason that Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict (the ""victim"" of the first movie) is brought back into the action is just the kind of reason you want and expect from your rival casino magnate. Another side plot is a casino-reviewer played by David Paymer who is shown a ""good time"" at the hands of Ocean's gang. This bit is also priceless.The challenge with Caper Movies is that to work they have to have a certain amount of believability. In other words, the minute you start thinking, ""Oh, come on"", the suspension of disbelief starts to sink back to the ground. There were a few too many moments when I thought the busters were trying to solve unsolvable problems with budgets approaching the funding for NASA. There are more gadgets in this movie than in a Julia Child cooking show. Everything from dice-manipulators, rigged slot machines, to a tunnel-boring machine the likes of which was used to create the famous ""chunnel"" between England and France. One of those only cost 30 million. Peanuts for these guys.But it doesn't end with the thieves as rip-off-artists. The casino has the highest-state-of-the-art security system in which each patron is tracked for blood-pressure, heart-rate, cholesterol level, metabolic rate, financial standing, hobbies, and sexual orientation. Apparently, if a winner really is surprised, then thats on the level. If the winner acts like they were expecting to win, then I guess they're hauled in and beaten by the security guards. Seemed a bit off the charts, so to speak. If the robbers have a budget approaching NASA, the casino has a budget rivaling the US defense department. So the gang of casino-busters has to break through this digital-wonder of computer surveillance without their faces and heart-rates appearing on the read-out screens of the surveillance team while ripping millions off the casino. No problem, I guess, if you have 50 million to spend.Where the story suffers is its characters and the number of gadgets. Maybe there are just too many of them. Not only does each character have a little ""story"" but all the gadgets seem to have stories too, and none get too much development. Don Cheadle hangs around the tunnel-boring machine but seems to do little else. Shaobo Qin as the athlete who also ""plays"" Dr Weng is never given much screen time, and yet that seemed to have huge potential for some great humor. Brad Pitt in some ways seems the most cliché of the bunch, playing a Vegas hunk, considering he is currently Hollywood's hunk. His only good moment is at the very opening of the film. There's also a strike going on at a Mexican dice manufacturing plant that's never quite fully explained.The comedic standout performances were by Matt Damon and Ellen Barkin, and you'll just have to see it to understand why. Their ""chemistry"" kind of worked for some reason. Look for the nose.The gadgets are certainly fun, and the moments mentioned above are worth the $10 ticket + $20 for popcorn, munchies and soft drinks. Certainly a great choice for a first-date as it's fun and you don't have to think. But it gets to be a bit too congested for its own good: too many characters, too many gadgets and too many side-plots. The characters are never really developed enough to give you a sense of why they are doing this. Maybe Ocean's 10 might have been a better more focused film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Easygoing spy caper might be the best of the three,"This easygoing and lighthearted caper movie is a definite step up on the second in the series – although I hope this marks the end of the trilogy rather than a prelude to any further sequels. It's a film you're going to like if you appreciate the talents of the cast – Clooney, Pitt, Damon et al – all of whom are by now well settled into their sophisticated roles. In fact, THIRTEEN might well have the edge on ELEVEN , as the ingenious plot – detailing an immense and complicated scam on a mega-casino – is so well devised that I had a ball watching it play out.Of course, there's nothing much here that hasn't been done before, and the film might well be too smart for its own good. Some of the supporting players – Eddie Izzard, Shaobo Qin – are more irritating than amusing, and Al Pacino's repugnant villain is one of the most unpleasant characters he's played in a long career. But there are other highlights that deflect from the flaws – Ellen Barkin's sexy femme fatale (sadly with the distraction of too much collagen, but otherwise perfect), a plethora of cutting-edge technological wizardry, some nicely judged twists and Soderbergh's debonair direction, all of which combine to make this a relaxing and genuinely fun outing for the crew.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I know all the guys that you'd hire to come after me, and they like me better than you.""","Back in 2001, Steven Soderbergh's slick, stylish, super-cool remake of the 1960 Rat-Pack heist film, 'Ocean's Eleven,' became one of the surprise critical hits of the the year. Featuring a stellar ensemble cast, the film's clever and exciting take on a modern-day Las Vegas casino heist left audiences wanting more. Three years later, Soderbergh and most of the cast returned for the long-awaited sequel, though 'Ocean's Twelve' ultimately failed to deliver the goods. Whilst it was certainly enjoyable to watch  and everybody involved seemed to be having fun  the script was poorly-developed and uninvolving, containing numerous moments requiring significant suspension of disbelief, particularly where Julia Roberts' character was concerned. Fortunately, with 'Ocean's Thirteen,' the filmmakers have returned to what made the first film so unbelievably entertaining: a selection of Hollywood's biggest stars having a crack at the impossible casino caper.Whilst the film has shed the two female stars from the previous film  Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones  the male cast has remained relatively unchanged, with acting veteran Al Pacino thrown in for good measure. This decision allowed for the removal of any clunky love stories from the storyline, keeping the writers (Brian Koppelman and David Levien, both new to the franchise) focused on what is important to the plot. It also allows for some highly amusing man-to-man banter between Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) about the troubles of relationships, the best one featuring Rusty's quirky pancake anecdote. The plot of the film is perhaps more elaborate than you might expect (you could easily lose track of some elements of the story if you're not paying attention), but each of the actors looks as though they are enjoying themselves, and, ultimately, we're enjoying it as well.The film begins when one of Danny's original team  mentor and father-figure, Rueben (Elliott Gould)  suffers a heart attack after being betrayed in a business deal by the ruthless, scheming casino owner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). Thirsting for revenge, Danny rallies his loyal troops, and they set about shattering Banks' hopes and dreams on the opening night of his slick and expensive new casino, The Bank. It doesn't matter if the team wins any money, as long as Bank loses out. Danny and his men hatch an extravagant plan to get their retribution, and success will depend entirely on their own resourcefulness and cunning. What are the odds of getting even? Thirteen to one.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner Forgive me for being repetitive, but that is one hell of a cast! Each of the actors understands that the film works best when the characters don't take themselves too seriously, and so their laid-back approach makes their exploits twice as enjoyable. The snappy script is jam-packed with highly-quotable one-liners, and George Clooney, in particular, relishes his sparkling dialogue, delivering it with the suaveness of an Ian Fleming character. Watch out for two clear stand-out scenes in the film: the first featuring a worker's strike at a dice factory in Mexico, and the second involving a very unique episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. All in all, 'Ocean's Thirteen' is a very entertaining thumbs up.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

First, I really enjoyed the movie, and found it to be refreshing, surprising, and full of new unpredictable content.The fact that there was not a heavy presence of estrogen from some leading character made the movie all the more intelligible, at least from a majority of what I would like to think is the male perspective; how most guys would view the third Oceans. You have to consider...the role played out in the first two movies were weak anyway, (I say this to all who feel that a woman lead character was missing from the third movie) and just a bit of filler at best if you really consider it as I just typed.

simply a fun escapist heist movie,"Ocean's Thirteen unfolds not in an excellent great-movie way but how subversive heist movies should- being entertaining while also showing some chutzpah on the part of the filmmaker. Although not reaching the level of tense joy of the original, it does go past the tedious self-consciousness of the second film to be, well, still self-conscious, but in that way that puts Soderbergh to task as someone who can make lots and lots of exposition into the equivalent of a great drink in a pricey bar. From the title cards to the angles that reveal even the smallest angles the characters are playing at (or maybe are not playing at, or are again), to the big $ numbers over the heads of everyone in the casino in the climax, and to how he gets such Hollywood Lotharios into bad wigs and mustaches and noses, it's a minor master's class in being hip and accessible for the mall crowd while still being splendid for simple genre admirers.This time, as well, it's not so much a tale of a heist for the sake of simply putting many millions into the pockets of the thieves, but as a matter of pride (a shake of Sinatra's hand is a point of merit for the older characters in this world, and it is sort of a world, of Las Vegas). Reuben (Gould) gets a heart attack after finding out he's been screwed over by Bank (Pacino), who is some-pun-intended an insanely wealthy man who's opening a new casino Reuben was supposed to be partner on. The Ocean gang decide to strike back at him the worst- letting the house lose, big time, for all the high rollers in attendance on opening night. This time, even more than the first and second films, the heist is elaborate, maybe too elaborate; there's a whole sub-plot devoted to Mexican factory workers who get riled up by Virgil and Turk to rise up against their bosses, despite the fact that they need to keep working to send the fake dice to the casino. Every side is covered, or almost every one, and there are no spots open in this one for romantic entanglements or much else. The element of Reuben bed-stricken is at the heart of the film, and everything else is, simply put, guilty pleasure hijinks of the subtlest kind.And, naturally, each character has their moments to shine. The aforementioned nose bit from Linus is one of the funniest gags in the whole trilogy, as obvious as it is. Don Cheadle gets to break out of his singularly English bit as Basher to go into daredevil garb to act as a pure distraction to Pacino. On the flip-side, Reiner becomes a prissy English high-roller. Some outsider running gags come in with David Paymer as a board member put into a purposeful bad luck blender. Even Pitt and Clooney get in on the fun, with Rusty donning a ridiculous get-up as a concerned seismologist. Overall, Ocean's Thirteen doesn't make for a very substantial dramatic feat, or even a very great comedy (Bernie Mac isn't as up to snuff as in the first film, and the moments with Oprah are more touching, ironically, than anything laugh-out-loud), but it is in its own superficial and too-cool-for-school way a must-see. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

the flashiest Casino sting yet,"'Ocean's 13' is the first of the trilogy I have seen, so can't comment on whether it is any better than 12 or 11. I am familiar with the original Sinatra/Rat Pack movie, and 'Ocean's 13' certainly nods back to that. ""You shook Sinatra's hand. You should know better"" is a payoff line near the end.Plot? Well, a Casino gets scammed. Big time. You do have to understand how blackjack, roulette, etc work to start with to appreciate the intricacies of the sting (and I got lost now and then), but the ideas are audacious and inventive, and fun.Our villain this time is Al Pacino, looking rather orange and playing nasty with relish. His sidekick is the purring and flighty Ellen Barkin, all pouts and wiggles like an ageing Marilyn Monroe. Amongst the heroes, the gang who pull off the scam, are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Eddie Izzard (absolutely atrocious acting), and more.Performances are generally OK. Effects, especially an earthquake, are well-done. In-jokes and laughs are there too, and the film fairly drips with the Hollywood gloss polished all over it.'Ocean's 13' is OK. It's probably worth your time to spend a couple of hours in the cinema if that's your thing. It is formulaic and does what it says on the tin. There's no tension or doubts, really, but a slightly muddled ending lets it down a bit. I'd rate it average.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Hate Nines,"I frankly think that audiences walk in with the exact opposite attitude towards the Ocean's films than the one I walk in with. Those who don't like them seem to come out with such a tainted look at everything, like even the best parts of the film are actually flaws. The people who like them seem to come out thinking that they've just seen a cute little romp devised as nothing more than a cash register by and for the millionaires starring in and making it. These people aren't wrong, but there is definitely a difference between Hollywood gloss with the mushy brain of an adolescent pyromaniac and that with the imagination of truly talented screenwriters.Ocean's Thirteen, like the first two, is my kind of film, a slick, elaborate caper with hues of revenge and a dryly ditzy sense of humor. If this is your kind of film too, then sit back, and just be mutable with the problematic inconsistencies, my friend. The heist is a summation of the furthest expansion of David Levien and Brian Koppelman's wildest ideas, all contrived to integrate in a very fun and witty way. If you're complaining halfway through about the excessive and perhaps wanton use of laborious gadgets of either complete fantasy or costing of more money and time than would be practically involved in whatever robbery, then you should've watched the first two soon before seeing this one to get yourself geared up again. People perhaps don't pay close enough attention to the small details of dialogue and story inferences in the Ocean films, because truly every ridiculous point has an explanation decent enough to be bought somewhere in there. There's one point where the gadget aspect of Danny Ocean's plan, which if mapped out would take a trigonometric genius, where I could've drawn the line. I won't explain the instance for fear of giving anything away, so all I will say is that if you're going to seduce someone, seduce them. There is no easy chemical or technological way out of the hard part of it, but there's a small bit of dialogue that's very comfortably and gracefully in character that permits this little excuse for the writers not to elaborate a clever seduction scene.But if there's any real peeve, anyone should have, it's what I'm about to mention, yet nobody ever says a word about it: First, they needed eleven people, but we bought it because Danny and Rusty thought long and hard about how many people they would need to pull off a virtually impossible heist on a Las Vegas casino vault, which had never before been successfully robbed. In Ocean's Twelve, we bought it because everybody owed Andy Garcia their own share of the debt, and the plot gives way to a sensible reason why there would be a need for a twelfth parcel at the last minute. Now, if you are a master thief that has proved himself to be such, why do you need thirteen people to rob a casino? You're a master! You don't need that many! I do understand the necessity of maintaining the regular appearances of the stars we expect, but then why not involve Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones in this one at all?The cast of course is a joy to see, and they all reprise their roles with the careful amount of familiarity. The heel-clickingly pleasing casting choice of Al Pacino is of course a satisfaction to the commercial portions of our movie-going mentalities, and of course we all know who he plays. I personally found Ellen Barkin to be underused and in need of further screen time. She's still very hot and still a very engrossing actress. To see the same on-screen pairing of her with Pacino as we did 18 years ago in Sea of Love is quite an interesting and unexpected element of the film, especially when in Sea of Love they played passionate people, tugging violently at each other's emotions. Here, they stand next to each other, rarely exchange words, and almost never look each other in the eye.Soderbergh, who has brought a very fresh and inventive touch of heavy style to the series, creates yet another advanced version of the world of colors, shades, editing, and gloss of Ocean's Eleven. Here, we're accosted by pinks and purples, and otherwise every color in the film is filled in like a lush painting or a Technicolor film by Powell and Pressburger, and title cards are given special backgrounds breaking from the action of the film, behind 1970s-style, almost African-style font. Having always been one of my favorite directors, he stays fresh and clever. Perhaps one minute, you'll think, this movie doesn't have the emotion or scope of a finale, but then you realize that all the characters and environments are those of a cold, earthy gloss. No tempestuous chemistry exists between anyone or anything, and that is part of the universe these films create. Ocean's Thirteen does everything a good, fun heist movie does.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Entertaining movie, third time is definitely a charm","The return of Ocean's crew along with a new member are planning to set up a big but a low-profile heist at the casino of Willie Bank after a double-crossed deal between Willie and one of Ocean's 13. While it does start off a bit slow at first, you can't go wrong with this movie as it does not fail to entertain us. The heist is top-notch, with a few close calls.Who stands out in this movie the most with the best performance? It's a tough one. I personally like the Malloy brothers (played by Caan and Affleck). They were just hilarious. Everyone else did a great job in their role as well.The first Ocean's movie is still probably the best, as a movie itself, as pretty much everything was well executed, but then again, I didn't like Julia Roberts' performance, so to me, this one comes very close. I've never seen Ocean's Twelve, and while I hear that it's the worst of the three, I will still watch it sometime whenever. Anyway, this movie is recommended for everyone.

A solid entertainment that doesn't quite reach the heights of the first,"This is a good entertainment. The first film in the trilogy was a great entertainment. When Ocean's Eleven came along, I remember myself being totally surprised  I had no idea there could be so much ""cool"" in one movie. The all-star cast, which we almost take for granted by this third installment, was unprecedented when it came out. And Soderbergh, who had a solid, fluid, complex script to start with, took all the pieces and mixed them all together to create a fantastically smooth, slick, fast-paced, funny and just plain enjoyable entertainment.But with Ocean's Twelve the gang sort of stumbled. The film suffered from two major flaws. The first was that it gave off the impression of a ""guy's night out"" and not an actual structured movie, with a solid plot or characters. And deriving from this, it just seemed like nobody really cared about what was actually going on. Soderbergh went completely wild with his experimental film style; meanwhile the scriptwriters sloppily glued a plot together that started out from Benedict trying to get revenge on the Eleven and eventually became some sort of competition between thieves that required a lot of suspension of disbelief. Couple that with the actors basically just having their ball throughout and the movie basically being one big private joke, and you had a serious problem unless you were George, Matt, Brad, Steven or any of the other guys involved. The entire movie emulated this sort of feeling that the people on the screen knew something that we, the audience, didn't.Luckily, everyone got their act together for the third installment, starting from the scriptwriters. The gang invited a new screen writing team on board replacing the original writers, and in turn the script returned to a more ""back to basics"" style. This time around no time was wasted and no unnecessary plot threads left astray like the all-over-the-place Ocean's Twelve. Once again, the film returned to the simple, straightforward style of the first: A gang of well-characterized thieves takes revenge on an evil Las Vegas megalomaniac by robbing his casino. The motive that sets things in motion this time around are a little more otherworldly than in the first film, in which Danny Ocean, unbeknownst to his criminal colleagues, set up the Benedict job in order to get back his wife Tess. In Thirteen the motive doesn't work all that well, but it doesn't matter because most of the film, like in the first one, chronicles the set-up and eventually the execution of the job, and it's just a blast to watch. In addition, I must take my hat off to the writers for actually being able to conceive such an amazingly and unbelievably elaborate heist as is featured in this film. It is unfathomably complex and yet, as it all unfolds in the third act, every little thing falls exactly into place. It's simply a thrill to watch.The whole cast is back with the notable omission of a strong female actress. I mean, with all due respect to Ellen Barkin, she isn't exactly Julia Roberts, and in his quest to assemble the most shining all-star cast possible, Soderbergh had a winner with Roberts on board. That said, Al Pacino is quite the addition to the cast. Although we're all more than familiar with his shtick, it was absolutely wonderful to see him in this piece. I rather understandably skipped his last few forays (Two for the Money, 88 Minutes) so essentially the last time I saw him on in a film was in The Merchant of Venice back in 2004. I do hope Pacino does choose to take more higher quality projects such as this one, because it's really sad to see his career in the dump  and worse, he himself admits that the worse the script the bigger the paycheck. The rest of the cast, obviously, do a fantastic job, but the real treat is to see each cast member in his own moment acting opposite the legendary Pacino.In an attempt to create the most unbelievably luxurious hotel man could possibly imagine, production designer Philip Messina went above and beyond to create a treasure cove of amazingly gorgeous sets that are the interior of the Bank hotel. And of course, Soderbergh, who also serves as the film's cinematographer under the code name Peter Andrews, delivers some interesting material, especially in terms of lighting and colouration but also some totally wild composition and an unprecedented use of the zoom lens.In all, Ocean's Thirteen is a fantastic, light-hearted, fast-paced, fun and funny entertainment that contains a taut, focused screenplay that is elaborate and complex while never crossing over the line into confusing. And although it doesn't completely recreate the fresh-faced magic of the first film in the trilogy, Ocean's Eleven, it certainly emulates a similar sensation. It is safe to say that Ocean's Thirteen is the best and most satisfying of this summer's entire onslaught of threequels. Just one thing left me scratching my head: with the omission of Tess, I just don't understand who is the 13th member of the team as appears in the title?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An insult to rats everywhere.,"Won't they ever stop? But I guess as long as moronic audiences worldwide pay to see this kind of plastic, soul-less drivel, there will be ""Ocean's 14"", ""Ocean's 15"" and maybe even ""Ocean's 39"". And by the time ""Ocean's 88"" comes out all of our brains will have drowned in that particular ocean.However, if you thought this movie franchise was more pathetic than anything else that is going on around now, think again: the incredibly transparent media hype surrounding O13 is even more pathetic. Almost every day do we get bombarded in the media by various supposedly ""witty"" remarks Clooney or Damon make about each other or other cast members. Clearly, Clooney and gang a sad ""rat pack"" make, so the producers needed to devise an original way of making sure that everyone in the world knew that Clooney and others were ""really cool"". Nevermind the fact that everything is probably scripted (i.e. every ""ever-so-casual"" utterance) or that Clooney is about as ""cool"" as one of his dead pigs, or that Damon and Pitt look like someone put women's faces on male bodies...I don't think much of the old rat pack either, but even overrated mafia midgets like Sinatra were more interesting than this sorry bunch. Dean Martin had more talent in his fixed nose than Clooney & co. combined.Aside from the movie being dull and idiotic, I was horrified to see Pacino and the ever-ugly Barkin with their new, plastic-surgery-ravaged, faces. They look grotesque. Won't anyone tell these Hollywood fools that after 30 facelifts you start looking like a bizarre creature from another planet?As for Barkin, a certain Gary B. wrote in the IMDb biography that Ellen is ""unconventionally pretty"".

"Fun a casino heist of wit and charm, that pays homage to technology and the digital world.","Well once again Danny Ocean(George Clooney) is back again for round three another casino caper that's full of star power as Clooney again is joined by all-stars Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, and Elliot Gould with this time the story centers around the con of Vegas casino owner Willy Bank(Al Pacino). A new Vegas casino has just opened and Willy Bank who's played perfect by legend Pacino feels good with his right hand lady Abigail(the still hot and sexy Ellen Barkin) yet, Willy hasn't realized he's playing with professionals and revenge is in store, because he had just recently double crossed Reuben(Elliot Gould) out of casino ownership. This time though Danny and his rat pack of boys have new methods and ways to over throw the casino it's mostly the mastermind and manipulation of computers, and the reprogramming of slot machines, and the use of high tech cameras, to the engineering of an earthquake, and manipulation of lie detector testing, to the use of cologne as an aphrodisiac, now that's just to name a few! Really a tribute to the ways that digital technology can be used! And the film is full of plenty of witty lines, and the characters take on their own fake identities even though the plot reveals little about their life in as of a social aspect. Just to mention it was nice to once again see Ellen Barkin and Al Pacino team up again, just remember 1989's beauty ""Sea of Love"". Overall a pretty good film with plenty of star power, fun, wit, and jolly fun to make it interesting as a commercial success and it was surely better than ""Ocean's Twelve"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Out does 11 and 12,"This has to be the best Ocean's movie yet. The acting was great, the story line was kind of confusing at some points but once it got to the actual heist it all came together.

It wasn't about George Clooney or Brad Pitt, and all of the character's area of expertise came out with more umph. There are a lot of surprise parts with the returning of a lot characters, how they're going to pull the robbery off, and if one of the characters is going to survive something bad that happened to him.

The usual suspects come in and try to make things right (or wrong?).It's a fun watch. Nothing too different to say here. Pacino is okay, passable. Everyone else is basically the same.

Those facts in and of themselves make this movie a sham. But willfully suspending disbelief of that- O's 13 has plenty else to make it implausible in the extreme. And plenty less to make it fun to watch.If the enjoyability of your movie depends entirely on the personalities of your actors, and Ocean's most certainly does, then you'd better come up with something cool for them to say and do. Not so, here. The ludicrous nature of the caper and the complete lack of meaningful interplay among its protagonists wipes the flick free of anything like personality. The enjoyable things about Ocean's 11 (snappy dialogue,witty repartees, cool suits, clever dupes, intriguing subplots, etc.) have been completely exorcised. Now all we've got left are a bunch of cool guys without a script talking shop about pulling off an unbelievable, altruistically motivate non-heist (they're not even in it for the money).

Ocean's 13,"It kept me going because of its witty plot, otherwise, I would be sleeping in the cinema's cushy seat. I like them figuring how to revenge this Wilie Bank. They use ideas and I like that.

The story is that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang must come back to revenge Wilie. To bankrupt his great hotel.They start planning from there, and from there it seems a bit slow in the plot. Why don't they start doing things? The idea made me glued to the seat and not move although in some part, I had to blink my eyes or look to nowhere. I have to admit that some parts made me restless because this is the first time I am watching a movie that talks and talks. But still, I manage to see the whole movie. The plot is great and the acting is great. I feel that the music is a bit cheery so I think it would be better if they mix Ocean's 12's music into this movie.Bravo to the director who had the ideas of making it interesting and the ideas of continuing the whole series of the Ocean's.

The movie doesn't really have a clear main plot, since you as a viewer also don't know exactly how the plan is going to work out. It isn't really the sort of a movie with a clear beginning, middle and end. It's more the sort of movie with a story that just 'happens', in which events just happens as they come along. It also adds to the unpredictability of the movie, which is of course on the other hand a good thing.It's again a greatly directed movie, with some great and unique classy style of its own, that shall remind you the most of movie's from the old days. The movie is good looking and fast paced, which makes the 2 hours go by without really realizing it.It was great to see Al Pacino in a role such as this. He hadn't played a real villain for far too long! In this movie he can basically let himself go, but without ever really doing so, in order to not totally outclass the rest of the cast, that are after all the real heart of the series and are what the movies are all about. All of the other 'eleven' actors also appear in this movie again. It's obvious they still have just as much fun playing together as they did when they first started in 2001. That is the foremost reason why it's not unthinkable that more sequels will follow in the future, which will most likely also be directed again by Steven Soderbergh, who also seems to get along with the cast just fine.

The Latter Day Rat Pack is Back,"Java Man Reviews ""Ocean's Thirteen"" (2007, PG-13) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Brian Koppelman and David Levine. Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Ellen Barkin, Al Pacino, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould & David Paymer. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW:Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his latter day rat pack are back in Vegas for another high-stakes caper, this time with a new mark, Willy Bank (Pacino). Bank has swindled Reuben Tishkoff (Gould) out of his partnership share in a new casino and the resulting shock has put Reuben into the ICU. Danny and Rusty (Pitt) gather the gang together to avenge their old pal, and even hope a successful score may bring Reuben back from death's door. The idea is to sabotage the casino's opening night, filch Bank's fortune, ruin his reputation and get to the hospital in time to give Reuben the good news. Of course Bank's empire and all of its sophisticated systems are impregnable, but that's just one more challenge for Danny and his team (and for the screenwriters). Dice are magnetized in Mexico, shufflers and slot machines are rigged, a camera is hidden in Bank's office--but these are just routine tasks for the Thirteen. To make it all work, they must get Bank's computers to shut down for three minutes--and that would take an earthquake.REVIEW: 3 JAVA MUGS OUT OF 4When Reuben learns of Bank's treachery,he tells him that ""You and I both shook Sinatra's hand, and there's a code among the guys who shook Sinatra's hand."" The image of ""Ol' Blue Eyes"" (who also starred in the 1960 original) still looms large in Las Vegas. Whether it was his classy song stylings or his purported mob connections, the man owned that town. So when the swindler rudely replies ""Screw Sinatra's hand,"" you know that Willy Bank will not long rule in the kingdom of cool.Pacino and Barkin, who burned up the screen in 1989's Sea of Love, make impressive villains and are welcome additions to the company. With a cast this stellar and a master filmmaker at the helm, there's no need to worry too much about the story. Just enjoy some of today's biggest stars in their best Armani duds as they swagger through the streets of Sin City.One or two of the subplots add interest, especially Bank's obsessive desire to gain a Five Diamond Award for his new operation. Sal Bloom (Reiner) poses as the evaluator, while the real rater (Paymer) is hilariously mistreated by some of the Ocean crew masquerading as hotel staff.One quibble: A few more women in the cast wouldn't hurt, though I certainly have no complaints about Barkin; it's just that last time out we had Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones.Next time, how about a prequel? Say Ocean's Five or Six, so I won't have to keep track of so many characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Oceans of good fun!,"After the sorrow disappointment that was Ocean's Twelve, I was not at all interested in seeing Ocean's Thirteen since I had a feeling it was just going to be the same thing again. But when people were seeing this film, I was hearing good things about the film. So I figured I would just wait until the rental, I just watched this film yesterday and still, I'm not a huge fan of the Ocean movies, but Thirteen is a good movie. The cast really looked like they had a great time making the film and Al Pacino was a great addition, he makes such a great bad guy. For once, I have to say that Matt Damon actually did a great job in film, I know people are going to bash me for that, but he never keeps my attention in films, but he had a great role to play in Thirteen and was a great comic relief. The story is continued with our hunky heist men.The gang is now suffering paying back the millions that they stole from Terry, so they're not exactly in the mood to get back together any time soon. But when one of their own is betrayed and double crossed by the new man in Vegas, Will Banks, they are out for revenge. Since Will is making a huge splash, he has a casino, a hotel, and millions of dollars worth of diamonds, the boys have to got to find a way to get to his heart. They band together to get this guy back and get their old schemes back in play.Ocean's Thirteen was a lot of fun to watch, it had a bunch of twists and turns at each point. I think my favorite part though was when Matt Damon was posing as Pepperidge and he was seducing Bank's assistant, even though it was a silly moment, it brought a lot of comic relief and the girl was just so funny. Not to mention how they got the diamonds out of the casino was so cool and was great eye candy. The cast did a great job and Thirteen is definitely worth the look. It was a whole lot better than Twelve, let's hope they keep it that way.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

While she was obviously not meant to replace Roberts and Zeta-Jones, I'm glad they chose her; no young starlet could possibly compare.The movie still delivers lots of shallow fun and allows the audience some 'inside joke' humor, more effectively translating this feeling than the previous Ocean's 12. Clooney gets to plug his social responsibility angle; Pitt gets to continue to eat in each scene; Damon enjoys more screen time as the eager to please Linus; while the rest of the gang pretty much lends likable support roles. Then again, Ocean's team is a bunch of affable thieves who always get what they want; their charming, sociopathic appeal makes their audience want to see them succeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's 13 - getting even is not odd... :),"(Karthik Narayan)What are the odds of getting even?No, not a question, it's the tag line of Ocean's 13, the latest movie in a long list of sequels that Hollywood directors have been pouring in this year  Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 not to forget Fantastic Four.After a disastrous Ocean's 12, the sequel had to very good to draw in the audience. So chopping and changing was required. The difference can be felt. The movie has an odd beginning  with Reuben falling into a dizzy after being cheated in a business deal by Bank (Al Pacino). Reuben banks on Danny Ocean and his team to get revenge.Like in Ocean's 11 (the first movie of this series), this movie is also all about the ingenuity that this team can never fall short of. Being chronologically, technologically and logically well advanced, they go on to rig Bank's ultra hi-fi casino and ruin him.Naturally money is a high value factor in the scheme of things and after the fiasco in Ocean's 12, the team runs out of money and seeks their old enemy, Benedict (Andy Garcia) to pitch in. Benedict, always the selfish double-crosser that he is, looks for more than a mere lending-returning transaction. Danny and team are forced to steal the diamonds in Banks' secret vault (even though they don't want to). Benedict hires Toulour (the Frenchman who torments Ocean in Ocean's 12) to steal it before Ocean can.How Danny's ever increasing army of thieves baffles everyone and still manages not to get caught forms the rest of the movie.The best part about the Ocean series of movies is that it doesn't have violence or abusive language (Yes, this movie will not win an Oscar for best script-writing!); there is no fist clenching and definitely no guns (though there are lots of Big Guns, if you know what I mean), except in the end when Toulour fools Linus (Matt Damon) with an empty gun barrel.The entire series always has belonged to Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney (who no doubt is aging but looks cool). I haven't seen an Al Pacino movie, so I can't comment on his acting as ""Bank"", but there isn't much anyway for him. There is no big female lead this time  no Julia Roberts, no Catherine Zeta Jones.Following a little custom that we saw in Ocean's 11, (Lennox Lewis did a cameo) this time it's Oprah Winfrey with a surprise end to the movie that is worth waiting for.Of all the sequels that were released this year, I would say this movie would rank among the better few.My mom doesn't believe in Hollywood movies  to her, its all violence and nothing else. But I am going to ask her to watch Ocean's 11-13 to make her believe it's not always violent and intellect does remain in the movie world!And yes, the movie tag line is a pun on its title, in case you didn't get it already!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This Is by far the Best Sequel Of the SUMMER!,"They got back to what we enjoy most... Getting even with Vegas which is what I love about O-11, and what lacked about O-12.

This is what a popcorn summer is suppose to be, quick paced, light hearted, and WITH A SATISFYING ending unlike other part 3's this summer. The plot might be just a tad out there but all in all you will enjoy it. I mean who really doesn't want to get one over on Sin City.

Oceans Thirteen Better But Still With Some Flaws,"Ocean's Thirteen is better than the other one but still with some flaws fortunately the good outweighs the bad. The all star ensemble cast are all terrific in reprising their roles including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Rob Reiner, Eddie Jamison, and Elliot Guild. Al Pacino joins the cast and he does a good job with his villain role in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are solid in their roles as well. Like the other ones it's better to see Ocean Thirteen without knowing too much about the movie. The pacing was slow at times again and the film still seemed to be juggling to many characters with a few reprising their roles from the past films who only make brief appearances but all of them are effective in their very limited screen time none the less. Ocean's Thirteen despite it's flaws is a solid caper movie much better than some other ones out there. Overall Ocean's Twelve has humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this third entry in the series worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
13 is the lucky number.,"Oceans twelve was unlucky as a sequel. Ocean's thirteen however is right on the spot and a succesfull sequel. 13 is an almost exact copy of the original Ocean's Eleven, but who cares, it works splendidly. And in 13 the feel good factor is back which was lacking in 12. And although there are smart twists in 13 they are not that complicated that you cant understand them as was the case in Oceans twelve.No romances this time. However I did like Julia Roberts and Cahterina Zeta Jones in 11 and 12, I didnt miss the girls in 13. More room for Al Pacino who played the egoistic asshole to a T.It is a formula film, but great formulas can deliver great enjoyable movies, as is the case with Ocean's 13. You know what you are gonna get. You liked it before and you will like it now. Ofcourse the surprise effect is less great than with the first Ocean's Eleven. I give Ocean's 13 a well deserved 7 points, which may turn into 8 points if I start to appreciate this movie even more during the coming years as did happen with the magnificent Ocean's Eleven which I must have seen a dozen times...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Gold-Plated Cow Patty.,"""Ocean's Thirteen"" is a glitzy, gaudy joke. Unfortunately for the audience, though, the joke is on them. I have felt more self-respect after visiting gypsy fortune tellers than I have after seeing this pile of glamorous, conceited, nothing. An Alka-Seltzer has more substance to it than this movie.Undoubtedly, fewer and fewer people are going to remember that this movie is based on the 1960's Las Vegas so-called ""Rat Pack"" of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., comedian Joey Bishop, and actor Peter Lawford. For all their talents, all of them were on the down-side of their careers, some sliding faster than others. Considerations of money aside, once you reach Vegas your creative career is over. Next stop, Atlantic City. The Rat Pack were famous for being famous, and everything they did was some sort of unfunny in-joke. Nevertheless, the one positive thing you can say about them is that they were who they were.With the Ocean's Thirteen bunch, though, they are not who they are. George Clooney may appeal to many people, but no one can accuse him of having a surfeit of talent. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are still decent actors, but you'd never know it from the roles they play in this piece of self-centered fluff. One of them should have given up his role to Ben Affleck, an actor much more suited to the vapidity of these roles. And to see Al Pacino in this film is practically a national tragedy.Mostly, though, I'm mad at myself for ignoring my movie instincts and for joining my fellow movie-going lemmings in donating money to the makers of this idiotic enterprise. See, the joke is on me.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
At least it's better than Ocean's 12 & 8...,"This movie isn't like the previous ones where they just did what they did to enrich themselves: This time they do it to prove a point and for the principal of the matter. It's a nice change from the norm. But overall, the movie just doesn't measure up to Ocean's 11, but at least it's substantially better than Ocean's 12 and MUCH MUCH better than Ocean's 8 obviously... but yeah, it's still a pretty poor showing when compared to Ocean's 11, and at the end of the day, only really is a 7/10 movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is what movies are all about,"Silly, over-indulgent fun with a great cast and crazy storyline.The Cast in Ocean's 11 was spectacular. To add Al Pacino in the mix makes it even more spectacular. The departure of Julia Roberts makes it even more fun.This time it's not for money...it's for revenge...and money. Lot's of silly humour, funny dialogue and bad acting. Perfect! The director and actors try to remind you that this is a film and as such none of them take any of it seriously. However this has the effect of putting a smile on your face and adopt a ""just go with it"" attitude.Clooney and Pitt don't put any effort at all into their performances, they might as well be sitting on their couch at home scratching their nuts. But neither did Dino and Sinatra. But the chemistry between them is amazing. The final scene sees them making fun of George's real life bachelorhood and Pitt's real life Kid-fostering obsession with Angelina Jolie.A noteworthy performance from Andy Garcia, who usually doesn't do ""Hollywood"" movies. He joins Pacino on screen again for the first time since Godfather 3, although they don't share any screen time together.The one who steals the show is Matt Damon, Look out for him trying to seduce Elen Barkin.See this movie, it's great fun and reminds you that cheesiness done properly is fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Film THis Summer and maybe the year,"Had a great new supporting cast Al Pacino was good, and Ellen Barkin was great. This a Next are the best films this year in my opinion Pirates and Spiderman, I think were too hyped up and it led to some disappointment. Ocean's Eleven is my favourite film, I've seen it 46 times and I'm sure I could see this one just as many also. Don't be discouraged by Ocean's Twelve (which was fine except for the Julia Roberts plot) Ocean's Thirteen is a fresh classy sequel. Plus, the poster was good, if you like that sort of stuff. I am kinda repeating Cole Boerens (sorry I have only just read your review after writing my eighth line). However, the ideas put across by Cole and myself are true. Eddie Jemison, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Matt Damon were the stand-out performances in this film. I had hoped Don Cheadle would have been better",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

You knew when one of them was down that they would rally together to support and defeat whatever may get in the way. I loved this as much as I loved the first movie.

Little moments I like;,"The gang slowly learning Chinese for/from Yen, Reuben's Casino-buying habits linked from Ocean's 11, the strange but welcome Mexican workers subplot, the nose gag, the daytime Vegas flavour, and the seamless CGI of the Bank casino.
I like that it's a revenge story designed to defraud and discredit someone. I like Andy Garcia's role. I don't like the lack of female characters, I don't like that it's a typical 'return to form' instead of something new, I don't like that Soderbergh feels as if he's on autopilot, and ugly by design is still ugly; this movie looks insufferably, embarrassingly shoddy. And I hate how Pacino's star power is supposed to make him a villain with none of the subtle and rich nuances of Garcia's first turn.
I can't deny that I enjoy it, bit only because I forget it the most. O13 is a clear vase of diminishing returns. But I'd still bank on the franchise making an exciting return, be it Ocean's 9, Ocean's 14 or Ocean's 21 (as I imagine it should be called in a fun twist), as long as it's a fresh and excited Mr. Soderbergh at the helm.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slick, cool, funny and fun - just what you ordered.","I saw the first one, didn't see the second, then I saw this. It was a Sunday night out to the cinema, and I wanted something relaxed and entertaining. This film fitted the bill perfectly. It has Soderbergh's clear taste for style present with all his wonderful imagery and colour schemes everywhere, David Holmes' sassy soundtrack complimenting the cool subject matter and Eddie Izzard of all people!The setup is a little hard to follow with some quick-cut editing and fast talking in the planning stage, but after that the rest runs as smooth as silk. Perhaps a little too smooth - some things seemed a little convenient and nothing seemed to go wrong, i.e. there was no sense of threat or danger. The ensemble cast is fantastic to see but they all seemed a little too comfortable and devoid of character (even Pacino) but these are the only things that seem to detract from this great piece of entertainment.It's funny, both witty and slightly goofy, visually stimulating and downright cool and entertaining, just what the doctor ordered.

The hotel ranking man couldn't entertain me at all. Unbelievable that a top actor like Al Pacino decided to cooperate with such a bad movie. He can perform much better.

"Silly it is, but Ocean's Thirteen is funnier and visually more pleasing than Ocean's Twelve","In the third instalment of this glossy franchise, heist-mogul-turned hotel entrepreneur Reuben (Gould) finds himself double-crossed out of a deal to open a new hotel-casino on the Las Vegas strip, by evil co-dealer Willy Banks (Pacino). This lands Reuben in hospital after a near fatal heart attack. After hearing of the deal, Danny and his crew decide to exact revenge on Banks by sabotaging the grand opening of his new venture. Perhaps what Ocean's Twelve lacked was the glossy (although admittedly tacky) aesthetic that Las Vegas rewarded the first film with. Because even when Ocean's Thirteen doesn't quite work, such as during the odd faux-romance scenes between Ellen Barkin and Matt Damon, at least the scenery jumps out at you. Yes Clooney, Pitt, Pacino and Soderbergh are way better than this - but the movie is fun, and in comparison with the utter mess that was Ocean's Twelve, it's nothing but a sprightly addition to a series that has probably run its course.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Who is friend #13 anyway?,"What happens when your sequel to a highly successful heist caper delivers a plot twist so unappealing it makes Carrot Top look like Brad Pitt? Go back to the basics. Start from the top, check and see just what made the original so much better and entertaining. Nonetheless, this is what happens with the third installment, and ultimately delivers. Using an excellent staff, quirky camera work, plenty of subtle and unsubtle humor, decent soundtrack, and lack of drama (that was all-too-present in Ocean's Twelve), the third part of this surprise hit trilogy actually holds up well against the original while easily surpassing the sequel. While the lack of women may be a bit of a downer, it could be for the best of the movieand for the men after all it does take place in Las Vegas.After being able to pay off all their debts and whatnot, their next heist has to do with revenge above anything else. After one of the Ocean squad gets ripped off and loses almost all his money to the egotistical and powerful casino owner Willy Bank, the rest of the crew seeks revenge as Bank's latest casino is about to open. Using high-tech gadgets, seduction, and even the help of former enemies, Ocean and the crew attempt to destroy West's opening night by making millions upon millions of dollars for them and other people in a matter of five minutes. While the plot isn't exactly the most believable out there, it doesn't distract from the overall experience.Ocean's 13 is all about the cast of characters, their chemistry together, and their interactions with each other. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon are the main three in terms of screen time and also in terms of performance. Clooney and Pitt carry this aura of smoothness and sophisticated style that not everyone in the Hollywood world has. Helping the pack is Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and more. Rounding out the cast is yet another great performance from the excellent Al Pacino as the villain getting what he deserves, and then Andy Garcia whom was the villain from the previous two heist movies.The budget here is not spent on explosions, monsters, or extensive use of CGI, but instead on expensive yet jaw-dropping sets and props. The casino looked magnificent from the inside and from the outside, as well as pretty much every place in the entire movie (with the exception of Mexico, but you'll see why). In the meantime, returning director Steven Soderbergh gleefully plays and toys with the camera with different angles, different kinds of shots, wide variety of lengths of shots, and even borrowing a technique that was made famous in Fight Club. While its nothing experimental, Soderbergh does a good job showcasing a story using a variety of techniques so the movie never even considers looking stale. Completing the directing is a sort of old-school vibe that accompanies the soundtrack. It begins to look so dated that you might expect even Sinatra to make an appearance.Pacing is what is a turn-off for some moviegoers, and pretty much what destroyed Ocean's 12 (despite the unforgivable plot). Unlike recent third installments, the pacing here remains consistent, and for the most part works well. The majority of Ocean's 13 is setting up the grand scheme, which ranges from an underground bunker in Nevada to a factory in Mexico. The third act is when the plan starts getting off the ground, and the payoff is definitely great for the audience and the lucky cast of gamblers unaware of what is about to unfold.Bottom Line: Despite some missing members of before (where'd all the women go?) Ocean's 13 is slick, stylish, fun, and everything that made the original a surprise smash. The chemistry among the crew remains intact, but now we have a better story to follow, and a better heist to capture on film. Capturing all the glee is Soderbergh, who once again excels in putting his distinct methods of film-making to good use as he contributes a dosage of style, pizazz and old-school flavor to the movie. The ending leaves the door open for more, and as long as they remain as entertaining as this, why shouldn't we continue the series? Clooney, Damon, and especially Brad Pitt seem to have a lot of fun robbing people and screwing around. Whatever happened to the good-ol' days of classic, one-track storytelling anyway?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as Good as the First...Better than the Second,"Ocean's Thirteen - as I stated above - has nothing on the infamous Ocean's Eleven, but is an improvement on Ocean's Tweleve.The plot is simple enough, and the heist is a wonder to watch along with the funnies along the way.Ocean's Thirteen is a good movie that doesn't require a lot of thought and is an ease to watch. You can sit back, relax and watch the Ocean Boys do their thing - once again. It is almost refreshing to sit in a theater for just under two hours (Pirates is nearly 3 hrs, Spider-Man is not as long but feels like it at 2 hrs and 20 mins). The movie, is admittedly at times slow paced, but exciting none the less.I recommend the movie to the Ocean lovers out there - but to others the movie may seem odd or even unfulfilling.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Good Flick,"I did not see Ocean's Eleven or Twelve. I had no intentions of seeing this film in the first place, but my friends wanted to last night, so I went along with them and was pleasantly surprised. Basically, the movie is about a Las Vegas hotshot, Willie Bank, who is going to open a casino. Danny Ocean and his conspirators disliked Bank in the first place, and when Bank cut out his partner, Reuben, Ocean's crew decided to make a revenge strike on Bank's new, self-named casino. The acting was very good. George Clooney and Brad Pitt did a very nice job as the main protagonists. I thought that some of the editing and camera-work was a little goofy (comedic facial close-ups were used a trifle too much), but hey, the movie was funny. Being that this was my first time seeing an Ocean's film, I was a little confused, but I was able to figure out the general gist, and seeing it again earlier today helped out a lot. I would recommend this film to all viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Soderbergh and co return for an Ocean's threequel which covers familiar territory, but is a step up from the previous film","When Danny Ocean's (George Clooney) friend and member of his crew, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), is strongarmed into signing over ownership of his new casino to his unscrupulous double crossing partner, Casino mogul Willy Bank (Al Pacino), Reuben suffers a heart attack and is rendered bedridden. Danny contacts his partner Robert ""Rusty"" Ryan (Brad Pitt) and the rest of his crew come together and hatch a plan to get revenge of Willy Bank and make Reuben whole again and must rely on assistance from former nemesis Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whose interests are temporarily aligned with Ocean's crew.While Ocean's Twelve took a sizable dip in audience and critical reception as well as box office gross, the film still made enough where it was a financial success giving Warner Bros enough faith to greenlight a third entry. With the series returning to Las Vegas, Nevada Clooney had hoped to have the film take place at his then upcoming Las Ramblas Resort which was not ready in time for filming and would ultimately be cancelled meaning that the setting would be at a fictional Casino built on the Warner Bros. Backlot integrated into the actual Las Vegas with visual effects. Most of the cast return this time around with the exception of Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones whose return was conditional upon giving their characters substantial involvement in the story which could not be accommodated leading to their respective characters being written out as ""it's not their fight"". Ocean's Thirteen was better regarded by critics and audiences than Ocean's Twelve, but the film saw yet another dip in box office making $311 million against its $85 million budget which while still successful meant it was the first film in the series not to place within the top 10 highest grossing films of the year. Ocean's Thirteen is very much a ""back to basics"" entry for the series going back to the glitzy glamour, quick pacing, and rapid fire dialogue that originally won over the audience with the first entry. While it lacks the novelty of the first entry, this is a welcome follow-up more aligned with what audiences wanted from Ocean's Twelve.While the writing does have to do some slightly clumsy workarounds in the writing such as unceremoniously sidelining Roberts' and Zeta-Jones' characters as well as taking Elliot Gould's Reuben off the table for roughly half the movie depriving the film of Gould's trademarked dry ironic delivery as he lays catatonic in a bed, once the movie is allowed to get going it hits the ground running indulging in the same high energy heist hi-jinks we know and love. Stepping back from the approach taken in Ocean's Twelve where the heists were shown after the fact depriving them of much of their tension and thrills, Ocean's Thirteen follows the heists as they go with more speed and focus allowing the film to engage the audience more on the stakes. Al Pacino is clearly having fun as ruthless Casino boss Willy Bank and while there are some similarities to Garcia's Terry Benedict, Pacino and the film do a decent enough job to keep him from feeling like a rehash especially since Bank is more malicious and antagonistic. Some elements from the film do admittedly verge on silly such as the plan of simulating an earthquake underneath Bank's Casino which tries to leap over the ""pinch"" blackout by several leaps and bounds. The movie also tries to shoehorn Vincent Cassel's Francois Toulour aka The Night Fox into the plot, but luckily, it's a borderline cameo appearance so despite being unnecessary, it's at least unintrusive.Ocean's Thirteen is very much a back to basics entry after the deviations in Ocean's Twelve didn't play to their advantage resulting in them going back to something more familiar. While you could argue Thirteen has some opposite issues from Twelve in maybe playing itself a little too safe and clumsily writing out Roberts, Zeta-Jones, and side lining Gould while also unnecessarily bringing back Cassel, Ocean's Thirteen is fun escapist fare that doesn't expect you to do much other than have a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

But that the question is even asked means that something is wrong because when a movie is good, the question NEVER comes up. This movie has to be one of the more mindless, pointless products from the Hollywood potboiler production factory. The movie tries to be sophisticated, the movie tries to be funny, but all it does is generate that short yet poignant question: SO WHAT? A bunch of guys trying to rob a Las Vegas casino, going through gyrations that are so disjointed and confusing that it defies all logic. What WAS good about this movie, however, were the performances of David Paymer and Ellen Barkin. Both demonstrated a level of comic acting that is responsible for whatever humor this movie was capable of generating. Ms. Barkin definitely has what it takes to be a wonderful comic actress and Mr. Paymer definitely should have a sitcom of his own. As for the other characters, let is be, as the song says.

Pleasantly Surprised!,"Well firstly, i've seen both of the previous movies and even though i don't think its a huge problem if you hadn't have done, i would have thought most people who would go and see Ocean's Thirteen would have seen the others! After having been a little disappointed with the second instalment and with so many prequels already released this year (ie. spider-man, pirates of the caribbean, shrek) getting mediocre (if that) reviews, i wasn't honestly expecting too much from this! However, i'm happy to announce that this was definitely better than Ocean's Twelve and even though not quite upto the original, it was definitely the film i have enjoyed the most so far out of the big prequels (mainly spider-man & pirates)! One major good point, which is the downfall of many of these big movies is that Ocean's Thirteen is not TOO long and doesn't drag on! Its got a good plot which uses all of the well-known characters in the best way (even though i would've liked to have seen abit more acrobatic stuff from the little Chinese guy) and its funny in all the right places! Witty, but not pathetically pointless! Again, its very clever with all of the gadgets they use in their plan and it kept moving which is what i hate most about certain films!

Somewhere in between Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve,"Ocean's Eleven was a splendid movie, in which the gang has invented the most ingenious heist ever. In Ocean's Twelve the heist was actually a fist fight in a train, which cleverly mocked the first part. What makes both movies similar is the fact that they both have a script with a climax and a plot twist which is actually the nicest part in a movie of that kind.This is actually what disappointed me in Ocean's Thirteen. It has no climax and no plot twist. There are many small tricks that are taking place on screen, and the movie creates a feeling of complexity not because there is something really complex, but because there are many things to follow and keep in mind at the same time. And this is the only major drawback of Ocean's Thirteen  the linear and steady development of the story, with no ""jumpy"" parts.Leaving this behind, the movie is great. The humor is very clever and also wins the audience with the fact that it is trying to be different from the previous parts and to integrate more complex and fresh jokes, which is something not many films manage to do. All the actors are as good as they always were  worthy of watching over and over, the atmosphere is nice and relaxing.On the whole, the last part of trilogy is worthy of standing proud next to its two older brothers... or sisters.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A similar comical heist, with lots of unrealistic twists and taken for good support on the good side, makes it too predictable. Although the lead actors perform good and try their best, the loop holes make them suffer. The first movie with static script in Ocean's trilogy. Watch this movie without any expectations or don't compare it with the previous two. You can give it a one time watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Feel-good, entertaining night out","Out of all of the movies I've seen in the past year, this rated up there with the best of them. In this one, the guys get back to focusing on pulling the heist rather than on also chasing the women. The result is that it seems all of the characters were given a bit more of the spotlight, which I think added greater depth to the story. Unlike 12, Thirteen spent must of its time in one or 2 locations, and the consistency of the setting I think added to the cohesion of the script. It was also fun to see how they worked in many of the minor characters from the two previous movies. I was entertained from start to finish, and nowadays that is what I consider to be mark of a very good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You shook Sinatra's hand. You should know better.,"I won't say there will not be an Ocean's Fourteen because Rocky and Rambo seem to go on and one, and this may too, but it would be a shame. This movie was just a shadow of Ocean's Eleven and it seemed that the stars were phoning it in.The best part of a caper film is the setup. There was little of that present here. It was more concerned with given stars like Andy Garcia some air time. It just didn't work for me and I felt that they were just looking for another paycheck for the gang.Of course, I will join the fans of People and Teen Choice, and say that I enjoyed seeing George Clooney and Brad Pitt again, but I was unimpressed with their performances. I also like seeing Ellen Barkin, but she was way below the standard she set in The Big Easy. Eddie Izzard is always enjoyable.Let's hope that they don't do any more.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can Bank on it,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every bit as good as the first one, and far superior to 12 ... the only thing missing is the excitement of a new franchise. Director Steven Soderbergh and all the familiar smirking faces are back, as is the colorful wardrobe.With a look and feel very similar to the ultra-cool first one with Sinatra and Martin, Thirteen is back at home in Vegas where the franchise belongs. This time the revenge is aimed at mega-sleaze ball Al Pacino, who screws over Ellott Gould for his share of the hottest new casino in Vegas. The boys aren't happy about this and, of course, what comes next is an elaborate plan that only someone as genius as George Clooney and Brad Pitt could truly comprehend. Anyway, it is fun to watch Pacino do what he loves ... chew his scenes with vigor.The other new face is that of Ellen Barkin, in her return to the big screen after her billionaire divorce. I for one, enjoyed having her sit and home counting money and cringed to hear she would be back on screen. Luckily she is given little to do other than wear a tight dress and act drugged around Matt Damon.The smarm is on full display as Pitt and Clooney continue to finish each other's sentences and the best scenes utilize Soderbegh's quick edits to capture the fine timing of all boys and their assignments. Even Andy Garcia is back and joins in the revenge plot with a twist of his own. As is customary, each of the boys gets their own little moment of spotlight, some to more success than others. It is nice to see Vincent Cassell (the only good thing about 12) back, if only for a brief visit.Overall, this hits what it swings at, and is nothing more or nothing less than we would expect from these pros who show up every three years to have some fun and get paid. Undoubtedly, there will be another in the series, as they have the process down to a science and they receive a nice pay day. Small price to pay for a fun popcorn flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie,"I saw this last night, and I was thoroughly pleased and enjoyed myself for the entirety of the film. The camera/shooting kept true with the first of the Ocean's movies, and was very pleasing to see the story unfold. I was a bit disappointed with the way the story went because it didn't contain as much suspense as Ocean's Eleven, but I suppose this is due to the 'double-cross/revenge' type storyline. I was very pleased with the little gibs of humor dispersed throughout the entire movie, just like the first two, and this kept my interest the entire time. I was very glad to see all of the characters come back and play their roles once more, and Al Pacino doing a great job with his part. Overall, I'd say that it was definitely worth the $9.50 I paid to get in and see the movie. There was some room for improvement, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie.

Back in Las Vegas,"""Ocean's Thirteen"" goes back to the original film's roots and delivers a silly yet rather entertaining Las Vegas caper. The gang is back to take revenge on Al Pacino and sabotage his newly-opened casino. The crazier the plan, the more fun, but I wish things didn't always go so smoothly. We have seen this before and already know that even what gets shown as trouble is actually part of the plan, with Danny Ocean always in control of the situation. Some real incidents and improvisation along the way would definitely make things much more dynamic and entertaining.Even though the performances felt a little phoned-in at times, the cast still works pretty well together, and no one is suffering from the absence of Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones (nothing against them, but both their love stories were oversimplified and out of focus).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun light movie,"As the first one was or more in the spirit of the first installment. I did like Oceans 12 too, but this goes in the direction of the first one, with a few surprises here and there. I have to admit, that I didn't count how many ""friends"" Ocean had in this one (were there really 13?) ... But then again, does it really matter? I don't think so personally.A brief introduction of the new villain this time around shows him as an evil man. But for some people (a friend of mine in particular) he wasn't evil enough ... I can see why he says that, because Al plays it a bit more subtle than Andy G. did in the first movie. Still Al is phenomenal in my book, including this movie!

You get the impression that Clooney and his mates enjoyed the last one and decided to get together again in Vegas and knock out a movie while they were there. The cast seem to be enjoying themselves while forgetting the basics of movie making i.e. entertaining the audience. The pace sags in places and you never really get involved in the story.

I liked it a great deal though I will say I was ambivalent until the end, which while not a great pay off was really good.If you want to see it either do so on the big screen or wait for the widescreen DVD since this was shot in a glorious widescreen that will lose a great deal on full screen TV See it, it will distract you for 2 hours-you may not (probably won't) love it but you will like it a great deal.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, But not satisfactory","The movie had a lotta expectation --- but as far as i'm concerned it didn't live up to it. Steven did a very nice job directing but it was not as good as the first part. The spark which was there in the first part is absent. All the planning and execution has been filmed with exceptional brilliance. As usual, Steven scores in that. But... an actor of Al Pacino's caliber has been wasted. He didn't have much to do except sit back let everything happen---especially when he was introduced as such a rude n crude person. The comedy plays a very very important part---the spontaneous dialogue delivery from george clooney and brad pitt are still good and i'd say its even better...Overall, the movie is an excellent entertainer---its a little disappointing only because of the image created by the previous 2 versions...

A Nutshell Review: Ocean's Thirteen,"13 is not an unlucky number for this Steven Soderbergh directed franchise. With many a blockbuster presenting their third installments this summer - Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean, Shrek, Bourne and the likes, Ocean's 13 bested those that have already gone before, with something light and breezy, although rehashing the tried and tested formula employed in Ocean's Eleven.I've always enjoyed heist movies, and Ocean's Eleven was a very smart one at that, given the bonus of having assembled some of the top names in Hollywood and having some of them play second fiddle. It was thoroughly fun, and I thought it had a very smart exit strategy. Ocean's Twelve however was a little flat, as the ending was a bit of a cop out, and didn't really excite with its smart alecky narration finale. The only memorable events from Ocean's Twelve were Bruce Willis and how Arsenal football club was weaved into the proceedings.Ocean's 13 leaves behind Europe and returns to where the action started, back to Vegas, where Willie Bank (Al Pacino), the most unscrupulous man on the strip, plays out Reuben (Elliott Gould) of their joint casino hotel The Midas - now renamed The Bank hotel, and causes the latter to suffer from a stroke. The rest of the Ocean gang, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) are mad, and congregate back in Las Vegas to seek revenge the best way they know how - to steal and to humiliate Bank on the opening night of his new casino.And we welcome back the friends we know from the previous two movies, with Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan the right hand man, who also opened this movie as he did the previous installment, Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, who is looking to break out of the shadows of Danny and Rusty to prove his worth, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Qin Shaobo the kungfu kid, Casey Affleck, Scott Cann, Carl Reiner and Eddie Izzard. There's no Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, both of whom were written out of the movie early, between conversational pieces of Danny and Rusty. Gone are the two leading ladies, only to be replaced by a very wrinkled Ellen Barkin as Abigail Sponder, the personal assistant to Bank.The chemistry amongst the thieving team remains intact, as once again we experience the camaraderie amongst the sarcasm and wit, with the banter between Danny and Rusty being pure gold, especially their final exchange with real life references. However, the scene stealer here (the other contender being Carl Reiner's absolutely hilarious role) is definitely Matt Damon. Still wanting to get into the thick of the action, and ever ready to volunteer for key roles, his Linus Caldwell is a hoot to watch, especially when he goes under disguise. A far departure from his more serious roles, like the upcoming Bourne Ultimatum (also the concluding part of the franchise), he fits that mummy's / daddy's boy figure to a T.While we get to return to the Bellagio, and with spanners thrown into our jolly men's plans, Ocean's Thirteen does feel a little dragged out. The structure's the same, with the middle part hinging on the setting up of the elaborate plan, leaving the final moments for the execution and the exit strategy with a twist. Sometimes having too much of a good thing do make the pace a little wonky. There's nothing really new to expect, except that Soderbergh actually went a step ahead and pulled the rug from under the audience's feet, and it's a clever little rouse involving the trailers you see for the movie. Now that's pure gem.What should put bum onto the seats will be the return of familiar faces into the roles, and in all honesty, a franchise episode that actually feels refreshed.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are exceptions of course, but in general, I get bored watching such films, as they all have similar plots. For those who got a kick out of OCEANS 11, I suspect this second sequel will tickle your fancy, if you can follow it. I watched it much too casually, and kept getting lost. For the record, Clooney and crew are on the vengeance trail against casino owner Pacino, who screwed over one of their own (Gould). I was quite happy to see veterans Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner still in on the action. Keep an eye on Damon in this one. For my money, he -- not Pacino -- steals the show.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Everybody Just Wants To Have Fun.,"Willie Bank back stabs Reuben and it leaves him fighting for his life. The gang hear about this and decide to make Willie lose all his money opening night at his new Casino, which Reuben was supposed to be a partner for.After the wreck that was Oceans Twelve, the gang decided they needed to go out on top, so they decided to throw us Oceans Thirteen. While this third installment is leaps and bounds over the sequel, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original. With everything it does right, there are a few steps they miss. The biggest one? Action. There is no action in this film what so ever. The con itself is a little off as well, nothing big here, they simply make the house lose by rigging all the games. It doesn't turn out to be as exciting, but the laughs are there and there is also some fun had.Everyone is back, with the exception of the two females from the first two. It's not their fight apparently. So it's boys night out. Just like the first two, you can tell that everyone is having fun here and nothing is to be taken too seriously. We have fun because we've been on the ride with them since the first film came out. Since this is the third time around it seems that most of them have very little to do this time around. This was a complaint many had with the second and is another one I have on this one. Bernie Mac is basically useless and used to ""keep tabs"" on certain characters. Soderbergh definitely saw that he didn't have much to do, so they threw him in for that task. As well as the character Yen, although for some reason they use him as a high roller. Would they do this? Take this risk for the things at stake? Pacino is a new addition and he's laid back here, surprisingly. He still chews up the scenery though. Ellen Barkin is also a new addition as Pacino's assistant. She plays a tough face, no stretch or anything. The funniest performance is from Casey Affleck, who helps with a strike in Mexico. Even Izzard and Garcia show up again.Some of the things they do are a little stretched, as is the amount of money they have. But we go along for it anyway. We are here to watch the impossible happen. To watch these guys have fun doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The con is nothing special, they rig casino games. Nothing too extravagant, the whole film seems to be not trying as hard. With the sequel they are raising houses, nothing that big here, just rigging card games.In the end, I can give this a recommendation because I did have fun. I never took any of it seriously and neither should you. If you want action and big cons, it won't be here. They go smaller this time. They also pull some twists, which is expected, so it doesn't come as a big shock when it happens. When any of them happen. There are lots of inside jokes as well, if you get them you'll enjoy it a little more. Either way, give it a try.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The storyline and plot was terrific, I was not bored for one second while watching the film. All of the twist and turns and little challenges that arose, made the movie that much enjoyable.

Just the same as the others...,"Ocean's 13 is the ending of one of the most successful series in recent years, and it finishes it off much the same as the rest of the films: fun, tricky, and completely free of deeper meaning or value.I am a fan of both of the previous Ocean's films. I seem to be just about the only person who really enjoyed Ocean's 12, but I thought it was probably the funniest of the three. Ocean's 11 definitely remains the best of the group, as well it should, and 13 is probably my least favorite. But that doesn't mean it wasn't any good. It was fun and funny throughout.The story is simple- at least for an Ocean's movie. One of the gang, Reuben falls deathly ill after being screwed over by Vegas tycoon Willy Banks (Al Pacino). Therefore the crew set out to destroy Willy by making his newest and grandest casino (the one he was supposed to share with Reuben) a flop. And they pull out all the tricks, some ingenious and some just absurd.The film was fine, and that was all. I didn't leave it raving or excited, but I also certainly didn't leave it disappointed. Except for one thing: Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherina Zeta-Jones was present for this film, and that was disappointing as they were my favorite parts of the other two film. Without them, the guys are just okay entertainers in my opinion. I will say, though, that Ellen Barkin did a wonderful job in her (unfortunately) small part. Of the guys, Matt Damon was probably my favorite.So, the Ocean's films end with satisfaction and humor along for the ride. I don't really understand the raving that this one was so much better than the others, because, in my opinion, they're all on the same level.

Big Entertainment,"After the brutally damaging Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's Thirteen is a refreshing overhaul of the Ocean genre.The swank opening credits (borrowed from a vintage NYC WWOR-TV channel 9 four o'clock movie intro) sets the red carpet mood in 70's Vegas style. The usual gang of thieves take on new challenges with new alliances against new enemies.Nothing really new, but very entertaining at the least, I believe. Some scenes border on surreal - owing to Vegas' limitless canvas of pizazz, gaudiness, and cheese. And then there are scenes with some touching moments that soften things up a bit (Elliott Gould is okay in my book).Toss in a few over-the-top comedic routines, dirt & diamonds, a cougar, some old school charm and a bit of luck, and Ocean's Thirteen scores big entertainment.

Carl Reiner loosely resurrects Alan Brady,"As with ""Ocean's 11"", the best parts here are everything leading up to the heist (I haven't as yet seen ""Ocean's 12""). I guess that I've always thought that the coolest parts of elaborate plots are the plots themselves rather than the result. Just earlier this month, I went to Las Vegas to see Cirque du Soleil's ""Love"" (a visual production of the Beatles' songs; I highly recommend it), so it was fairly interesting to see the sites here. I interpreted Willie Banks's (Al Pacino) hotel as the real symbol of Las Vegas: disgustingly giant so as to fulfill one's own hubris.All in all, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is some pretty neat entertainment. Steven Soderbergh has certainly proved himself a capable director during these past few years. Playing their roles from the earlier movies are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould. In fact, Carl Reiner's character reminded me of his earlier Alan Brady (the boss on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"").

Silly fun,"As silly, gaudy and drawn out the Ocean's franchise had gotten by its third outing, I still somewhat enjoyed Ocean's Thirteen, an overblown attempt to keep the magic alive that most of the time trips over its own bells and whistles. That being said, the gang is all there, and that alone is good for some laughs. This time around, Eliott Gould's cranky charmer Reuben has been ousted from his Vegas property by Willie Bank (Al Pacino) a ruthless and ludicrously rich casino tycoon with big plans for the future. Reuben is left in a dazed depression, and the gang all drifts back together to try and rob the hell out of Pacino, using methods and cons so over the top they almost seem like a parody of the former films. Pacino is a bit more clownish than Andy Garcia's grim Terry Benedict was in the first film, which adds to the cavalier absence of any sense of real danger. In fact, Benedict is now chummy with the gang himself, which is a cute turn of events but kind of seems too silly. Ellen Barkin adds a lot of class as Pacino's head honcho, fitting into the Ocean world nicely. The gang I'd all back and more eccentric than ever, with Matt Damon scoring comedic points in one of the funniest prosthetic jobs I've ever seen. Newcomers to the show include Julian Sands, Oprah Winfrey and a reliably hapless David Paymer. It's not that this one takes the formula too far, it's just that we've been there, done that, got the t- shirt and there was really not much need for it. I won't say no though, because the blue print of what made the first so fun is still there, it's just been jazzed up and adorned with a few too many gilded sequins and fancy jib jab. Still enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Analog players in a digital world.,"The latest movie in this summer of the sequel is a departure from the first three heavyweights of ""Spider-man 3"", ""Shrek the Third"", and ""Pirates 3"". Aimed more at adults than adolescents, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the clean-up hitter this summer. In baseball, a clean-up hitter usually has power. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" has star power, perhaps more than any other release this summer, and the movie wields its weapons well.While Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are not back for this installment, all the men of ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Ocean's Twelve"" do reprise their roles. George Clooney and Brad Pitt head up the gang of thieves, aided by Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and the rest of the crew that moviegoers have come to know over the last six years. The biggest addition to the cast is a name bigger than all of them, and his character is the catalyst for the caper that drives the entire film. The man is Al Pacino, playing a flashy casino owner who incurs the gang's wrath by betraying Elliott Gould's Reuben Tishkoff, setting the stage for the rest of the revenge movie.The first film was a modern classic that thrived on the energy of Las Vegas and the cool confidence of Clooney and Pitt. Twelve lost much of those factors by bouncing around Europe and putting the band of thieves on the run. Thirteen returns to the franchise's successful roots, taking place predominantly in the colorful world of Sin City and also placing the heroes in control most of the time.In restoring those two key elements, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" recaptures the spirit of the original. The dialogue isn't as crisp or smart, but it's close, and elements of the past glory are present. Things like con-man lingo and everyone bilingually communicating with The Amazing Yen provide well-done unexplained humor. Writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who penned quality guy flicks like ""Rounders"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") do overuse the borrowed elements, as though they decided to repeat the good parts of the original's script as often as possible, and the resulting jokes wear a bit thin over the course of the movie.Returning to Vegas is a wise choice that simplifies the plot. Though staples of heist movies, like double-crosses and sleight of hand, are present, the story is largely straight forward. You know what the guys are going to do; you're just watching to see how the crew overcomes the various inevitable obstacles. This makes it slightly less entertaining, but also makes for a very comfortable viewing experience, despite the required suspension of disbelief. The cinematography of Steven Soderbergh (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) helps too; the pictures and transitions are not to the impressive level of ""Eleven"", but they have their moments, as do the quirky uses of titles and graphics.As is the case in many sequels, the cast slides effortlessly back into their roles. Clooney and Pitt are smooth; Damon is trying to prove himself; Bernie Mac is a fast-talker, etc. As the new guy, Pacino effectively joins the fray with a surprisingly underplayed part. He's not the big, bold, brash near-caricature that he has morphed into through movies like ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"". He still looks the over-the-top part with his deep tan and vibrant suits, but he is more kniving than bombastic, which is a very appropriate choice for the movie.""Ocean's Thirteen"" is the cinematic version of a lazy river ride at a water park. You hop in your inner tube and cruise around the lengthy pool, admiring the view, chatting with friends, and generally enjoying the laid-back experience. Unlike many of this summer's blockbusters, it does not bombard you with loud effects or action scenes. It won't shock and awe you by pulling wool over your eyes with a mind-blowing twist. Instead, gentle turns and reveals are sprinkled throughout, providing an enjoyable two hours spent with familiar and entertaining characters.Bottom Line: A good summer diversion that returns to the roots of the series. Not as good as the first, but better than the second. 7 of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best of Oceans',"I've just re-watched Ocean's 11, 12 (forwarding all the time) and 13 and the last is definitely the best with me. One doesn't look for much sense in a heist movie as long as it is funny and entertaining which O13 sure is. The plot is rather unbelievable, from drilling an underground tunnel in Vegas with the Chunnel machines to ripping a secure glass showcase out of heavy-duty concrete base. With a helicopter, yeah. So far it is all fantasy but a very cute one. The heist scheme is partly revealed althrough the preparation but the viewer doesn't get the whole picture and has to puzzle it out up to the very end. That's enough to keep you on throughout the movie, with some very funny moments here and there, and the whole cast's very good acting. The Mexican episodes were superb.I also unexpectedly liked the absence of female characters save Barkin's Abbie cougar, or any sappy romance (as much as I enjoy Catherine Zeta-Jones and tolerate Roberts). Thank to that absence we have a cool, funny, resolute team in which everyone has more or less equal importance to the watcher, and their camaraderie is warm and easy. No one steals the show.This movie is a keeper. 'Nuff said!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should we be looking for a Fourteen?,"After seeing Ocean's Twelve not quite three years ago,I wasn't sure if the idea of making another Ocean's film would be such a good idea. But hearing and reading the reviews of this movie convinced me to invest in this sequel(amongst a summer of high profile sequels),and I'm pretty happy I did. As for my summary line,after seeing this offering,a sequel doesn't seem like such a bad idea anymore.The story is probably tighter than the previous two movies: Casino owner and LAs Vegas old guard Reuben Tishkoff(Elliott Gould)has a massive heart attack when he is basically swindled by an over-aggressive casino entrepreneur named Willie Bank(Al Pacino,dialing it down to be as dry and quietly menacing as he is unscrupulous). News travels relatively quickly to Tishkoff's friends,aka the gang from the previous fixes: Danny Ocean(George Clooney,really smooth,even for himself),Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt,not even needing deodorant for this film!),Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon,resting up for the third Bourne movie),Livingston Dell(Eddie Jemison),Frank Catton(Bernie Mac,in a role he seems born to play),BAsher Tarr(Don Cheadle,happy to take lighter stuff as always),Yen(Shaobo Qin,doing a little more than neat stunts this time),the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan and CAsey Affleck)and Saul Bloom(Carl Reiner,as sharp as ever at 85),and they all agree to enact revenge on Bank. It's ultimately agreed upon that the best revenge on Bank is to sink his brand new casino hotel,and the plot to do so is set into a looming,looping,exacting motion,as usual.Featuring some fairly inspired secondary performances by Ellen Barkin(as BAnk's sexy,exacting assistant),Eddie Izzard(As a new investor to bankroll Ocean),Robert Einstein(aka ""Super""DAve Osborne,as a Vegas gaming fed),David Paymer(as an unassuming-looking hotel reviewer who's about to have one of the lousiest hotel stays of his life)and Andy Garcia(back as one-time and possibly future nemesis,Casino boss Terry Benedict),this movie moves in brisk,sharp,clean strokes,complete with set-up,enactment and completion,all documented in an efficient,multi-screened stream of events. Director Steven Soderberg doesn't seem to care that elements of the film seem either vague or rough,preferring to allow the film-goer either take it or leave it as a finished product. Some may not care for it,I didn't mind it at all. Where ""Eleven"" was stylish and almost ruthless in its style,and ""Twelve"" had a promising set-up and effortlessly likable first half undermined by an utterly confusing last half,this movie returns to the original formula for the most part,and to me,the best parts of this film may also be what makes it less than perfect:that is,it's easy flow,quickness and lack of interest in the core details of the job. Still,I can let it go if a movie about a massive con isn't interested in plying the whole craft before the viewer as long as said movie still keeps it entertaining and quick,and I'm happy to say ""Thirteen"" does just that.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better than the second , not as good as the original","Refused to go see this at the cinema due to the bad taste still in my mouth from ""Oceans Twelve"".The premise of 13 is pretty simple. Reuben (Gould), the gang's buddy casino owner has just been shafted in a deal with hotshot casino owner Banks (Pacino). The gang wants revenge, and so sets out to make every gambler a winner on the new casino's opening night by rigging all the machines. Forget how totally implausible this is and just enjoy the banter and charisma of the showcase of Hollywood stars in the movie, most notably Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Most of the characters seem to have no more than 100 words of dialogue and 15 minutes of screen time. It's OK, but the idea has kinda been done to death.

"The most enjoyable and most entertaining of the ""Ocean"" series.","Danny Ocean (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) and his crew (Brad Pitt, Oscar-Winner:Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Cann, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Edward Jemison and Shaobo Qin) decide to help one of their crew members (Elliot Gould).

Which he and Walter were going to start an Casino together but Walter decides to go in Business for himself. Now Danny and his crew will do anything to beat Walter at his game during the Casino's opening night but Danny also has no choice to ask his former enemy (Andy Garcia) for help as well.Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven ""2001"", Out of Sight, Solaris ""2002"") made an enjoyable heist comedy that is a major improvement over ""Ocean's Twelve"".

Also in the supporting cast are Ellen Barkin, Eddie Izzard, David Paymer, Julian Sands and Vincent Cassel.

Revenge heist,"This one isn't as good as ""Ocean's Eleven"" but it's better than ""Ocean's Twelve"". This is more of a mission to wreck someone by stealing from that person than just mainly focusing on the money. Although money does play a factor. Out of all the three movies in this franchise this one however has the most meat to it when it comes to the heist. And the crew is back to do what they are good at in a cool and stylish manner. And this time the teams main target is Willy Bank(Al Pacino) after he screws Reuben on a deal. The heist and dialogues have it's clever moments although some parts are just absurd and doesn't make much sense. It's a entertaining heist flick but just didn't stand out all that much to the point I could call it a memorable flick. On a positive note though the cast doesn't try way too hard to be cool, which just came off more smug and pedantic than cool. Overall this is a stylish heist movie that has some substance to it and is worth seeing at least once.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Next Plan 9 From Outer Space?,"A boat load of stars standing around while the director, (was one even on the set?), has them run through a few reaction shots, read a few lines, stand up, move around a little and in the end just insert edit their payday work into a standard low budget, no brain caper film that has the look of last years 'I've got all the new FX plug-ins' on my cool Final Cut Pro machine. Obviously in the execution of this sorry excuse for a film, the Writer(s), Director, and Studio couldn't even convince Brad Pitt, Matt Damon et al to even pretend (act?) they were aware of what movie they were in. It would be surprising if they even knew until they cashed their 'contractual obligation' paychecks that they where 'acting' in a movie that day. Al Pacino typically growls up a storm, and attempts to carry the film, all the while playing to a George Clooney that might as well have been green screened into their scenes, or the whole film for that matter.

Fun in Vegas,"The usual suspects get together for ""Ocean's Thirteen,"" the usual suspects being George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, and Andy Garcia.This time the villain of the piece is Al Pacino, as hotel mogul Willy Bank, who cheats the now-ill Reuben out of his share of the business. Danny wants to get Reuben what's his. Ellen Barkin plays Pacino's assistant. She's a ""cougar.""As usual, the gang's plan to bring down Bank is preposterous, filled with technological gimmicks, rigging all of the betting machines and the dice, etc., as they deal with worker problems at one of the manufacturers in Mexico.It's fun to see it come together. However, it's also a little confusing and nowhere near as entertaining as Ocean's Eleven. The best part of the film for me was the gang's efforts at destroying the stay of someone there to review the hotel (David Paymer) - hilarious.What makes these films watchable is the terrific casts, even if they are just having a good time.

"""Ocean's"" series finds its swagger with third installment","There aren't really any shocking twists or deceptive mind games in ""Ocean's Thirteen,"" but it's cool, it's clever, it's fun and it's way better than ""Ocean's Twelve.""The all-star cast needs no mentioning other than the loss of Julia Roberts and the addition of another Italian casino bigwig in Al Pacino. I suppose we can look forward to Robert DeNiro in ""Ocean's Fourteen.""This time, the gang is motivated by revenge for Pacino's character William Bank screwing over Elliot Gould's character (one of the thirteen) and causing him a near-death experience. The idea is simply to get even with Bank by making his casino a huge loser. The plot has no extra meat and it's swift and to the point.

A quality film for people of all generations,"Oceans 11 was an excellent film. It couldn't miss. It was a remake of the 1960's film starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr., with a modern all star cast.Oceans 12 fell short of the hype for me. This is mostly due to the fact that the film wasn't set in Las Vegas, which in my opinion is the heart of the first film.Oceans 13 however redeems the trilogy in a superb way. The group of criminals with a heart of gold are back in Vegas and as charming as ever. If you didn't see the first two, no worries, as the this films plot unfolds independently of the first two.

"Very Entertaining, Though Not as Expected","Ocean's 13 is an interesting third outing as it moves in a somewhat different direction from the slick, complicated misdirection of the first film and the mottled, forgettable attempts at humor of the second. Instead, the film is supported by character interaction, which succeeds on many different levels. This is no surprise of course considering the talent involved. All the actors contribute to the film well with the possible exceptions of George Clooney, who hams it up a bit more than usual, and some of the more minor character roles (mostly those outside Ocean's actual 13), which are a bit drowned in the enormity of the rest of the cast (an inevitability). The film is an enjoyable surprise because instead of stylized plot and grandiose emotion, it instead highlights subtle (and sometimes not so subtle in the case of Clooney's exaggeration) character interactions that keep the watcher chuckling and sometimes outright laughing throughout the entire movie. The standout performances are by far Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, who carry the film in most of the more humorous scenes. Pitt seems to be the smooth, cool anchor of the film always making the most of his screen time and persona, while still facilitating the other actors' performance. The only disappointment of the film (and it is only a minor disappointment) is Al Pacino. This may be an unpopular remark, but he does not stand out in his role instead he delivers a consistent, but unremarkable performance. Oceans 13 is an excellent and amusing piece of entertainment though it may not contain enough sex and violence to appeal to the crazed summer movie public.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Easy and decent to watch,"Oceans 13 is an end to the Oceans trilogy and it finishes off pretty good. A lot of people were weary about watching this because of the previous Ocean movie and i realise a lot of people didn't like the third one. I personally think that this movie rocks and although its not as good as the first one (what is?) it still kicks but.The story is about revenge and also a heist on Willie Banks (Al Pacino) who cheated Rubin into giving up his business. Rubin has an attack and almost dies. Danny Ocean and his crew want to get back at Banks and so they take advantage of his Hotel/Casino.The acting was definitely a 10/10 for everybody and it was a very good idea to get Pacino on board. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and the others are very good and so is Garcia who is actually helping the Ocean crew in this one. It was also good to see Ellen Barkin and Pacino on screen together again for the first time in 19 years.

Not even close to Ocean's 11,"I don't understand why so many people have given this movie such a high rating. This is the first comment I write in IMDb and I am doing this only in order to say that this is a bad, bad movie. There is no suspense, no humor, no intelligence. Actually the only positive thing I can think about this movie is that it is glamorous and that is all. However, since glamor is not the first thing I look in a movie, I can honestly say that this film was a disappointment. First of all I got the impression that nothing happened in this movie. When comparing this movie to Ocean's 11 you will find that in Ocean's 13 there is no excitement, no climax and no humor. But the most annoying thing for me was that the plan of the heist was rubbish and full of not believable details. This just spoils the fun. It seems to me that the writers could not think of an intelligent plan and just made up a lot of things that just are not possible. This usually does not bother me in a film, but when you are watching a film about a heist you want it to be believable, you want to place yourself in the shoes of the con men and think that maybe this could be done.

Ocean's 13,"I had seen Ocean's 11  did not like it a bit; so did not see Ocean's 12. But with such hype around Ocean's 13, could not resist seeing the huge star cast executing a plan to rob the Casino.Again Danny Ocean gathers his bunch of guys to rob diamonds and millions from Willie Bank's newly opened Casino. This he takes as a challenge  because we as audience are made to believe that doing that robbery is impossible. But the way Danny and his gang go about planning the robbery is simply amazing.To me all the Ocean's movies themes (as they are presented) looks like as easy as getting down from a tram and leisurely walking to my home, opening the house with the key, and taking money out and waving at my own self as I walk out of my home.I know that there are die-hard fans of Ocean's series, and for them this movie would be really funny, witty, intelligent, and thriller series they can't miss. But for me  it is so degrading to the sensibilities, that I find C -grade (I won't even mention B grade here) Bollywood movie a bit better than this lousy crap. At least C grade third rate Bollywood movies at times think that their audience is a bit intelligent. But not Ocean's series! The biggest joker of the lot was poor Al Pacino  the owner of the casino, running haywire, from one place to another  managing his biggest casino empire. Did not he hire any qualified and professional staff to work in his casino? Less said the better. Waste of money, and talent of great star-cast. Steven Soderbergh, what has happened to you? You gave us a below standard The Good German recently and now this.

Extraordinary Comeback,"""Ocean's Eleven"" felt like an intelligent and entertaining movie. It did very well with the story and its diverse cast, and it benefited greatly from the start leads.... Then came ""Ocean's Twelve"", and maybe t was the extra cast member; it just felt bloated and dragged.Now the gang is back, and few people might disagree with any of the following descriptions because this sequel is truly spectacular, engrossing, sensational, wild, intelligent, remarkable, quick-paced, clever, striking, original, sexy, funny, surprising, appealing, vibrant, colorful, and the list could go on and on.Films like these work well when the adversary is something to fear, and Pacino's millionaire does bring with him class, and a few scary maneuver. He hasn't reached his level of success for being Mr. Nice Guy. This time the offense is personal, and Ocean recruits his gang to set things right, and if this requires that the plot of the film becomes a bit complex in its execution, it's o.k. After all, we need equal amounts of intelligence, charm, elegance, and a touch of double-crossing. As the second in command, Ellen Barkin exudes intelligent sensuality and carries her duty with aplomb of stars from days lone gone. Here is a sexy and mature actress who knows how give a look, make a move, and wear a spectacular dress, all while conducting daily business.The rest of the cast is equally outstanding, Clooney, Pitt, and Damon once again demonstrate why they have become popular leading men. Each could carry the film on his own, but we're grateful they know how to share screen time. Unfortunately there is not enough time to mention everyone's contributions. Let's just say, the parts make the whole work very well.Much of the success of the film is also a result of fantastic CGI, art direction, and set decorations to bring to life a fictional world in one of the biggest and most competitive playgrounds in the world. The new hotel is both garish and impressive, with loving care given to the design of gambling environment and other hotel sections. There is also sufficient time spent on explaining how the hotel business works, without overwhelming us with too many details, just enough information to give us a taste of the cutthroat world that Las Vegas can be.Sodenbergh successfully shows how good a director he can be, once again presenting us with a treat rarely seen in Hollywood, an intelligent, entertaining, and well developed story that supports a very good looking cast and film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better than ""12"" but not by much","After the disastrous ""Ocean's Twelve"" was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, ""We've already had this saga sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?"" Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition. The good news is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that's not a particularly high bar to jump over). The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not traipsing all over Europe on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors. In ""Thirteen,"" Danny Ocean and his ""crew"" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself. The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.At the beginning, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances. Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors. Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore. And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.""Ocean's Thirteen"" may be better than ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie. I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects. We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Much closer to 11 than 12,"Ocean's Eleven was about as good as it gets in this genre, once you watched it through enough times to understand the tricks. Ocean's Twelve was the worst sort of smug Hollywood sequel misfire. The very good news is that this one is much closer to Eleven than Twelve. Danny Ocean gets the crew together one more time when Pacino screws would-be partner Gould in deal to build start-of-the-art Vegas casino. When the price tag for punishing Pacino gets too high even Benedict (Garcia) gets in on the action. The plot takes a little while to get rolling and the chances Ocean takes with Pacino make him look shy in Eleven, but all that said some (but not all) of the magic from Eleven is back. They try replicating the snappy dialogue from Eleven with some mild success, where Eleven was breathtaking this has more the feel of formula work. But a nice formula it is and the makings of an entertaining evening. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

More,"The hits keep on coming. The story of the group of handsome and charming males, who want to relieve a casino of its treasures, is irresistible to the big stars in this film. The setup allows them plenty of room to show off their various talents. So, a relaxed and compatible group of all-star actors are gathered together again, like moths drawn to a light, as in the two preceding Danny Ocean films.The setting of Las Vegas is also irresistible, with beautiful date palm trees lining the streets, its constant solicitude of the comfort and entertainment of its many guests, its beautiful neon lights and fountains and unique architecture, and its fascinating casinos, of course. Living close to Tunica, Mississippi, with plenty of casinos of its own, I was amused to hear the lines uttered by Al Pacino, ""Tunica. Isn't that where games go to die?"" And, surely Tunica will never approach the brilliance of Las Vegas, which is shown off to its best advantage in this film.Al Pacino adds much to this final film of the trilogy. Pacino knows how to assume the style of a successful and rich hotel-casino owner, without betraying boredom, impatience, or hostility. A hotel-casino owner should be the perfect host, especially during the opening day of the hotel-casino. And, Pacino is the perfect, if somewhat paranoid, host as Pacino puts on the skin of his character in a convincing manner. Also, Andy Garcia is a pleasure as the competing hotel-casino owner and co-conspirator with Danny Ocean.The film again features computer wizardry and cunning technical gadgetry along with the quick wits and physical dexterity necessary to bring such a difficult heist off, as in the previous two films of the trilogy. This film, like Las Vegas itself, has so many attractions that it is hard to not overlook some brilliant moments in this fascinating film. The film is like the diamond necklaces, featured in the film. Every changing facet of the diamonds gives the viewer a new pleasure and delightful view.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Glorious Fluff,"In a scene from ""Ocean's Thirteen"" Brad Pitt's Rusty Ryan asks George Clooney's teary eyed Danny Ocean, ""Are you watching Oprah?"" A few moments later Pitt's eyes well as both watch ""Oprah"" and he says, ""So they are really going to build her a house"" Clooney and Pitt are hysterical and making fun of their classic leading men personas. They are clearly having fun doing so. Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not just fluff; it is glorious fluff. This comical revenge tale by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is smart, funny and basically an excuse for a bunch of very talented actors to hang out and have fun. You have Academy Award Winners or Nominees Clooney, Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Al Pacino all together in one movie, who all enjoy working with each other. Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not ground breaking movie making; however, it is breezy cool at its best.In ""Ocean's Thirteen"" Willie Banks (Al Pacino) betrays Reuben (Elliot Gould) in a hotel casino deal that nearly costs Reuben his life. Consequently, Danny, Rusty, Linus (Matt Damon) and the rest of the crew come to Rueben's rescue. Danny and Rusty also enlist the expertise of security strategist Roman (Eddie Izzard) to break the casino of the Banks Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The Banks Hotel caters to the ""whales""extreme high rollers. However, Roman informs Danny and Rusty that the Banks Casino employs the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system called ""Greco""named after its inventor Greco Montgomery (Julian Sand). The system is virtually fool proof. When part of their plan falters Danny is forced into an alliance with former rival Terry Benedict (ruthless Andy Garcia). At the same time there is a hilarious subplot involving a worker revolt in a dice manufacturing plant in Mexicoyou really have to see the movie to appreciate this.There is nothing really distinctive about ""Ocean's Thirteen"" storyit is well paced and executed. The dialog is crisp, clever, and funny. Al Pacino does what he was hired to do which is gnaw on the scenery. He is masterful. Matt Damon makes a hilarious comic turn as Linus disguises himself as Lenny Pepperidge, the interpreter of a Chinese high roller. Don Cheadle is solid as Basher, doubling as expert engineer and motorcycle daredevil. George Clooney is smart, charming, and cool as Danny Ocean. Brad Pitt is at his breezy best, and again demonstrates his gift as a natural straight manalbeit to Clooney's Ocean. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is basically a guys' movieliterally. One saving grace is the stunning and strong Ellen Barkin as Banks' right hand Abigail Sponder.Steven Sonderbergh hinted that this maybe the last ""Ocean's"".

Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was as good as the remake of the original ""Ocean's 11"", with the late Frank Sinatra, but it was better than ""Ocean's 12"" in my book. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, all reprise their roles in this one. One character is conspicuously absent, and I still haven't heard the reason why that person isn't in this one. I won't say who it is, but you probably know who I'm talking about...

Weakest of the Three!,"This is probably the worst Oceans movie I have seen. Don't get me wrong, I liked this film although the first two are better especially the second. All the characters return for this film to do more heists in the city of Las Vegas.When one of the members of the Ocean's party, Reuben gets a heart attack, the gang blames it on Willy Bank because he is a cold-hearted manager that did something bad to Reuben. The gang teams up with old pal Terry Benedict to do something about Bank.The acting is decent. All the members of the gang had more of a part. It just wasn't Brad Pitt or George Clooney. I liked Matt Damon and Carl Reiner. Even Al Pacino did a decent job as Bank.The music is not as good as the first two. There wasn't much music this time around.I liked the heists and cleverness. I also liked it when an old enemy becomes partners with the gang that stole millions from him.Overall, this is a good finale to the series. I rate this movie 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Smooth, Suave & Gritty","I was highly skeptical about O13. Ever since the disappointment of O12, I surmised that this series is finished. Soderburgh did not have anything more to give with regards to Danny Ocean and his crew. How wrong I was. He produced the greatest trick up his sleeve. His Ace, Al Pacino. Putting Al Pacino as a negative character as well as Andy Garcia as a pseudo negative role, Soderburgh wins over the audience.O13 has the simplest of all plots. Something that any man can relate to. One of the eleven is bullied out of his own plans to make a hotel (Elliout Gould) by a high flying business man, known as dirtiest player in his game,(Al Pacino). He bullies Reuben Tishkoff from his own dreams, which results in his heart attack, and he is admitted to a hospital. So, the eleven conspire to take him down, and they put up with a plan that is a dream of every casino goer. They create an atmosphere for 3.5 minutes where every player in the casino wins. Admittedly however vague and idiotic it sounds, they do this very well, and that brings about a smile in your face.Like in the first movie it was Danny Ocean(George Clooney), Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt) in the second its Linus Caldwell's (Matt Damon) turn for lady luck. His part is a assistant/secretary for a rich Japanese client,(Shaobo Kin) as well as a translator. He seduces Al Pacino's right hand man or rather woman, Abigail Sponder.Like the first movie, this one has a detailed plot, with a slick way to steal the cash off. In the end, when Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia) tried to pull one over them, they fool him over once again. There's a small cameo by Vincent Cassel although I hardly felt it was necessary. Maybe Soderburgh was thinking of ending this trilogy with this one, but I hardly think he succeeded in doing that. You cannot end Ocean's trilogy without Julia Roberts and Catherine-Zeta Jones. For all those who are moaning their absence from this movie, Danny Ocean makes it a point that they would not be involved in this heist since it was a matter of avenging their friend and not any normal job.The acting yet again is superb. Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon who are the lead roles in this movie are really good. Especially Matt Damon, who gets a bit of extra reel space due to his supposed affair with Ellen Barkin's character. The rest of the crew, Elliout Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Kin, Scott Caan and Eddie Jameson all have small parts that they do with perfection. Elliout Gould does a fine job of playing the guy in bed, unattached from the world. Don Cheadle, is the one preparing the huge magnetic device, who has a finer aspect of character of writing a poem for the bed ridden Reuben Tishkoff, to help him feel better. The usual animosity between the Malloy brothers, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan is missing, but even then working together for a change they do a fine job of it. Carl Reiner and Shabo Kin probably has the smallest of parts in the movie. Shaobo Kin's role is basically a rich Japanese aristocrat who orders Linus Caldwell about. Carl Reiner posing as a undercover agent for the 5-Star Diamond Awards also has little to offer. Eddie Jameson does a great job solving the codes for the blackjack and working as an employee in Al Pacino's(Willy Banks) hotel. But lastly, no one is more brilliant than Bernie Mac. He basically has 2 scenes to his credit. And even in those 2 scenes he stands out brightly.O13 is certainly not the best movie of the year, but it certainly is not the worse. It's a fun watch, but when is Danny Ocean and his crew not fun to watch !!!! The direction is good, the acting like always is up to a very high level. The cinematography is good, the background score very nice, special effects though used scantily was also superb. All in all 8/10 !!!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A really bad movie.,"Oceans 13, to put it mildly, put me to sleep. The characters are disconnected, the technique of filming in dark/white and with film stock left over from the 1960s, and the lack of uniformity in developing the plot makes this movie a candidate for a rotten tomato award. The inclusion of a tunnel boring machine into the plot seems as far out of touch with reality as is apparent in the rest of the plot. TBM are gigantic machines requiring special equipment just to transport, let alone install and operate. Skip it as it is not worth the gas to get to movie house. I sincerely hope this is the last one of these series of movies. The first one is a winner in all departments. The next two should be burned.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

A waste of man-flesh,"We pay eight dollars not to ""watch"" the movie but to feel like we're in the movie. Through screen writing and cinematography, the audience is supposed to see the world through the eyes of the main character and experience his adventures vicariously. Ocean's Thirteen didn't let us in to Danny Ocean's world. The audience was left out of the jokes--when the Chinese character spoke in Chinese, the other characters would talk back or laugh, but since there were no subtitles, the audience didn't know what he was talking about. We were also left out of the lingo (a Susan B. Anthony) and the plotting of the operation. The entire movie was what Alfred Hitchcock would call a McGuffin.The final goodbye scene between Danny and Rusty at the airport was a two-shot from a low angle in front, so that rather than being physically in the place of the characters looking at each other (in traditional POV style shots), the audience is in the point of view of Danny's luggage.And why hire the sexiest man alive to co-star in a movie with the second sexiest man alive if there aren't any female characters, no seduction, no love. The girlfriends back home are mentioned in passing, but we never learn anything about them. Seduction is what makes us care about the characters. We fall in love with them when they fall in love with each other. Ellen Barkin looked fantastic in this movie, but rather than seduce her with some of the available male beauty in the movie, Matt Damon's character wears a hideous rubber nose and requires a chemical agent to attract her.Ocean's Thirteen was a spectacle not a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

A disappointment,"It really says something about a movie when Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and the rest can't even make it partly interesting. OK, I admit that 13 was better than 12- which doesn't say much- but I completely disagree with those who say it was better than 11. The problem is, 13 was simply boring. There was no tempo, no pace- and, oh yeah, no plot. Actually, 11 didn't have much of a plot either, but the perfect tempo and witty humor dazzled you so much that you didn't even notice. In 13, the most exciting thing is a fake nose. I personally think it's a travesty to have Al Pacino in a movie- Al Pacino!- and give him about 2 lines, and bad ones at that. There was almost none of 11's humor. 12, while confusing and generally bad, at least was mildly interesting, if only because most viewers spent the whole time trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Overall, Ocean's 13 disappointed me- and I would definitely never recommend it.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Keeps on impressing!,"The exploits of Danny Ocean and crew are something you will either love or loathe. Asides from the first movie which was what I felt Luke warm Oceans 12 really did impress me with its wise cracks and story line which leads to a perfect warm up for this third instalment. Danny Oceans mentor and team member Ruben has been screwed out of a deal with a ruthless Willie Banks (played by Al Pacino) the team take it upon them-selves to teach him that when you cross one Ocean! you cross them all! This Danny and the team leave the stylish Hustle-like format out and pull out all the stops with everybody who owes them. What I liked about this movie was that it shows almost a mission impossible layout of getting in and getting out with no little surprises up their sleeves. The film still has its funny moments which are great and gives it that charm but this time EVERYBODY has their part to play in the heist a bit like in the first movie. Again my only complaint with O13 was that although it tries to keep a serious tone to it at times with the fact what Ruben means to the team and leaving the wives and girl-friends at home it still pretty much fails to connect on an emotional level but you'll just have to take it for the sake of entertainment and trying to fill in a few gaps. Clooney,Pitt and Damon were again all in fine form but I felt that extra kudos should of gone to Don Cheadle this time (although his cockney English accent still sucked). Al Pacino was brilliant as always as Willie Banks and we certainly can't miss out Ellen Berkin (I need to find what was the name of that perfume!). To conclude Oceans 13 is one of those movies that you just watch for the sake of entertainment, nothing to lose nor gain but having said that I liked that fact that it was not as hyped as much as its predecessor due to the fact that films like Spider-man 3 just aimed too high and delivered not all that much but on the whole this one kept me happy and I would walk away saying I would like to see another one !OCEANS 13 : 8.1 OUT 10WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF GETTING EVEN ?

"Better than 12, that's for sure!","In all fairness, Ocean's Twelve wasn't that bad: it was slick, well acted and fun, although it was evident that the script had been put together as an excuse for Clooney et al to have fun in Europe for a couple of months, the result being a bit of a mess. Thankfully, Ocean's Thirteen is better: there's only one job, we're back in Vegas and there are no ridiculous contrivances (well, maybe one or two, but the movie is too damn enjoyable for the audience to start questioning the logic).Most importantly, though, the premise is much more interesting: whereas in Twelve the gang pulled off a series of heists in order to survive, this time round they are driven by revenge. The victim is Willy Bank (Al Pacino), a sleazy hotel owner who has put Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), one of the original eleven, out of business, causing him a heart attack. Because of this, Danny (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the others (minus Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who are left out since ""it's not their fight"") decide to get back at Bank by ruining the opening of his newest hotel/casino, only given the target (there's a virtually invincible security system, called Greco) they are going to need some extra help in the shape of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), whose loyalty is questionable to say the least. But with the clock ticking and a dozen of things that could go wrong, he is probably the last person to worry about.Being back in Vegas really ensures director Steven Soderbergh and his cast are able to feel at home: the camera movements, the editing and the performances are more confident and less smug (in a good way, of course) than they were in the previous film, which however does not mean there isn't time for an in-joke or two (Damon's fake nose being the standout). The plotting is as ingenious as in Ocean's Eleven, although the writers make a huge mistake explaining every single step of the procedure in the first thirty minutes: after a while, it just becomes too much for any viewer to pay attention to. It is all compensated by the following hour and a half: the wit is as sharp as ever, the set-pieces are brilliant and visually delightful, and all thirteen cast members get their moment in the spotlight (among the ""minor"" players, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are the most memorable), Damon in particular completing the transformation he went through in the first two movies, turning Linus from a nervous learner to a con-man worthy of the name. And what about Pacino? Most of the pre-release hype focused on him, and it has to be said that it was fully justified: the former Michael Corleone is one hell of a villain. Sure, he does get excellent support from Ellen Barkin, but if it weren't for the combined effort of Clooney, Pitt and Damon he would walk away with the entire movie, fearless, proud and merciless (the scene where he squares off with the leading man has to be his best moment in years).So, to sum it all up: Eleven - near flawless; Twelve - amusing but a bit uneven; Thirteen - not exactly on par with the first one, but worth your money nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Spectacular crime caper flick which will dazzle you all the way,"OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, in my opinion, is a spectacular crime caper flick which will dazzle you all the way. If you ask me, the production design was absolutely spectacular, the performances were top grade, the cast was well chosen, and the direction was excellent. I just love Steven Soderbergh films, despite the fact I've only seen four of his movies. Those four movies are ERIN BROCKOVICH, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, OCEAN'S TWELVE, and this one. Also, I especially loved the costumes. They were really well designed in my opinion. The elevator shaft and natural disaster sequences made me a little dizzy.

Great Film,"If you liked ""Ocean's 11"", and hated ""Ocean's 12"", then you'll love ""Ocean's 13"". But if you hated ""11"", and loved ""12"", I don't know what planet you're from. ""Ocean's 13"" is a great return to form of ""11"" after the disappointment of the second film. All the fun one-liners, the chemistry between the cast, and the smart script are back, and even better than before.This time around, Rueben helps casino tycoon/bad guy Willie Bank (a wonderfully evil Al Pacino) design and build the ultimate casino. But when the time comes to open it, Willie strikes Rueben out of his share of the money, which results to Rueben having a heart attack. This angers Ocean and his ten heist-planning pals, so they devise a plan to sabotage the opening night of the hotel and avenge Rueben.The best parts are watching the characters sabotage everything, from fixing slot machines to win jackpots at certain times, to fake earthquakes, and even annoying a hotel critic (David Paymer) to hilarious results, while posing as a various hotel employees.The thing that makes this film is the actors. Everyone and more is back excluding Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Julia Roberts who are only mentioned in passing reference. Personally I'm glad they're not back. It's an ensemble piece so everyone has to be good, and everyone very much are. Among the best are Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, and many others. The best though are of course George Clooney and Brad Pitt, the chemistry between them is amazing and hilarious to watch.Kudos also go to the writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien who wrote a smart, complex, and witty script, and director Steven Soderbergh (who also did the cinematography, and produced it) who crafted a sharp, enjoyable film. My one complaint is that it is a tad confusing at times, but by the end, everything makes sense.This is a great film, and even better film-making.

It also seemed like they were able to actually give each character a fair amount of screen time whereas in the second film most seemed meaningless.

A fortune won and lost on Soderbergh's deal,"I knew it before I saw it, so I only have myself to blame. This isn't the third installment of a three-figure blockbuster. This is more like a nondescript episode of a second-rate TV series in its third season. The plot is so lame and the acting is so uninspired that I kept asking myself, why is it that Ellen Barkin's supposedly high-flying character only owns a single cocktail dress? ""Ocean's 13"" is beyond saving, even from Al Pacino and his self-travesty as gambling mogul Willy Bank. I expected a guest appearance, but in fact his is a surprisingly big part. Not that it helps. The only thing there seems to have been no lack of is spray-on tan, seen on virtually all actors. Also, wouldn't you agree a deliberately shallow movie at least needs a hot chick? The only one who comes even close is Olga Sosnovska as Debbie. It's a minor part, but from what I've seen of her preppy charm and cold ambition, I'd say she's Bond girl material.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Thirteen is lucky here!,"To develop another sequel to the Ocean franchise was not much of a gamble. ""11"" hit it big at the box office so the films producers decided to double-down on 11 and produce a continuing ""12"" which brought more than a dozen of glories to the Ocean franchise even though ""12"" was not admired by critics. So now the waves are high on the expectations of ""Ocean's Thirteen""! Will ""Ocean's Thirteen"" crash at the box office or will it be smooth financial sailing again? The film almost made $40 mil at the box office during its opening weekend run so I would say that this Specific Ocean is banking it in again. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" returns to Las Vegas and like ""11"" it focuses on an elaborate casino burglary scheme against a supercilious Las Vegas hotel entrepreneur. This time is Willy Banks played by Al Pacino. All the Ocean players are back to steal your heart with their witty banter and distinctive specializations. In case you forgot, the Ocean crew includes: The leader of this safecrack pack himself Danny Ocean (George Clooney), the slick Rusty (Brad Pitt), the ""wanting to prove"" Linus (Matt Damon), the Vegas hotel historian Reuben (Elliot Gould), the nervy Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the explosive Basher (Don Cheadle), the acrobatic shortie Yen (Shaobo Qin), the bickering brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) & Turk (Scott Caan), the Croupier smoothie Frank (Bernie Mac), and the conning elder Saul (Carl Reiner). OK, so that is just 11! Who are the other two? The hotel villain of ""11"" Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) yes you heard right; and a techy wizard Roman (Eddie Izzard). Banks right-hand-woman Abigail played by Ellen Barkin is the sole female primary character in this Ocean tale. The ensemble acting is not much of an audacious effort by these thespian clowns, but it is still a supreme spectacle of movie stars having a ball on-the-job and doing it formidably & coolly. I do have a slight favoritism towards Elliot Gould taking the acting gold of this crew for his comical work as Reuben. Pacino banked it in also for yet another grand performance as a baddie in playing Banks. I cannot tell you more specifics of ""Ocean's Thirteen"" because that would be Movie Spoilery! And even the Ocean's Crew do not commit that one! What I can tell you is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is on a revenge heist against Banks who cheated Ruben out of millions on a hotel deal. Director Steven Soderbergh does recapture some of that cool aura and clever dialogue that brought ""Ocean's Eleven"" a critic goldmine. However, my money is still on ""Ocean's Eleven"" as the king of the trilogy! Nevertheless, you should still check out that Oceanview of ""Ocean's Thirteen"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A puddle not an ocean,"It took a while but the day after I realized: The word that summarizes this movie is ""idiotic"", possibly mindless.Apparently (I fell asleep but 12 had a more complex plot - was this a way to make it more user friendly to the extreme formulaic so easy to digest no twists turns surprises or anything stimulating???) I had free tickets for this anyway so didn't mind. So it was a tad boring to say the least but kept the interest somewhat. Some would say it was insulting to their intelligence too. So much for a good story.Further observations - could anyone (apparently a meany greedy man) like Bank (what a silly name) played by Pacino seem less upset or concerned about losing that much money? What saved this and made it mildly entertaining after a long week was the actors, aside from that guy that played Bank. They provided some levity.Barkin should eat a Big Mac and retrieve the (bigger) nose she had in the Big Easy. She was much prettier then - and not because she was 20 years younger at all.I discussed George Clooney with my mother and we both think he is getting more attractive with age!

Improvement over the sequel,"After the slog that was Ocean's 12, I'm glad to see this one learned from the mistakes of its predecessor and got back to the roots of what made Ocean's 11 so fun. Don Cheadle finally gave up on his terrible Cockney accent, and 3 out of every 4 of his lines are said in an American accent. A lot of the heist moments were really smart, and it was a just an all around good ""Robin Hood"" type story. The villain was a real scumbag, and that made it easy to root for the main characters even though they aren't the best people either. This film was missing a lot of the heart that ""Eleven"" had and that was disappointing. I feel there should have been more drama between the characters and story. This was an improvement over ""Twelve"" but not as good as ""Eleven"".

"Clever, fast moving and fun ...","Clever, fast moving and fun - that's how I would describe this movie. You really need to see the previous two ""Ocean"" movies to get rolling with this one because familiarity with the characters is presumed.In this third version, the main characters are back and are looking to exact revenge on a hotelier (Al Pacino) that ""double-dealed"" one of the Ocean gang (Elliot Gould). While Gould's character is recovering from a heart attack caused by the swindle, the Ocean gang is planning to break the bank on the hotelier's new, ultra-modern, secure hotel.If you enjoy elaborate and exotic methods - plans within plans - clever bait and switches ... this movie is for you.

The Bottom of the Ocean.,"I'm addicted to ensemble-cast flicks, so I simply had to see this, even though I had some very serious foreboding. I consider Ocean's Eleven a very stylish, slick, and well paced heist. I was a bit upset when I learned Soderbergh would make the sequel from lesser money which just sounds unfair. It's like you went to a good restaurant, gave a generous tip, even brought some friends next time just to find less on your plate.Because (normally) money shows!Don't get me wrong; I don't have anything against low budget. But a budget-cut sequel to a blockbuster sounds just fishy, without mentioning the extra aces like Zeta Jones, Cassel or the European locations. And if I'm wrong here, and they actually made it out of more money, it must have been used up for the above-mentioned stars and locations, for there were big, yawning gaps where some action should have been. R.I.P.All right, you could think, now they're teaming up again to make up for it. Back to base, back to Vegas, back to the original"". Think again! This is just another desperate grip on the cow's tits which was killed with O12, so they shouldn't try to milk it again. Desperate it is, really. Remember the scene from 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' where Gus was counting money as Damon and Affleck lined up to serve a second helping, before they look frankly in the camera and say something about taking a role sometimes for a friend... I guess this was the case here. Meet up, dress up smart, talk smooth and let the camera roll.Cut. -Are we done yet? - How's Angelina? - Grand.(Why 5 stars then? Just because with this cast I start counting from 5. Without the names it certainly would be just the one.)",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrific summer escape movie,"I'm surprised by the number of scathing reviews I've read on this site. To me, this was back on par with the fun and cleverness of the first film. Overall, Thirteen was the funniest and breeziest of the three Ocean films. A lot of people have complained about the incredulity of the schemes and scenarios, and though this is true, it never took me away from the movie. It's supposed to be a fun, escapist movie. A summer romp.My favorite aspect of this movie is the absence of an unnecessary romantic sub-story. I'm of the opinion that much of what is wrong with film and TV these days is the constant recycling of the same old love sub-stories. These stories have no place, generally, in fun heist movies. They have become expected, predictable, and annoying. I could list the films and TV shows that have been ruined by this trend. Anyway, the point is, Ocean's Thirteen is as good as it is largely because there is no Julia Roberts love triangle to distract us from the real story, what we really came to see. A heist! I think Ocean's Eleven was really a better film for the most part, but the whole love story nearly ruined it for me. That's why Thirteen is my favorite of the Ocean movies. And the film seems to know it itself, as there is never any mention of Julia Roberts' or Catherine Zeta-Jones' characters.I mentioned before that Thirteen is the funniest of the three Ocean movies. Much of the humor is slightly self-referential, but never overly-so. Many of the lines are of the same witty variety that were so funny in the first film as well.The acting is just as good as it was in Ocean's Eleven. Pitt and Clooney have so much chemistry together (on a strictly heterosexual level, not that there's anything wrong with that). They're just so darn good at being suave, cool, witty thieves that we love to root for. Pacino is terrific as the bad guy, of course, and Andy Garcia and Ellen Barkin are very good as well, though there is not as much for them to work with. I was a little disappointed that Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac didn't get as much screen time as they should have, but they did well with what they had, Cheadle especially.What's so great about Ocean's Thirteen is that it consistently stays true to what it is: a fun heist movie. It moves along at a fast pace and never wavers. Like the original with the Rat Pack, this movie is really all about the guys, the Eleven, and I love that there is no cheesy love story to take away from that. Ocean's Thirteen is light and breezy for a heist film, and the humor adds to that. Overall, it is the perfect summer escape movie, and it makes no attempts to be any more than just that. It's my favorite of the three.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"better than the second one, as good as the first one","I was really disappointed at the last ocean's movie series. I really didn't had any high hopes for this one either but I gotta tell you, this one is a good one. I am not gonna go into any details but if you've seen the first one (Ocean's Eleven), you'll love this one for sure. This movie has almost the same humor as the first one but the evil master-plan is certainly the best one out of all three.

Almost as fun as the first.,"Nothing could really live up to the magic of the first film in the franchise, but this one definitely comes close. It's a hell of a lot of fun with the same witty, hilarious style that I loved in the first two but this one raises the stakes just a bit. The heist is bigger...but they also aren't really stealing anything for themselves so it's a bit anticlimactic. This one is probably the most original of the series and also the most outrageous. I mean Casey Affleck freaking out and starting a worker's strike at a Mexican dice-making factory? And then Scott Caan being sent to stop him only to be seen throwing a Molotov cocktail at the police? It doesn't get much better than that, and I was laughing until the tears came. The cast is brilliant as always with everyone from George Clooney and Brad Pitt to Casey Affleck and Eddie Izzard delivering knockout performances. Al Pacino is the perfect addition as the villain this time around and he plays the part like he was made for it. It's clear that everyone had a lot of fun making Ocean's Thirteen and that sheds through to a wild, hilarious and immensely enjoyable ride for the viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Good, but inferior to the first two","In my opinion, ""Ocean's 11"" and ""12"" were two of the most fun and entertaining films I have ever seen. ""12"" was especially ingenious and brilliant, especially and viewing it multiple times. ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not a bad film by any means, and it manages to entertain very well and provide a lot of laughs.Several aspects of this film make it inferior to the first two movies, however. First of all, the plot element of the team trying to make a hotel rater's stay at Mr. Bank's hotel miserable sort of made me feel negatively about this film. This was an almost disgusting section of the movie (poisoning his food and putting lice on his bed) that could have been done in a less disturbing way. Also, what's with the character of the Night Fox in this film? In the previous film, he was a smart and clever character, and here he is simply made to look like an idiot. The writers could have done much better here. Most of the regular cast is good in this film, as usual. Al Pacino, though he makes a fine addition to the series, is not himself here. He neither acts nor sounds like his old self. It's hard to believe this is the same person from ""The Godfather"" movies. Not really a bad film, but had it been better, the ""Ocean's"" films could have been an absolutely perfect series. Still worthwhile and fun.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The acting, the plot and the characters remain trite and predicable, even stereotypical, but it is a glorious glimpse into the Las Vegas gambling world. George Clooney is aging fast, and I feel the theme here has expired. Please, let's hope this is the last of the Ocean's saga.

A Guy Film,"Women always look at the action-heavy movies and say, ""Hey, that's such a guy film."" But it's not. You see, Ocean's really captures what I think every guy desires. To go out, break some rules, make some money, and most importantly, hang with your boys.The film is casted with the best ""cool guys"" there are. Brad PItt and Geroge Clooney make suave look easy, and Matt Damon has really grown into this role. Don Cheadle and Eddie Izzard turn out great performances, and the banter between the ""Malloy twins"" is stuff that makes comedy funny. The heist in this film is the best yet, because you can truly root for the good guys. In a turn from the other Ocean's films, the crew is NOT robbing but rather liberating the money from WIllie Bank, played by Al Pacino. It's revenge more than robbery, and Pacino's character deserves to be hated.The music, as always, is stunning. I always feel like the mood is captured at an Ocean's film through the amazing soundtrack.My only complaint about this movie: Al Pacino. The man is past his acting prime. It's a sad sight to see, but it's true. While he does turn out a decent performance, the fact of the matter is that he says every line the same way.But Ocean's Thirteen is great, and should be watched again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

As expected,"I cant say this movie was a disappointment. It was exactly what I was expecting: mediocre. The computer generated hotel, that seemed to move around the strip, was just silly. Its location changed from across from the Mirage (pay attention to the scene with Pacino and Gould at the construction site), to just south of Paris, to another location that looked like it was next to the Mandalay Bay (overhead shot). Weird. Maybe if I didn't live in Las Vegas, this wouldn't have bothered me. I have never seen Al Pacino play such a chump either. Kinda of a strange character. The most powerful man in Vegas, getting duped non-stop throughout the movie. Not very realistic. But, that goes with the rest of the movie. How about bringing in the two drilling rigs that carved out the tunnel under the English Channel between England and France? Amazing. Just flew them in, I guess.

Probably Good That This Is The Last One,"""Ocean's Thirteen"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is entertaining at its core and even goes back to the Vegas locale that made the first one so successful. However, by the end of ""13"" it is clear that the ""Ocean's"" series has played itself out.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the gang (this time featuring Matt Damon in a much larger role) back in Vegas, where this time they are getting a little revenge on casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) for putting Reuben (Elliot Gould) in the hospital.The biggest ""plus"" about this film is that it goes back to Vegas, the setting that these kinds of movies need to feature. Even when all else can (and sometimes does) go wrong, there is just something about seeing those suave guys in sharp clothing strutting around the casino floor. It adds that ""cool"" factor.Unfortunately, ""13"" is kind of a mishmash of all kinds of different stuff, both plot and character- wise. The ""big job"" is delved into much too quickly with very little ""setup"" (a key component of the original), while the characters become (for the first time) little more than parodies of themselves. Everything just kind of feels rushed in this one, as if the plan was to camouflage a fading series with continued action instead of plot/character development.Overall, though, ""Ocean's 13"" is still entertaining, at least.

Ocean's Eleven Lite,"The first Ocean's Eleven (the remake, not the Rat Pack version) is a classic heist film. Good team, excellent plot, clever twists, action, excitement, the whole nine yards. Ocean's Twelve, the sequel, is a convoluted mess that is best left forgotten. Ocean's Thirteen, the movie in question, falls somewhere in between. It's a huge leap forward in quality when compared to its immediate predecessor, but it doesn't quite reach the novelty and sheer fun that the first had in spades.We return to Las Vegas as Reuben (Elliott Gould) has fallen to some hard times, being cheated on a casino deal by heinous Willy Bank (Al Pacino) and now it's up to Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his crew to settle the score. It's a workable plot, though a touch too similar to the first movie to really impress with its originality. The movies look too similar for you to be able to appreciate it fully, and even the twists are somewhat predictable because of this.And while the acting is generally very good, I don't really buy Pacino as an effective villain in a heist movie. The man can certainly play a villain, no doubt about it, but he doesn't quite hit the right notes here. Especially when the movie also contains Andy Garcia, the slimy ball of haughtiness from the first film. I also have to note that none of the characters have evolved at all. They're still the same old rogues they were in the first film, and while I don't expect a lot of character development in a cheerful heist film series, I'd appreciate if there was a little bit of it.All that being said, I do think it's an enjoyable film.

The recipe for making a bad film.,"I saw this on the Cannes Film Festival last week and it was definitely the worst film shown. I think Ocean Eleven was a fair film considering the type of genre. Ocean Twelwe sucked big time. So I went to this with the expectation, that Ocean Thirteen would suck just as much. That pre-expectation was not fulfilled. This is a perfect recipe for making a bad film with a billion dollar cast. Now Al Pacino played as always brilliantly, but that was thanks to his talent, NOT Steven Soderbergs actor directing, because he didn't get anything out of Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon or for that matter the rest of the cast. They didn't tribute with anything besides their smiles, good looks and their presence. The film lacks of feelings, emotions, renewal and charm. All I saw was a scene by scene in an coincidental order trying to tell a story that didn't make sense at all. Every time a new scene played, the audience has to figure out time, place, meaning, character relationships in a matter of seconds, before the film changed scenario again. The audience have to figure out, what happened immediately before the scene, because that is not explained and have to figure out why and how they did so. All very confusing. All in all I think Mr. Soderbergh, Mr. Clooney, Mr. Pitt and all the rest of the cast, should put a lit on this trilogy and try to renew themselves with a new concept to make money.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

To get even, Ocean, Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the other compadres team up with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to bring down Banks by bankrupting the hotel on its grand opening night.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" doesn't boast enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time. The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict supposed to be inherent to the setup.

The friend who invited me and who had liked both the Ocean's 11 remake and Ocean's 12, had the same reaction I did -- disappointment with the relative lack of action and of spark to the characters here.Ocean's 13 has a light, glib flow and style to it. It has some pleasant, attractive actors and scenery. Pacino's electronic security system gives the movie some focus and challenge. But its choppy pace and frivolity are disappointing. When a movie, like this one, sets up a series of major and minor ""cons,"" it should use subtle, clever strokes and should play fair. This movie plays fast and loose on both scores.Within minutes, Ocean has lined up countless moles in key positions in Pacino's casino. This occurs in flimsy and unbelievable ways, like simply dropping in and making an open-ended promise to a desk clerk that she will be made a manager, slipping a restaurant manager some fast cash, and catching a casino floor manager pawning fancy house silverware. The way Ocean infiltrates a man into the casino as a dealer is played more for laughs than believability, and it is left completely up in the air how later blowing the cover of that same man makes any sense for Ocean's plans. A quick, easy chat with one big-shot is all it takes for Ocean to get carloads of high-rolling ""whale"" gamblers to up and leave Pacino's hotel.Very early on, Ocean's team seems to have free run of the casino's security and electronics floor. With ease, they repeatedly tramp back and forth across it, so that, for example, one of his men can relieve a guard at just the right moment. Details about how Ocean plans to fix Pacino's dice, roulette wheels, and slot machines, and use a gigantic drill to mimic an earthquake, are glossed over to the point they come off as amateur science fiction - not to mention ""the Gilroy,"" some sort of magical love potion used to reduce the only mildly competent guest character in the film, Pacino's top manager Ellen Barkin, to jello.Particularly poorly handled is the way the team spoils Pacino's attempt to get a five-star rating for his hotel. The movie goes completely over the top in inflicting all manner of extreme, unbelievable, foul treatment on the implausible-acting visiting critic. Not content at depriving Pacino of five stars, the movie pounds the joke into the ground, not stopping even at one star. How, in the midst of all of the luxury and other satisfied hotel guests, are we supposed to think that the critic, or anyone else, would believe such an exaggerated, isolated experience? As if in recognition of the clumsy, near-sadistic, unfunny excess, there is a simple-minded, contrived scene at the end where the beleaguered critic is helped to win big at an airport slot machine.Playing fair not only means that the film cannot lift off completely from reality, but it also means that both the good and bad guys need to be up to the challenge. Here, Pacino does nothing but talk tough. He is given fair notice by Ocean at the start, but does not make a single smart move the entire movie, only mistake after mistake (such as being easily manipulated into allowing Bernie Mac to set up a game on the casino floor and generally allowing Ocean's men to swarm all over his hotel, completely undetected and undeterred). In one token scene, which the script comes right out and tells us is meant to show how savvy Pacino is, he taps into an FBI computer to search for the identity and known associates of a dealer who Ocean planted in the casino. But this incident only makes everyone look bad. It depends on Ocean confusingly blowing the dealer's cover, it nearly destroys Ocean's plans, and the way Ocean and his men get out of it is wildly exaggerated and far too convenient. Also way too easily, Ocean dismisses Pacino's threats at the end, confirming the character's total impotence.Indeed, the few adversities faced by Ocean are trumped-up accidents, either overcome too easily or too implausibly. As a result, there is a near-total lack of suspense and a diminished, anticlimactic sense of accomplishment at the end.The film has an overall slack pace, despite -- or maybe because of -- rapid cutaways between short, thin scenes. At times, it feels like slow-motion, which can be one of director Soderbergh's worst tendencies. This saps not only the drama but also the humor. There are so many characters that few if any have time to shine. As if to make up for this, Damon, Cheadle, and Bernie Mac get strained, far-fetched, show-boating scenes that only fall flat. Andy Garcia seems injected almost as an afterthought.The film evokes some sentimentality about the Elliott Gould character, including a short scene reminiscing about ""the old Las Vegas,"" but much about this is superficial and unexplained. His end scenes, in which he shows up at and struts around Pacino's casino in fancy dress with a big cigar sticking out of his mouth, acting triumphant based on absolutely nothing that he himself has done, strike a false and ineffective note.Nothing could be easier with a movie like this than writing a canned, shallow, gushing review that ignores all of the problems, settles for the movie's famous faces and places and glitzy, smooth, and easy feel, and hides behind lazy labels like ""popcorn movie"" or ""caper flick."" Of course, these qualities, and the talented people involved, give the movie some entertainment value. But not nearly enough. Any serious review has to come to grips with the failings that make this movie a disappointing missed opportunity even as mildly entertaining fluff.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Just an excuse to give some screen time to everybody (and there are really a lot of people).The best are Al Pacino (so so), Matt Damon and Andy Garcia that at least look natural.There is no suspense, no sense of danger, no passion, no sex, no violence and overall no fun on the whole movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Should Have Walked Away...,"It's third time unlucky, yet again. First Spider-man 3, then Shrek 3, Pirates: End of the World. And now this.It's not as bad as Ocean's Twelve (but then, what could be?) and Vegas has never looked better. Great cinematography, especially as the plane lands at the airport, with all the hotel resorts visible from the runway.But it's an awful grind nonetheless. When the two decent gags you've already seen in the trailer, you know you're in trouble. The McGuffin (plot premise) is quite dodgy. With the first, you know it's a) the money and b) Ocean getting Tess (Julia Roberts) back that's the motivator. Like most heist films, much of the fun is the getting together of the gang. It's hard to mess that up, whether it's The Dirty Dozen or The Wild Geese etc.With Ocean's Twelve, well, er, they had to get the money back for the guy they robbed. Not so thrilling. Spoils the 'happy ever after' finale of the first one.Here the Elliot Gould character, Reubens, is stiffed by new casino kingpin Al Pacino and has a heart attack. So the rest of the gang decide to take Pacino down to cheer Reubens up. Sounds better than it reads. You think, how could Reubens be so naive as to trust this shark, anyway? He's hung out with crooks, after all. It's all a dodgy premise that you don't believe, nor the whole Mission Impossible routine they go into right away. It's like watching The Krypton Factor and none of that cool David Holmes music can alter that. It's just boring.Neither Julia Roberts nor Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles, though that may be no bad thing. They're not even referenced by the leads, though. You don't really believe this gang would risk heading for the slammer for decades, estranged from their loved ones, just to generate a pep talk for their ill chum.Any humour is sort of understated twee and self-regarding. Or just naff. Eddie Izzard shows up again, but oddly he can't really carry a role off like this. He's not larger than life, his voice is too light, he can't measure up to Clooney or Pitt.There's an awful lot of talk and exposition (which is what the Izzard character is brought in to do, it seems) from start to finish but I couldn't catch a lot of it. I mean, really, you just have to strain a bit to hear the dialogue all the way through. It's off-putting, and it seems to be a trend with modern blockbusters. You almost suspect it's deliberate, to put the audience on tenterhooks.We're meant to believe the gang can just buy off any minion in Willy Bank's supercasino just like that, bribing them to do stuff whenever it's convenient.There are one or two flickers on interest during the final heist... and that's it. The finale is a rip-off from the first one, substituting fireworks for the beauty of the Bellagio fountains, and a nondescript Sinatra song for Debussy's lovely Clare da Lune.The film looks good, and if you're heading to Vegas for the first time, check it out on DVD. But don't spend money going to see it. It's a real grind. Even one hour in I was waiting for it to be over, and thinking, wow, there's another HOUR to go...Diminishing returns here: after the first big win, we've ploughed money into the box office and got less back for it.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

A very average movie... and the worst of the saga,"Ocean's 11 was a decent movie with a very good plot twist at the end. Ocean's 12 was a smart comedy with very good performances from all actors. And Ocean's 13 is a movie that passes by unnoticed.Although performances were acceptable, the plot isn't attractive. Reuben got betrayed by Pacino, had a heart stroke and the guys want revenge. And that's fine. But Sodenbergh tries to make PAcino look like some invincible character, and his hotel like some sort of hi-tech Alcatraz where no one can steal anything, nor commit fraud because of some sort of ""supercomputer"" and super ultra high technology. The problem with this is that this looks so artificial and forced that is difficult to believe. There are some ""funny"" moments but they don't make you laugh hard.Besides, there is no way Benedict would trust a guy like Ocean after what happened in the first movie. That's a flaw in the movie. Another flaw is that they don't explain why PAcino is so upset with Mr Bank, leaving aside the fact that the Bank hotel is supercool and is a strong competitor to the Bellagio.One more flaw is that Sodenbergh made Toulour (one of the best's thieves of the world in O12) look like some sort of brainless thug that is easy to deceive.For all this reasons Ocean's 13 = 5*",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Third time's not the charm...,"That's not to say all the Ocean movies are terrible. The first for me was very enjoyable, while the second while lazy and convoluted was okay. This film does have its moments, it is stylishly shot, has a brilliantly slick opening sequence and I liked the score. However, despite these good moments, it not only doesn't correct the mistakes of the previous time but makes more on the way. The direction is disappointingly lethargic, and the story is unevenly paced and convoluted. To me the script is not very good at all, in fact at worst some of it is pretty darn bad, while the film further suffers from being too long and too slow. Even the acting is disappointing, this is a great cast but some of them don't have much to do or don't know what to do with their material. Al Pacino comes off worst, he is a great actor but here he seems uncomfortable and uninterested. So overall, a disappointment really. I suppose it's worth a peak but I personally found it lazy and dull. 3/10 for being visually and technically accomplished. Bethany Cox",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
a scientific point of view,"I work for a research team who conduct top secret experiments for a government in Great Britain (obviously for security reasons I cannot disclose which Government). The subjects of our experiments are pretty much whatever the hell we decide to do and for our most recent experiment we decided to test the effects of a Soderberg film on the common household chimpanzee.We decided a mother and child would be best and we selected the most maternal chimpanzee we had. We sat both chimps down and played oceans 13 on the monitor. During the first fifteen minutes they proceeded to defecate and throw faecal matter at the monitor, so far pretty standard behaviour for a chimpanzee and indeed any human being forced to watch the same movie, however as we reached the hour mark the infant defecated again but this time he proceeded to smear the monkey chocolate into his own eyes.As we approached the 3 and a half hour mark the mother seemed to completely flip and started to bash the monitor as hard as she could which was unfortunate as she was using her child to hit it, over and over she pounded that little chimp into the screen until there was nothing left but a mass of blood, glass and little baby monkey pulp, it was a truly horrendous sight and I was reduced to tears (I had paid a fortune for that monitor, it was HD and everything). Suddenly the mother let out a bloodcurdling screech and dropped dead.During the autopsy we discovered that all the major organs seemed fine except for the heart which was visibly broken leading to the conclusion that a mother would rather club her child to death than sit through oceans 13 regardless of how unbearable the loss of a child is.Delighted with our results we decided to try some human testing and selected two male subjects both with the same IQ. Subject A was locked in a room and forced to watch Oceans 13 while subject B was locked in a room with nothing but a plain white wall to stare at.Shortly after the movie began subject A was smearing his own leavings over the monitor exactly like the chimps. After the 5 hour running time had finished we conducted tests on both subjects, we took blood samples and discovered that subject A's blood contained 75% more boredom than subject B's and whilst subject B's IQ remained the same subject A's IQ had dropped by 50% thus proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that watching a Steven Soderberg film does in fact make you dumber.On a side note, 3 months after the experiment subject A was diagnosed with aids. We are not saying that you can catch aids by watching Oceans 13 but if you absolutely must watch it then please be careful.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unlucky 13,"There was a time, when American was black and white, when any toothless dropout with a gun could hold up a bank or a payroll by rolling the fat, sleepy security guard, then get into a fatal shootout with cops. And then get memorialized in a mediocre B-movie.
Then along comes Bonnie & Clyde and those two losers get the full glam treatment. Fair enough, that was a great movie. But Hollywood should have quit while it was on top.
Fast-forward 50+/- years and we've got a tired genre. Maybe you can still walk into a bank in Bumblefk, Iowa, and steal some cash from the tellers. But who wants to watch a movie about that? No, heist movies have to be big-time, big-screen action movies. So they're either stealing state secrets or holding up casinos or what-have-you. Except nobody, in real life, is brute-forcing their way into modern bank vaults or Vegas casinos. Too many cameras. Too much security. Too many armed guards.
The modern heist movie is Wall Street rigging energy distribution in California, with a company named Enron as a fig leaf, and nobody getting shot, one guy going to jail, and then getting suicided shortly thereafter. That's the modern reality of heists.
Movies like Ocean 13 are just cartoon junk. Well-dressed sugary treats that are mere color revivals of black&white B-movie plots that weren't that compelling in the first place.

Tame and Tired,"9 June 2007. This third and hopefully final version of Ocean takes a almost tired look at a prolonged criminal caper in Vegas that isn't as exciting nor captivating as its predecessors. The beginning plot outline seems almost desperate and forced together. Too characters, difficult editing and transitions, no time to really get caught up into most of the scenes. There are a few nice comedy pieces sprinkled throughout but absent the strength of female character starlets leaves this movie more about trying to be impressive without much power nor punch. While semi-literate, actively involving and managing to make it to the end credits, this movie moves more on inertia than interesting characters and tense plot situations.

It's Getting Faster Every Time,"Ocean's 11 was a brilliant combination of gripping detective, thrilling comedy and excellent love story, lifted on high by the dazzling array of great actors. Ocean's 12 was slightly worse, as the plot began repeating itself and some tricks did not work out again. Ocean's 13? C'mon, give me a break! What could be invented, if anything, this time? Especially, taking into account the sad fact that Julia Roberts would not take part in this part anymore, what will happen this time? Well, the film makers eliminated the love story altogether, which thinned the film really badly. Instead, in addition to the smashing team of Clooney, Damon, Garcia, Pitt and others, they invited the one and only Al Pacino as a red-haired, merciless and vile casino owner, greedy and devoid of any principles. This time, the Danny Ocean team decides to ruin his tasteless new casino and even combine their efforts with their deadly rival, Mr. Benedict. And then, a fountain of head-banging tricks, smart ideas and impossibly expensive gadgets starts pouring on us effortlessly for almost 2 hours. The classical glossy picture, smooth jazz background, elegant view of Ocean (who, in fact, is a very incidental character this time, leaving much more time and space to other heroes) leave very little time to think. The movie becomes a nice, tasty, easy to digest comic strip, almost stripped of any serious thought or psychological insight. What is also a pity; the heroes of Pitt and Damon also have less impact and time on the screen, although Damon's appearance as a womanizer at the later part of the film and his romance with Pacino's aid make the film very funny. Keep it in mind, Pacino's hero is impeccable. He is cold, vile, greedy monster, a real shark, and his appearance, his hairdo, his suits, his manners are superb. He is the real winner of the whole movie. Well, trequels become so fashionable that one may scratch in utter disbelief if a new port be added or not. I hope, they will not go on with Ocean's 14. That will be really too much of a good thing. But still, this movie left me quite pleased. At least, that was a swift, easy-going, sweet-tasting, laughter-provoking bubble gum.

Why did they bother?,"The only reason I felt compelled to keep watching this movie is that fact that its quite well known and the actors in it are all pretty good (minus George Clooney). But did they really need to drain every last drip of enjoyment out of the films by producing another Ocean's? Just another classic example of US producers making crap movies to draw people into get as much sales as they can. This film had no originality and seemed exactly the same as Ocean's 11, what was the point of making a copy? Things always seemed to go perfectly for Danny Ocean and the whole criminal world was centred in on American white boys. I'm glad more recent movies have branched out into including other parts of the world in a genuine way, unlike the racial undertones in reference to Shaobo Qin's character. It reminded me of movies like Transformers where the robots landed by chance in USA, bearing in mind 70% of the earth is water. I feel like this movie would've been better if wasn't just trying to take the piss the whole time and replaced the smug criminals with people that actually seemed like they could pull it off.

So flat and affectless is this endeavour, like a moebius-strip tour of a food court, one has to award more than one star, since the director may have found the perfect medium for expressing the banality of the luxury consumerism it depicts.That said, I would point the viewer to better efforts in a similar vein; Scorsese's 'Casino', which is much plagiarised here, hamfistedly, 'Grand Slam', from 1967, for an example of how exciting heist movies ought to be, any random episode of 'Hustle', which do what his ought to with more economy, or even the latest KFC or PokerStars advert!",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

A decent ending to the Ocean trilogy.,"It seems that the ""Ocean"" trilogy only works when they are in Las Vegas, the city where it all began. In fact, it was hard to do worse after a second movie where everything went wrong. This film maintains the previous cast but focuses the plot on a quest for poetic justice. In fact, the thieves will no longer steal for selfish reasons, but try to punish a villain who double crossed Reuben. A plus for a plot in which the scriptwriter's delirious imagination nearly knocked it all down with such a creative and elaborate assault plan that it lost its credibility. The idea was to recreate the first film on an epic scale, but it was so obvious and exaggerated that it didn't work out. Even with this problem, the film can be digested and we can enjoy and be entertained by it if we don't think too much about that. The cast is the same as the two early films, with George Clooney and Brad Pitt leading, but they do almost the same thing they did before, so there are no surprises or remarks about them. On the other hand, Al Pacino really knows how to look bad as a villain and it was great to see him in another evil role. Vincent Cassel confined himself to an unfortunate cameo, quite unworthy of his talent. Steven Soderbergh, who seems to have recovered from the crash that was ""Ocean's Twelve"", directed the film fairly regularly and close to what we might expect from him: good camera angles, big care with scenery and the use of city landscapes, some visual beauty that looks good when its brightened by a decent soundtrack, as was the case here.

All this powered by an unsustainable amount of energy, perpetuating an unsustainable way of life. This movie, like it's predecessors, in some ways attacks this status quo by showing how this group of stars are in some ways ""Robin Hoods"" or ""Lupins"": criminals on the good side.

Casey Affleck is fun as usual. Pacino? I've never really understood why people think he's so great, but I guess it's down to personal taste. I personally think the ""series"" is done. But it could have been a long lasting one without such obvious stories and without the terrible terrible accent of Mr Cheedle. A shame, and not something I'd recommend going to see.

Luck Be a Lady Tonight.,"The third installment in director Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's"" saga. This time Elliott Gould is nearly frightened to death with strong-arm tactics by crazed casino magnate Al Pacino. Thus our cast of demented heroes come together to get even with Pacino and his top assistant (Ellen Barkin). Cleverly conceived flick by the all-world director does not waste much time with exposition, but rather starts the ball rolling and does not let up until the end. Could have worked as a silent picture just as well as one with sound. Soderbergh continues to amaze me with his risk-taking film-making techniques. To me, it is like he is just experimenting here with ""Ocean's 13"" and not even trying to make a cinematic masterpiece. It is fun and highly unique in its own special way and it matches the substance and style of the second installment and also compliments the original well. David Paymer is priceless in a short part as a critic who has his share of problems. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
