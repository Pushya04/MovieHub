beautiful but slow,"Jesse James (Brad Pitt) is a mystery to his own kids living a secret life under a different name in Kansas City. He's 34 and it's 1881. The remaining members of his gang include Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), Frank James (Sam Shepard), Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). Frank and Jesse are the last two remaining original members.Andrew Dominik films a beautiful looking movie but his script runs on and on. Roger Deakins's cinematography is a thing of beauty. The first train robbery at night is haunting. The dialog is a long rambling affair. As always, I don't particularly like narrations. One would expect a Jesse James movie to be exciting and a great thrill ride. In this movie, even the action scenes are moody and stylish. What starts out as a fascinating beautiful hypnotic watch turns into more of an endurance test at over two and a half hour. Brad Pitt plays Jesse James as a mercurial calm commanding presence. Affleck has an unstable edginess. The cast is filled with wonderful actors. Nevertheless, the movie could use a little trimming.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting but flawed,"It's hard to imagine this film being much of a success, despite starring Brad Pitt. It's a long-haul: slow-moving, intensely melancholic and sombre, dealing in grey-paletted landscapes and skyscapes, pauses, silences, things unsaid as much as things said. Still, it's been critically successful, and it address questions pertinent to today's society. Fame. Hero worship. The desire to be someone else, as an escape from the drudgery of your own life (""do you want to be like me, or do you want to be me?""). The realisation that that someone else is ""just a man,"" just like you, and that he perhaps struggles with the same sense of drudgery and hopelessness, as you do.Notably, the film conveys a sense of the drudgery and sheer hardship of life in the west that many films miss, and, unlike most other westerns (with the exception of 'True Grit'), the dialogue often feels authentic  slightly grandiose, perhaps stilted to our ears  almost Elizabethan; slow, deliberate, unusual, and just right.Roger Ebert comments on the bleak emptiness of the landscape (like McCabe and Mrs Miller, it was shot in Canada- all huge grey skies, desolate waving wheat-fields, snow, ice, and mud), and how, because of this, because ""the land is so empty, it creates a vacuum demanding men to become legends."" As in the Russian drama 'The Return', the landscape becomes almost a character, or at least a driving force which partially dictates why the characters behave how they do and what courses of action they take.I say this partly because no explanation is sought, or offered, by anyone in the film, for the gang's actions. This is simply what they do - perhaps to avoid the drudgery of working in a grocery store, like Bob, or making shoes, as Frank suggests he will do; perhaps for the money, to give themselves a chance of a fuller life. Perhaps simply because, in this environment, doing anything feels almost like a random act. The film is detached from the characters, and the characters are detached from themselves. At one point, Jesse speaks about watching himself from outside: ""I look at my red hands and my mean face... and I wonder 'bout that man that's gone so wrong."" The state governor comments that, while some say Jesse's crimes are revenge on Republicans and people who wronged his family, his victims didn't seem to be chosen on account of their political persuasion. In other words, he's no political rebel. He's just an outlaw, who does what he does - who knows why? That's not important to the governor. He wants the man captured, not to understand his motivation. The film should go beyond his concerns though, and examine the latter..shouldn't't it? Doesn't it?I'm not convinced that it does, and more context of the sort hinted at in the governor's two or three lines might have helped. For all the film's desire for historical accuracy in detail, in the bigger picture it's rather sketchy. I'll return to these criticisms later.But, still, it's a film easy to admire, for several reasons: the use of space, and silence, building tension in long, drawn-out dinner-table conversations. The inexorable build toward death, like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West', a dance of death - or a slow, deliberately paced walk towards it. It feels like something winding down: everyone is aware of impending confrontation, but unable to escape from it. People face their deaths with stoicism, as if this is what fate has dictated for them, as if it is their role to play: the gang member Pitt shoots in the back for real, or imagined betrayal; James himself, who glimpses his assassin in a mirror but makes no attempt to dodge the bullet's path.It will probably be admired most for its performances: Casey Affleck's insinuating, awkward hero-worshipper, at once understandable and pitiable - bullied, insecure, unloved - and at once somewhat contemptible, annoying and disturbing. Pitt's James - aloof, detached: melancholy, for no clear reason, at one point he hints at his desire for death, for suicide. ""Once you've looked over the other side, you'll never want to go back into your body,"" he says. Or something of the sort. Then shoots holes into the ice.Ultimately however, despite this admiration, it's hard to like, much less love. It is characterised by the same aloofness I've just discussed in its protagonist. Jesse's occasional mentions of the soul raise the possibility of a deeper philosophical strain (which might be somewhat out of place, given the dour 'factual', 'realistic' nature of the film, such as the vomit that smears Bob Ford's suit when he falls over on a saloon floor)- but it remains merely a suggestion, adding to a vague impression of some sort of inexplicable sadness. Of course, James is not simple: a psychotic family man. But there's a lack of insight into his character, and the other characters in the film. They seem to remain ciphers who simply exist, rather than fully fledged human beings who act. James' family seems barely to exist, except for occasional shots to show that he has one. The film observes dislikeable characters doing dislikable things; the audience is left to judge, but are not given that much to base their judgements on, despite the slow pace. The film's attitude to its legendary titular character is unclear: do we admire him? He's a cold-blooded murderer - surely just as much of a coward as Bob Ford. Or is he let off the hook because he's Brad Pitt, because he's brooding and handsome and has a family? Ultimately, the film is indifferent - neither tragic nor exciting, just generally glum, it gives the impression of saying more than it actually does. It had the potential to be more than it is, and is thus an interesting, perhaps necessary, but flawed movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Expectation of Applause,"""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a handsomely mounted, film-school like study of the last days of the infamous James' Gang by director Andrew Dominik. Growing up in awe of Jesse James (Brad Pitt), Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) finally gets to live out his dream of living side by side with his idol when his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell) joins the gang. Young Robert quickly learns that the exploits of the murderous train-robbers are far from the exciting flights of fancy he grew up reading about in newspapers and dime-store novels. A series of cowardly acts in the wake of double-crossings and humiliations ultimately lead to the titular event.The style of the film is often visually arresting and downright disturbing, especially in the acts of violence, which leave the most gruesome parts slightly off camera, but are frequently shot and framed in such a way as to maximize shock value and leave an uncomfortable feeling of tension in the theater seats. Dominik sometimes relies too heavily on voice-over narration torn straight from the book upon which the film is based leaving us to assume that aside from dreadfully beautiful photography of passing clouds and desolate Midwestern landscapes, he wasn't always sure how he visually wanted to tell the story. This leads to a sometimes snails' pace as the plot unfolds, though the haunting Oscar-worthy cinematography from Roger Deakins and mesmerizing music score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis eventually get under your skin even as the hands of the clock seem to move slower as if stuck in a pretty photograph of a nightmare.The acting in the film is superb from all involved. However, the performances often blur the line between caricatured scenery-chewing and emotional nuance (especially from Pitt and Rockwell). While there is some entertainment to be found in the lighter scenes of camaraderie amongst the gang members, the audience never really feels anything for the characters aside from sharing their sense of paranoia and fear knowing that around any corner someone will be betrayed and shot. The film also suffers from some scene stealing cameos from James Carville as the governor hell-bent on catching Jesse and the otherwise lovely Zooey Deschanel, who appears out of nowhere for a few moments about ten minutes after the film should have rightfully ended.When the credits finally rolled, I wasn't sure what to make of the film. There's some unforgettable imagery (my personal favorite being the almost surreal depiction of the cloth-masked robbers waiting in the dark woods as the train comes roaring down the tracks), and many commendable artistic elements to be found in the film. If the idea was to leave the audience feeling the era showcased was a tension-riddled and violently lonely existence, then the film succeeded wonderfully. Those seeking a more pure entertainment will most assuredly be left stressed and stretched to their limits.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A hauntingly beautiful film,"Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a deliberately paced, stunningly visualized, and emotionally charged exploration of the early development of mass media celebrity in America. The film riveted my attention for two hours and 40 minutes, and has remained on my mind for several days after my viewing. Although centered on one of the iconic legends of the Old West, it is far beyond an updated reincarnation of the Western. It is an epic allegory about the development of the American cult of celebrity and the effects of this obsession on the individuals caught in its web.Visually, the film soars beyond anything that has hit the screen since Conrad Hall's final masterpiece with Road to Perdition. Roger Deakins, the cinematography genius behind The Shawshank Redemption, Kundun, and all the Cohen brothers"" films since The Hudsucker Proxy, surpasses his best work. He pulls out all the stops hereintricately orchestrated changes in focus, richly textured colors, dazzling use of light sources, careful manipulations of time, powerfully significant fade-ins and fade-outs, and shots through rain, snow, and rippled old glassto communicate the story. Deakins' contribution stands out in the railroad train robbery sequence at the beginning of the film. Clearly defined, flickering light sources and deep black shadows create a dazzling, nightmarish vision that haunts the rest of the film. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission.The richly textured, historically precise visual aspects of the film bring to mind Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven and Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. However, instead of the understated, ""realistic"" performances featured in those films, The Assassination of Jesse Jamesshowcases powerful, yet still realistic performances by an outstanding ensemble cast.Sam Rockwell, as the not-too-bright but well-meaning Charley Ford, and Mary-Louise Parker, as Jesse's loving wife, stand out. Yet the film belongs to the two titular leads, both of whom deliver the performances of their careers and create characters filled with disturbing contradictions. Brad Pitt's Jesse James is alternately pitiable and terrifyingan affectionate, loving father, an old-before-his-time sage, an adventurous daredevil, an unrepentant bad boy, and a vicious sociopath. Casey Affleck's Robin Ford is a complex, repellent, and tragic character who challenges the audience's complicity in the undercurrents of the film.All in all, this is a great filmnot for those seeking the simple pleasures of instant gratification. But definitely worth the attention of those who still believe that movies are an art form.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great but hard to sell...,"If you have watched the trailer and know this movie is two hours and forty minutes long you know what you are getting into and should not be disappointed. This movie delivers on every level of film making, be it cinematography, acting, or writing. Casey Affleck delivers a fantastic performance in how he portrays Robert Ford as the bright eyed fawning kid in a way so sincere it makes the audience uncomfortable even when it shouldn't. Brad Pitt underplays his part as Jesse James hitting all the right notes while never saying much. Exactly the way one would expect an outlaw to act when they have everything in the world to hide. I can't say the movie didn't FEEL two hours and forty minutes long but I never wanted it to end sooner than it did. I guess I just enjoyed the time I got to spend watching these characters for the full running time.I loved this movie. Unfortunately, a long western without action is something seemingly impossible to sell to the public these days. It would be to the advantage of the studio to sell this like The English Patient was sold 10 years ago. Just make people feel like ignorant idiots if they don't like it! As much as it pains me to say it, I think most people don't care enough to bother seeing what makes this movie so great. The only other option to make this a success is to fool them into THINKING they love the movie. I'm really curious how many folks out there that like the movie agree with me here.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Work of Art,"Wow, does this film have style or what? The Assassination of Jesse Jamed by the Coward Robert Ford, is one of the longest titles I've ever seen for a film and the movie's run-time follows the same pattern. I have no problem with this. I would sit through a ten hour ""Jesse James"" because of the excellent tone given out by director Andrew Dominik. The frozen Missouri/ Kansas landscapes are a treat for the eyes. The musical score does its job: to blend into the film so subtly that I cant imagine the images on the screen without it. The narration neither detracts or adds to the tone, although there is one bit of bad editing that confused my friend as to whether the narrator was speaking or a man's voice had been dubbed poorly.""Jesse James"" delves deep into the inner conflicts and emotions of every character. We live with them, eat with them, and often feel their pain or their confusion. This confusion is often associated with the bi-polar nature of the film's central character, Jesse James, played by none other than Brad Pitt. Casey Affleck delivers a subtle performance here that actually becomes the most effective as the film progresses over its 160 minute running time. I hated Robert Ford for a good portion of the film, thought he was so annoying and clingy that it was a wonder Jesse James didn't kill him within the first day of their complex relationship. But then, as I sat through the so called ""gruelling"" running time of the film, I learned to feel for him and understand his motives and attraction for Jesse. But ultimately, his childhood, comic book worship of the famous outlaw changes.The ""style"" of the film is evident in the first frame of passing clouds. Roger Deacon's cinematography is the best I've seen since Conrad Hall's work in Road to Perdition, perhaps better. He is definitely winning the Oscar this year, between this and No Country For Old Men. There is a scene involving a train robbery where the visuals and utter style blew me away. The lighting and camera direction becomes more subtle and less noticeable after the train scene, but, does not lessen in quality and pure artistry. There is a topic on the IMDb message boards approaching the topic of whether certain films should be labeled ""art films."" Well all films are works of art, some are horrendous, some are extraordinary. Well, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an extraordinary work of art.",,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome  and spectacular Western with good performances from Pitt and Affleck,"This is a sprawling and glamorous Western but overlong. Packs colorful scenarios, slow-moving pace and slick edition. Wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins and atmospheric musical score by Nick Cave. The motion picture is well realized by Andrew Dominik who displays enough off-beat touches to keep things interesting.Adding more details over the largely described on the movie, deeds happened of the following way : Later events led disaster on 6 September 1876 in which Jesse(Brad Pitt) and Frank James(Sam Shepard) with three younger Younger brothers attempted a bank robbery at Northfield , Minnesota, only Jesse and Frank got clean away to live quietly for several years under assumed names , Jesse as J.D. Howard and Frank as B.J. Woodson. In 1879 they robbed a train and another one in 1881, in the latter crime a conductor and a passenger were killed. Governor of Missouri raised rewards of 10.000 dollars each for the James boys, dead or alive. On 3 April 1882 Bob Ford, a new member , treacherously shot Jessse dead in the back of the head in his home at St Joseph, Missouri where Jesse was living along with his wife(Mary Louise Parker) and sons. Frank surrendered six months later , he stood trial and was acquitted. He gave up his criminal ways and lived a respectable life until he died aged seventy-two in 1915. Robert Ford(1861-92) made his mark on the history as the man who killed Jesse James. It was his claim to fame. Bob(Ben Affleck) and his brother Charlie (Sam Rockwell) were new recruits to Jesse's gang in 1881 and when a reward was offered for Jesse and Frank, dead or alive, the brothers Ford made a secret agreement with Governor to assassinate the outlaw. For the rest of his life Ford was reviled for the manner in which he had killed Jesse , whose gravestone bore the words: ¨Murdered by a traitor and a coward whose name is not worthy to appear here¨. Forced by public opinion to leave Missouri , Bob wandered through the old West , taunted by the words of the popular song : ¨The dirty little coward, who was shot Mr Howard, has laid poor Jesse in his grave¨ .Others films about this legendary outlaw are : The classic version (1939) titled ¨Jesse James(1939)¨ with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, ¨The return of Frank james(1950) by Fritz Lang with Henry Fonda ; ¨I shot Jesse James¨by Samuel Fuller with John Ireland as Bob Ford ; ¨Jesse James vs the Dalton(1954)¨ by William Castle with John Ireland, ¨The true story of Jesse James¨ by Nicholas Ray with Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hero Worship Turns Sour,"Though Jesse James through the newspaper accounts of his exploits and through the dime novels of the day was already a legend, his immortality was sealed on April 3, 1882 by the manner of his death. The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story.But was that accepted version the real story? For the first time the Ford brothers, Robert and Charley, get their due. As played by Casey Affleck, Robert Ford was a most complex character indeed. Ford is shown for what he was, a moonstruck kid who was brought up on those dime novels and idolized the legendary bandit. The fact that Charley was already riding with the James gang got him into the group.After the last job the James gang pulled and the only Ford was ever in on, the Fords kind of attached themselves to Jesse James. Of course the idol is no hero. Brad Pitt plays a most unheroic Jesse.Hints of Pitt's interpretation of Jesse's character are found in the classic portrayal of Jesse James by Tyrone Power. Remember when the laconic Henry Fonda as Frank James dresses Jesse down, tells him he's getting mean, meaner every day even with some of his own gang members? Power was showing signs of it, but we see Pitt as Jesse do some really brutal and cruel things. At the same time he's a loving husband to Mary Louise Parker and doting father to his two children.As good as Pitt is I think the acting honors go to Casey Affleck. His gradual disillusion with his idol is really something to see on the screen. He becomes really scared of Pitt for reasons I won't reveal, but were definitely sufficient to want him to get Pitt.We also get to see the Fords sorry aftermath. Things did not go so well for them. Bob Ford did not quite get the acclaim he would have liked as Jesse James became bigger after death than in life.Frank James as played briefly in the beginning is an odd peripheral character in this film. The James brothers did separate some months before Jesse's death. Frank is played by Sam Shepard who has an encounter with young Bob Ford at the beginning of the film and announces to one and all, the kid creeps him out. But Jesse likes having the kid follow him around like a puppy dog to his ultimate regret.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a very good western and we sure don't see too many of them in these times. It's shot in an unusual color, almost like one of those sepia-tone films that were in vogue for a brief spell. The location shooting was done in western Canada and looks a whole lot more like Missouri then than Missouri does now.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pitt assassinates the Oscar competition,"From writer/director Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.Director Dominik has great control of the picture but when the film went into the editing room the film underwent some problems. The film never keeps the momentum to be an amazing picture. The viewer is connected for the first 15 minutes, then bored for 10, then enchanted for 45, bored for 15, then comes the anticipated climax and you think its over, then it goes on for another half hour. Dominik gives the audience the best understanding of Jesse James possible so we can become better acquainted with him but brings in an slew of different characters that, to be perfectly honest, I don't care that much about. I believe this might be a example of over character development where we get all the aspects of his life but all we want is Jesse.Last year, many critics were stating Brad Pitt gave his best performance ever in Babel however, his Jesse James is the best performance of his career by a mile. Pitt wears Jesse like an overgrown coat that you don't want to get rid of. Pitt gives the most tortured, endearing, and frightening performance of the year thus far. He makes the audience so uncomfortable and awkward yet gives off sensitivity and compassion for a very unlikable and ferocious man. If buzz builds, expect Pitt to be a huge contender at the Oscars.Casey Affleck, arguably the better actor of the Affleck clan gives the most pathetic, annoying and cowardly performance in the last ten years; and its brilliant. With his deep ""admiration"" for Jesse, his Robert Ford is engulfed in Jesse's presence and wants enjoy the moments with him, even if he is in fear of him. The finale is truly his show as he stretches out his acting legs and dissolves into a character you can't wait to see off-screen.The cast ensemble is a true revelation as each character as over-developed as they might be, all bring a sense of humanity, charisma, and heartbreak to their roles. Sam Rockwell who is on the verge of being a household name and coming his way to a nomination one day plays Charley Ford, brother of Robert, as magnetic as the character demands. Mary Louise Parker, who is one of the better actress' working today, goes nowhere as Jesse's wife. This is a role that is very Academy friendly, and throws it away in a her limited screen time Sam Shepard who plays the older brother of Jesse, shows fear and anguish built up in a man who yearns for emotional freedom from crime. Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt all turn in exceptional performances and enhance a cast of big name stars. Expect a possible Screen Actors Cast Ensemble nod for these men.Expect a possible and much deserved cinematography nomination for the overdue Roger Deakins, which is the strongest technical aspect of the picture. Also a great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is a possibility along with great costumes by Patricia Norris and perfect art direction by Janice Blackey-Goodine. The appeal is there for the film as a whole but it leaves us floating a little too often in a long river of bravery, artistry and commendation. Dominik will likely be cited for some breakthrough director awards with the picture popping up during precursors' season.Get ready for the assassination everyone knows is coming but no one can prepare for. Never has been a film that tells you the entire story in the title and can still surprise the viewer with beautiful cinematic moments.Grade: ***/****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
the most beautiful film ever made,"I've been thinking of a good way to start my review, I've been pondering many opening sentences, but none of them are close enough to the point, so I've decided to just say that this film is perfect in all aspects. When the credits started to roll I didn't move at all, I sat staring at the screen just thinking about what I just watched. I was trying to understand if what I just saw was really that good, or if I was just thinking it was. The film runs at almost three hours, but never looses your attention for one second. It moves forward through dialog that is poetic, but increasingly haunting at times.First off, the performances. Brad Pitt as Jesse Jame makes you feel that he is a vulnerable person, and then at the next second he'll make you completely change all your feelings for him. He doesn't talk much in the film, but is none the less flawless. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford is in his best performance ever, makes you hate him. His character is very shaky, very nervous at times, but always seems confident of what he's doing, whether it's right of wrong. He steals most of the scenes he's in. The biggest surprise however for me was Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Robert's brother and Jesse's right hand man. At the beginning of the film, you think that Charley is the stupid brother and that Robert is intelligent beyond any standard Charley could reach. At the end of the film though, the roles switch. You realize that Robert has been making all the dumb decisions, and Charley has been trying to save him by covering them up and usually taking all the crap for it. His last scene was intense and beautiful. One other performance to talk about is Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, an outlaw womanizer. His performance is somewhat comedic, but in some scenes he can be the backbone for the drama. I can easily see Pitt getting a Best Actor nomination while Affleck pulls in the Supporting Actor for the win.The musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is on par with Clint Mansell's classic Requiem for a Dream score, if not better. In the films most horrific scenes, the music turns them into something beautiful. You'll want to sit through the end credits just to hear it one more time. The music will draw you back to the film to see it again. The score also fits the tone for the most of the scenes.Andrew Dominik's direction is perfect. He uses the camera in such a unique way that you never miss anything that happens. In one of the film's best scenes, he places the camera so that you can only see Pitt's silhouette become meshed into a train's smoke and then reappear seconds later as it pops out. Dominik also wrote the entire script by himself, which really shows how versatile he is. He originally wrote the film into a 3hr and 50min cut that the studio made him trash. I can't wait to see that cut.The best thing in the film though, is Roger Deakins' cinematography. That is what you gives the feel for the film. The blurry landscapes, the wheat fields that Pitt gracefully moves through, and the greatest train robbery scene ever on film. It perfectly portrays the landscapes of the old 1800's and everything that took place there. The film is consistent with providing one memorable scene after the other. When the assassination finally happens, you'll be sitting in your chair gawking at the screen in amazement of how sudden it happens.I am very proud to say that this is now my favorite film of all time, and my definite choice for Best Picture of the year. It brings new flavor to the art-house scene and never lets you down. I recommend this film to everyone. It truly is a beautiful film.I give it a 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good things, it has...","I can't be kind with this film; it's been a very disappointing experience. As the world may know (or can find out with this and other movies), Robert Ford killed Jesse James, the famous outlaw from the West. Well, Andrew Dominik's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford"" (already a bit pretentious, even if it comes from Ron Hansen novel's original title) is a long journey to the 'how', 'when' and 'why' of the fact, giving that we know the who.I'm sorry if I'm being a little repetitive; sometimes movie characteristics stick with me for a while after watching them. The music of ""The Assassination"" is repetitive, as its structure and its beautifully shot sequences, sceneries, lights and use of colors, empty rooms, fast- moving clouds: the movie is just marvelously shot. Dominik's adapted script starts the film off with the kindness of telling us who the main character (played by Brad Pitt) is, as we witness a blurry screen.That's the set-up for the structure, with a pleasant narration that not only becomes unpleasant with duration time, but at times also unnecessary. What are images for if someone's telling you everything you're watching? What good does a complete description provide for an actor if the viewer will be carefully watching if the character behaves exactly as what he or she heard?Brad Pitt suffers from this in this film that Dominik wants to be a focused study on two people, but gets distracted with the 'bigger picture' and worn down by the narration and an excessive exercise of style. Roger Deakins' photography is undoubtedly the movie's highest point, but it looks like the director never knew when to say ""stop"", and Deakins, an expert on camera tricks (here greatly helped by Curtiss Clayton and Dylan Tichenor's classic and well chosen cuts to black; which work every time and are not excessive, so they create a balance), kept going.I don't want you to misinterpret me about Pitt, though. His work here is very good; patient and contemplative, however unexpectedly confident and threatening in the stronger scenes. Even when his Jesse is the one who speaks the less, his speaking becomes meaningful. This is not Russell Crowe's elaborated study of silence in ""3:10 to Yuma"".Actually, ""The Assassination"" is nothing like ""3:10 to Yuma"": in Mangold's film there's a redemption that's understood by the viewer after witnessing a series of events; here the movie tries to redeem a character leaving no space for the viewer's personal judgment. In a similar way, we sense the feelings and personalities of ""3:10 to Yuma's"" characters in one specific scene; while Dominik's movie almost obligates us to comprehend its two main creatures before, during and after the main events, when the truth is that we may not have figured it out.Luckily, Casey Affleck's best performance to date helps us a lot, because the actor worries about creating someone we can empathize with. He presents a contradiction in his Robert Ford, who used to worship and love someone he ends up killing. The best scenes in the film are the little ones; the ones where you don't think anything relevant can happen. When Robert is watching Jesse's wife Zee (Mary-Louise Parker, one of the many underused actors in the film) through the window, he turns around and realizes Jesse's been watching him for some time. ""You'll break many hearts"", he tells Robert. Try to unveil the whole meaning of that phrase.Of course there's plenty of good things in ""The Assassination"". Like Sam Rockwell's interpretation who, away from Pitt's stillness and Affleck's constant ticks, constructs a normal human being who worries about his family and friends, and does it with the naturalness that's characterized him even in his most eccentric roles. He's better than the other two and, seriously, he should be working more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best so far this decade,"This almost defines the oft-used term ""elegiac Western"". It has some of the well-worn themes of Westerns, such as the creation of Western myth vs. the cold, harsh realities. But for some reason, it never feels like anything else I've ever seen. It has a style more reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni than any of the great Western filmmakers. It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole. But it's also not averse to close-ups. Director Dominik, who has only made one other film, Chopper, and it's been seven years since then, loves to concentrate on facial expressions, as well as body language (don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language, or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention). The cast is uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads, and neither has done as well. Affleck is a revelation. The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider. Andrew Dominik is the star, though. There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely re-invents the genre. 3:10 to Yuma may well be the big money-making Western of the year, but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released. It is the best film of the year so far, and will be hard to top.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The artistic shots through the old style glass is fantastic.Score is very unorthodox yet amazingly effective.The only downside to the film many say is the running time, but I admire that Andrew allowed for the performances of the actors to be the showcase.

Good but slow and unfocused,"The story of notorious outlaw Jesse James, concentrating on the last seven months of his life. Looks at how he is befriended by Robert Ford and how this will lead to his death.Good acting and decent script but very slow moving, resulting in a 2 hr 40 min movie. Could have been an hour shorter and still achieved the same result. The story meandered and digressed a lot in the middle section, spending much time on subplots which didn't have much bearing on the main story.Thought that the story of Robert Ford's post-assassination life could have been expanded more, though. The little post-assassination story that was shown, saved the movie, I feel.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of my favourites of the decade,"I don't think I can add to what has been said so well already about how amazing this film is. It is a movie that both entranced and haunted me, and alongside the likes of Brokeback Mountain, There will be Blood and Pan's Labyrinth, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of my favourites of the decade.The film is quite glacial in its pace, but I do not consider that a problem in any way, as I think the slow pacing was done deliberately. And even if it was slow in pace, I don't think I would have cared, because everything about this film is so good.The Assassination of Jesse James... has some of the most sweeping and at the same time most beautiful images I have seen on film in recent memory. The whole film is exquisitely shot, and the landscapes and scenery are stunning. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score fits beautifully too.The film is also rich in characterisation, has a thoughtful and well-textured script, has a beautiful and haunting atmosphere and a story that despite the pace and the long running time drew me in and never let go. The direction is sensitive and never heavy-handed, and there are some truly excellent performances. Both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are wonderful in very powerful and understated performances, and out of the supporting cast Sam Rockwell stands out.In conclusion, a fine film and one of the best of the decade in my opinion. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too self-important to truly shine but definitely worth a rental,"This artsy, extended western does feel somewhat over-labored, indulging heavily in subplot and lengthy, actorly pauses without having enough backbone to do so, before finally finding it's footing over halfway through. Andrew Dominik is someone to look out for in the future with his noticeable sophomore release, offering a contemplative, slow-burning alternative to most westerns, guided by some impressive cinematography and airtight production.While much has been made of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, it really seems to be more about him simply stepping up to play a larger role in general. He hangs around with an admirable supporting cast and does not appear too out of place, but I really couldn't call his, or any of the chief performances outstanding. Brad Pitt continues to refine the obviousness of what made him successful, but even as the rugged and roughed up centerpiece he feels awfully lightweight in certain instances.If viewers are patient enough to sit through the less-involving first half of this lengthy piece with some curiosity then it just might transition from this pseudo-authentic, slightly homoerotic shoot into something a tad deeper on the nature of celebrity.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
unbelievable!,"This movie was quite simply AMAZING! Oscar worthy performances from Affleck, Pitt, and Rockwell-Oscar worthy cinematography-Oscar worthy directing. Hate me if you want, but the pacing was perfect. I was glued to my seat. The best part about this movie is that it could have easily been a set up for failure given how slow the story is, but the tension created by each actors performance left me wanting more. The last thing the world ""needs"" is another typical, gun slinging western. This is by far the best movie I've seen all year.P.S. for any little Ben Affleck fans... I just have one thing to say, his brother just made him look like a joke.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a captivating tale,"I have read a lot about this movie before I watch. Acting of both Bradd Pitt and Ben Affleck is good, but movie does not kept the interest of movie watchers. I have to kept an eye on the clock to see how much it is remaining. I have a craving for this movie but all my dreams of relishing this movie is dashed. I don't understand why it is rated so high. Only the climax is bit interesting otherwise movie is dull.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant but not for everyone,"I was reluctant to watch an almost three hour western but was very curious, especially because of the cast. The story is not intricate and the pace is slow, which will make many viewers bored, but what is interesting in the story is the increasing tension build up and the character studies. The character of Robert Ford is marvellously played by Casey Affleck, a pathetic character that both repells and makes you feel compassionate, his gradual shift from awe to resentment to Jesse is subtle and in line with the above mentioned tension.
Brad Pitt is impecable, the best performance I have seen from him. The development of the characters and the story are wrapped perfectly with superb and perfectly synchronised photography, music and landscapes, making this , in my humble opinion, one of the best pieces of cinematography of the last 20 years.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pretty to look at, very intense from time to time, but also very slow","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is based on the novel of the same name by Ron Hansen, which in turn is based on real events that took place in the late 1800s. The West is slowly dying out, giving room for modern era of industrialization and globalism. And one of the last great folk heroes of that era was the train robber Jesse James. This is the story of his demise. As you might have surmised from the title.Directed by Andrew Dominik, with Roger Deakins as the cinematographer, it's certainly a very pretty film. The West is brought in front of your eyes in all of its empty glory. With its vast fields, its endless space, with the distant sun painting everything in shades of dust and wheat. The camera work and lighting are also spectacular, especially in the opening train robbing scene. If you like westerns at all, you should definitely see this film for the visuals alone.The acting is also very good. Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, the main character, has that smarmy quality to him. You can instantly see that this guy is faking his bravado, putting on airs, trying to fill shoes that are way too big. But he thinks he's pulling it off, and is so annoyingly smug about it. This is a guy you wanna slap on general principle. Which makes it all the more interesting when the movie starts to work at making him sympathetic.But real top notch acting in this movie is done by Brad Pitt as Jesse James. I would have liked to see more of this character. Now you get the sense that people believe he's a myth, a legend. A man that quiets the room simply by walking in. Because he's that dangerous. You can see it, but you don't quite have time to believe it yourself, because we don't spend enough time with him. Pitt convinces us by his acting, but it's not enough to really sink in. Yet at the same time the movie talks about him a lot. About how he was larger than life and a feature of American cultural consciousness at that time. And how much his death shook people. You hear about it, but you don't believe it because so much time is spent with Ford.Which might make it seem baffling when I say that this film is a slow one. Because if it's a slow and long one, where was the not-Ford time spent if not on Jesse? Well, on landscapes, Ford's relatives, more landscapes, interior shots, landscapes... Things like that. And it looks pretty. It looks real pretty. But perhaps they could have cut a few of the establishing landscape shots and focused more on Jesse's status as a legend. Might have made Ford's eventual fate more coherent for us. Because there's a reason the title of the film paints Ford as a coward. It demeans him for killing a train robber. Think about that.Still, the film has its merits. Definitely a film I will remember, for the imagery alone if nothing else. It has its flaws as well, being far from perfect, but nevertheless I'd say it's worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jesse Was Actually Bored to Death,"Even if one is not versed in history, the title gives away the ending so there's no suspense here. The point of the movie is the journey, but this one is so mind-numbingly boring that one has to repeatedly ask, ""Are we there yet?"" About 13 hours into the movie, Robert finally shoots Jesse (hurray!). However, the film goes on for another three hours after that! In fact, it may still be playing. There are too many talking heads blabbering on and on about uninteresting things and much of the dialog is either slurred or mumbled (especially Afleck). The pompous narration adds to the misery. And what's with the repeated usage of the lens with blurry edges? Epic failure.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautifully Textured Masterwork,"This is a really amazing film. All the pieces - props, costume, camera-work, script, and acting - fit together as well as the finely crafted parts of a nickel-plated revolver. I was surprised I'd not heard more about it.The film tells the story of the James Gang and specifically the fatal relationship of Jesse James and Robert Ford. During the course of the action we see darkness and light in everyone, even the ""coward."" Care is taken to finely pare into the psyches of these Outlaws and the cold world they walk in. I think I saw just about every emotion there is to have in these men and we can almost understand, even if we can't accept, what moves them in their deadly paths.Pitt is both iconic and vulnerable - beautiful and frightening as Jesse James, a robber and killer who hoists up a reputation of fearless boss on one shoulder and charming folk hero on another. His character's movement through peril and praise reminds one of the great gangster characters from Scorsese's work, with an added rawness that only Pitt and a few others can genuinely summon. His fatalism is also quite entrancing and subtly masterful.Affleck is truly mesmerizing as a born misfit who is so uncomfortable in this world around him, that his neuroses, if they can be called that, really get into your skin. I was reminded of Joaquin Phoenix's role as Comodus, but it's even more intense and yet so very believable. As the audience, I was torn between pitying the character, being utterly disappointed in him, and just wanting him to somehow be better. And the script's maturity really comes into play with this character. No one is beyond reproach, understanding, or grim fate.I'd say that's the main theme here: fate.There's no easy formula. No one simply ""gets what's coming to them."" There are no simple villains or heroes. There's just life and the actions taken and the echoes of those actions and eventually, an end. It transcends any petty ideas of justice or even legend. It takes a full snapshot of a beautiful and grim reality and lets us just take it in, like a corpse on ice. Profound by presentation alone.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fair on history; sloppy on characterization,"Not brilliant, but a decent watch. It takes a docu-drama approach, so don't expect a scintillating shoot 'em up western. Neither is it a very accurate analysis in its historic character portrayals. Jesse James was an infamous outlaw, not the Messiah. Robert Ford was a traitorous outlaw, not a Poindexter computer nerd type with too much mousse in his hair. The other Ford was also an outlaw, not Mickey Mouse.Other than character development, this period piece is constructed with superior attention to detail of the era. The chronology of historical events is correct. The acting is mixed: some expert, others lazy. Mary Louise Parker is best, in a powerfully emotional yet minor role. Unfortunately, it makes it even more obvious some of the performances were walk-throughs. Casey Affleck (Robert Ford) renders his many colliding emotions well, but Brad Pitt pretty much plays himself. Never did he become Jesse James in this film. In one scene, he does a psychotic laugh that sounds forced and lame.The narration is garbled and inaudible, to anyone except a bat, maybe. You'll need to enable the sub titles to find out what is being mumbled, to avoid missing significant information. Also, the film runs longer than necessary; a lot of stuff we see in the developmental stage is worthless padding.On the up side, the atmosphere is appropriately somber throughout. The choreography is imbued with deep colors that properly maintain the theme. The tension of the Ford/James ""friendship"" plays out well on the screen. The music supports the mood and objective, and even someone who knows nothing about Jesse James will learn some facts about him.More a docu-drama than a western or a history piece, the film has its share of strengths and weaknesses. Overall, worth a rental when you have nothing else to do.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cuts Deep,"There are some incredible performances in this film. Beginning with Brad Pitt as Jesse James. It shows how romanticized a person could become, notwithstanding his cruelty, instability, and violence. Pitt plays the complex criminal who murdered without a thought and then collapsed in tears. The second and probably more significant figure in this movie is Robert Ford, played masterfully by Casey Affleck. He goes from worshipping the outlaw, gaining his confidence, and, finally, living in abject fear. This film pushes three hours and yet one can't take his eyes off it. Sensational supporting cast. Tension thick as it can be. And a sense of the reality of celebrity and its pitfalls. One of the better films I've seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Overblown, overlong; great role for Casey Affleck","New Zealander Andrew Dominik's 'Chopper'(2000) had Eric Bana very effective in the biopic of a famous Australian criminal. This overblown, overlong, pseudo-arty rehash (with intermittent fake-antique ""refracted"" camera-work) of Jesse James's last days has been admired and hated. Brad Pitt got the Venice Film Festival's Best Actor award. In fact Pitt lacks the presence needed here to make his role interesting. Casey Affleck, with his embarrassing faux-naïve eagerness, is the one who holds the screen. With this and the upcoming movie brother Ben has debut-directed with him as the star ('Gone, Baby, Gone' from a novel by 'Mystic River' author Denis Lehane), he may be moving up to major roles, so that's the most noteworthy thing abut this otherwise misfired effort. Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepherd and others are wasted in scenes and conversations that ramble on and never make much sense. The Seventies-style quirkiness isn't backed up by solid ideas, and at over two and a half hours, this is a long, tedious slog to sit through.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Reflection of Our Society,"This was a very good movie and I would definitely recommend it but it is 2 hours and 40 minutes with it being slow at times. Still it has some great acting, musical score, cinematography with good directing.Casey Affleck has had a great year in acting with this movie and Gone Baby Gone. He gives such a deep, authentic and complex performance you could say he deserved an Oscar for it . He has what his brother Ben Affleck does not have, dedication to the character and the meanings and purpose they have within them. When I think about his performances and roles in both Gone Baby Gone and this really makes me wonder about myself and my character. Brad Pitt gave a very interesting performance as well but I still did not find it to be that great. At times he was a bit over the top but this is not to say that he was not good.What really transformed this movie was the cinematography and directing. The directing and cinematography really delivered on what the purpose of this movie is. It helped you understand the feelings, personalities but most of all the complexities of all the characters involved in the story. The cinematography and music fused together and really made me get a feel for the story and the movie.In a way this movie reflects our society today. The message of this movie was really deep and meaningful saying that everyone plays a role in society even if you don't like your role that is what you are. The public determines your destiny and image. It depicts gang life and how betrayal is the worst act that can be committed and in which loyalty is a must even if you know longer have relations with it. It shows how there always has to be a necessary evil or a scape goat no matter what effect it has on people because people do not want to blame themselves they want to blame others instead. This is movie happens to take place in the west rather than it being a western. This movie/story tries to tell us something that is deeply embedded in our minds and in our society. It displays what we think of ourselves is drastically different of the image of ourselves from other people.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Zen of Celebrity,"Greetings again from the darkness. The star of this film is Super-Cinematographer Roger Deakins. This guy is a true artist with a camera and thanks to the excruciatingly slow pace here, we get plenty of opportunities to admire his craft. I am not just talking about the stunning snow scenery, but pay attention to the way Mr. Deakins photographs faces and the movements of the actors. It is truly a technical marvel of film-making.As you might guess, when the best thing about the film is the cinematography, it may not deliver the goods from a dramatic standpoint. I won't call this a snoozer, but if the pace were any slower it could have been just as effective as an old fashioned slide show.The film is really not about Jesse James and it really isn't too much about the coward Bob Ford. It really is about one desperate attempt to get famous ... to reach celebrity status. As the old saying goes, be careful what you ask for. Brad Pitt does a nice job capturing the existential side of the famed bank robber, but the film really belongs to Casey Affleck, in his first true lead role. I must admit, Affleck's mumbling and fake naivety wear thin very quickly. Sure he may be the best actor among the Affleck brothers, but is that really saying much? New Zealand director Andrew Dominik put together quite a supporting cast but really doesn't now what to do with it. There is so much wasted talent ... in particular, Sam Shepard and Zooey Deschanel, whose roles appeared to be thrown in at the last minute. Faring better are James Carville in a surprisingly effective role as the Governor, Paul Schneider as a creepy Wood, Nick Cave in a weird scene as a saloon singer, Sam Rockwell as Ford's older brother and the always effective and interesting Michael Parks, who is to ""GD"" what Samuel L. Jackson is to ""MF"".As a work of art, this is definitely one to see. From a dramatic standpoint, it is quite a let down.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Most critically underrated movie of the year....,"This film is as close to perfection as it gets. I'm completely baffled by those who do not get it. But then again, they are probably baffled by why I don't understand how movies like ""National Treasure"" sell more than twelve tickets.I read a review about how only ""cinemaphiles"" will get this movie. Uhhh, well, uhhhh, yes I agree.First of all, the cinematography is breathtaking. And the acting is outstanding. And you don't get all this without amazing direction. Brad Pitt delivers his best, by far, performance to date. I wish he would stick to meatier roles like this and stop than Oceans 11 (12, 13, 245) nonsense. And Casey Affleck actually gave me the chills, his performance is so dead-on. As terrific as Brad Pitt is, this is Casey Affleck's movie. His performance is chilling - and haunting. And he nails this character. If he does not get an Oscar nomination, I will take a hostage. In addition, Sam Rockwell gives one of the most likable and entertaining performances I've seen in a while. His timing is impeccable. (That scene on the ice where Jesse keeps firing his gun and Rockwell keeps continuing the conversation made me laugh out loud.) All the supporting characters are amazing. And we have the bonus of Sam Shephard. If you like good acting, this film is like the motherload. Too bad they didn't let Mary Louise Parker speak more than 3 words.One thing I haven't heard too many people comment on is the dark humor in this film. I laughed out loud several times. Luckily, I wasn't the only one. Usually I'm getting the ""something is wrong with that woman"" look as I'm laughing at the dark, hidden humor in films such as ""Sling Blade"" and The Assassination of Jesse James. Maybe its a southern thing.The ONLY criticism I have of this movie is the somewhat distracting voice-over narration. This kind of bugged me. Sounded like someone narrating a children's fable. With this kind of acting, we don't need someone telling us what is taking place.I hope Brad Pitt gets an Oscar nomination for Lead Actor (although he is not the actual lead, Casey Affleck is but Brad Pitt is considered the Lead). And I not only hope that Casey Affleck gets an Oscar nomination for supporting actor, I hope he takes the gold fellow home.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yawn.,"I am solidly in the minority here. This film was tediously self-indulgent. I fought sleep. I wondered through most of it why the principle actors signed on to do it. Perhaps it's just one of those films that had wonderful potential on paper. Maybe after the final cut from the editors and director, the story and dialogue just got in the way of some private pretentious vision of the filmmaker. It had all the potential to be a great film. IMHO the director's art house cinema muse got in the way. Is this enough lines of text to pan this turkey? No? OK. How about now? Still not enough? Unbelievable! IMDb is guilty of the same sin this movie is---compulsory long-windedness.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Well... long titel for a long movie.,"Have to say this movie is very well made. Poetic imagery and background music, which I heard was composed by Nick Cave. The acting is also very good, no doubt.
Now, this is by no means an action, comedy or adventure, or even a ""classical western."" It's a character study of sorts, I would say very much so. And a take on the Jesse James story I presume, beacuse I myself know nothing about it, other then the name Jesse James, as many others do, but to me that name is the same thing as Lucky Luke. Don't know what a history buff on the subject of Jesse James would say about this movie, but it did seem like they were trying to keep to known facts in this film, even though I wouldn't know. That was the feeling anyway.
Now, like I stated, this is a very beautiful and well made movie. And it's very centered on the characters of Robert Ford and Jesse James, and some other members of the Jesse James gang, one of them Robert Fords brother.
Anyway, besides how well made this movie was. I can't help I found it way to slow and also depressing. It has a extremely serious and sad feel. I don't mind slow movies or even some times depressing movies. But this was a little bit to much even for my take.
Good movie. But overall, boring and depressing. I would only recommend it to someone who likes to study movies as an art form. For someone who's just looking for a good time to spend two hours or three, on a movie, this movie is a no no.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Legend Born and a Coward Ignored,"""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" says it all, but it has even more than meets the eye. Not only is the title a spoiler, but it sums up the two main characters. JESSE JAMES is in BIG BOLD letters like the legend he is while Robert Ford is hardly noticed underneath his name with the publicly attached ""coward"" in front it. The title allows us to sit back and enjoy the journey of Robert Ford in his quest to become famous, and Jesse James' journey into infamy and legendary myth.The film stars Brad Pitt as the notorious Jesse James. Brad Pitt delivers an incredible performance. This may be his crowing achievement along with the character, Tyler Durden, which he played to perfection in ""Fight Club."" He plays Jesse James like he's bipolar so we never know what he's thinking, or what he's capable of doing at any given minute under any given circumstance. One minute he's jovial, and the next he's ripping at Robert Ford's head as he presses a knife to his throat with a demented look in his eyes just screaming of a homicidal maniac. Brad Pitt doesn't play him perfectly and some will notice the infamous Tyler Durden laugh peeking through, but it's a great performance that is thoroughly layered with deep, dark and buried emotions. It is worthy of a nomination at the very least. Jesse James' past and his actions seem to haunt him. Pitt plays a man suffering from a deep and very dark depression as he tries to hide his inner demons with good nature and laughter. Jesse James always knows what's going on. He's very cerebral in his actions. He's like a homicide detective with his carefully intimidating probing of terrified subjects as he looks for answers, but finds nothing but lies. James finds himself all alone surrounded by people that are looking to get paid off by giving him up to the law. He is always on the run and we gradually see him become tired of running and tired of living the way he is. His insomnia keeps him up at all hours as he lives in fear and paranoia. The assassination scene, one of the best scenes in the film, is incredible and shockingly suspenseful, as well as chilling. The pacing in that scene is deliberate and thought provoking, which will leave you thinking about it long after you see it.Casey Affleck plays the ""coward,"" Robert Ford. He is surly Oscar worthy here and undoubtedly gives the performance of his lifetime in a career year - ""Gone Baby Gone"". He plays Robert Ford as a weird, meticulous, well intentioned admirer of Jesse James thrust into his inner circle. He's the youngest brother of five boys. He's the weak one. He's the one always made fun of. He's always overlooked or looked down upon. Robert Ford is an uncomfortable person to be around, and Affleck plays him perfectly as a very odd young man with an obsession of Jesse James + the James gang that cross over boundaries of more than just admiration. He wants to be so much apart of that gang that, that's all he has ever wanted since he was a young child reading the fascinating stories of the James gang, and his legendary idol, Jesse James. He wants the fame and the respect that Jesse has, and he wants to be apart of something grand. He wants to know what it feels like to be Jesse James; in his shoes. As he joins the gang he starts to feel the pressure of Jesse James, and his feelings of the man start to change. When Robert Ford is sent to capture and arrest Jesse James that is when Jesse James becomes haunting as he watches his every move, and death seems immanent to both Robert Ford and his brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell). Robert Ford becomes every bit as famous after the murder as James was, then the people stop caring and they start hating. The final act of the film may be the most impressive since we see the kind of backfire stardom can have on you in a celebrity obsessed culture - even in the late 19th century.The journey leading to the assassination and the incredible acting is something to truly admire and become utterly fascinated to watch unfold. The acting was just incredible even with some of the smaller parts, especially, with the lying and conniving, Charley Ford, or the funny, smart and very creepy, Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider). The acting on a whole was fantastic and no one upstaged anyone. The four main characters are all fantastic and all very different. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing; this is some of the greatest film has to offer. The scenery is vast and breathtaking. The way some of the images are shot with blurred and distorted edges gives the audience the same feelings of the blurred perceptions between myth and fact. There are several shots through distorted windows giving a blurred outlook on this folklore world that Dominik creates. We never really are sure if something happened this way since the truth has been lost in myth and legend.The set and costume designs were fantastic along with the argot. It feels as if you have been transported back to the late 1880s. It's a slow character study and wonderful cinematic piece of art. The score is both beautiful and haunting matching the tone of the film to perfection. This is one of the decades best films. Andrew Dominik deserves a lot of credit for this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly good,"Is it slow? Yes it is. Apart from that, The Assassination has no flaws. Despite the pace, you'll still want to know what happens next. The narration is beautiful, thanks to photography, intense dialogues and some poetic voiceover from the book. The psychological dynamic between James and Ford is perfectly depicted. Every single facial expression is gold. Acting is terrific by Affleck, Rockwell, and Pitt in perhaps his best interpretation. The moment of the assassination is a thing of beauty. Lastly, this movie has the best photography I've ever seen, and I mean it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The hero that was a villain.  The admirer that was a coward.,"Anticipated realism.Beautiful cinematography and direction. Some people say the storyline is misguided and sometimes dull, but I say with good reason. They are building something here. We all know the story. The American lure. Even though it's history and could be no other way, I didn't see it coming. I never expected the actual assassination to be so forth carried out.It was interesting to find that Pitt wasn't the focus of this film, instead we find Affleck deviling deep into the depths of desire and madness. The tension building with each disappointment or insult. How he did not win Oscar gold for this performance is beyond me. Instead it went to the methodic killer in ""No Country for Old Men"" and not the reluctant one in Jesse James.Pitt gives one of his finest performances in one of his most challenging films. He didn't really need to say much. His presence captured all. Pitt may very well be remembered for this film, even with an ever-growing impressive category of work. The supporting cast also did a great job, with an outstanding showing by Sam Rockwell as the sometimes not so evident meeker Ford brother.In short, a psychological thriller that never fails to conspire.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect,"I just now re-watched the film for the first time in years. It's perfect. My eyes are sobbing. It's the only movie I can recall that personifies a feeling of how America really was during that time.Jesse was a last remnant of old America, when it was brave and fierce, unapologetic and bold. Despite him technically being a serial killer, Jesse was widely regarded with fondness amongst the American people, for various reasons. Normally, a man who killed a serial killer would be praised, but to snuff out Jesse was as if the very spirit of America itself was snuffed out.The scene of his death is heart-wrenching, especially after the slow build up over the entire movie. Zee's cries of grief are as real and devastating as I've ever seen in a movie.Also I'm now 34, the same age as Jesse when he died. I feel I understand his plight more now than ever.I first saw it on its opening weekend in 2007 with my dad when I was 17. I still remember that viewing well, and still have the DVD.The casting, acting, cinematography, direction, script, everything really, is utterly sublime. I consider this film in my Top 10 movies of all time, alongside LOTR. In many ways I think this film is even better than LOTR.The soundtrack in particular is so deeply sad. It really accentuates the film as a whole, and the feeling it gives, like the snuffing out of the flame Jesse was carrying, the flame that remained since the civil war that he and so many who were there, and who admired him, were a part of. Snuffing out Jesse was like spitting on the very soul of America, despite his many murders. Jesse's betrayal and assassination was like a stab to the heart of so many who mourned for the death of part of the American soul that lived on with Jesse. No other film has captured that feeling so vividly as this. It's as if I am transported back to that time and feel it as if I am right there.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Time capsule (or closet) from a bygone age,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a slow-moving western. This in itself is unusual  westerns tend to be action pieces. The denouement is given away in the title, so there is no waiting to see how it will end. Instead, we are invited to spend over two and half hours examining the whys and wherefores. These are fairly involved but not inscrutable: Jesse James is hero-worshipped (almost homoerotically) by the rather limp wristed Robert Ford. Robbie joins the big man's band of bad guys, eventually gets fed up, and ends up shooting him in the back. End of story.It is one of those films billed as 'a psychological study'. Indeed, apart from some very nice photography, there is little else to study. Fortunately, Casey Affleck is up to the job and managed to make me squirm with every softly-delivered phrase. Jesse (Brad Pitt), on the other hand is macho, tough and straight (at least as low-down dirty, thievin', murderin' crooks go). And Jesse is brave. Robbie isn't. But Robbie would like the fame and adulation that goes with being brave.It is films like this that make Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys so hilarious. What do men, with strong sexual urges, no women, and cooped up with each other for hours and months in the wild west, do? Well, they discover their inner gay and have sex. Simple. So write a love story where sex just isn't gonna happen and you get enough psychoses to spin a nice yarn, some highly dysfunctional lives (it's based on a true story), or nearly three hours in the cinema.Pitt calls the film an 'anatomy of an assassination.' On that level, it is quite effective and recalls many a film noir where we have to work out why the victim was really killed. It's also a good example of how a common criminal can get to be portrayed as a dashing rogue  a persona many murderers, from serial killers to perpetrators of high-school massacres, possibly buy into. If this is a plus point of the film, the documentary-like way it is shot adds much. Great effort has gone into making even small details as authentic as possible and we genuinely feel as if we are glimpsing through a window into history.

Abominable Monstrosity Of Yawning Tedium,"You want a definition of pretentious, tedious, boring, prolonged, too far-fetched, dull, skewed, pathetic, silly and bland? Well, you got it - this abominable terrible monstrous long stew that was intended as a masterwork but failed sizzling and dies with a whimper. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a terribly vapid and languid film that crawls lazily and only gets a bit faster when the shootings come in, but alas, even they sound as if some boys exploded powder from their dad's bullets in the backyard. This lazy, idle, slow, plodding, yawning delivery is made all worse by awful scenes of some duels or deaths which all seem unnatural or staged. Brad Pitt? Sam Shepard? Sam Rockwell? Well, ven excellent stars can make horrid missteps like they all did here. My advice - never even think of watching this abomination of artless stew/",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Film Ever?,"I know absolutely nothing about films. I just know that this one is so damn good that even someone like me who usually just sticks to comedies can get lost in the story.I love watching this film over and over. The best part is that it has been over ten years since it was released, so when I quote the brilliantly written quotes to my friends they usually don't know it's from a film and they assume that I have incredible vocabulary. So, thanks for that. The dialogue in the film is pure poetry. Which is just one factor of how this film is able to capture life of the 19th century, because words had so much more value and meaning before things like LOL came into existence.Bringing the audience into this world is what makes it so easy for us to humanize and sympathize someone who on paper should be considered a vile and ruthless criminal. I doubt the best lawyers of today could do what this film has done.I LOVE this.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Place,"I've seen two modern westerns in close proximity: this and ""3:10 to Yuma.""The main thing that defines the western is the notion of the western grand spaces on men, always men, purifying certain traits and dynamics. From that you get specialized versions of the usual stories, often about honor and revenge.Within that there are few decisions to be made: which story, how pure, how close to cling to cliché (not necessarily bad), and most importantly what balance to put on the man versus the place.Usually the decision is to focus on the man. That's served the Hollywood fame machine well for almost a century now. Its the choice made by the ""Yuma"" folks, and its pretty ordinary; the only difference is in this guy (Crowe) versus that one, say Wayne.The choice that was made here is far better. Its more abstract than usual. It pretends to be more focused on men than usual, two men as is the case with ""Yuma."" But in fact the emphasis here is on the place. Its the place, the spaces and visions that define the urges and qualities that these men absorb. It allows for the thing to be visually oriented and Deakins is up to the job. He learned this working for the Coens.The way this emerges is about story, Jesse (like Clyde Barrow) having become a legend through media exposure. The perspective is folded: we see a man who is cursed by what he sees of how others see him.(His undoing even leverages this: the historically accurate scene of him admiring a train picture and exposing his back.)The characters work, and the best we've seen Pitt in eons. But its the presentation of the world through what we see that matters. We enter the story not by getting the world by observing men and deducing the world; we see the world as they do and can see how it shapes them, and the tragedy we see unravel.Both this and ""Yuma"" celebrate the kernel of honor in an extraordinary thief. But here you are in on the shaping. Its a noir idea, and much more welcome than mugging in chaps.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"This is certainly a well-crafted film. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful, as is Nick Cave's score. Brad Pitt captivates as always, and the other main performances (Casey Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner, Paul Schneider) are all quite accomplished as well. The personalities of James (charming but dangerous) and Ford (hero-worshipping, meek, eager for recognition) make a compelling contrast. The movie engages your attention despite its slow pace, and is a fairly interesting deconstruction of Western mythology. But I had a couple of problems with it. The narration is delivered poorly, and often insults the audience by spelling things out too plainly. More troublesome is the air of self-importance that hangs over everything. Dominik strives for a Malick-ian aesthetic but lacks the emotional and philosophical content to back it up. I tend to appreciate an elegiac tone, but I often wondered what purpose it was serving. It felt overdone to me, as if I was being cajoled into recognizing a profundity that wasn't there. It needed to back off just a bit. I did generally enjoy the experience, however.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A work of art!! An underrated gem,"How can a movie be so beautiful yet depressing. It almost feels like Shakesperean. One of the best shot movies ever!!Roger Deakins is awesome!And the opening train robbery!! So so beautiful.There have been countless movies made on Jesse James and his assassination. But this movie, no scratch that, this piece of art isn't like those. It explores the relationship of Robert ford and Jesse and the reason for the titular killing. It almost feels like a romance between the two and killing being the last act of highest intimacy. Robert in his entire childhood looks upto the legend that is Jesse. He wants to be like him. But when he gets to know Jesse more he realizes he isn't this great antihero who killed the rich and looked after the poor but rather an arrogant prick ready to murder anyone who stands between him and his success. Even Jesse knows he is a bad man. That's what makes it so hauntingly beautiful. The two characters share an intimate relationship which just cannot be explained by words. Jesse has become paranoid after all his exploits and actually want to die. And he wants Robert to kill him!! And the leadup to the assassination. Cinematic perfection!!. The music just playing tragically and the sudden stop when he fires the bullet and then continues after his death, man just so frickin' awesome. And the after math of the death was so important thematically. On one side we have a daring murderous cowboy who looted people and killed women and children and on the other we have a scared individual who was just protecting his life. And who does the public recognize more? Of course Jesse James. It just gives a scathing review of the people we are and how we aren't as good as we think.And the performances!!!!Casey Affleck just portrays Robert's fears and admiration so well, he almost steals every scene he is in, and Brad Pitt producing I think his greatest performance. Jesse James needed to be played by an electric screen presence and a huge star and Brad Pitt is both of them. Sam Rockwell does an awesome job as well(as per usual) as Robert's brother.
Actually I wasn't surprised to see the relatively low ratings here on imdb as a casual viewer might view this as boring. Agreed the movies is slow paced and there are a couple of places that dragged. And that's why I loved it. We just know the ending but the slow burn of revealing the reasons for it was just so spectacular!If you have a higher attention span I am sure you will love it. For the others who have been watching Nolan or Fincher movies you might find it boring but try to watch it!! One of the alltime great movies",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An unusual and fascinating reinterpretation of a legend: THE ASSASSINATION OF JASSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD,"The young Robert Ford had a morbid veneration for the outlaw Jesse James. From an early age because he collected anything with him. One day he finally manages to make space in his band and hitting behind him, kill him. Presented at the Venice Film Festival 2007, the second movie directed by New Zealander Andrew Dominik with Brad Pitt did win the Coppa Volpi for best actor prize deserved, considering the extraordinary performance offered by this actor, universally recognized as a pretty face relegated only to petty traders, but instead be able to grapple with expertise in roles far released, and ""The Assassination of Jasse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is proof beyond question. A sign that looks can be deceiving and that, behind a sex symbol, contrary to what one may say or think, there is a hidden talent not indifferent. Certainly, in the career of Brad Pitt There are other valid interpretations, but it certainly surpasses them all. Andrew Dominik courageous ""extrapolates"" an American myth, projecting it into a reality ""current"". Eluding any stereotypical gender make a wonderful western twilight, unconventional, focused more on the psychology of the characters in the historical context: in fact there is no mention whatsoever in the past the dreaded bandit, nor do we try to draw a profile social / political than years . Dominik dig deep. It offers an unusual and fascinating reinterpretation of a legend. Set the narrative pace calm and reflective, light years away from the hectic standards of contemporary cinema. Directs without any particular virtuosity: fields, reverse shot, long shots. Immense and beautiful landscapes that emerge in all their splendor, which inevitably leads to overt reminiscent of the style of Mallick, pausing so the viewer's attention on the contrasting relationship between man and nature. Sequences that are echoed in the cinema of Michael Cimino, impossible not to find similarities with ""Heaven's Gate"", or more generally to his way of making a movie: the same stretches of green, endless open spaces. Commendable Roger Deakins, who cleverly exploits the photographic effects of fading in the contours of the image, thus channeling the movie in a sort of dreamlike dimension. Avoiding the kind of a show, choosing instead a style Dominik disillusioned, finding Jasse James the embodiment of the end of Western, approachable in some ways to ""Unforgiven"" of Eastwood, both movies leave out many differences, are anchored to a certain realism, far from dazzling epic western detectable in most movies. ""The assassination of Jasse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is in fact entirely devoid of action sequences, excluding the one, that of the train robbery. Robert Ford did not intend merely to resemble his idol. Knowing he could never emulate correctly decides to shoot him. The same thing will happen to that one hundred years after the fans of John Lennon. Ford portrays perfectly the emblem of unbridled ambition, but you will understand very quickly that a myth can neither kill nor replace. The boy will remain a prisoner of himself relentlessly, sharing the same fate of his hero, in a mocking juxtaposition of roles: the person who first became famous from nothing and then pay high price for glory. Dominik's movie is striking for introspection and careful definition of the protagonists: the expression of Jasse James/ Brad Pitt is ambiguous and painful, measured and intense, making infer in his eyes a deep existential angst: constant research, perpetually in motion, distrustful and unable to forge human relationships (the size is so high on him as to his throat to many), paranoid and violent, narcissistic universe in which it is confined and in which everyone thinks to safeguard their own safety, just wait the hour of his death. Followed by the commodification of the body in an impressive and realistic ritual, where the corpse raised as a triumph to be photographed and sponsor, will become gods and the gods will be consecrated forever. And where Jasse James was the slave of his fame and glory of his victim, Robert Ford remained prisoner of the fatal gesture, forced to recite it constantly before the crowd of theaters. On the wings of an unforgivable mistake but never not find the strength to expiate their sins. Coward, in fact. If the interpretation of Brad Pitt is outstanding, even more priceless is that Casey / Robert Ford / Affleck, who infuses his character a dose of humanity unsettling to leave you breathless. Work created with impeccable craftsmanship. Single, gigantic, transcendental.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ghost of a Legend,"The Assassination of Jesse James is an elegy of futility, an exquisite scorched earth of a movie. Its themes creep up on you and seep into your bones. A tale of friendship and betrayal, it's also a portrait of rootlessness, of violent men who kill because they don't know what else men are supposed to do, and it has some of the grizzled, melancholic grandeur of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns. Yet there's nothing generic about this film, and nothing melodramatic either; it's closer to lyric realism. Written and directed by Andrew Dominik (Chopper) from a novel by Ron Hansen, the film is an epic poem, a primordial vision. With its dreamlike landscapes and its delicate piano and violin score, The Assassination of Jesse James owes a clear debt to the early films of Terence Malick (Badlands, Days of Heaven), and there are images here that are among the most beautiful and haunting I have ever seen in a movie. Yet the visuals are never made to compensate for a lack of story (as with Malick's later films), and they aren't hypnotic for their own sake. Dominik uses them sparingly, poetically, like a master painter. The film is almost three hours long, but it doesn't meander and it never seems indulgent. Dominik shows a loving attention to detail, a sense of the ebb and flow of his scenes, that is reminiscent of Coppola's first two Godfather films. Assassination isn't quite on that level (its characters aren't that rich or alive, and the story, though poignant, isn't full-blown tragedy), but how many films can be compared to The Godfather? I think it's the finest Western film since McCabe and Mrs. Miller (it has a similar delicate pathos and poetic intensity), and never mind the Oscars: it's easily the best film of 2007.At first, Brad Pitt might seem somewhat lacking in the central role. Pitt is a problematic actor: when he has a role that allows him to get out of himself and let rip (such as Twelve Monkeys or Fight Club), he can be a riveting, electrifying presence; but like Jack Nicholson, he can also be lazy and coast on star appeal. But Pitt's Jesse grows on you. Pitt makes Jesse both menacing and oddly affecting, lost and almost childlike, a figure of pathos. There are moments when Pitt suggests that Jesse is an enigma even to himself.The outstanding performance comes from Casey Affleck, whose creepy Bob Ford is one of the most original characters ever created for the screen. Bob's worship of Jesse prefigures the slavish, faintly psychotic devotion of modern-day celebrity hounds; when Bob smiles, he sets his small teeth on edge and we can feel the hostility lurking inside him, waiting to come out. (It may be buried so deep even he is unaware of it.) In the end, the film is as much about Bob as it is about Jesse (who is never quite real to us), and maybe more so. The amorphous spell of melancholy which the film casts upon us comes as much from our feelings for Bob as for Jesse.It may be facile to say that The Assassination of Jesse James is about lost souls and false heroes; the film is so deftly, instinctively made, so light of touch, that it never pushes its meanings. But they are there, and the exquisite beauty of the film, the ghostlike images, the long silences, the open spaces it allows to exist both inside and between the scenes, combine to create a haunted, otherworldly quality, and a sense of unglimpsed depths. There's a moment, towards the end of the film, when the Ford brothers leave the James house where they are staying (and where Bob will assassinate Jesse), and we are allowed to see the surrounding countryside, and the skeletal town that is growing up in it. The image comes as a shock, because until now the intimacy of the film has kept our focus closely bound to the characters; despite its epic scope, there seemed no need to recreate the greater world in which they exist (or for the film's budget to include such elaborate sets). The image is all the more breathtaking for coming so unexpected, and we may be struck by how much care has gone into creating this world, seemingly for its own sake, independent of the story. At such a late stage, letting us see the fruit of this work seems almost an afterthought. Dominik may be so intensely inside his vision that he is indifferent to whether or not we experience itthe process of creation is enough. He has the focus and immersion of a true alchemist.This is an almost perfect film, yet it's an elusive work, and definitely not for everyone. A lot of people will miss its ineffable, alchemical grace, and mistake it for a rather long, lugubrious Western. Like Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Dominik is not interested in genre conventions, not even enough to subvert them. He's inventing a whole new genre in order for this one work to be exactly what it needs to be. (There's very little action in the film, yet it's full of suspense; and the occasional violence is never what we expect, it's never not disturbing.) At times, the effects Dominik gets are so unique, so inspired, that they seem faintly mysterious. He's a major, major talent. The Assassination of Jesse James is both an epic about the process by which legends are made and a tender, intimate love story between two antagonists so utterly dissimilar they might come from two different worlds. Yet they do have one thing in common: both men are so lost to themselves that at times the film seems almost like a ghost story. In a way, that's what it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"both amazing and annoying, it's a revisionist western with content and style","With maybe the longest title of any film this year, the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, writer/director Andrew Dominik is out to make a real statement on the legacy of outlaw Jesse James and the man who shot him, Robert Ford. Was it murder or almost a kind of suicide? Was Bob Ford a hero, a coward, or just reluctant to get any of the press he originally might have wanted as a youth? Questions are raised legitimately by the filmmaker, and they aren't questions that shouldn't be overlooked. But there's a catch, actually a couple: as Dominik wants to stay truthful to the original source AND make an epic film, he makes a work that tells too much while also showing in a style that veers between the magisterial and the false. It's a subjective thing, to be sure, when looking at the cinematography of a film and how it is effective to the senses, though it could be something more legitimately arguable in looking at if it works for the material itself. These, of course, are the big minuses, which I'll get to in a moment.But one aspect to 'Jesse James' that should be noteworthy all the way is Brad Pitt's performance. He's been a Hollywood star since I can remember, even going back to the mid-90s when he started to break out of character actor parts and into marquee status. Now here's a sort of throwback to the best work he's done as a quasi-chameleon and still with the gravitas of a star. It's a mesmerizing portrayal of a man who is as mysterious as he is deadly, psychotic, loving, paranoid, scary, crazy, affable, and even charming. Just a little facial movement or raise or lowering of the lip indicates so much, and Pitt nails it every time, even in scenes where he almost starts to drag along with the dialog. It is, at the least, worthwhile alone to see the film for him (maybe a little less so for the rest of the cast who, while good at what they do, are there as typical back-up western parts). Affleck is also a good co-star, who has to play mostly in one-note status (mostly pouty, like a nerdy kid on the playground who is scared s***-less but out for blood). But it is, at its best, the Brad Pitt show, which is rare to see as of late in his career.In fact, it's probably Pitt that probably kept me in my seat through most of the film. Dominik's direction and writing are, on the other hand, a mixed bag. He wants to make a sprawling, affecting tome on the nature of a legend and of the effect it has on those around the person (who is, as Ford acknowledges, just a person), while coating it as an auteur. His tactic is to take as much narration possible, and it's literal overkill (no pun intended); we hear some moments when the narrator comments on Robert Ford looking through a closet! What does this add? It turns right from the start, and off and on until especially the last fifteen minutes, into a history lesson as much as a dramatization, which disrupts the intentions of making it a subjective perspective. OK, it's known, James was an icon for Americans as a figure of anti-establishment as part of a kind of establishment (not above the law but not one who should've been killed by a man of no consequence like Bob Ford). But does it need to be pounded over the head?It doesn't help then that cinematographer Roger Deakins adds to the mixed feelings. He captures many wide vistas, tight rooms and dark night exteriors (I did love the train robbing shots) like a true pro. But what are we to make of the constant shots with soft-focus? The explanation I have read is that it's meant to represent the truth that is blurred by legend in the story. That's fine to hear after the fact, but while sitting and watching the movie it just doesn't make sense- it's less poetry and more a consistent form of drab self-indulgence. After seeing No Country for Old Men, where Deakins made, ironically, a better looking western set in 1980, it becomes clear that the directing has to also be taken into account.And this goes without saying that it isn't a bad movie at all. Dominik does explore the themes at work here, with the damnation of betrayal and the fatality of the criminal, plus the side of America as a kind of hidden backdrop of pain and misery and fear of death. It's just that they're explored for too long and without the kind of depth that's really required. If you're looking for a real classic interpretation of the Jesse James/Robert Ford saga, watch I Shot Jesse James by Samuel Fuller. It might not have the aspirations of great art that 'Assassination' has, but in its B-movie way it's almost a masterpiece in examining some of the same material.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Strangely enough, one of the most poetic Westerns to ever be made","The Assassination Of Jesse James is possibly not only one of the finest films to have come out in 2007, but also one of the best westerns ever made. Yes, I agree with some of the views in here that you don't necessarily expect a western to quite turn out to be the way this one does and thats something I found myself immensely attracted to. This film has layers westerns have rarely achieved (the exception being Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven) and you could almost find yourself falling in love with the pain that some of the characters are hoping to come away from, in an almost poetic sort of way.Be it in the characterization (an excellent adaptation I must say) or the way the music, dialogues, and the cinematography have been used to bring to life a book onto the big screen, every single thing falls into place and How! Couldn't quite have been possible without the stellar cast lead by the two protagonists Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). An exuberant portrayal of Jesse by Brad would surely count as one of his best so far (Along with Snatch and Babel) and a brilliantly effortless debut by the younger brother of an almost spent force (almost, if it wasn't for Gone Baby Gone) - Casey Affleck are without a doubt the greatest highlights of this film. Together as well as individually their's is a performance that has the power of almost bringing tears to your eyes and a heaviness into your heart you may have seldom felt before. Kudos to the director Andrew Dominik for bringing onto the cinematic world a brilliant gentlemen for whom the word 'sink' could only be in reference to a role, with his teeth thrown in.Do yourselves a favour folks, watch the Assassination of Jesse James today, and wait even after 'the moment' is over for another 20-30 odd minutes of drama so riveting, you could hardly blame yourselves for believing that the title was a dead giveaway.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"PLEASE, cut a long story short!","Having read all those articles regarding the god-like performance of Pitt and Affleck, and having slept last night to the brilliant OST by Nick Cave, I must say I exited the theater with a sour taste in my mouth. It could be those bad quality Nachos, but most likely it was the feeling that the movie I had just watched, missed a great chance of becoming one of my all-time favorites...I don't want to spoil an already spoiled (due to the title) movie, so I will be as abstract as possible.First things first, the acting of the two protagonists is indeed brilliant. Jesse's eyes reveal a marvelous mix of lunacy, cruelty, tenderness and desperation, in a way only really great actors can deliver. Bob Ford, on the other hand, has everything a made-to-be-hated character must have. The creepy look in his eyes and the trembling voice, both demonstrating his awe and fear of Jesse at the beginning of the film, give way to a vile stare and determined outbreaks as the film progresses... Just brilliant!The photography and music of the film also live up to the fuzz about the movie. Especially the score, by the hand of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is as lyrical and sad as it can be, almost unfit for a Western. A true requiem for a great man!So, what is it that disappointed me? At first, it was the feeling that the director focused on the wrong details. I should be cautious with this criticism, since I have not read the book, but I really wanted to see more of Jesse's life, what civilians thought of him during his ""career"" etc, and less of the trivial stuff about his men's lives. Jesse James is the star here, not Ed Miller!The second -and most important- drawback of this movie, is its length. There is no polite way to say it.. I got bored! And for a movie with such great acting to make someone bored, it must be REALLY slow! And it is! More than I could imagine! I am not against long films. I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings (even wanted more), I loved A Clockwork Orange, I liked Braveheart... But in those cases, the plot unrolling was constant during the whole length of the movie. In Jesse's case, it's not. Sunsets are great, snowy fields are nice, and long blank stares have their importance. But... This movie should last one and a half hour, to a maximum of two. Not more. That would be ideal, the plot would advance with a steady pace and people would appreciate a nice scenery, instead of saying ""ah, nice, here's my chance to go out for a cigarette"" (I actually heard that one!).My 7/10 is mostly due to the acting, music and photography.

(Train emerging from darkness, light illuminating masked figures in the woods, Deakin's spell casted on every frame.) Brad Pitt is as menacing as Daniel Plainview, his presence is a continuous jump scare, adjusts his mask like a true fashion model, every close up of him is an ad for Prada or some other capitalist thing, I swear, even the wind dares not blow his direction.

Bang Bang,"Very cool, very stylish, a new approach towards the western cowboy movie welcomed back. Those slow train coming scenes just before the symbolically ghostlike gang hop on to what is going to be their last train robbery together by night, those scenes are so marvelously shot and definitely going to remain engrained in my mind as top classic in cinema. Brad Pitt pulls off the role of Jesse James very convincingly predictably and so does the rest of the cast do a great job to give this film an all round quality. I love the color and I love how all throughout the film there is this echoing poetry. The story itself, a sad one, at least here were we seem to be witnessing what appears to be the end of a long Saga between the members of the Jesse James gang. Everybody seems to be splitting. I think Jesse James actually lets Robert Ford hand on out of a sense of nostalgia, due to Ford's youthful thirst for adventure, excitement, all things expiring in Jesse himself. The times they are changing. The Assassination itself does indeed recall those last scenes in the movie ""Road to Perdition"", the likes of which I think are brilliant to say the least, they are sublime. Then Nick Cave just had to butt in there with the famous song, did he not? This is a great movie, I definitely recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Maybe its because I love Altman's, McCabe and Mrs Miller","Clearly, I am in something of a minority, but I just didn't get into this meandering and somewhat pretentious would be epic. Brad Pitt is fine, of course, but because he underplays his role, even he cannot raise this above the level of an overlong TV documentary. Maybe its because I love Altman's, McCabe and Mrs Miller, so that I fail to find this in any way at all well shot. True there are one of two rather fetching shots, I recall a cornfield, an amazing sky and the oncoming train, but so there should be in a film this long! The film does eventually seem to finish, only to start up again and give us another half hour with Robert Ford making the most of the post James years. Little action or violence and lots of very ordinary dialogue.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent movie-one of the best of the decade,"Can Hugh Ross be my Best Supporting Actor of 2007 for his narration of The Assassinatino of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford? I loved his narration. So perfectly spoken and rich. Best movie I saw from 2007. Better than There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men. The acting, cinematography, direction. It's intoxicating leaves you speechless and amazed. Casey Affleck is excellent and so is Brad Pitt. The entire cast is strong. The ending when Robert Ford is doing the show about how he killed James is really haunting. His pleasure in reliving the killing and how it brought him fame is where Affleck really excels. The makeup when he is on stage is also really good. A+.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good fundament that struggles with vapid realization,"It's a quite good movie, that tries to find it's own sight on the case of Jesse James; and furthermore restyling cowboy aesthetics. Thus it uses the usual stylistic devices, rearranging them in a lyrical manner.But the film has several deficits. It often stays flat and the short narrators parenthesis back up what they shouldn't: unreflectedness. Regarding the length of the film it narrows the pleasure and brakes the proceed too much. Nethertheless it fulfills its purpose by giving additional info's and insight views. - Not a difficulty but a lag of the movie is that despite actors doing a solid job they could have been used much better.Overall it's a good movie. Because of its lenght and its further not mentionable but many little lags, it is unfortunately not worth seeing it twice.

Leaves you feeling empty.,"This movie would seem to have everything going for it; a top cast that delivers uniformly fine acting, excellent writing and direction, all combined with stunning cinematography. So, why doesn't it work? That is the question I've been asking myself ever since the first viewing. ( A second look proved no more enlightening. ) It can't be the slow pace, as I have seen many films paced at least as leisurely as this one - ( ""Eyes Wide Shut"" springs to mind ) - that I have found spellbinding. The music doesn't help. Slow and lugubrious, it helps to create an oppressive atmosphere that never lets up. No, I believe the answer lies somewhere in the combination of these two elements; what I call the Ken Burns factor.Simply put, ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" - fine as it is on many levels - is an ultimately depressing experience. Add to the mix the fact that Casey Affleck mumbles much of the time and key lines of dialogue are often unintelligible, and you are left with a major disappointment.",,Anonymous,Biography
Simply put: Beautiful in every way.,"The very first thing I noticed at the beginning of the film was the music by Nick Cave. I think he's found a good niche for his music composing for films. His last project, ""The Proposition,"" while certainly different and a little more strange, was still haunting and gorgeous. Here in this film it sounded like Thomas Newman. In fact when I first saw the preview I could have sworn it was. A testament, I think, to the brilliance of his work.The next thing I noticed was the wonderful, dark, and crisp cinematography. The brown grass and black suits and red blood popped off of the screen. The train robbery scene truly did haunt the rest of the film. The lighting and angles movements were dramatic and perfect.I was surprised at Oscar season when Brad Pitt hardly got any attention at all. Maybe it was because of the subtleness of his performance, maybe it's the apparent ease at which he takes on a roll, with the seeming non-chalance he has with his gestures. Regardless, this performance like a few of his others was ambitious and well-done.Casey Affleck, in his break-out role, gave a performance that gave me the feeling that he was extremely uncomfortable in his own skin. And his boyish voice added to the nervousness I felt every time he appeared on screen. His nomination was well-deserved.I've read a lot of comments, here and in other places, about the length of the film. I honestly didn't notice. I was that involved. The editing and performances and the story all contributed to a riveting film. I loved every minute of it.I can't wait to see Andrew Dominik's next film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Glowing Jewel in a Sea of Cinematic Darkness...,"The Assassination of Jesse James was very well produced and executed but the overlaying narration by Hugh Ross of the masterfully written prose of Ron Hansen makes watching the movie a truly unique experience.The movie adapted to screen and directed by Andrew Dominik stands out in several aspects. From the wonderfully interwoven soundtrack to the magnificently picturesque cinematography to the superbly method performances by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck (who turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me). It is a slow moving film but you barely notice the time passing by when you become entranced in the story, that is, a story of the more genuine and believable type of the American ""West"" and the infamous American outlaw gangs. This movie does little to romanticize the genre (not typical of Westerns - although I wouldn't even call it a ""Western"") but, rather, presents a much more human side to the gun-slinging, horse-riding, train-robbing part of our country's history.In today's big-business ""fast-food era"" Hollywood, when all that can satisfy the appetite of the masses is 20 scenes per second special effects one after the other, you can't help but notice an eroding taste for culture and cinematic delicacy. That is why it is so refreshing that a movie like this comes along every once in a while, through which we realize that all is not lost.As of recently, I would put this movie in a category with three other movies that share this special quality of genuineness. Three glowing jewels in a sea of cinematic darkness: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; The Namesake; and Into the Wild.Bon Appetit!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"We may know how it ends, but perhaps the biggest achievement of the piece is the manner in which director Dominik makes us forget how it does with a stunning study.","There is an underlying and quite eerie sense of substance in Andrew Dominik's 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, the kind that is linked to the fact it is a study of an individual's obsession with a celebrity; a lust to be like a certain other, no matter how infamous or hated they may be. Here is a film with a central idea; a central study that is executed wonderfully well, with a slow burning and alluring approach which compliments the slow and steady delving into obsession. Simply put, it's great to look at; wonderful to watch and by the end, rather frightening.The film, whose central study is got across in one brilliant scene, looks at what is an unhealthy fondness of someone who has got to a relative pinnacle of a career by way of murder; robbery and bullying. In what might be the film's best scene, we encounter the outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) in a bath tub – at his most raw, at his most vulnerable and at his most revealing. At the entrance to the bathroom stands the proclaimed 'coward', Robert Ford (Affleck), and they exchange words before James poses him the question around which the study revolves: ""Do you want to be like me, or actually BE me?"" Here is an exchange in which James, in his rawest of forms, challenges Ford's ideologies to do with an unnatural fondness and makes us aware, that he himself is aware, that he might carry a certain aura about him.The film documents James from 1881 to 1882, while incorporating any feats, robberies and murders that unfolded at that time on a twin parallel with Ford's gradual coming to terms with the fact this idolisation exists within him. The entire piece is narrated by a certain Hugh Ross, adding an interesting ingredient on top of an already interesting study. The inclusion of a narrator initially felt, at least to me, unwarranted or perhaps un-needed. Whatever tale or recalling of events that needed to play out didn't necessarily strike me as the sort that required narration from an agent uninvolved. But I think the inclusion is merited when you link it to the overall picture; that fact the film might be seen as a lecture, or a warning of sorts, of this sort of intrigue and obsession with violence in the media and aspiration to become someone, or someone of similar ilk, whom isn't a particularly good role model.But that's not to say the film talks down to us. It very cleverly distances us from unfolding the film from either of one of the two lead's points of view. We see this from a third person perspective; someone not directly involved in the text which feeds off two people, one of which is a hardened and rather nasty outlaw while the other is a young man whom comes complete with stalker-like tendencies and an unnatural fondness for a national villain. During one scene set around a dinner table in Ford's home, James sits amidst the rest of the family as tensions flair. But the film additionally seems to like the notion that Jesse James might act as an alter-ego to the rest of Ford's family, as well as the American Dream in general. He sits there, almost as some sort of a visualisation of an amoral manner in which to garner attention, money, fame and, ultimately, admirers. This, twinned with whatever conflict going on between James and Ford, adds a certain extra layer of antagonism between James and the Fords.As the film nears its conclusion and the inevitable nears, certain flashbacks see Jesse refer to himself in the third person sense as some kind of overwhelming anxiety and an aspect of suicidal ideation begins to overcome him. We are given his point of view, a rarity up to this point as the film provides us with a blurred and wide angled lens as he stares out of a window giving off a very uncanny sense of dread and a delicate mindset coming close to crumbling down. The film finishes what it starts in a true and engaging manner. The epilogue and Ford's supposedly newfound celebrity status following the shooting of James brings him nothing but misery, and he never, ever – as the voice over states, comes anywhere near replicating the aura nor fame James had when he was at his peak of 'celebrity' status. What was an unhealthy obsession, quickly turned into a realisation and then into an unhealthy groove of trivialisation and guilt. Ford gave himself the big build up, latched onto the wrong beliefs and paid for it, and this film is an impressive documentation of that process.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A New Western Classic,"21 October 2007. What LOST IN TRANSLATION did for Japanese culture, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY COWARD ROBERT FORD does for the Western. In one of the best visceral presentations of the West, its feel, its depiction of bare, spartan rooms, the ambiance sounds of rustling wind and creaky floors, this movie reels with authenticity, a rawness, grittiness even to how shooting scenes are played out. People die harshly. Men talk trash, like real men talk about women sometimes. There are amazing scenes of silent acting that communicate brilliant the mood, the feelings, the senses of the scene. Both Brad Pitt and Casey Afflect easily award nominations bring to the screen a real subtle and intimate, disquieting, and complex characters, . This perhaps overly long, sometimes difficult to follow where even eventually even Sam Sheppard's character just seems to disappear, remains nevertheless an intimate epic movie brings both a fantastic cinematography to the audience with the color, lighting, the shots of both bright sunshine and complete darkness of the nights of the old West. The narrative-voice over is riveting in its also documentary style presentation that adds authenticity to the acting on the screen, a richness and depth of really experiencing each scene.

Slow and sombre,"Released back on 2007 this film features colour cinemaphotography and a widescreen format. It uses a lot of modern filmmaking techniques, especially in the first half. I found the narration a bit unnecessary, it's well acted, costumes tend to be clean and nice looking, the film avoids bold bright primary colours, there's lots of whites and greys and browns instead. The range of filmmaking locations includes lots of forest, it's a film with a lot of outdoor scenes as you'd expect in this genera. The dialogue uses a lot of 19th century English, it has a strange theatrical style to it at times, with Pitt playing this larger than life character, the violence is nasty and unpleasant when shown, the music is nice, I didn't like the weird dream like look of some scenes or Jeremey Renner's awful haircut. The female characters are just kind of there and don't really say or do anything, the pacing is very slow and the story starts to drift a bit at times. I think Open Range had a more solid structure though this film probably has more ideas. I praise the film for it's costumes, makeup, art design and music, at times though it gets a bit confusing, Casey Affleck is really good and does a lot of acting with just his face and eyes and posture. At times Pitt plays an almost unhinged and very unlikeable character but we see over time how memories fade and the idea of celebrity takes hold. The final part of the film in many ways is the most interesting and important. It also explores our own morbid curiosity with stories and characters like these. All in all not perfect but it has some interesting ideas and some parts are very well done. You can't deny the talent involved in making this film, I just don't know if all it worked.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
So Many Things You Can Say About This Film!,"Do you notice how long many of the reviews are in here about this movie? That's because there is so much one could say. This is an unusual movie, especially for a modern-day-filmed western.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the ""stars"" of this movie but the biggest star to me was Roger Deakins, the man who photographed this film. Wow, this is beautiful! It's so stunning to look at in so many spots that there were many times I was more involved in the visuals than the story. In that sense, it reminded me of the marvelously-photographed films of Terrence Malick. Kudos to Andrew Dominik for a similar style directorial performance here.Regarding the story, here's a warning to those who are expecting the normal western fare and want to see the usual amount of gun battles and related action scenes. This film is 2 hour and 40 minutes and there are not many ""action"" scenes. If you are hoping to see another ""3:10 To Yuma"" re-make, you will be very disappointed. This story is slow. It's a character study of Jesse James and the man who killed him, Robert Ford.That said, I still found it a memorable film. The photography, the great acting and the uniqueness of the story were all good enough to keep me interested throughout. For once, I was glad to see James portrayed more realistically. Despite what you've seen on film in the past, this man was not a hero, folks. Sure he was a likable guy at times, and a nice father at times, too, but he was a thief and, much worse, a cold-blooded killer. You see that in this film.I have to say I can't remember a film I've seen in recent years in which the two lead characters (James and R. Ford) were so strange and unpredictable. For that, I have to really compliment the work of Pitt and Affleck. They were amazing and kept me guessing throughout the movie. They played very complex people.Another facet that I found unusual were the numerous scenes in which a person's eyes told the story better than any dialog could. The tension in this drama was almost unbearable in many instances. Except for ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" I can't recall a film with so many tense scenes with long pauses depicting shots of people's eyes relaying their either their fears or suspicions.Pitt, as ""Jesse James,"" does a fantastic job in this department. He made us go inside his James' brain, assuming we were knowing what he's thinking about Robert Ford, and wondering what he would say or do next. James is shown in this film to be a twisted and (justifiably) paranoid criminal who doesn't trust anyone. For example, he's constantly moving his family.On the other side of the coin, you have the Ford brothers and other members of James' gang who are constantly terrified of their boss, knowing he could snap and shoot them any minute. The terrified looks in their eyes were, to me, frightening to watch. This movie is filled with scenes depicting jittery people. Affleck, as ""Robert Ford,"" the man with the nervous smile, and stuttering-like speech, was one of the strangest characters I've seen on film. Sam Rockwell, as Ford's brother, ""Charley,"" has a big role in this movie, too, and doesn't really get the billing he should. I thought he was right up there with Pitt and Affleck.I might be in the minority with this opinion, but I found the best part of the film to be the last 20 minutes, depicting how America reacted to the killing of Jesse James and what happened to the Ford brothers. All that was fascinating to me.Overall, once I realized this wasn't a ""shoot-em-up"" western, and just sat back and appreciated the storytelling, wonderful visuals, low-key narration, fabulous sets, scenery and acting....I ended up being very impressed. So, a key is to know what to expect before you see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A harrowing story about fear, betrayal and hubris...","Many elements of this film work well. There are some quality performances, most notably from Casey Affleck who is remarkably good as Robert Ford. Perhaps the best performance I've ever seen from him. Lovely sweeping visual imagery from Roger Deakins dazzles on screen and the idea is mostly engaging. Beautiful score too. That said, it takes a pretty special movie to justify a 160 minute running time. This wasn't quite good enough to do so in my view. The denouement trudges on for too long, and the voice over was excruciating to listen to by the end. Whilst this film is enjoyable, and quite moving, some elements do fail to crystallise, particularly the more periphery characters who felt lacking in substance - Zee James (Jesse's wife) felt like a squandered opportunity for example. Whoever decided the voiceover was a great idea should be fired. Less would've been tolerable, but it really does drone on and on. In my experience, it's a rare for a voiceover to work really well in a 21st century film, unless it is being used ironically. One couldn't help wondering whether it was used so heavily to cover up failings that emerged in postproduction. Good crack either way.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Too Long And Too Muddled, But Great Characters","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a perplexing film in scope, subject, and style.The first thing that hits most people is the title. I mean, how long does a film's title have to be? Although I understand WHY they settled on it, I still feel that alternatives must've been out there.The next is the length of the movie itself. At over 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a behemoth in terms of size. I understand, too, that the original uncut version was a bit over 4 hours. Four hours! Thank goodness they cut it down. But I feel more cuts were needed and a better direction taken with the movie as a whole.The biggest issue I have is that the entire production seemed to have difficulties deciding on who the main character was. Was it Robert Ford (Casey Affleck, GONE BABY GONE)? Or was it Jesse James (Brad Pitt, BABEL)? You can, on occasion, have multiple main characters, but with this film the muddling of who was doing what to who and why got seriously confusing. I attributed this to the fact that half the time we were focused on Jesse and the other half on Robert. The problems this caused was a lack of consistent story flow and a lengthy film that could've easily held more interest if it would've focused on either one character or the other. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the film start near Jesse James' assassination and then lead us off on the life of Robert Ford afterward. But that portion of Ford's life is quickly skimmed over and we never get the true feeling for what he went through after being labeled ""the coward who shot Jesse James in the back."" I also have to comment on the repetitive use of time-lapse photography during scenes meant to show the passage of time. The constant showing of clouds skidding rapidly across the sky got a bit tiring; time after time after time after time.Regardless of title and movie length, and the lack of a consistent character, the acting was pretty much perfect. Brad Pitt played the confused, dangerous, paranoid, and nearly psychotic Jesse James exceptionally well. And Casey Affleck as the disenchanted Jesse James fan-boy came across as creepy and not-just-a-bit pathetic.Although this film received plenty of praise (including two Oscar nominations), I found it to be slow and the first hour confusing with regards to understanding which character was doing what and why.But the acting saved it for me. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this flick for those who are ready to head off to bed (as this might put them to sleep before bedtime), I would suggest it as a good character study of the times surrounding the life of Jesse James and the poor sap who shot him.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A wasted opportunity,"1. The film has a good, quite authentic look to it - at least as far as props, costumes, sets, etc. The sound of the old, wood-frame houses was right on. The landscapes are obviously not where they are supposed to be, but that follows an old tradition in Westerns. Canadian locations have become very identifiable & are obviously not Missouri nor any adjoining states.2. Brad Pitt made a good Jesse James. I know Jesse's photos quite well & was able to forget them. Mr. Pitt did his best to be enigmatic - I don't know if that was intentional in his portrayal of Jesse or simply because he didn't know how else he could carry on through this script.3. The rest of the cast did as well as they could. Sam Shepherd seemed a bit old for Frank James, but then I always thought that Frank looked old for his age in the few photos that exist.4. Now for the bad part - it is as slow moving as molasses in winter.5. Almost every film that has extensive voice-over explanations has had post-production problems. When it's all been put together, they've found that the explanations are needed, because the film had become a muddle.Having been a professional genealogist who has researched Jesse Woodson James & family & who has worked with celebrities, I understand what they were trying to do with this. In an oblique way they were using Bob Ford as ""stalker"" ... as well as exploring Jesse's emotional-mental issues (which included drug use) & the various family connections that that are often neglected. It is rare that any film for popular consumption has mentioned the murder of Jesse's favorite cousin, Woodson Hite, by the Fords. It also often goes unmentioned that there was a lot of blood relationship amongst these various outlaw clans. Therefore, there were family issues, as well as the historical background that is more commonly known.I commend them for the attempt, but such an exploration was perhaps better left to print. Despite knowing most of the story already, I found it almost impossible to follow. Perhaps, the problem was that it simply could not retain my interest enough to follow it. Sometimes, a work that is very literary, with lots of explanation & internal action, but little real physical action, can be impossible to transpose to film. I suspect that is what happened.I really wanted to like this film, but sad to say, I didn't. Perhaps one day a mini-series will do justice to the complexity of these people & their era & will still manage to be entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautifully filmed and haunting film that is classy, deliberate and engaging","Robert Ford is an unremarkable and unmemorable young man who has long held a fascination with the outlaw Jesse James. When his attempts to join the James gang are rejected, Ford persists and is taken in by Jesse  perhaps because the latter welcomes the non-threatening adoration of the former. However as time goes on two things occur within both men  Ford becomes disillusioned and less in awe of Jesse, while Jesse becomes suspicious of his gang members and fearful of betrayal.It is best to get the common complaint out of the way and acknowledge that, in some vocabularies, this film is ""slow"" but this is not the same as me agreeing with those that label it such. Rather I prefer to see it as ""deliberate"" or ""gradual"" because these describe the quality of pace in the same way but doesn't suggest that it is a detrimental or negative thing. So the film does move with a patient pace that is in no rush to go anywhere quickly. But yet it manages to engage and hold the attention with surprising ease. The reason is the quality in the tale  the narrative, the characters and the themes all come together to produce a film of quiet interest.I am not doing it justice in my description but the main story, taken at face value is an engaging story of the later life and fate of Jesse James, in particular his interactions with Robert Ford. It is a fascinating portrayal mainly because of the strength of the characters more than the specifics of the plot. James is as charming as he is violent and it this uneasy balance that makes him engaging. Meanwhile Ford goes from being starry-eyed to being bitter; both men are interesting individually and together. As many have said, the modern subject of fame is run through the film. The wonderful title alludes to it as it presents the story in the headline of spin (history may side with the celebrity against the ""coward"" but we can see that the title is not necessarily true). Mostly it is in the background but in retrospect it is more important than I first thought  it just took the final twenty minutes to bring it all into focus for me in regards significance.Bringing the best from the characters are a couple of great performances, supported by good performances. The celebrity undercurrent very much suits the casting of Pitt but it is not just this that he brings to the role. Rather his performance is really impressive, mixing his usual charisma and charm with a convincing undercurrent of menace. Affleck was more of a surprise to me because he does come out with a nicely understated and powerful character that rightly never gets close to holding a scene in the way Pitt's James has to, but does all his work in smaller ways. The support has good work from Parker, Rockwell, Shepard and others. Dominik directs the camera and the cast with a steady and understanding hand but for me the real star is Roger Deakin, who's main misfortune appears to have been having two great products in the same Oscars season  essentially splitting his votes.The cinematography is breath-taking. The most obvious touches of style get the mentions of course, but across the whole film it looks great, with attention paid to the stark colours, strong use of lighting and focal points within the shots. Like everyone else though it is the wonderfully creative visual moments that make the film and stick with the viewer. The striking use of light and darkness in the early train robbery is one but the general design of the narrator-led sequences with clever use of focus, framing and colour. It is a breath-taking work and although I cannot comment on its worthiness versus ""There Will Be Blood"" (I have not yet seen it), it is a triumph. It is rare that I would watch a film again just for the beauty of it, but this is one of those films that could have frames and sequences hung in a gallery.Like its title this film is longer than the norm, but it is also better than the norm as well. The pace is slow, but not in a way that is dull but rather a way that is patience and rewarding. The story and characters hold the attention easily and the thematic comment on fame only serves to add. Topping off the performances and direction is a wonderful piece of work from the cinematographer that greatly adds to the sense of importance of the film by making each scene a visual beauty that is a joy to watch. I get that it will not be to everyone's tastes but it deserves to be seen anyway  but moaning that it doesn't have the pace of Young Guns says more about you than the film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Artistic western,"This is one of the films that isn't for everyone because it's a slow and yet realistic film, with a lot more talking and drama than action. It just very beautiful to watch though and the realistic approach is done very well. Some audience might be turned off by this film because for a movie about one of the most famous outlaw, there is hardly any action in it or robberies. The film is about the last days of Jesse James before his assassination and everything from the acting to the cinematography is done very well. Brad Pitt does what he does best and his acting is top notch, he was excellent in portraying Jesse James in a complex and yet charismatic manner. Casey Affleck was perfect for this role in portraying Robert Ford, his acting was very believable when trying to act all annoying and cowardly. If your one of those types that don't care for stuff blowing up every minute or constant action, you might enjoy this film. It's artistic western with great acting and amazing cinematography, showing the ending of Jesse James's career. With that said, this film is not for everyone. Most teens will probably be bored by this movie, I personally liked this film enough to give it a 8/10.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pitt and Affleck's acting pulls this through the second act dip,"In 1881 Jesse James (Pitt) was an outlaw. He was known to steal and murder. In 1881 he took part in his final train robbery, with his brother Frank (Shepard) and a new crew of his, after the death or arrest of his previous crew members. One of these new members is Charlie Ford (Sam Rockwell). Charlie's brother is Robert Ford (Affleck), a twenty year old in complete awe of Jesse James, being able to cite his stories and his trivia off the top of his head. He asks Jesse to join his gang and when Jesse accepts he does all he can to prove his worth, so much so that after the robbery Jesse asks Robert to stick around with him whilst the other members scatter across the country. Jesse seems to like the attention Robert puts on him. It makes him feel celebrity like. However after a while Robert's infatuation becomes too much and Jesse begins to wander about his new friend. He sends him off to join his brothers as the star struck Ford becomes too much.Over the next few months the Ford brothers live at home with two other gang members who are constantly at each other's throats. So much so that one day it ends in one of their deaths. Meanwhile Jesse scales the country, killing those who are likely to betray him. He finally catches back up with the Ford brothers and asks them to accompany him on a bank heist. They set off to Jesse James house, for refuge until the robbery will take place, where Jesse's brutality, unpredictability and intimidation shine through, turning Ford from one time stalker to a potential killer. Ford's new emotions toward Jesse and a huge reward prize over his head, leave Robert Ford only one option. An option he must take before it is too late.You may think I have given away too much there, but if you read the title you will realise I have not. We all know that the story is about Jesse James murder, and how he was betrayed by one of his most faithful partners, Robert Ford. This just shows you how and why it happened. You may already know if you have researched into this outlaw but if you don't this film is the exact story of his death, including the aftermath where Ford is labelled the coward.The film is really brought to life by the performances. There are other good things about it, but the best aspect is the acting talent. For starters Brad Pitt is fantastic. He plays James with a sense of mystery and fear. The look in his eyes allows you to register what he is thinking without giving too much away. He also starts off as charming and ends up as a man you hate. The performance alone does all of this, even the dignity shown in his death when he either realises that his time is up, or he is testing Robert Ford's bravery. The entire performance is one that shows us so much. One of Pitt's best to date. Sam Rockwell is also very good as the slightly brain-less Charlie Ford. His reactions when lying are realistic, and they make us feel as if he really is hiding something. Jeremy Renner also pops up in a small role and is also very good, except from when he is obviously wearing a fake beard. The surprise breakthrough however comes from Casey Affleck who seems every bit Robert Ford. He begins timid, stuttering through his lines, in awe of Jesse, and as the film continues you can physically see him hide deeper inside himself before plucking up the courage to commit his deed. The events shown after the death are some of Affleck's best work, where he expects applause for shooting his gang leader but is surprised to see himself branded a coward. His slide back into his cave is brilliantly shown by Affleck. He is a great acting talent and here he really shows it. The cinematography is also beautiful showing us some lovely shots in wide open lands to show how isolated these characters really are.The problem with the film then lies in the running time and the dire middle sector. The opening thirty minutes and the final forty five are great but the middle seventy minutes become dull. Too much time is spent away from the two leads, following characters that are not as integral to the plot. Sure they all have reasons for being there but we spend too much time concentrating on them when we really want to see the two leads. During the entire middle sector Pitt and Affleck hardly share a scene and they are the two you are really there to see.The acting of this film pulls it through the middle slump, and I only think that if the film was cut slightly it could have been better. The bookends of the film are riveting but the middle becomes boring and the film becomes a drag, which is a shame considering the positives within this film. People seem to slate Pitt's acting talents and I advise them to all watch this to see how good he actually is. They will also be pleasantly surprised to see a man with the surname Affleck actually can act.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly haunting and gorgeous cinema,Very slow paced which is perfectly suited to its mood and story. Intensely involving with tremendous cinematography. One of the very best films. A true work of art obviously born of passion. I admire the courage and determination of the film-makers to persevere with such a project that obviously defies box-office formulas and would have difficulty making a profit. Looking forward to more by this director. It must be extremely challenging to put in the energy required to push a project such as this one through the many hurdles imposed by the movie industry but I certainly hope that great film-makers continue following this example. Highly recommended to anyone with the patience and interest in experiencing original and challenging (not in ideas for in form) cinema.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
SLOW.,"A good film with great acting, Pitt, Affleck and Rockwell are all great. Overall though kind of long and a little slow for me, but is still worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vastly Underrated,"Pitt is pitch-perfect as the larger than life Jesse James, but is out-shined by Casey Affleck in his courageous, un-nerving performance of Robert Ford. Affleck more than deserved his Academy Award nomination, and I believe he would have won if the film had been more successful. I can only surmise that those disappointed with this film expected an action-oriented shoot'em up Western, and not a brooding character piece. The films slow pace may bore some viewers, but I enjoyed it. I compare it to a cross between a Terrence Malick film and Deadwood. The film doesn't glorify the west, instead it shows it as dirty and brutal. This is definitely one of Pitt's top performances. For those interested, I also recommend Bruce Springsteen's version of the classic song (title of the film).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Death Becomes Him,"Rather grim and joyless tale from writer / director Andrew Dominik, starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. There are powerful performances from the leads and a talented cast of players, but the real star is Roger Deakins' cinematography, and it is just as well that the film looks and sounds beautiful, because there is little to admire in any of the characters, despite what are clearly skilled performances. No doubt, this can be considered a suitably accurate portrayal, but does it make for rewarding viewing and a positive audience reaction? Setting aside the ability of Hollywood to repeatedly cast gangsters as colourful rogues, or at best, misunderstood or conflicted, rather than the killers and thieves that they are, there is still no-one here to root for, so when this or that character meets his end from time to time, don't be surprised to feel little but an abstract curiosity about the mechanics.As the film rolls on into another hour, even Mr. Deakins' beautiful pictures lose their ability to redeem the unrelieved uniformity of the pacing, and when there is an injection of tension at the promised conclusion, the discovery that this was not the end, but only an end was, for me, a disappointment. It is easy to admire style, but for true enjoyment, there must be substance, conflict, emotion. Where these are attempted by this story, it usually misses the target, and the surfeit of moodiness and brooding disquiet becomes wearing after a while.The script is unremarkable, and few of the cast are given much to do beyond spitting out some western stereotypes in a studied drawl. In the end, it seems reasonable that we take from the piece that the old west was a cruel and dangerous place, with more than its fare share of cruel, dangerous and greedy individuals, unwilling to make their way in the world through honest toil, and unwilling to respect the lives and property of others, but watching them kill each other for 160 minutes, no matter how beautifully filmed, is not an edifying experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This isn't your Father's type of Western, and that's a Good Thing!","You might think the title of the movie spoils the entire ride with its spoil heavy title, well I'm here to tell you you'd be dead wrong. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen in a very long time. Not because the story is puzzling or complex, but rather because it gives us a different perspective than one might think based off the title. This is not a movie about Jesse James, instead, it is a drama that explores Robert Ford's relationship with Jesse before the assassination and the fallout that comes from it.One thing is for certain, this isn't your fathers type of western. There are no wild shootouts, horse chases, elaborate bank robberies, or even a hero for that matter. This is a tale of one character's rise to infamy through another character's downfall. Put bluntly, the movie is more of an epilogue than anything else. The movie is primarily told from Robert Ford's perspective which only makes things that much more poignant about the entire situation. We see the impact meeting the real Jesse James has on him and how his ideas of him become warped over time and what that means for the fate of both men. From Robert idolizing Jesse, to him thinking he is 'just a human being'.It's not easy to see who is a hero and who isn't, those lines are intentionally blurred. The beginning of the film clearly makes the case for Robert Ford being an over the top obsessive fan of Jesse James, which points him out to be the 'bad guy' as the title suggests. But as time goes by the director moves away from this notion and starts to build up the idea that Robert Ford as acting not out of pure cowardice, but perhaps out of self-defense, or so Jesse will have him believe. It's this vague line that makes the movie so intriguing, who truly was playing who? But at the same time, there is also the idea of self-promotion at play. This is an opportunity for Robert to achieve the stardom he has always wanted. Finally, Robert Ford has been given his chance at fame, but certainly not the type of fame he was looking for.The beauty comes at the end of the film when we are shown the final years of Robert's life now having to live with the fateful decision. He is given fame but at the cost of torment and public ridicule for killing a beloved figure. Interesting enough is that we don't truly see what the public thinks of Jesse James till he is gone. He is seen as a celebrity by many, but the entire movie leading up to this point keeps this aspect hidden from the viewer. As if Robert Ford himself simply believed he could replace the man himself, simply take his fame and make it his own and no one would know. It's beautifully structured so that as the movie progresses you start to actually sympathize with Robert more and more right up to the bitter end. Yes, he may have been a creepy sociopath to begin with but as his suffering unfolds before our eyes it's hard not to pity the man. The brilliance truly stems from focusing on Robert over Jesse.And as for the soundtrack, it's spectacular and more importantly moving. It helps paint the 'wild west' as a slow moving and sorrowful place, where heroes are born but also where they will eventually die. This score mixed with the stunning cinematography, which at times obscures the image, create a perfect dreamlike tone (as if the whole movie is some sort of fantasy of Roberts').I can easily say this is one of my favorite western movies ever made. It's subtle, beautiful, and moving. And as I said above, the movie is rather slow (especially the first half) but the ending is more than rewarding. It leaves you emotionally conflicted, feeling sorrow for the so-called 'coward' of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A strange obsessive film,"I watched this film on DVD while lying in bed late at night - I mention this as it might have influenced how I feel about it. I found the film to have an obsessive, haunting, but authentic quality about it.Regardless of personal performances I felt that overall the film gave a very good look at a certain period in American history. Unlike films like ""Young Guns"" very little is glamorized here. People are not thrown back by gunfire - they drop from the trauma - and gunfights are a haphazard affair. All that was much like what ""The West"" was like, rather than how it was portrayed in novels and films. The length of the film, with its long conversation driven sequences with little background music also emphasize the period nature of the topic. Before radio, records and TV, folk found slower ways to pass the time.The ""facts"" of the story are revealed in the title and ""known"" to many. But this film deals with the interior emotional landscape of the main characters rather than a straight forward plot driven set of scenes that we might expect. For some that will made it tedious to watch, but I found that I couldn't tear myself away from watching it - perhaps a bit like watching a car crash in slow motion - you know what's coming but have to watch anyway.I also found the narration to be a peculiar, but effective addition. The narrator has to represent the author of the original book that the film's based on, because more than once he describes things that no character in the film would know. And yet this too helps set the scene in a manner counter to the usual, and I like that.An enjoyable watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kill HIm Already,"I'm all for an oater. Huge fan of John Wayne, John Ford, Gary Cooper. And I'm all for a movie on Jesse James. I've got family from Missouri and relatives inappropriately named for him during the reconstruction.But movie gods, how long are we expected to watch one mentally unstable man wander around tormenting half wits? Here's how I think it's supposed to work: the movie is shorter than the book, and, when it comes to biographies and histories, the book is shorter than the actual event itself. And, since it's live action (this is the most important thing), we're supposed to be entertained. Compared to this, Lawrence of Arabia was a stroll, and Dr. Zhivago a short story. This movie was endless and DULLER than third-generation nylon stockings.All credit to Brad Pitt for successfully making this character thoroughly unlikable, since we know from Devil's Own he can make the bad guys look somewhat charming with a bad accent. And James' character here is the closest to reality - best since The Long Riders (and that was the best until now, far better than some of the laughable depictions seen in The Outlaw and the like).But with Jesse as one endlessly scary dude, I spent most of the movie waiting for the promised old west justice and wishing I had brought my own six shooter so I could put an end to my misery.No nice daffodils or tulips, no sand dunes - nothing to distract me while I'm waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Oh, and since there was nothing to wax lyrical about, I admired everyone's full mouth of beautiful clean teeth (there's historical accuracy for you).Since we all know what happened to Jesse, the only surprise is why I sat through the whole damn film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even great acting cannot rescue this confusing bore,"This film is about a notorious outlaw named Jesse James back in 1800's, and his young admirer.I had high hopes for this movie, due to the Oscar nominations and the high ratings on IMDb. Yes, Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give great performances, but I was utterly disappointed after watching it. I felt I have completely wasted 2.5 hours of my life.The plot is highly confusing. It's so hard to follow who is who, who does what and why do they do the things they do. There seems to be no explanation as to why they kill each other in the film. The pacing is so slow, there is so little action in the film, all they do is talk. Even after Jesse James died, the film stretches on and on. Zooey Deschanel receives a mention in the production notes in the film despite her role being a 30 second role in the film? I just don't understand this film.",,Anonymous,Biography
A gorgeous modern western,I love this movie. It's top 5 all time for me and criminally underrated (although I think more people know about it now). I remember watching it with a group of people with the lights on in some random hostel in Croatia but after the first 10 minutes I had to walk away. I couldn't watch it in that setting. I needed to experience the movie fully after seeing how good the start was so I watched it later. I was not disappointed. The cast is unbelievable and had many actors earlier in their careers. It has scenes I still will watch to this day and a soundtrack I'll still listen to as well. It is long and maybe even boring for some but totally worth it. There's no reason it shouldn't have been nominated for best picture and original score but I'm glad it got multiple Oscar nominations.Years later I ended up reading the book which was also great. I don't know if there's a better adaptation out there from book to movie. So many lines were straight from it and I would almost argue that you should watch the movie before you read the book(naturally so you can say the lines like the characters in the movie while reading it).,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Review of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford by the pseudo-Intellectual Me,"Andrew Dominik's ""...Jesse James..."" is one of the best films I have seen in years. I know movie goers expected this to be an action western romp when it first came out, but that's not what the film ever intended to be.The film is about fame, obsession and how we'll be remembered. It excels as a woeful character study of the ""assassin"", Robert Ford, despite what the title would have you believe. And the title is important. This is the first time I've actively studied the title of a film to extract meaning from the story, as it's significance is important to understanding what Dominik is trying to imply. Casey Affleck is oddly sympathetic, once again despite the fact that I'm 'meant' to be repulsed by or hostile toward him. This is by in large, due to the framing of the story which shifts far more focus on his character than the supposed titular character, Jesse James. The assassination itself is ultimately ancillary to the story of a man forgotten and vilified by not only his contemporaries but it's implied that history also looks at him unfavourably.It is shot beautifully by Roger Deakins. This certainly helps you get through 2 hours before one of the best endings, you'll feast your eyes on, affirming everything you think and know about the characters and their placement in the world. It's certainly worth a watch, hopefully you can draw just as much meaning out of it as I did because there is so much more I want to say about it.I forgot to mention all the acting is great, and there's a great cameo at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A melancholic, period-accurate Revisionist Western","Incredible acting from Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt here. Both give really great dark and enigmatic performances. Sam Rockwell and Paul Schneider are also worth mentioning too.The musical score is at times uplifting and also beautifully tragic, another masterpiece by the genius that is Nick Cave (who also gets a fun cameo at the end of the movie).The film is however very long and not for everyone but it is worth seeing through to the end as I think the final 30 minutes are some of the best scenes.What makes this movie really great I think is the historical accuracy. Everything from the outfits, the weapons and technology and especially the dialogue are all very true to the period. This movie is as much an ode to the old West and a revision of old Western movies as it is a Biopic of Jesse James or Robert Ford. Like all Westerns though it is also a story about America. If you are interested in American History or you like Westerns, you will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gone, but not forgotten","How do you even begin to describe a movie like this?The fact that this movie is a true story only serves to benefit it. Most biopic films are held back by the reins of reality, like they're obligated to stick to the real-life formula. However, for this film, it works. It wears the inevitability of its history and its title like a badge of honor. It serves to be the journey, and it arrives at the destination with confidence. It knows that the audience knows what's going to happen, hell its based off of an American legend in the form of Jesse James, but its the last 25 minutes that holds the weight of the film. It still happened, but it relies on the fact that we don't know the fate of poor Robert Ford.Technically speaking, this film is an absolute marvel. Cinematographer Roger Deakins puts forth some of his absolute best work, even making his own lenses for parts of the film. The landscapes are large and barren, making the characters inside them seem mythic. Notably, that of Jesse James. Every performance in this film is pitch perfect, but Brad Pitt as Jesse James may be one of the best casting decisions in recent memory. Jesse James is a legend, but he is no God. He's a volatile, paranoid, angry man, who shows moments of being kind, funny, fatherly, and overall shows a glimpse of a good man. But he's a human being. A deeply flawed man who murdered people.But everyone loves him. And people to this day still do.The film is a critique about the way we see fame. Or infamy. The titular Jesse James is a man impossible to form a solid opinion on. Robert Ford on the other hand is different. He's just a kid, that idolizes Jesse more than anyone. But he discovers that his legendary hero, is nothing more than a man. The film chronicles the last year of Jesse's life with his gang, and ends with Ford shooting him, and the rest of Ford's life.The rest is something you have to experience. This movie has one issue, its a half an hour too long, and that would've been solved if Dominik was able to give his directors cut. I can say the last 25 minutes of this movie hit me like a sledgehammer. The score, the camera-work, the acting, even the story, it all feels so incredibly mythic, but the kicker is, that its real. Its a film that paints an accurate portrait of what we know. And by the end, made me never look at this story, history, or fame, ever again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Strong characterisation and acting, weak plot","There's much to like in Andrew Dominik's film, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford': most of all, it truly is a psychological western. Brad Pitt is excellent as Jesse, a murderous but charismatic bully, fully aware of his own magnetism and ability to inspire terror; while a group of misfits gather around him, bound to him through fear, envy, idolisation and daydreams. But somehow the plot doesn't quite work: Jesse seems to rightly distrust his acolytes, yet nonetheless, leaves his fate in their hands. The movie's solemn narration (not to mention its title) gives away the plot; while the broader context (the aftermath of the American civil war, which goes a long way to explaining James' status as a folk hero) is passed over. Ultimately, it's a lengthy movie, in which not enough happens that is not foreseeable from the earliest scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A soulful, character-driven western.","Wowthis movie is a true work of art. The main story was rather straightforward, but the characterization, the intensely poetic visuals, the soulful score and the brilliant direction made it one of the most hauntingly unique cinematic experiences I've ever had.First of all, the performances were all top-notch. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck obviously dominated the screen most of the time, but quite a few secondary actors (Sam Rockwell, for instance) stood out as well. Casey Affleck's performance was widely acclaimed, and I was very impressed with him as well but personally I thought that Brad Pitt stole the show, especially in the last hour of the movie. The character of Jesse James was just as complex and layered as Robert Ford, and Pitt pulled off this multi-faceted personality very nicely in my opinion. It's a real shame he wasn't nominated for the Oscars.Another major victim of an Oscar snub was Roger Deakins. I had liked his work in The Shawshank Redemption and Fargo (it had been one of the few redeeming features of the latter), but this time he really outdid himself. His style was strongly reminiscent of the cinematography in Terrence Malick's films, with the wonderful landscapes and the most interesting camera angles. Moreover the visuals blended effortlessly with the background scoreevery technical aspect of this movie seemed to fit right in place.As far as the actual assassination of Jesse James is concerned, I thought it was brilliantly portrayed. The fact that the title itself was throwing such a huge spoiler at the audience even before they had seen the movie, must have made it very tough for the director/screenwriter to maintain the significance of that particular scene. However, the spoiler was very cleverly used by Andrew Dominik to provide some strong dramatic irony to the plot, and this made the assassination scene all the more impactful.There are quite a few more themes and interesting aspects that I noticed in the movie (e.g. the possible homosexual tension, the whole ""novel-like"" atmosphere) but no matter how much I write about it, it would all amount to a single fact  that I loved every minute of this film. As of now, it is definitely my favourite of the year.My Final Rating: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good if you are interested in the Old West,"This was a long movie but it was an account of Jesse James and the life of the man that assassinated Jesse James from when the assassin first does a job with the James gang till the end of the assassins life.

Character assassination,"New Zealand director Andrew Dominik breaks many genre rules with this unconventional western about the illustrious outlaw Jesse James and his assassin Bob Ford. Better he should have broken something else (let's start with his type-writer) in this turgid, sluggish western that moves slower than a Conestoga wagon through the Badlands in the 19th century.The first rule he forgoes is in ignoring the axiom that Western characters are men of few words. The James brothers are in the twilight of their careers and this last gang they have assembled is a band of dullards and morons that have trouble putting a sentence together in between long vacant stares. The film opens promisingly enough as the brothers plan a train robbery in a stark wilderness setting. Here Bob Ford, the delusional, James worshiping sidekick attempts to inveigle his way into the good graces of Frank (played with a fine stoic, resignation by Sam Shepard) who will have none of it.Casey Affleck's speech and tick affected Ford is interesting for the first half hour of the film before he becomes downright annoying for the rest of it. Nevertheless, brother Jesse takes him under his wing and for over two hours we are given obvious hints from the pursuit of fame to latent homosexuality as reasons for Ford's ultimate act of treachery.Director Dominik clearly loves cowboy movies. He manages to plagiarize (in a decent film this would be called homage) from westerns good and bad. The Searchers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Left handed Gun, The Great Train Robbery and Dead Man are among others all hinted at. Visually it has some striking moments but overall the cinematography is uneven.At ninety minutes this would have been a bad film. At two and one half hours it becomes a tortuous one. While the heavy handed Dominick deserves most of the blame, producer and actor Brad Pitt should have strangled this project at birth. His comatose performance of Jesse is all pose and little substance and as producer he green lighted this soporific monstrosities running time.For more engrossing, entertaining, better acted and filmed evocations of the James legend I strongly suggest you see The 1939 Henry King Jesse James with Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda and the 1973 Philip Kauffman film The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is a brooding picture, the mood is dark and the scenery incredible. Possible awards nods for production design and cinematography are obvious, as well the stand out performances of Affleck and Pitt.

"Serious, poetic and beautifully shot western","Simply put, I thought that ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" was a cracking piece of work. Serious, poetic and a beautifully shot western, built on excellent central performances by Brad Pitt as Jesse James and Casey Affleck as Robert Ford respectively.Brad Pitt's Jesse James is hardly an American folk hero. He is a nasty piece of work. Unstable, unpredictable, tormented and ruthless. A dominant personality. People are afraid of Jesse James and rightly so. It is one of the best performances of Pitt's career. Forget Pitt as A-lister and tabloid fodder and think about Pitt as the great character actor that he undoubtedly is.As good as Pitt is, the true revelation here is the performance of Casey Affleck. I have only ever been aware of Affleck as Ben's brother and as the comic relief in ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"". There is nothing in those films that could prepare you for his work in ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"". Just outstanding. If he does not get a Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars next month, I will be very much surprised.Casey Affleck's Robert Ford is a slightly creepy, slightly dislikeable man who is trying way too hard. He is very much a small man trying to be a big man and in the process manages to get in way over his head. His initial hero worship of Jesse James turns into something disappointing, destructive and tragic.""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" is a great film. Quite a long film, but engrossing throughout. The hours just shot by. It is early days yet, but I think it is my film of the year so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"7/10.  Whilst it has flaws, the portrayal and story more than compensate","I don't need to do much explanation of what this film is about as it's in the title. To make that huge title larger and fill in all the of the film's exploits it would go something like this: ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and the preceding build-up of a few robberies, James relationship with his fellow robbers (especially Ford) and a slight look into the aftermath"". I'm not sure if this was a considered title, though I should add that there is a 4 hour version of this film with which Mr Pitt won the Venice Film Festival's best lead for, so perhaps it was an idea.2007. Starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. Directed by Andrew Dominik.I'm sure this film wouldn't be half as good as it was if it wasn't for one man: Casey Affleck. He received an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor and he steals the show from right under Brad Pitt's feet. He lost out to Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men, which I will begrudgingly say is fair as it was top notch, but in my awards it goes down as Affleck in my awards. I'll start by saying that while he tops the list it is not to say that everyone else is poor. All the cast are on top form here including Sam Rockwell. I'd say Brad Pitt does a fantastic job portraying James' paranoia, outlandishness and pure cool grit. But Affleck is just too good here; every single one of his scenes is played perfectly. Every aspect of Ford's character is played out stunningly: his admiration of James, his slyness, his boyish tendencies while trying to look like James. The message is just thrown out of the screen at you that this is a boy in a man's body looking for a name for himself. The last few scenes do not allow for much acting to be done by Affleck in terms of screen time but his change of character is outstanding. He completely removes that boyish dreamer and replaces it with a man filled with deep regret and hatred.The other Oscar nomination was for Best Achievement in Cinematography. Put simply it looks good. Even from the poster you can see that the setup is great. Its outdoor shots are very panoramic with the great sweeping Wild West backdrop all trod along by horseback with Pitt swanning around looking cool as can be. The film proceeds over a large time scale and goes through the seasons, each looking remarkable when caught on camera, with my favourite being the snowy mountain background as Pitt's character becomes more paranoid and restless. It lost that Oscar to one of my favourite films ""There Will Be Blood""Now I have to say for all these good points there are quite a few bad that weigh it down a fair bit. The first thing that frustrated me a lot was the dialogue. The language in the film was obviously going to be a difficult issue with it being set in the late 1800's, but not this much. A lot of the lines seem to not be vocalised well (I watched a DVD version) and some of the language was just gibberish to me, so every now and then I lost the plot and had to go back and use subtitles.This is not my biggest annoyance with this though. That comes down to a rather simple thing used 2 or 3 times in the film. Right at the start a narrator speaks a bit about the previous goings on of James and his gang. I don't mind this as the film is already quite long and can understand why producers feel the need to trim. The issue comes when the narrator starts to describe a few of Fords ideas and feelings. Only for a few seconds or perhaps a minute at a time but this still infuriates me. The idea of a film, and why a film can work better than a book, is that you see a characters emotions there in front of, you see what it feels and you can connect with the character while putting yourself in its place. This use of a narrator seems lazy to me, as the writer of the film cannot find a situation for the actor to express himself he/she just sticks in a bit of dialogue and Affleck looking sad. If you can't find a scene just have the character do a monologue or express his feelings to another character in a big chunk.The only way a film can be any good at all is with some underlying depth or an idea or concept that the viewer must understand and take a meaning from; I enjoyed Prometheus because of how it makes us think about ourselves in terms of our real nature and what shows us to be human. This is what makes or kills a film for me and this film, while not having a real depth, has a good idea in it. ""How can a man kill his hero"". That is what this film is mainly all about.

"A story of the  last days of the notorious Jesse James, and the man who came to regret killing him.","""I'm saying his sins will soon find him out. I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full. I'm saying Jesse James is a desperate case and may require a desperate remedy.""The Assassination of Jesse James is about as far from your usual shoot 'em up, bang bang, western yarn, as you can get. It's actually a character study. A particularly measured and slowly paced character study. But it works on the strength of it's great cast and solid writing.Casey Affleck is wonderful as the unsettling, perpetually nervous, shifty man whose unnerving obsession with Jesse James is uncomfortably obvious. And Brad Pitt continues to impress, as he presents James as a charismatic, dangerous, and paranoid man (though his accent was a little iffy, at times). The supporting cast of talented actors like Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Garret Dillahunt, Mary-Louise Parker, and Zooey Deschanel, are all favorites of mine, and all perfectly suited for their roles.Some people may find the pace to be a little TOO glacial, but it would be a crime for a movie with cinematography this beautiful to be rushed. Some of the backdrops and settings are almost breathtaking, with snow-covered roads and fields of grain featuring colors that seem almost too vivid to be natural. I'm a big fan of striking scenery in my movies, and this one certainly gets my seal of approval in that regard.The Assassination of Jesse James is not a short movie, and it's value is in the interactions of the characters, not in the robberies (which we see only one of) and romanticized-western action that we would normally associate with the near-legendary story of the James Gang. I found it to be worthwhile. It raises questions about what makes a man a hero or a villain in the public's eyes, and by the end of the film, we find out that those questions have interesting answers.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a big joke.,"While everyone seems to have been thrilled to see that movie, i'll help the people who haven't seen it yet and are about to, by telling them not to. The 3 out of 10 grade that i gave is justified by : 1 point for the director of photography (except the lens-baby shots), 1 point for the acting (except brad Pitt who once again plays ""brad Pitt""), and one point for ... some scenes that weren't so bad after all. Now don't get me wrong, i'm not the type of person who exclusively likes action movies, one of my favorite films is 2001 space odyssey after all ;).""The assassination of Jesse James etc"" is probably the film which title corresponds the most to the content. It is long. There is no surprise. And never during the movie i cared one inch about any of the characters. Jesse James ... he loves his wife and children, he, as the (dispensable) narrator says, is not in good health, he cries after hitting boys, he's human. OK... now that's a potential for good drama. except... except not, all i can see is brad Pitt being brad Pitt, overacting, and i never related to the character. Robert ford... well. You know during the whole movie that he's gonna kill him in the end and all you do is wait for that. I wish that the movie had had the decency to stop when he actually killed him, but it didn't, it went on, and on, and on. yawn. the music. you're not supposed to notice music in a movie. music is there to add character, color to the images. it goes in the subconscious. the music here is... well. the 3 same notes over an over, so recurrent that it annoyed me whenever it came. the rhythm. first scene, the train thing, bore at first, then exciting when it actually happens, very well filmed.. you think ""yey, here we go, it's gonna keep on with great dialogs and the narrator will just stop talking""... but nothing of that happens, you keep going up and down on the yawn scale. the scenario. it's the scenario of a short movie. and the ""plot"" is accessible by a 1 year old kid. actually it's one of the first independent movie made for people who don't want to think.the film is simple, there is nothing to discover (which is really annoying, imho), nothing exciting, sometimes irritating, sometimes kitsch, sometimes ""please don't use that lens effect"", and sometimes ""wow i paid for that thing""the director tried to do Asian-like cinema, a psychological drama, and it just failed. really failed. at least ""Brokeback mountain"" had a reason to exist. i see none for Jesse James. really, why did they make that movie ? no plot, no story (that can handle 2 hours+). incredible.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unusually Contemplative Western, Vivid Cinematography, Thoughtful Performances","This often startling and frequently beautiful film is not a simple Western, definitely not a bang-bang shoot-em-up where good guy beats bad guy and everything is hunky-dory in about 90 minutes.This film is a curious sort of history lesson, a deliberate and artfully conceived look at the Cult of Celebrity, not too different from the way fame is concocted today; neither of the lead characters are particularly admirable men, as James the Outlaw has robbed and slain innocents, often merely because he finds them suspicious or annoying. The man who stalks James and ultimately shoots him (no spoiler here--check out the title!) is nervous, craven and unsettled; he projects fame and riches from the accomplishment of a craven act and must deal with unexpected consequences.There are some vivid recreations of the Old West, many contemplative shots in the snow and ice or blowing fields of wheat--the director expects the viewer's immersion in atmosphere and character--this is not an easy film to enjoy, especially if you are used to traditional Western action--but its a deeply thoughtful meditation on a culture that rolls out heroes regardless of consequence and its loaded with startling performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"The long title of 10 words strike you initially, and besides having a mouthful of a title, the duration too is at a whopping 160 minutes, of which I can humbly suggest to trim it down to a more manageable 120 minutes.Based on the novel by Ron Hansen, the narrated parts which provided much of the needed background on Jesse Jame coupled with key timelines, were somehow more enjoyable than the rest of the movie itself. For some reason, the voice-over, repetitive (like a one-trick pony, though beautifully haunting) score and soft visual focus provided it with some form of documentary styled legitimacy, only to be hampered by the more clunky delivery on some of the more dramatic aspects. This is not to say that the actors were below par in their fleshing of the characters, but you can sense a deep attempt in trying to emulate styles like Terence Mallick's, in crafting a movie which lingered with still visuals, silence, with unquestionably wonderful cinematography.Our notion of Jesse James is probably one of an outlaw of the wild west who's quick on the draw as well as being a notorious robber/killer molded into the Robin Hood reputation. There are plenty of different interpretations of Jesse James, but none comes so interesting or as intense as Brad Pitt's. Through his confident swagger and suspicious demeanour, here's a man who precedes his reputation, who is clear as crystal in knowing what's he doing, and what the risks are, but nonetheless human prone to err after all.However, the film's focus was presumably put more on Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), the wide eyed recruit who joins Jesse's gang, and that became a dream come true as it presents an opportunity to work with his idol. And his idolization becomes a strange obsession, as he draws physical parallels between Jesse and himself, that makes even Jesse himself edgy and uncomfortable, even questioning at one point if Robert just wants to be like him, or be him. Hence sparks the crazed suspicion and like the adage says, it's better to keep friends close, and your enemies closer.I thought Sam Rockwell stole the show from both Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt in his portrayal of Charley Ford, which reminds me of a Chinese adage of pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger. His Charley is clearly no simpleton, but his depiction of being one probably led to his being able to survive for a long while, when Jesse slowly dispatches the others. But what took the cake, was his spot on impersonation of not only Brad Pitt, but of Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James as well, in a scene so short, but nonetheless quite pivotal leading to the final moments of the movie.There are a few points you must note about the movie. I felt that the full house audience didn't really know what to expect, thinking that it's Pitt on screen, and his presence actually drew in the crowds. And while everyone's waiting for the title incident to happen, they discovered that they're waiting too long. Bear in mind the film runs more than 2.5 hours, and you have to be incredibly patient to get there. I felt a little sorry for the masses who walked out, especially those who did so just before the turn of events, and thereon the pace actually quickened, though covering nothing more than what you can read from encyclopedias under 5 minutes.Those expecting big shoot-em-outs and action sequences like 3:10 to Yuma will also be disappointed, as the action here is never stylized, just presented as a matter of fact for cowboys in that era. Gun fights, if you can call them that, are so extremely ordinary, you'll find yourself more amazed by the intricate weapon design, and the plenty of gunpowder used which explains the plumes of smoke, coupled with the primitive, unsophisticated basic revolver that affects accuracy.Instead, what this movie is, is a well crafted and very measured piece of drama that tells the tale of a legendary outlaw, and his heinous betrayal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
When the actors become the characters...,"I wasn't expecting much in the way of the entertainment factor when going into this film, considering its run time, however the performances of all the actors, namely Pitt, Affleck and Rockwell, assure that the pacing can be viewed as relevant to the character development.When we are first introduced to infamous American outlaw Jesse James it is brought to us in an intimate setting and full understanding of the character. The poetical narration adds to the biographical style the movie feels like.Put in a beautiful, yet unsettling score, some beautiful uses of cinematography and you have yourself a brilliant film.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford= 9.4",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never meet your heroes,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is study case on admiration turned into obsession. A close examination of how a young man is driven by jealousy towards a person he once admired.Upon viewing the film, I've noticed how the bitter relationship between James (Pitt) and Ford (Affleck) is the main element, the main focus. The two characters have an off-putting relationship that's not even considered ""Mentor - Trainee"". Ford is simply portrayed as a kid who wanted his hero to take notice of him. Only once James did take notice and joked over his admirer. Ford's admiration turned into obsession, which finally turned into resentment.Speaking of acting, Pitt is wonderful and really captivating, from body movements to sowing fear into the other characters. All his nuances are implanted in the script in a delicate way which makes it fascinating and frighting sometimes.I can't say the same dough about Affleck, something about his acting was really annoying and felt insecure. Though it is clear his character is supposed to resemble a fan, an admirer. I wasn't moved by his emotions. Hence why the ending didn't surprise me.As for the cinematography by Roger Deakins, I was completely astounded. Every image and shot was so beautiful and captivating. The dark shots of the train in the opening sequence, the single shot of Robert Ford fading in from the mirror, the amount of heavily detailed shots in a single film is the type of work I trust only Deakins to make.Overall I'm really impressed by this movie, the soundtrack that accompanies the film by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is authentic and fits the tone so well. Along with the bitter relationship between James and Ford which is filled with emotion and hostile behavior make this movie a must watch among cinephiles.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exceptional,"This is the first review I have ever written because I loved this movie so much. I recently watched it for the first time, and a few hours later watched the entire thing again. The cinematography is astounding. Absolutely beautiful. It's such a deep and poignant story, which is not what I was expecting. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck's performances were exceptional, perhaps the best of either of their careers. This movie is not an action movie and is not all told chronologically. If you are looking for high paced robberies and old western shootouts, this is not that movie. It's psychological and almost philosophical story, an emotional movie about two characters and how they evolve - in relation to the other, and on their own. It says a lot about the way society remembers things, mainly that people are often remembered for who society thought they were, but not for who they really were.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Captures all the mood and atmosphere of the good western, but not always engaging","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the early days of motion pictures, the western was at the pinnacle of it's game, being the landmark of American cinema and capturing the idyllic image of the 'cowboy' as the fearless hero with a no nonsense attitude and a grizzled image, giving the world the first 'big screen hero' in the shape of John Wayne...and this would last through out the years as those like Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood would take over the template and keep the legend alive. Nowadays, it's a rarity...although films like the re-make of 3:10 to Yuma and Ed Harris's Appaloosa do come by, in modern times it's a defining genre of cinema that's pretty much been allowed to fall by the wayside. Andrew Dominik's mouthful of a title is an attempt to revive this type of film is a lengthy, ambitious and fairly heavy piece that has all the right ingredients at hand in terms of mood, atmosphere and slow, lingering tension that somehow fixate our eyes on the main characters...but fails to really craft a truly absorbing or coherent story that is a problem when it's demanding your attention for so long.As deep and as dim as it is, it's trying to engage you more in the characters than the plot, and so it befalls the performers to bring the show to life. In the lead role as the main titular character, Brad Pitt has the job of bringing the fire and madness inside James's soul to life, as he displays signs of losing control and going completely over the edge, yet still manages to remain the most elusive outlaw in the United States. As the second titular character, as the young pretender Ford, Casey Affleck shows early signs of promise before his break through role in brother Ben's Gone Baby Gone, as the hopelessly infatuated young man who can't spin a line to any of James's associates and can never prove himself as a true man. Both are well cast, and are complimented by quite a supporting cast including Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Renner and female players in the shape of Mary Louise Parker and Brooklyn Proulx.It's a film that opened to great critical acclaim but limited box office success...the reason may be it had all the right elements in place, but couldn't use them in the right way to engage it's audience. In a day and age when this genre has far less gravitas, this is a deadly mistake to make. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An elegaic, poetic and sorely underrated masterpiece","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a film for the ages. It's a film that breaks Hollywood convention, breaks film convention and simply astounds me. I find it one of, if not the, best film of the last five years and yet was criminally overlooked by the Oscars and by the public.The films cinematography echoes Terrence Mallick, Roger Deakins masterfully encapsulates the times it's set. It oozes beauty yet has an underlying sense of mystery, myth and legend. Jesse James has perhaps one of the greatest train robberies ever committed to celluloid, with Brad Pitt brooding around the steam, moving in and out of the shadows, Colt in hand. The director, Andrew Dominik, clearly understands he is dealing with a character who has passed into American folk law and the sepia tint throughout reflects this, shots of rooms with blurred edges give the effect of Civil War photographs, as if we're looking at a film made in 1882.The script is heavily influenced by the synonymous book upon which this film is based; with poetic narration littered throughout the two hours thirty three minutes running time. The third-person narration, becoming so rare in contemporary films, gives the effect of the audience observing the real goings on of Jesse James and Robert Ford. Delivered in melancholy tones by Hugh Ross it works beautifully, matching with the cinematography to create a seamless illusion for the audience.The audience are also blessed with perhaps the best cast of modern times; Brad Pitt's brooding, enigmatic Jesse James is one for the ages and won him the prestigious Best Actor award in Venice. No such luck from the reluctant Acadamy who are keen to ignore all of Pitt's best turns (see Se7en) despite his increasing prowess. Portraying such a myth-like character was a risk for a man so associated with blockbusters and action-packed thrill-rides, Pitt can no longer hide behind his good looks and instead of shying away from this challenge he rises to it and surpassed all expectations. If Pitt is indeed the new Paul Newman then this surely is his Butch Cassidy, a film to finally get him recognised as not only a good actor, but a great one. Despite this the film is undoubtedly Casey Affleck's; his Robert Ford is sly, cowardly and arrogant. He admires and worships Jesse at the beginning, his trepidation at the first meeting is palpable and the tension at a certain dinner scene is eerie. The chemistry, or should it be un-chemistry?, between the two leads helps propel this film from great to masterpiece, you can sense the awkwardness between the two and understand Jesse's suspicions. Yet towards the end, thanks to Affleck, we pity the character and the shell of a man he as become. The supporting cast also does a stand-up job with Sam Rockwell playing the once-jovial Charley Ford with the brilliance we now expect from him.This is not a film about Jesse James as much as it is a study of fame, infamy and the fickleness of the common public. The title makes you believe that James is the hero and Ford the villain but by the end a much different picture was painted. In traditional books and films there's a victim, a villain and a hero. The beauty of this film is you could argue each character as any of these three it depends upon your own interpretation of the films events, the final answer isn't given to us on a platter, we are left to make up our own minds. This bravery on such a risky film makes it evident of Dominik's courage and fearlessness. The film deserves a better reputation than it has, it deserved a better box-office run than it got and more so than that it deserves your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stays with you,"Superb acting by an amazing cast. But the most enduring aspect of the film is Casey Affleck. As much as We might have reason to dislike him, he delivers a truly unique and spellbinding character study as Robert Ford. As much as I thought I knew people like his character, as more time went by I realized he made the character so multi faceted that I didn't know anyone like him. So much depth for such a callow and shallow character. He also actually grows throughout the film into an adult from an adolescent. Wonderful acting performance. He should have won an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A haunting elegy for the Old West,"""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", written and directed by Andrew Dominik, and starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, is one of the most striking and memorable films I've seen lately. I'd heard about the film before – heard that it had been a commercial flop, but was widely regarded as an underrated masterpiece, and one of the greatest westerns of our time. So I finally gave it a go, and boy, I heard it right! It's hard to pin down what it is that makes this film so great. I mean, sure, the acting, cinematography, music, etc. all play a big role. But there's something else going on here, some kind of cinematic alchemy at work that you don't see everyday. The film is haunting, beautiful, dreamlike yet piercingly real. There's something incredibly elemental about it. You can feel the coldness of the wind against your cheek, the warmth of the fire on your feet. You can feel the dirt underneath its nails, the water as it runs down its face.The story, based on an (especially then) obscure novel by Rob Hanson, concerns the relationship between the two titular characters: Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and Bob Ford (Casey Affleck). The title pretty much gives away the central event, but the film also covers the time leading up the big event, as well as its aftermath. Just in terms of period detail, it's probably one of the most realistic and historically accurate westerns I've ever seen.On its visual merits alone, it's an incredible watch, one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. This should come as little surprise to those familiar with the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, but even so, this film is one of the jewels in his already illustrious crown. The look of the film is like old photographs of the era, or artwork from the likes of Andrew Wyeth. It is at once gritty and beautiful, realistic and otherworldly. Its use of light and shadow, natural scenery, and blurring effects at the edges of the screen also stand out. There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work you can mute and simply enjoy as visual experiences, among them Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Terry Malick, to name three. This film easily qualifies in this category.The acting is also excellent, though generally understated. Brad Pitt, who can often be a hit-or-miss actor, hits here with a vengeance. It's easily one of the most subtle performances I've ever seen from him, and his screen presence alone would've made an Oscar nod warranted. Casey Affleck is also great, sometimes even stealing the scene from Pitt, and his ability to make us feel several things about a character at one time is impressive. The supporting roles, played by notable actors such as Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Sam Shepard, Zooey Deschanel, and Michael Parks, round out the cast beautifully.The music, by Australian artists Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (both of them new to film scores) is incredibly beautiful, capturing the folk music spirit of the Old West, and compliments the tone and atmosphere of the film remarkably well.If one forced me to find one criticism of the film, it would be that it's a little too long. But I don't like making that claim, because I can't help thinking of the Emperor Joseph II, who criticized one of Mozart's operas for having ""too many notes"". Mozart reportedly replied, ""Which notes would you like me to remove, your highness?"" Though I have the subtle feeling that the film is longer than it strictly needs to be, I can't think of any one scene or sequence that could be removed without diminishing the film somehow.All in all, it's a wonderful film, and it's a crime that it isn't more well known than it is. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It will burn itself into your memory.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Moody, a bit overblown, but fairly good.","If nothing else, this film should have won an Oscar for longest title of 2007. The Asassination of Jesse James... is the story of the final days in the life of the legendary outlaw, and the mousy young man who ends his life. This film has many strengths, but it just meanders a bit too much to really move its intended audience. More than anything, you'll remember the beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on No Country For Old Men, and his work here may have been even better.The film begins with Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) staging one last big train robbery. By this point in their careers, they are the last of their original gang still together. The rest of the guys they use for the job are a motley crew of low-lifes from the backwoods of their native Missouri. One of these fellows, who literally just walks into their camp and tries to suck up to everyone, is a young man named Robert Ford. Casey Affleck plays this young man who seems to have read and memorized about everything ever written about Jesse James and considers him a hero. Nobody seems to even want to talk to the lad except Jesse James himself. Maybe he's just being polite as a famous athlete would to a young autograph seeker. But when the robbery goes down, Ford is right there with the gang, and the robbery is a success. After the job, the gang splits up except for Ford who Jesse inexplicably allows to stay with him for a brief spell. After a while he is finally sent packing, but by this point their destinies are intertwined, and anyone who reads the movie's full title will certainly know what happens in the end.There are some great things about this film to be sure. The acting is outstanding. Casey Affleck earned his Oscar nomination. He is exceptional as the skittish young man Robert Ford who dreams of fame, but understands that the most sure fire way to get it is to kill his hero. Brad Pitt is.... well, he isn't bad as Jesse James. Maybe its a sign that his acting is finally getting better if I can't tell you he was terrible like he usually is. Sam Shephard was miscast, but it still would have been better if he'd been in the film past the first half hour. His Frank James character splits for the east coast after the initial robbery. Sam Rockwell, as Robert Ford's brother, is pretty good, as well. Pacing is a problem for this film, and almost sinks it. The first 45 minutes or so are outstanding. Then, the film just seems to evaporate for a while and nothing of note happens. The final 45 minutes or so are also outstanding as the film redeems itself with a very insightful ending. We see that Robert Ford becomes more ""infamous"" rather than famous after shooting Jesse James in the back of the head. Luckily, the great look of the film helps pass the time during the dead spots.It almost seems like the art of cinematography is being reborn in Hollywood. For too long now, people have been letting CGI do all the work, and not catching the magic of the outdoors on real film as well. Remember back to the 1970s when nearly every film looked this good. The days of Laszlo Kovacs, Vilmos Zsigmond, and Nestor Almendros were wonderful. It looks like people are starting to care what their films look like once again. This film cost roughly 30 million dollars to make. It barely made a tenth of that in theaters. It's hard to say who they thought their audience was going to be for this film. Most western fans demand more action, hence the huge payday for 3:10 to Yuma last fall. The Asassination of Jesse James is nothing like that, and many casual viewers may not even get through it. I'd recommend it, but it is not quite a great film. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"This film is far from your typical western. Don't watch it with the expectation of dramatic gunfights - there are none. Still, there is an incredible feeling of tension throughout, because the story is simply superb. If you can tolerate a slower pace, and an absence of action scenes, see this movie. Perfect cinematography, and excellent acting by all performers. It's difficult to compare it to anything else, because the plot is completely different from any wild-west flick I've seen. From the very beginning, the narrator lets you know what's coming, and yet this still doesn't weaken the emotional effect of anything on screen.I know this sounds like your typical snobbish film review, but this really is an absolute must see. The first hour can be a bit confusing (I had trouble keeping track of the names) and sluggish, but the conclusion makes it all worthwhile. Give it a chance, and I promise you'll be hanging on every word. This is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after the end credits.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Modern fandom complexities & character studies, set in the Old West... have seldom looked so poetic!","The title says it all. This is the more unheard of ""legends"" of the man who both idolized and shot the infamous outlaw Jesse James. I'd be reluctant to call it a Western, because foremost, we get a male character study flexing many muscles and nuances, that seems to just happen to be set in the old west. Yes, there is gun-play but that's not what made the filmmakers get this ambitious drama off the ground, for sure. The modern complexity of idol fandom and fame coveting, (which is unnervingly reminiscent of such famous cases as the John Lennon & Ronald Reagan shootings) plus the film's psychological character interplay very much discloses this fact.Told most elaborately and poetically, writer/director Australian Dominik has made sure it almost never gets too boring, though, as every scene is as artistically shot as a wall painting. The West has seldom looked both so rugged, flamboyant and beautiful as here, as those snow scenes will stay long on my retina! And if that doesn't do the trick, pitch-perfect performances are plenty to enjoy, with Affleck delivering a haunting and unforgettable portrait of Ford.A note to the ones watching this who are having trouble with languid pace and atmosphere: stick with it, because those final 20 minutes is a masterful showcase of more trimmed, riveting storytelling underlining the story's double tragedy. Biggest flaw which holds back my higher rating: It IS overlong by at least half an hour and an already fine movie would have been great, if cut down.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Six Cinematic Offences,"A critic once said that watching ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" is like watching a book on tape. That's such a brilliant and succinct description that there's not much to add to it. I'll try to enumerate the film's cinematic offences anyway, but forgive me if I don't have the original writer's wit.1) A good movie should begin and end in sensible places. Not only does ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" finish long after its ending, but it starts long before its beginning.2) Actors should have an excuse for lending their talents to a film, but the only real speaking role in ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" is that of the narrator.3) The audience deserves at least one character they can side with. But in ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" no reason is ever supplied as to why we should care about any of the characters, from Jesse James and Robert Ford to the sundry other gang members who get shot along the way.4) Dialogue in a film should express to the audience the thoughts and feelings of the characters. Since it's difficult to care what any of them think or feel, the fact that they mumble all of their overwrought lines hardly matters.5) A movie should seek to entertain its audience in some way, shape, or form. ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" seeks only to put its audience to sleep.6) A movie should be a movie, and not a narrated slide show. The story should be told with action, dialogue, and images, and not by a didactic voice-over. ""The Assassination of Jesse James..."" tramples this rule into the ground.On the plus side, it's good news for insomniacs.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Modern Western Masterpiece,"What a gorgeous film. Andrew Dominik channels Terrence Malick in every scene, highlighting the wilderness of the Midwest and how its desolation seeps into each character's daily life. This film is built on a ladder of tense moments, culminating in Jesse James's death. Robert Ford's infamous stardom afterwards is a depressing denouement that fits his lifelong failure at gaining trust. Brad Pitt's Jesse James is the alpha dog, radiating a supernatural sense of awareness that is both menacing and respectable. But this film belongs to Casey Affleck, whose cracked voice and shifty face forces you to join in with the gang's harassment of the reluctant assassin.

a profound cinematic masterpiece,"This movie is a profound cinematic masterpiece. To me, it is best seen as social commentary, a critique of a democracy/free society star system. In a democracy, the way people distinguish themselves is by attempting to become a star, a hero, a celebrity.Jesse James was a celebrity, played by Brad Pitt, a star. Robert Ford was a non-entity, a confused youth, played by Casey Affleck, a fine actor but not a star (yet). The movie focuses on the star's inability to live a real life--he doesn't know what's real and what isn't. Is he a star? Do the people around him believe he's really a star? Can he trust anybody around him? Is he forced into paranoia? The movie portrays Jesse James as a victim of his own stardom. His doubt and distrust of the people around him are equivalent to doubting his own worth. He has become so distrustful of what is real that he is paranoid, depressed, and at least borderline suicidal. His death is shown as in part a suicide, but more importantly as an attempt to find the reality of his life. Is he a genuine hero--that is, does the confused Robert Ford really worship him? or is Jesse a fraud--that is, is Robert Ford so filled with envy that he's willing to murder Jesse? For Jesse, there's only one way to find out.Jesse James's predicament is depicted in the movie as a central paradox of free and open democratic societies. What's real? Who are the heroes? Doesn't the implied but nevertheless real hierarchy of the star system twist and destroy democracy in a profound way, so that it becomes very difficult for citizens in a democracy to distinguish the true and the false, or to uphold real values? Do democracies self-destruct as they morph into a star system? Movie stars and other celebrities (Lady Di? John Dillinger?) would love this movie for its depiction of their predicament, and their society's predicament.These profound themes make the movie heavy, but they also make it a classic thinking person's movie. It's an epic, and a great one. Cinematography, acting, and screenplay are all great. Directing was very good but flawed--the movie could have been faster paced, and with less mumbling. But it's nit-picking to point out flaws in a movie as great as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent viewing of history,"There's a lot of great things about this movie and the characters are played pretty much flawlessly. Great acting. The only thing is the length of the movie sometimes swayed my concentration a tad...not much though. I am really glad this movie turned out good because i love westerns and all things wild west related. Jesse James, being probably one of the biggest names of the times. Great insight to the times leading up to Jesse's demise and a very intriguing insight into Jesse as a person by true accounts. A must see for movie lovers. If you like westerns, historical or down right great movies then i highly recommend this movie. I'm giving it a 8 because of 2 reasons.1-the lenght and 2-i never give any movie a 10. you can always be disappointed at some part.",,Anonymous,Biography
Little Brothers can be the most dangerous,"The movie is about that decay of Jessie James, but instead of seeing the long battle, We seeing the aftermath of being an outlaw on the run.Brad Pitt is truly acting the best. I've ever seen. A men That is depressed paranoid, just the end of his days soon approaching and he kind of knows it.Casey Affleck is truly magnificent in his portrayal, playing a starry eye kid pushed around neglected by his ido and brothersl.The movie looks good that, beginning train scene is jardopping and all of the movie has a southern feeling that is just nice.Nice feeling of suspense and terror because of Jesse James, just Marvel to feel as the main character together with an unstable personJust feels like a passion project, a really nicely put together film, a bit too long but it is worth to see the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie as long as its title but beautifully made and acted out!,"First of all, I can understand some people not liking this movie. It's pace and style is not just for everybody but having said that, I personally absolutely loved it!Most important thing to know is that this is not a western at all. At least not in the classic sense of the word. It just happens to be a movie that is set in the old west but features none of the typical genre clichés and familiar ingredients. This movie can be more looked upon as a history lesson, being told by some skillful film-makers, both in front and behind the camera's.And that's basically what this movie is; an historical retelling of the Jesse James story, or even a biopic, if you will. And it at all times remains a very authentic feeling and looking one. This means that nothing ever gets exaggerated or glorified. No heroic shootouts or brave characters without fear in this movie. It instead features very real human characters of flesh and blood, with all of their emotions and imperfections. It's not a movie that is in love with its subject but it only, again, tries to tell a true story about true people and where needed, gives its own interpretations on how certain things probably would had transpired, about 120 years ago.And here lies the movie's greatest strength; its authentic look and feeling. And thankfully this also all can be seen back in the movie its characters. I just loved how it showed the good and bad sides of both Jesse James and Robert Ford and how the movie was never picking sides for any of them. It instead tried to create some understanding and sympathy for both of the characters and the movie really succeeded beautifully with this.But this all is also obviously thanks to its actors, who portray all of the movie its most important characters. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are both really perfect in their roles. Casey Affleck even got nominated for an Oscar and when you see this movie it's not so hard to see why really. He plays a pretty complex and hard character with much conviction. But with all this talk about Affleck and Pitt, people tend to forget all about Sam Rockwell, who I aways think deserves far more credit than he's ever receiving.It's no spoiler of course that in the end Jesse James is getting killed by Robert Ford. After all, this is in the movie its title! But I must say that the entire execution of it (no pun intended) and the build up to it is done incredibly. It's both really tense and powerful and you're literally holding your breath when it's 'finally' happening. I was absolutely loving the movie its final 30 minutes or so but by saying that I'm not saying that I was bored or not as happy with the movie its first 2 hours.Even though it's a really slowly told movie and doesn't feature much action in it, I can't say that it ever felt like a boring or overlong movie. It was always an interesting movie to watch, thanks to the dynamics between the characters and the way the entire movie got shot and told by director Andrew Dominik, who only makes movies once every few years.And lets not forget about Roger Deakins' cinematography, that gives the movie an even more authentic look and feeling to it. It was a great move to hire him for this movie, since his visual style is perfect for this movie. The main audience will know Deakins' work for basically all of the Coen brothers movies, that often have a sort of similar authentic look and feeling to them.Perhaps you have to be a real lover of cinema or one of the more old school style of film-making to fully enjoy and appreciate this movie but for me it was an absolutely great one to watch!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gorgeous, rich true-life portrayals","Although as long as its title is unwieldy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is (apparently) true to life and is the beneficiary of a smart, uncharacteristically supporting performance by Brad Pitt as the folk-hero villain and a strong, if a bit mannered, performance by Casey Affleck as his eventual killer.It's the latter days of the James Gang, and weary older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) is calling it quits after one last train robbery. Jesse's not so inclined, though, so he assembles a new crew of cutthroats, including the Ford brothers, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and Bob (Affleck). But all the while, Jesse is always looking over his shoulder, sure that someone's about to cut him down, perhaps even someone from his own gang. It doesn't help that he's written terroristic telegrams to governors and presidents alike, either.The story's told through the eyes of Bob Ford, a stammering young man who strongly idolizes Jesse to the point of carrying around a shoebox of dime novels about the legendary outlaw and knowing all sorts of arcane facts about Jesse. Not surprisingly, to Jesse and the rest of the gang (including Bob's brother Charley), this seems childish and downright pathetic, and consequently they don't give the young Ford much respect.This attitude leads to a strange mixture of resentment and continued idolatry on the part of Robert Ford. Should he continue to try to ingratiate himself with Jesse, or should he turn him in to the authorities? Turning him in might make him a hero - the one man who could fell Jesse James - but then he'd really lose whatever remaining respect Jessie had for Bob. (To Bob's thinking, he's one of Jesse's pals.) Affleck's Oscar-nominated performance is wonderful, walking the fine line between hammy and nuanced. A less-capable actor (or, perhaps, an actor less on top of his game) might have taken Bob's idiosyncrasies and run with them, played them up rather than muting them somewhat, making them feel more natural. You get the sense that although Bob is not a good man by any means, he is human in his actions and reactions; he can be a cold-blooded murderer and thief, but how he deals with each minicrisis is neither insincere nor cartoonish. It might be a testament to Affleck that he's able to make something out of the relatively dull character of Robert Ford.Brad Pitt is simply Brad Pitt. He's come a long way since movies like Legends of the Fall and A River Runs through It; he's now a Good Actor, not just a beefcake model, and he's effectively menacing and confusing as James, who was (the movie says) going a bit off the deep end in his waning years even without having to deal with the specter of betrayal. James is sad, excitable, angry, dissonant, and Pitt is up to the task. Weirdly enough, though, although Jesse James is the nominal subject of the movie, Pitt takes a backseat to Affleck. This isn't about romanticizing the lawless West and the tough fiends who populated it; it's about dreams crushed and comeuppance delivered.At more than two and a half hours, this is not a broad, unsubtle look at real-life events, and it's not always easy to watch. James is not only not presented positively, he's shown as a realistically diabolical criminal, not just some pretty boy with a lot of ""cute"" facial hair. Multilayered characterizations and sweeping, Oscar-nominated cinematography make this an effective Western.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Beautiful film, but not so much about Jesse James as about Ford","This film is a well-made period piece which uses some creative cinematic techniques, some more successfully than others. It is very successful and crating a world which draws the viewer in and seems believable. Jesse James, then and now, was a superstar criminal with a larger-than-life persona. This film is not really about James, though. Rather, it is about Bob Ford and how he transforms from a James groupie into an assassin. Casey Affleck's performance as Ford is an unsettling balance of naivety and creepiness. One always feels that the wheels are turning in Bob's head, thanks to the impressive non-verbal skills of Affleck. He's the under-rated brother and a much better actor than many people realize.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Death and its toll,"Since the review I've read talks only about the technical aspects of the movie, I feel like dropping by my feelings while I was watching the movie.I was expecting to watch a movie with some good ol'shooting going around, but I was terrible wrong, but surprisely not disappointed. This movie tells history, what comes packed together is a story of a man and a boy, both trying to survive in an hostile environment which was in the turmoil of change, they are somehow uncertain of their future as they swung between manhood, confidence, trust, fear and love. Brad Pitt was never a pretty face and he shows it to us at every single movie, and Casey stands out in the screen, we could have had another in his role, but I'm glad we didn't.To cut out the chase here, I think this movie tells the story of death through life and vice-versa, both at the same time. It shows how many weight a killer carries in his back and how many you have to carry to become one. Their decisions shape their future so perfectly, as the fall of one predicts the rise of another. The question is: Is he prepared to take his place in the world?So the movie answer this question and gives us a bitter taste of what you have to do to get anywhere in life. You have to take a step, you need to be patient, you have to be in the right place at the right time, you need luck and them life might give you a shot. Once you get there, sometimes it might pop out another question: Is that what you are really looking for? All of this is given to you just with glances, stares and imagery. I'm happy to say, I like the way they carried out this.I'll give it a 9/10, why? I really don't know because I was really into the characters, they can give you so much with bare silence. Maybe I was missing some CGI-action shooting? Who knows? A must see...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A modern masterpiece,"After going through a recent obsession of classic westerns, something odd nowadays for a teenager apparently, I bought The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford thinking it would be a nostalgic homage to western films of old like the brilliant Unforgiven. Instead, I was treated to a tense drama profiling the final days of America's famous train robber. I'm glad I made the mistake of picking up this film because it is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Casey Affleck defies his brother's reputation for abysmal acting talent (sorry but it's true) by pulling off a stellar performance as the creepy but likable character Robert Ford and Brad Pitt has one of his best performances as the troubled Jesse James. Both actors manage to cloud the audience's opinion subtly and slowly almost without you noticing until the film's over. A solid supporting cast of Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner manage good performances in the background without taking the attention away from the two leads. The only flaw I can find is that Casey Affleck can at times be too slimy for my liking but that's me personally more than anything else. Anyone who enjoys films and wants to see some career best performances should definitely make the time to watch this brilliant movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Loved this movie!,"I'm totally confused why this movie has not been rated the score it has. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. I absorb it so much more because, of the history, you also see into the psyche of Jesse James, and with the unsatisfaction of a good part of the Unites Sates after the Civil War, and the government taking their lands for development is not so different than today. People were struggling to survive. After 30 some odd years the Civil War, the impact that the war between the states made was apparent. I truly wish that this movie could be relaunched, I think with the dissatisfaction that the current state of the Union, foreclosures, layoffs, politics can me more retaliative today more than 4 years ago. I can't agree with someone killing, but I can see what your environment creates , and the need of survival weighs out.",,Anonymous,Biography
An intriguing Western character study,"This film follows Jesse James (Brad Pitt) in the final days of the the James Gang as he becomes increasingly paranoid that the gang's members are out to betray him. If that wasn't already true, James's tactics only hasten the end that will come to him by way of Robert Ford (Casey Affleck).The performances are good for the most part but I didn't think much of Brad Pitt as Jesse James. He didn't convince me that James was a character whose fate I should care about in the least. Casey Affleck's Robert Ford, on the other hand, showed an interesting blend of hero worship and spite and was certainly worthy of the Oscar nomination that resulted. Also, the underrated Sam Rockwell gave a noteworthy performance as Charley Ford.The film looks attractive, although some of that imagery is snatched practically verbatim from other films like ""The Searchers"". I feel that the main detraction from the film's overall appeal is in the storyline. The film performs well as a character study but the plot falls flat until the late stages when some life is finally injected into the proceedings. Nevertheless, the film is undeniably interesting when, at the end, you step back to take a look at the big picture.I recommend this film to fans of the Western genre but those more interested in straight drama will likely get the most out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A ""one for the ages"" performance.","At first I was a bit skeptical about what I was going to get from it. From the summary to the previews and trailers, It all seemed about ""just right"" at the beginning, nothing to add on, nothing breakthrough about it...

The film got me, and it got me good; from the shots to the script and scenery, passing through the costume design and soundtrack, the amount of almost flawless things about the film just keep getting higher and higher. But, what really put the seal at the end of the envelop and make me realize what a master piece this film was, was Cassey Affleck's performance. ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING. Nothing else.

"Really beautiful, really slow","Essentially Roger Deakins show reel. About 15 minutes in there's a train robbery at night and it could be the most beautiful five minutes of movie ever created. To all future cinematographers, watch this film if you can get your movie to look as good as this, congratulations you have mastered your art. But pretty pictures aren't the only thing that make a movie.The film is packed with talent, there is not a second in the film's run time where it does not look achingly gorgeous and Brad Pitt clearly relishes being the focus as one of the titular characters and a legend from the old west.The story? Well, it's summarised in the unwieldily long and literal title. This is the Western as art house. Or The best Terrence Malick movie never made by him.The issue is the glacial speed and the over reliance on endlessly long scenes of fairly banal conversations. If it was any slower, it would be playing backwards. It could work as a character study but the VoiceOver tells you everything you need to know so the audience is being spoon fed. Also clocking in at nearly 2 hours 45 minutes it is unnecessarily long for something that could be summarised as a young man hero worships an outlaw but then betrays him.The film is like a conversation with a supermodel about macro economics, utterly beautiful but totally boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pitch and period perfect,"One of the most fascinating period films ever produced. The director and actors spare nothing to create a genuine feel for the time. Brad Pitt and Ben Afleck give the finest performances of their careers. The dialogue is pitch perfect, intelligent, and period correct. Settings and costumes are historically accurate in the finest detail. The frozen landscapes and vast, moody skyscapes are breathtaking. Admittedly, there is a relative dearth of stage blood and the gunshots sound like the real thing, but it still amazes me that anyone could find this film boring.

good film,"To be honest, I think this movie is great. When I start to watch, I feel it exciting. However, as a foreigner, sometimes their behavior and language is little difficult to me to understand because of the culture and background.First, the actors in the movie are very good. Because in the movie, there are many inner scenes, so it's hard for the actor to show their emotion, to let us feel and believe what they are faced. But they really made me feel nervous or exciting or upset. I do think their performance very delicate. And due to this point, the story looks very smooth. So I will recommend it to the people who like some types of western movies but not too much action.Second, I do like the music and the way how to capture the scenes. Especially in some horrific scenes, the music and the light coop in a wonderful way so that make me focus in the film. After the show, I will still think about it. How that scene looks like, dramatic and wonderful feeling.Last but not least, the story can represent the American's life in that period and some unique spirits of American. Jesse James look as a hero in that time, and his life is really dramatic. I can image that period's life in America. So although I am not American, I will still like this kind of story.Generally, I like this film because its' story, actor, music. Not like the other western films, it's not always full of shooting scenes or fighting scenes, it make you understand and think more about that time in US.

The last seven months in the life of Jesse James,"Released in 2007 and directed by Andrew Dominik, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" stars Brad Pitt as the famous outlaw in a chronicling of the last seven months of his life. The movie begins with the Blue Cut Train Robbery that took place in Missouri on September 7, 1881. Casey Affleck co-stars as Robert Ford, a 20 year-old member of Jesse's gang, who kills James for the reward, but also (presumeably) because he and his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell), feared Jesse was going to kill them. The final 25 minutes detail the Ford brothers lives over the course of the next decade after James' execution on April 3, 1882. Paul Schneider,Garret Dillahunt, Jeremy Renner, Sam Shepard, Mary-Louise Parker, Kailin See and Zooey Deschanel have notable support roles.This is a funereal, realistic Western consisting of long dramatic sequences spiced with flashes of violence. Although critically praised, it bombed at the box office and some people scoff at it as a slow bore, but I found it pretty mesmerizing, even haunting. There are numerous highlights during its 2 hour and 40 minutes, like the opening train robbery, the outhouse rendezvous between Schneider and See, the tense gunfight in the upstairs of a frontier house, Jesse's death and the interesting aftermath.The movie makes a point of depicting Jesse as a paranoid man on his way to an early grave because of his foolish choice to be an unrepentant outlaw. At least Frank James (Shepard) had the scruples to leave outlawry and move east. Jesse is shown lamenting what his life had become and even shooting one of his comrades in the back, like a coward, not to mention abusing an adolescent. Yes, Ford later shoots Jesse in the back, but it had to be done. Jesse's days were numbered due to his own bad choices. Plus Robert and his brother were afraid that Jesse was going to shoot them at any moment. Also keep in mind that Jesse wasn't no frickin' Robin Hood; he stole from the rich and regular folks alike and gave to... well, himself. In light of all this the title of the movie is purely ironic, but when the legend becomes fact, print the legend, as they say.The Alberta and Manitoba locations are picturesque, but they don't look like Missouri and Kentucky (and surrounding states), where the events took place. These are Eastern states, albeit ""midwest."" The locations in the movie look like what they are -- the northern prairie. ""The Long Riders"" (1980) is more accurate on this count.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sometimes it was fine, I get that you couldn't include everything in the movie. But sometimes the narrator was stating the complete obvious. Describing what is happening while we are actually seeing it ourselves. It treats the viewer as a child, because the narrator doesn't think we can see what is going on inside of the persons he is describing.

Unlike other films on Jesse James, this one does not glorify him nor does it focus on the exploits that made him famous. The movie picks up after the end of the James-Younger Gang in the twilight years as a harsh post-war world crashed down on the old time outlaws.This is more the story of Robert Ford and how hero-worship turned to bitterness. He was the Mark Chapman of his day, driven to kill the man he idolized in order to take his place.From all I can tell this film is historically accurate and well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Deep Dive into Hero Worship and Betrayal,"""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a beautifully crafted and introspective western that offers a contemplative look at the final days of the infamous outlaw Jesse James. The film is a slow-burning character study that delves into themes of hero worship, betrayal, and the complexities of human nature.Brad Pitt delivers a compelling performance as Jesse James, portraying the legendary outlaw with a mix of charisma, menace, and vulnerability. Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford is equally impressive, capturing the character's youthful admiration, envy, and eventual disillusionment with Jesse. The dynamic between Pitt and Affleck drives the narrative, creating a tense and psychologically rich exploration of their relationship.The film's visual style is nothing short of stunning. Cinematographer Roger Deakins creates a series of hauntingly beautiful images, using natural light and sweeping landscapes to evoke a sense of melancholy and inevitability. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold with a sense of grandeur and tragedy that feels almost Shakespearean.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's evocative score further enhances the film's somber tone, providing an atmospheric backdrop to the unfolding drama. The music, combined with the film's poetic dialogue and meticulous attention to period detail, immerses viewers in the world of the late 19th century American frontier.While the film's slow pace and contemplative nature may not appeal to all audiences, those who appreciate a more meditative and nuanced approach to storytelling will find much to admire. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a deeply affecting film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.In conclusion, this film is a masterful exploration of myth and reality, offering a poignant and visually arresting portrait of two men bound by fate and flawed by their humanity. It stands as a unique and powerful entry in the western genre, deserving of its critical acclaim and enduring legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Slow, very realistic, almost documentary-style adaptation with brilliant acting and music","This is a slow, beautifully acted western which is a very realistic and faithful adaptation of an actual historical event. To be honest, it is a bit difficult to relate to the principal characters and the themes are very specific to the era which are not much applicable today. Glorification of criminals (especially charismatic gun- slinging cowboys) is not something that is relevant today, and the movie only touches on this theme towards the very end.The movie is beautifully shot, the background music is stirring and perfectly matches the events, the ensemble cast is brilliant and both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give good performances. Brad Pitt generally only plays one type of character-the charismatic, confident, commanding leader-and Jesse James perfectly matches that archetype, although I think that Pitt's efforts to show how broken Jesse is inside do not quite hit the mark and are not very effective. Further, every other character is terrified of Jesse but we do not actually see him doing much, which is slightly puzzling. Casey Affleck is also good, but the jump from Robert Ford adoring Jesse James to Robert Ford suddenly deciding to assassinate Jesse at any cost is a bit abrupt and not very convincing.The assassination scene itself is very strange, in fact Jesse's entire behavior leading to the assassination scene is very puzzling, almost as if he had already given up on his life which does not quite match his character. Motivations are not effectively conveyed, and one has to carefully consider the events to infer them. But perhaps that is intentional, as the focus of the movie seems to be just relate the facts and events in an almost documentary-style. The movie is really long and depicts in great detail a number of extraneous events involving other members of the James gang which are only tangentially related to the central narrative. In spite of all the complaints though, I was utterly captivated throughout its entire length, and the acting and music and the gravitas of the characters makes up for all the other shortcomings.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I have no real knowledge of blocking or mise-en-scene, I couldn't write a screenplay to save myself and I am a poor actor at the best of times. Despite this, I find myself fascinated by film. The medium is one that captures the contemporary imaginative landscape like no other, whether it be Breaking Bad or Toy Story 3.Despite having seen this film 8 years too late, I can honestly say I cannot recall a film that demanded my attention as assuredly as this. It is certainly a slow film. It does not grab your attention through aural assault nor does it manipulate you or demand emotional investment. What it does do is grab your attention through it's sheer command of the medium. Whether it be Roger Deakin's breathtaking cinematography, Nick Cave's mesmerising score (composed without even a frame to reference) or Brad Pitt's zeitgeist-defying performance, this is a film that by it's very existence defies expectation. If you enjoy artists at the peak of their powers, Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a film you MUST see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What happened to Jesse James,"Yes, does the film really have such a long title that manages to describe both the main character and the climax? No, no, no. The climax will be after and much more interesting than the murder itself.I came across a brief review from one person and he said that there are almost no dialogues in this film and the film literally shows everything. Visual storytelling, so to speak.This is partly true, but the communication of the characters is enough. Not an arthouse for 3 hours with beautiful views, but just a western. And beautiful. Nature is shown amazingly. I can't take my eyes off it!The film is very atmospheric and such an original movie should, if not supported during the rental, then at least with your attention. Of course, the author will not know about this support, but at least you will get acquainted and think that you should have seen it earlier.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sublime masterpiece,"What can be said about this movie? The title (which I believe serves the movie in an excellent way) gives every plot point away from the beginning so what you're left with is to sit and enjoy the ride. This western is not all about shootouts and action, but the fatal relationship of mankind with betrayal, fame, myth and judgment.The cinematography is amazing, the rendering magnificent. The long time it runs allows the viewer to travel at the locations and observe the characters from every possible angle. The vulnerabilities of each are portrayed in such a way that the viewer cannot choose a ""side"", and the relationship between Robert Ford and Jesse James is extremely exciting to watch unfold.The best way to watch this movie is like observing a piece of art in a museum. It becomes asserted on the viewer, or as Stephanie Zacharek said ""this film represents a breakthrough in the movie-going experience. It may be the first time we've been asked to watch a book on tape."" Maybe visual poetry would be the only way to describe it.The soundtrack of the movie signed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is just as magnificent and frames the movie amazingly.Great performances by Sam Shepard, Mary-Louise Parker and Sam Rockwell, but the two protagonist's portrayals, Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, are mesmerizing and steal the show. A must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Score and filmography make it stand out. Superb,"Revisited this gem last night having previously viewed during a distracted time in my life. The casting is superior to most western style films as every character is believable and the fear or uncertainty experienced by most around Jesse is palpable and puts you on edge to watch. The narration is subtle and toned without being overused, adding some depth and setting when required. The pace is slow and it's not all action, this is character based storytelling at its best. The score brings a whole new feel.The standouts for me are Pitt, Affleck and Rockwell. All provide pitch perfect performances. I read somewhere Pitt rated this as his best movie, on second viewing I have to agree. Having reviewed I would put this in my top 20 movies and will no doubt view again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Modern Greek Tragedy,"Hero worship, love, betrayal, ambition, the value of loyalty tinged with not a little madness in —and an audience's pity for — all its central characters, this movie is what movie-making should be all about.An earlier reviewer called it ""a hard sell"" and I must admit my first thought at the end of this film was ""how the hell did they get the financiers to sign off on this?"". It's a gunfight movie with barely a gunfight in it, and yet it well never cease to grab you from the first moment to the last. Every scene in this movie is compelling. Each scene could almost stand on its own as an exemplar of the art of cinematography, screen writing, direction and acting.I've seen reviews that say this movie was too long. No, it's not quite long enough, and if you watch it at home the first thing you'll do after losing yourself in Nick Cave's haunting soundtrack that rolls with the credits is to replay it all over again (BTW, Cave cameos in the movie as saloon bar singer, so watch out for that!).What is there to say about the plot that hasn't already been said? Each and every character is a study in the personal, moral, and opportunistic pitfalls of a life that is knocked from pillar to post by the winds of fate. You can't help but empathise with every one in the movie and their fate, even (perhaps especially...) Robert Ford.If you like movies that move you, you'll love this one.

Perfection.,"I think I will just come right out and say it from the off, this is a masterpiece, a truly spell binding, mesmerising tour de force that seeps class from every pore. I have often found myself cringing and turning my back on those who use in film debate the tired old defence of ""it's not for everyone"", but here I find I have no choice because this picture is purely for those enamoured with poetic beauty and precision film making at its highest. Those in search of an all action gun toting western need not apply, in fact those merely after popcorn fodder to while away an evening viewing should steer well clear. Andrew Dominik's second directorial effort is a character and dialogue driven piece of work, its thematic heart swirling with intelligence and elegiac beauty.The story centrers around the final days of notorious outlaw Jesse James, and how one of his young disciples came to murder him on April 3rd 1882. Using Ron Hansen's novel as its source, it also fills in the gaps as to what became of the murderer Robert Ford as regards the subsequent aftermath of killing the infamous Jesse James. The film is dealing with issues all to prevalent in modern day society, we are witnessing perhaps the first instance of celebrity status gone berserker, we see how the press glamorise the nasty piece of work that was Jesse James, turning him into some sort of quintessential noble outlaw. We observe a stalking menace yearning to be like his hero, a young and impressionable fellow who's hurtling towards infamy completely oblivious of the pitfalls and irony of it all.Structually the film is perfect, and to me the film defines the old saying of art on the silver screen. The performances of the lead actors are incredible, Brad Pitt gives a career high as Jesse James, all teetering villainy yet perfectly befitting the prince charming outlaw persona so gleefully built up by the press. Sam Rockwell is Charley Ford, and here he proves that movie big wigs really need to start giving the guy some more dramatic roles to get his teeth in to. Yet as good as Pitt & Rockwell are, both men are left trailing in the wake of Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford, childish emotion fused with flecks of dark undercurrents as Affleck layers a perfect show. How the academy chose to ignore this performance should be seen as an act of treason against American cinema.Few films have left me open mouthed in admiration at the quality on show, but shot after shot, frame after frame, this really is as gorgeous as it comes. Roger Deakins photography sublimely pleasing the eyes at every edit, be it lush rolling hills cloaked in snow, or shadowy figures appearing like ghosts from locomotive smoke, with Deakins firmly cementing his reputation as a master of his craft. The score from Nick Cave & Warren Ellis perfectly captures the ambiance and texture of the piece, with Cave himself bagging a cameo performance as a bar room busker. It's incredible to think that this is only director Andrew Dominik's second feature film, following on from the hugely enjoyable Chopper in 2000, it is now evident that New Zealand can lay claim to producing a talent that if all goes to plan, will go on to become a director to rank up with the best of them.As it is, and just right now, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford should be filed along side Vertigo as a member of that club that only admits the greatest American films of all time, and that be even if it was directed by a Kiwi, wink wink America.Masterpiece 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good....even great,  but not exceptional.","Before my review, I'll admit that my reasons for seeing this film were shallow. I of course went to stare at Brad Pitt and because I really like two of the actresses who were thrown on the screen for a few seconds. Of course, I was given much more than I expected, since I really had no expectations (I find it dangerous to have any when you go see films lately).I knew about the length. I had no issues with the length. I can't say the same for the guy snoring in front of me (I tried to wake him up by gently kicking the back of his seat...he was missing a great film folks!). I loved the pacing of the film actually (and not just because it makes my $8.50 seem more reasonable). The slow deliberation of the film was absolutely necessary for the times and the people it was studying.The film itself was obviously beautiful...but nothing particularly special in my opinion. It simply reminded me of films like ""Cold Mountain"" or ""Legends of the fall."" Although I did love a few shots with the light on the hardwood floor and the scene where he gets shot. It was nice to look at, but was there anything new? Not really.The cast was probably one of the films strongest points. First let me talk about the more supporting characters. Both Paul Schnieder and Sam Rockwell were awesome. It might just be that I already like them, but really they both gave a lot to their characters. I can't see the film without them. As I mentioned before I also really like MLP and Zooey, so my only complaint is how little they were used. In actuality it probably would not have been as good if their roles were any larger. The film was a study of two men and the world they lived in...I suppose it was right to accentuate the lack of women in their lives. It would have been a sellout to do anything else.Okay, so Casey Affleck....is he that annoying in other roles, or just a really good actor? I can't say because I've never seen him otherwise. All I know is that he annoyed the snot out of me throughout the film, but in a good way. If that was the goal here, it worked! I was captivated by his acting and my annoyance. I'll have to see him in something else to give a final verdict on how good he is. I suspect that he might just be annoying, because I find the same with his brother.Brad Pitt. I was kinda disappointed actually. I don't know if he's been type cast or maybe has just reached the peak of his acting abilities. To be honest, I'm kinda getting bored with Mr. Pitt. It seems to me that he was just sorta ""there"" in the film. They could have cast anyone else with a semi-big name and gotten the same needed effect. If they hand him an award for this role, I'll be really confused.The writing and overall story telling were the absolute best features of the film! I saw this film and the new ""Elizabeth"" film on the same day. Of the two films that attempt to delve into the psyche of historical figures, this was by far the better film (of course the first ""Elizabeth"" was better than both). I was just thinking...maybe they could have cast Cate Blanchett as Jesse. I think it would have been the same. Haha. No seriously.Anyhow, my final verdict is this: It was a good film, but not exceptional. I feel that we should expect work like this on a regular basis. Films like this should be the standard, not the exception.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pitt the Major Flaw in This Otherwise Strange and Beautiful Western,"2007 is shaping up to be the year of the Western revival.There's not much need of a plot summary for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" because it's all right there in the title. And there's not much plot to summarize anyway. This is a movie more interested in character than plot and more interested really in aesthetics than character, and it's a strangely fascinating film. It's certainly one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time.The young actor Casey Affleck is a revelation as James's assassin. His Robert Ford is awkward and stammering, whose appearance and behavior leads people to believe he's dumber than he is. His idolatry of Jesse James is fueled by the dime novels he collects and in which James so frequently appears. The character as written is somewhat obtuse; I'm not sure I completely ever understood what makes Ford turn on James, or when the change in his feeling occurs. But Affleck does wonders with what he's given to work with and gives one of the best performances I've seen thus far in the year. Unfortunately, at the film's center is Brad Pitt, and he creates a vacuum which the film succeeds in spite of rather than being dragged down by. Pitt is simply not a good actor, but his good looks and sheen of Hollywood glamour will assure that film makers keep giving him starring roles. I kept thinking about Russell Crowe's marvelous performance as an outlaw in ""3:10 to Yuma"" and couldn't help but wonder how much better this film would have been if Crowe had been cast instead. Pitt doesn't sink the film, because the cast he's surrounded by does such good work (in addition to Affleck, Sam Rockwell is a stand out as Robert Ford's older brother), but he prevents it from being even better than it otherwise could be.Some may be turned off by the film's formality; virtually every shot looks like a carefully composed photograph. But I thought the film's tone and visual style matched the subject. After all, we're talking about a legendary figure here, someone who's as much myth as man, so why not give the movie the imprint of myth as well? ""Jesse James"" isn't much interested in ideas, though I think it wants to be. Only in the movie's final moments, after Ford has assassinated James and then suffers the harassment of a public that decides to idolize James in his death and deride Ford as a coward, does the film toy with the question of what distinguishes a hero from a villain. It doesn't come to any conclusions, and because of Pitt's inadequate performance, it never explains why James was able to make himself into a legend while Ford died a figure of infamy. But I was willing to let the film's sheer physical beauty and fine supporting cast sweep me along with them and cause me to not care too much about anything else.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Save your time and your money.,"I'm not sure that I can offer much more about how almost all of the characters are less than two-dimensional, and more forgettable than the faces of other people in line at a grocery store.I found myself wondering how this Jesse James got his name in the title without actually doing anything in the film. Saying that this film is about the legacy and death of such an infamous gangster/gun-slinger is like saying that Forrest Gump highlighted the failure that was the Vietnam war.Basically, 3:10 to Yuma exemplified the energy, valor, and excitement that The Assassination... needed. I'll grant that the scenery is kind of nice, but it's lost amid the clutter of bodies and plot pieces that are littered through the film.In my experiences, many of the finer films do require a second or third viewing before much of the nuances can be appreciated. Eraserhead, Dogville, Full Metal Jacket, they're loaded with symbolism and messages. This film left me reaching for meanings, trying to find some hint of an idea, but I was completely baffled and disappointed.By giving this collection of scenes such a low review, I find myself wondering if everyone who gives it a high review has just convinced themselves that they liked it; sort of a way of dealing with a severe trauma.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Astonishingly beautiful, bluntly original...a masterpiece","It's been a great year for films, and right now, this one is my favorite. I went without knowing the source material, and had only read some reviews which were mixed. I expected a pretentious mess, but instead was enthralled. I haven't seen a film that was as original as this one, that is, it references no other. Comparing it to the work of Terrence Malick is only valid because he's another unique director (who included fields of waving wheat). This has a potent narrative pull.I don't remember seeing a film that fuses images, acting, music, meticulous period detail in its art direction and mood so seamlessly. Despite claims that it's overlong, each scene--all unexpected--moves the action forward. The title tells us what's going to happen. We're left to see why...and when. So there's incredible tension leading up to the killing. While all the performers are extraordinary, Casey Affleck dominates this group of psychopaths so successfully that everyone else looks quite normal (he out Norman's Norman Bates). His very complex character is so thoroughly laid out before us that the aftermath of his notorious act disappoints us as much as it did Robert Ford.Because this film is so frankly original, I think people might resist it. But if you buy your ticket without expectation (this is not a Western; it's a psychological exploration of a wide range of deviants), you're in for an astonishing experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jesse James,"Epoch Movies sometimes fall into a pit, where the mechanics of moving back in time has more to do with showing characters dressed in the days of old and portraying social poses than conveying a genuine epoch feeling. This is of course arguable since the spirit of a time now dead is impossible to show; but maybe it can be emulated, suggested more than defined - and of course, the more vague it gets the more dependent it becomes of the viewer's own predisposition do see it, understand it or ""connect"" to it. For me ""Jesse James..."" works at this level portraying with accuracy something both palpable and vague that transcends the curiosities, the costumes, the surface of what we see  the spirit rather than the materiality; very intimate, passionate and yet strangely detached. These were the men of the days that are gone. The awkwardness of those days bursts in the beginning, as a strange locomotive fills the the dark woods with light, and this synthesizes the overall mood for the picture: the direction, the cutting, the photography, the actors - and their meager lines -, are in a perfect unison.I remember ""The Proposition"" and the parallels that can be traced between (appart from Nick Cave): both movies use a similar visual technique, with long shots of the wilderness, small lines, subtle score and loose editing. The big difference is perhaps the voice over in ""Jesse James..."", a narrator that works almost like an historian and brings us closer to the characters and their inner feelings.Brad Pitt has good leading role  the best in the last years  looking a matured actor, and Casey Affleck has the first big opportunity to show what he's got  and he delivers.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brad Pitt as an Actor,"First off, I have to say that this is an incredible story, made into an incredible movie, filled with a credible cast. Personally I have never been disappointed by anything I have seen with Brad Pitt. He is a phenomenal actor, and is the perfect person for an intensely bipolar cowboy. Casey Affleck really supported as the Coward, and I am amazed to this day by his performance. Having not heard of him before I was slightly concerned, but in the end he pulled it out. Enough with the actors, the film itself is beautifully shot, masterfully scripted, and well directed. It doesn't use dramatic music to heighten a scene's intensity, yet you can't help but feel the tension. The train scene with the light coming through the trees is incredibly brilliant. So far this is the best film I have had the pleasure of viewing. I look forward to more like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece!!!,"Sometimes American movie-making reminds us why they are the biggest and most important entertainment industry in the world. This happens when we see movies such as ""Assassination..."", which is, ironically, the kind of movie that has become more and more rare to be made. Maybe because it's poetic, long, based on details rather than on blockbuster action. The acting (especially Affleck, who saves the family name)and the whole technical part (costume design, art direction, cinematography and score REALLY seem part of a coherent whole), all led by this practically unknown genius-to-be Andrew Dominik build a masterpiece that won't be loved by most people (and the foreign press seems to confirm this).

A Joy to all the Senses we Bring to Cinema. 2007's Masterpiece,"With a paltry two Oscar nominations (for Cinematography and Supporting Actor) the Assassination of Jesse James joins the ranks of cinematic achievements (most recently A History of Violence) that get annually short-changed by the Academy.At 2 hours and 45 minutes, with a title that stretches to a daunting ten words (not to mention one that gives away the final plot), and with the complex idiom of the American west (the colloquial complexities, arcane geographies, making it harder for an international audience), and you have a film that could end up being a trying, if not exasperating, experience.But the Assassination of Jesse James emerges from all this as one of the great triumphs of the year, leaving in its languorous brilliance a story of destructive mythification, paranoia and, above all, sickening fear.Director Andrew Dominick chronicles the story of the famous outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who, at the age of 34, is celebrated and mythified in dime-comics and legends, but is filled with self-loath and despair within. Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who grew up with a comic book idealization of James, meets his idol as he plans his last train robbery. Rebuked by James, Ford begins to turn resentful and pursues the path foretold by the title.Ford's eventual detachment from his childhood myths becomes critical in enabling him to kill James with cold-blooded planning, acquiring in the process a large bounty and the perhaps expected goodwill and heroism from killing an outlaw. But soon after, tables turn as Jesse James continues to live as a legend in popular memory, leaving Ford to confront the devastating implications of his act that question his moral compass.No doubt, the film moves slowly, but it does so exquisitely, exposing the nuances of its characters in slow meditative shots and conversations. There is a powerful dramatic tension that undergirds this film, and indeed heightens as it proceeds to its raw and thrilling climax. This languor, coupled with a deep visual sense and rich moods makes Jesse James an almost hypnotic literary experience.The acting performances are superlative. Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller and Sam Rockwell as Charlie Ford give sublime performances as men sickened in fear for their lives.Casey Affleck brilliantly creates a character as irritating and annoying as Ford, while slowly and persuasively exposing his instabilities and vulnerabilities in confronting his idol, and subsequently, his own life.Without an Oscar nomination, but as deserving, is Brad Pitt who lends the film an enigmatic and sensual presence, with a performance that ranges from moments of poignant despair to those of destructive paranoia. Unlike Affleck, Pitt's performance is deeply understated and is as languorous and rich as the film itself. The best actor award at the Venice Film Festival was highly deserving.Cinematographer Roger Deakin (Shawshank Redemption, Fargo) captures the marvelous palette of colours and shades that make Westerns to notoriously seductive, and is a frontrunner for an Oscar this year.Moody, visually transporting, and melancholic, the Assassination of Jesse James is a far cry from the romantic bravado of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and is as gritty and compelling as the very best in the Western genre. It is this year's Masterpiece. -----------------Deepak Nair",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Truly Beautiful Film,"This movie really caught me by surprise; I had no idea what to expect, it was one of my few blind buys on Blu-ray. It was amazing, I feel it was the 2nd best movie of 2007, only behind No Country For Old Men (I'm surprised it did not get Best Picture and Best Actor (for Pitt) nominations). The film was overall excellent: amazing cinematography (color contrast and landscapes), superb acting (I felt Pitt and Affleck were actually James and Ford, Rockwell was good too), story was calm and intense at the same time; the only problem I can see was that the pacing was a little slow, but it never lost my attention; I never really knew what was coming next.Overall a fantastic film; cannot wait to see what Dominik does next (rumor has it it is a work of Cormac McCarthy...

This is not a typical western shot-em-up, this movie is a historical epic drama which tells you the tale of a American bandit and the life he was going and the way he was assassinated.

All the affectation of a Terence Malick's ""Days of Heaven"" w/o the art - interesting b/c Sam Shepard was in both ""Days of Heaven"" and this clunker. Horrible acting; everyone except Shepard is trying to act like they are in an art film - arch without any presence. Shiitake mushrooms have more presence and are considerably less annoying than Casey Affleck. The cinematography is anti-Malick - instead of sweeping, beautifully exposed wide angles there are mid ranges with vignetting added to give it some artsy look and to make up for the bad exposure of many of the shots. It doesn't work. I can't remember when I saw a more pretentious piece of boring film.What happens when you give a bad film student with a Terence Malick obsession a bunch of money?

History is a vague affair filled with perceptions tainted with what we know to be true, not the truth, a tunnel with the end in sight not the tangents the provide context of a broader knowledge, But i suppose without a prize what incentive would there be for the winners to write it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A gut wrenching essay on the vanity of greatness,"What struck me the most in this movie was the crude realization of how little control one has over their own fame. Along the story you learn to love and respect Jesse James, through the elegance and clouded mystery of the character, to the point of forgetting his true nature. You can't help but feel, like the rest of the crowd, resentment at Robert Ford (masterfully played by Affleck), just a man who, albeit not for the right motives, went through a conflicting journey to bring down a dangerous criminal. Maybe Jesse James never had the intention of turning into such a beloved legend and Ford surely wasn't expecting the label of coward. Celebrity culture is a dangerous playground and your will can only do so much. After some point, you're in the hands of a crowd who projects their own insecurities and deepest desires on others, loving the free and brave Jesse James and loathing Robert Ford, who killed an unarmed man. That's why I think that, above anything else, this move is a critique on the vanity and transience of the celebrity culture. I mean, that ending is nothing short of perfect.
The not so good aspects: it could generally be a bit shortened and the transition of Ford from admiration to resentment felt quite rushed, but that may require a second view because of the subtlety of Affleck's portrayal.
Of course this could not go without mentioning the tremendous work of Roger Deakins. The train scene alone is only one of the finest exemples of the use of lighting I have seen and the dreamlike blurred edges and chromatic aberration in some scenes are just sublime.

Back to the Past....,"I am a connoseur of cinematic detail. Especially in historical movies that I have a fair knowledge of the times they depict. And I am often absolutely, verbally, anal. I drive my wife nuts on this but to me even a background set filled with accurate prosaic items is cause for a private gasp of wonder for me. Hey--someone conncected with the movie I am watching actually CARED about attempting to render history halfway realistically!Someone once said that the past is another country: ""They do things differently there."" Kudos to the screenwriter and the others who cooperated on this masterpiece. The dialog and diction (supported by the splendid cinematography!) transported me back to the late 1800s. The film seemed to me to be about as linguistically/historically perfect as it could possibly be. If the speech was not exactly ""factually correct,"" it nevertheless rang profoundly true. These old flesh and blood American characters probably and actually talked like this--a mixture of transplanted British courtliness and low-down--often obscene--countrified slang.The clothing was right there along with everything else. I don't believe I will ever look at Kirk Douglas or John Wayne with their smart and silk perfectly-knotted neckerchiefs below their ostentatious Stepsons the same way again.A word or two on the film's cinematography....

A gorgeous yet gritty post-civil war epic that lays bare the heart and soul of an American outlaw and his killer,"While lesser movies hog the limelight, Andrew Dominik's poetic, 19th century western sits understated yet assured in the shadows, seemingly content with the fact that its subtle pace and content will not appeal to all. Despite exuding a stylish sheen of continuous visual class, professionalism and beauty, in addition to remaining rich in detail and elegiac in tone, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford has a running time, pacing and plot that'll disgruntle many. However, more importantly, it boasts a divine showcase of aesthetic, acoustic and cinematic elegance that's anchored so aptly by the pin-sharp performances of leading actors Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The former: yet again displaying his miscellaneous ability as a now experienced performer. The latter: an absolute revelation.Adapted from the novel by Ron Hansen, the ten word title most certainly tells audiences the who and the what, but not the why, nor the how. These underlying questions are, in essence, the heart of Dominik's tale which begins with a melodiously tranquil introductory montage of the tale's forthcoming central character, of his family, of his criminal repertoire, his pen names, mind-set, severed finger and granulated eyelids. According to the omnipresent narration, the tale commences in Kansas City, Missouri shortly after Jesse's (Brad Pitt) 34th birthday. Following this harmonious preface, we're introduced to the outlaw's current crew of no-good petty criminals (including a superb Sam Rockwell) and the impending proverbial coward, Robert ""Bob"" Ford (Casey Affleck), an ambitious, Jesse-idolising 19 year old nobody yearning to be a somebody. Somebody like Jesse. Over time, as Jesse's caginess regarding his dysfunctional band of gunslingers creep disturbingly into sight, he and Bob develop an estranged friendship forged on reverence and commiseration that gradually decays leaving a pedestal of scepticism, jealousy, fixation and deception. Both men exude a constant air of unpredictability: their emotions bubbling vividly to the surface on numerous occasions. However, their outlooks on life and aspirations for the future couldn't be more apposed. Prone to suicidal bouts of depression, Jesse longs for a form of spiritual respite he knows can only come via one grave route. Bob, on the other hand, craves the long-overdue recognition of his peers and the public and the fame and supposed fortune that comes with it. Clouded as their visions are, though, a series of double-crosses within the band of outlaws involving; infidelity, adulteration, persecution and deceit lead to a fair share of bloodletting which inevitably paves the way for a moving climax which exemplifies the downfall of the legend and the defining of the coward.Despite having one of Hollywood's leading men at the forefront, The Assassination of Jesse James is by no means glorified by the mere presence of its male lead who, allegedly, had it justly printed in his contract that the title of the film was not to changed. In this, Dominik's second feature, we see Pitt in an irregular yet unforgettable role in which his million dollar face is paraded not as a shrewd marketing tool, but a landscape of emotions awash with pain and distress, strife and paranoia, fear and depression. Pitt's deranged, dead-behind-the-eyes look is the unadulterated core of what has to be considered as his finest performance to date. Cold, moody, unsettling: Pitt delivers a multi-layered performance of a man in whom suspicion, grief, insomnia and misery suffer a series of head-on-collisions. Resulting in memorable screen performance that's equalled, if not surpassed, by the young Casey Affleck. Quite simply, Affleck is phenomenal as the unhinged, self-indulgent assassin, Ford. His odious, erratic and sometimes snivelling portrayal of the wanna-be outlaw is as fine-tuned, heartfelt and effective as that of co-star Pitt's, if not so: more. Affleck's performance emerges as one of the film's genuine high-points; excelling far beyond the confines of the expected yet emotional climax; radiating sheer acting impeccability, class and awe throughout; provoking pity, spite, disgust, anger and ultimate sympathy from a compelled audience.Sticking relatively close to the principles aired throughout his debut urban cult-classic Chopper, Dominik is able to present another in-depth dissection of the emotionally complex mind of a murderous criminal renowned with notoriety yet an estranged sense of heroism. Don't expect to see any self-inflicted earlobe hacking or mother-in-law thrashings here, though. Despite preserving similar theses to Chopper such as; mistrust, confusion, obsession, fear of death, fear of life, fear of friend and foe, Dominik has approached The Assassination of Jesse James in a much more patient, less explicit and tantalising manner: integrating a host of prosaic, figurative dialogue that is given clarity, precision and cinematic cohesion by the consistently stunning aesthetics.With Roger Deakins on photography, the visuals couldn't really fail. Bringing a distinct element of experience to the production, Deakins is able to speak to the audience in visual terms using; wheat-fields, sunsets; land, snow and sky scape's as vividly and expressively as writers use words.Nick Cave's harmoniously soft yet menacing score further aids the subtle mood of the tale. How it failed to even be nominated for the Academy Award for best original score remains the bitterest of mysteries. Together with Deakins, though, the atmosphere created by the visual: audio components are as bolstering to Dominik's feature as the polished performances of his leading men. Least I forget Hugh Ross's pitch perfect omniscient narration- a character in its own right- which, quite simply, ties the entire motion-picture together with veritable sincerity and style.IN SHORT: Slow in places, stirring in others. Dominik's epic yarn will most certainly be met by the cold shoulders of many, but by the utmost respect of others. Laden with highly-convincing and even Oscar-worthy performances, The Assassination of Jesse James is as scenic and as a finely-tuned as any film in recent memory. Visually poetic. Lyrically distinct. Melodically immersing. But discreet it looks set to remain for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Empty Story,"Yes actors do their job, images are sometimes great. But that s about it.The story seems empty, the film is boring as hell and you only keep on watching it just because of the average advices : you wait to see what is so great in the movie and then you reach the end of it... Just feeling you loosed your time.There is not much more to say about it. But i have to complete more lines to be able to post this advice. So let s review who is Jesse James, and try to understand how you can turn a legend into a bad movie :Jesse Woodson James (September 5, 1847 – April 3, 1882) was an American outlaw, gang leader, bank and train robber and murderer from the state of Missouri and the most famous member of the James-Younger Gang.How with such a background can you make a movie where nothing happens... You will discover it soon if you decide to watch it. Already a celebrity when he was alive, he became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hauntingly beautiful, subtle and engrossing.","This is one of those rare movies that takes on a life of it's own. The cinematography & direction transcend average competence to blend seamlessly with the script, adding textures and moods as rich as any novelist's prose.The cast is excellent. Brad Pitt is in familiar territory as the charismatic but treacherous Jesse James. Casey Affleck delivers a very complex and courageous performance in the not so flattering part of the coward Robert Ford. Sam Shepard, Sam Rockwell and Jeremy Renner round out a rock-solid lineup.An action thriller this is not. The plot is very unhurried, but with a bit of patience, you will be rewarded with a complex and fascinating tale.

Art!,"This one's a bit of an odd one for me: is it Art or Fart? It seems to divide opinions up the middle; me, I'm in the middle  I liked it to a point but much prefer Tyrone Power's admittedly unrealistic take on Jesse James from 1940. Which means I'm probably going to get brickbats thrown at me from both sides of the fence. To me, nearly all modern films aim or pretend to be Art, and you can't argue this has some beautiful photography realistic plotting and natural acting. Life in general usually has no great plot, why should a movie always need a completely cohesive one - refer to the classic Dersu Uzala by Kurosawa for a masterclass of languid plotting. What we're watching is still a fantasy: none of us were there in 1882 to know better. And all people are ordinary people unless they're hyped up into special people by media or gossip, so if James really was a charmless monosyllable psycho well done to the team for trying to portray him that way.Unknown slimy adolescent idolises renowned violent baddie, worms his way into his confidence and eventually becomes Someone by shooting him in the back. Looking into the dusty picture at that momentous moment did James really want someone to put him out of his misery or was that just guesswork? Pitt and Affleck play the duo locked in time and make this tick, Pitt playing Pitt with a cigar this time, and Affleck the uptight Coward speaking like Stepin Fetchit used to, no one else matters much apart from in the tension of wondering who's going to get shot next. There's hardly any crudity, sex or violence which is probably off-putting for a lot of todays audience used to it who maybe can't do it without it anymore, but to me there's still too much because what's there is all gratuitous. Favourite bits: the gang waiting in the woods to rob the train at night; the few times anyone laughed or smiled  life was tedious sure, but human beings will always find good hearted humour anywhere; nice attention to period detail, manners and speaking idioms, although so cleverly made not over required; the aftermath and taking the Ford show on the road.Why not simply view this as a useful appendix to Ken Burns' still staggering American Civil War TV series? It's the most stunning modern film I've seen for years - then again, I don't get to see many! Imho well made, thoughtful, colourful, cogent, courageous and I didn't look at the clock once to see how much longer I had to go. Based on that yardstick I wouldn't mind seeing the 4 hour version ... only not just yet. But  give me Tyrone Power any day!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Legend of Bob Ford,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)A newspaper man in an old John Ford film once proclaimed that when legend becomes fact, you oughta print the legend. Well, they've been printing the legend of Jesse James now for over a hundred years. He's been a Robin Hood at times, a cold blooded killer others. It's the old wild west conundrum: for every tale of outlaw heroism is a tale for outlaw ruthlessness.And now here's a tale that is as decidedly conflicted as the legends themselves. In Andrew Dominic's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Jesse James is no hero, even shown to kill a man in the same manner that supposedly made Ford a coward. But at the same time, James is also shown to be a doting and loving husband and father. His paranoia has made him ruthless. Though he does now have his reasons to be to be paranoid, its that very paranoia which has alienated those around him.The picture seeks to dissect the legend, not necessarily to get to the facts, but the essence of reality. In a way, it's striving for what Werner Herzog calls ecstatic truth. Though that's not necessarily aimed at James himself, but his assassin, Bob Ford. Yes, that is the legend that is most steeped in hyperbole.Was Ford a coward? The title would lead you to be believe such, but that's the irony. If there has ever been a more matter of fact title, I've not heard it. Some of said the title says it all in this case, but nothing could be further from the truth.Casey Affleck steals the show in his portrayal of Robert Ford, the young man who idolized, then feared, and finally assassinated Jesse James. He gives a mannered but electrifying performance. Brad Pitt portrays Jesse James as a contemplative but quietly menacing man, troubled by his increasing ruthlessness. Sam Rockwell plays close James friend, and brother to Bob, Charlie Ford. Elsewhere, in one of my favourite performances of the film, Paul Schneider plays the outlaw and notorious womanizer Dick Liddel. It's a film full of excellent performances, though none match that of Affleck's.The plot is lingering and lyrical. When the film debuted it played in a four hour version (there have been rumblings about a future release of this version, but other than a few select screenings there have been no solid leads). The picture goes off in different directions, with the ultimate aim of eventually coming back together, but without force or haste.The film opens with a train robbery, the last of older brother Frank James (Sam Shepard) who is weary of Bob. But Jesse takes him along, not so much because he trusts him, but perhaps because he enjoys the flattery of Bob's idolization. Eventually Jesse begins knocking off those who he suspects of going against him. Dick Liddel has been teamed up with another team member working on their own scores. Although he is close with the Fords, he reminds Bob at bullet proof not to betray him.Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Jesse's cousin, shows up at the Ford home one snowy winter day. Hite has it out for Liddel, who's living there, after he slept with his father's young new wife. Hite storms the bedroom and he and Dick shoot it out. Just as Hite has Liddel in his sights, Bob pulls the trigger. They must hide that Wood has been killed, knowing that Jesse would kill them for sure now. Slowly, fearfully, and regretfully, the Ford's are enlisted to conspire Jesse's arrest. Only after they it absolutely dire does Bob commit his infamous deed. Though we know it's coming before we even enter the theatre, the assassination scene's grace and poignancy are unexpected. And the way Jesse meets his end prods existential queries. Throughout the film action is frequently narrated in a calm manner by Hugh Ross, often simply telling us in words what is happening in screen. Where in many films that may seem trite, here it feels uniquely transcendental.Director Dominic is not satisfied to simply dissect the legend. The film is, quite frankly, one of the most stunningly beautiful films in recent years. Dominic and Roger Deakens capture the action with an unabashedly artistic eye. Chilling sky blues blend with the golden wheat of Alberta, evoking the aesthetic qualities of Days of Heaven. That film was admittedly a huge influence on the visual style of the picture. Dominic not only shot the film in the same fields, but hired the same costume designer (Patricia Norris). To top off the stunning look and mood of the film is Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful score. Cave is proving himself not only an immensely talented singer-songwriter, but a wonderful composer as well.If there is one word to describe The Assassination of Jesse James, it is undoubtedly beautiful. Which is not to say that it's all look: the substance is also quite remarkable. The film held me in its grip for every minute of its length. Though I have not read the source material, the storyline and approach to the legends of Jesse James and Bob Ford I suspect owes much to the book. Much of the narration sounds like it may have been taken verbatim from the book.This is a highly ambitious film, and one that I will unreservedly stand behind. There are usually only a few films that hint at a lasting reputation for greatness. I think this is one of them, and that will be recognized in time. And I'll stand by that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford - The Best Film of 2007,"Every year there's a movie that takes your breath away. Every year there's a movie that you become obsessed with. Every year there comes a movie that sets standards for movies for years to come.Well, I just found that movie.""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a modern day masterpiece. From the very first intriguing moment to the breath-taking end, ""Jesse James"" will make you come out of the theater feeling a whole rush of mixed-up emotions.Don't let the title fool you; just because the title tells you a very important event and who's involved doesn't mean it gives the entire movie away. In fact, far from it. ""Jesse James"" is not your typical Western. It delves into the lives of two very misunderstood figures in American history and not only tries to portray them individually, but tries to show the audience their very conflicted relationship.A chain of events is set into motion, that leads Jesse James and Robert Ford to their inevitable destinies.Although the movie is long, and spans 2 hours and 40 minutes, (the original movie was over 4 hours), the time flies by and the movie's over even before you know it. All of the amazing aspects of the film keep you captivated and there is never a dull moment.Brad Pitt stars as Jesse James, the famous or infamous outlaw that leads a double life as an insane, psychotic killer and a kind, always smiling friend. Brad Pitt portrays both of these aspects perfectly, being menacing and dangerous one minute, and kind and paranoid the next. You never know what Jesse James is thinking. Brad Pitt makes his character one to be feared, and yet one to be loved.This is arguably Brad Pitt's best performance, and his Jesse James will be the one remembered despite the fact that the outlaw has been portrayed on film many times.Casey Affleck co-stars as the ""coward"" Robert Ford, the 19 year old boy who has been obsessed with Jesse James his entire life. This is the performance that will be talked about come Oscar time. His acting is brilliant in this film. Every one of his lines is layered with many subtexts, and Ford's emotions are clearly written on his sleeve. However, Ford feels many emotions at once and they're always conflicted. Throughout the entire movie, you always see Affleck with some kind of emotion in his eyes, whether it be anger, adoration, admiration, respect, love, fear, or courage. He adds a lot of depth to a character that has been greatly ignored in American history, and makes you hate him but love him at the same time. Immediately, the audience greatly dislikes Ford's weak behavior. Then, as the audience's feelings towards Ford changes, so does Ford. He changes from a cowardly, awkward young boy to a man faced with a great destiny that he must accept. He becomes brutally aware of what he is capable of, and is almost scared of what he can do. Yet he embraces his fate, full of ideas of the glory and fame that he's always wanted. Casey Affleck puts his heart and soul into his line delivery and it clearly shows. He is not Casey Affleck, he is not reciting lines, he is not playing Robert Ford, he is Robert Ford.Another aspect of this amazing movie is the incredible cinematography and visual beauty, which we can thank both Roger Deakins and Andrew Dominik for. The movie looks like an old picture; the edges are blurred and every shot of the film looks like a piece of art. There are many shots of the beautiful landscape, which shows that despite the menace and betrayal happening in the film, there is still beauty in the world.The score is brilliant. I have never seen a movie and focused on the music so much. The music was written by Nick Caves (who does a great cameo in the movie as a ""saloon singer"") and Warren Ellis. The music really enhances the tone of the film. It has Western elements in the score, but has a sympathetic and foreboding mood to it. It's very pleasing to listen to and doesn't distract from the main action. The score symbolizes what's going on in the character's minds and hearts, and it fits perfectly with the dialogue and cinematography.Andrew Dominik, who is relatively new to the directing world despite the critical success of ""Chopper"", is the mastermind behind this amazing film. By merely watching the film you can feel the director's love for his craft. He wrote the voluminous and fantastic screenplay. He and Roger Deakins were in charge of the masterful cinematography. He gave a lot of insight to Brad and Casey's characters. He thought up the brilliant, visually-stunning ""train scene"". In short, he is a genius and is one of the main reasons why ""Jesse James"" is a modern masterpiece.This film is not for everyone, however. You have to go to the theater and be willing to submerge yourself into a fascinating world for almost 3 hours. You have to be willing to delve into Jesse James's and Robert Ford's minds. You have to be willing to appreciate the artistic elements of the film, such as the cinematography, the score, and the incredibly slow, but appropriate pacing. If you're willing to do all of that, then you're in for one of the best movies in recent years. You're in for an experience that you will not soon forget, and an experience that will stay with you long after the final credits roll.I give ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" 4/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The best Western-ish movie of this century,"It took me nearly six hours to finish watching this movie. Yes, I saw it twice. It's not too complicated to catch up or anything. But personally, I think this film is...a landmark. It deserved to see twice in a roll. It's very poetic and visually striking. This is, by far, the best Western-ish movie in this young century.As I said, it's Western-ish. Because it is characters study film disguised in Western genre. There is no such think called ""action"" to be seen (except some very violent scenes). The film is, to me, possessed by Terrence Malick-like kind of touch (cue, blowing grasses scene!). I really wonder what took Andrew Dominik (of critically acclaimed, ""Chopper"") seven years hiatus before direct this amazing second feature.If you want to look for any surprises, please look elsewhere. Because its title says it all (duh). It's about legendary outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) who eventually got killed by coward Robert Ford (Casey Affleck). The film opened with the last ""job"" of James's gang after almost two decades of all kinds of robbery. Jesse's brother, Frank James (Sam Shepard) decided to retire and live in peace. Jesse, on the other hand, decided not to quit (one can assumed that he didn't know how). He recruits Ford brother, Charley (Sam Rockwell) and his younger brother, Robert.Even though Charley is just another ordinary low-life criminal who didn't have any motivation in his own future, Robert has. Robert is a 19-years-old boy who idolizes Jesse since he remembered. He learned to be like Jesse in every single motion (at one point, Jesse asked ""You want to be like me, or you want to be me?). But the more Jesse shows his vulnerability like a normal human being, the more Robert questioned himself whether he might be able to step over Jesse's reputation and make a legend on his own name.One of the great things about this film is, they're able to make a full human being from two titular characters. Jesse is very bleak character who has two completely different personalities. He's a gentleman and family man who kept his secret identity well enough to not get caught. He's also paranoid madman and plain cold-blooded killer who is about to losing his damn mind. Only the other hand, Robert is simply...a child. He is a scared young man pretend to act tough. But when opportunity is knocking on his door, he over did it that it actually ruined his life.I've gotta say, Casey Affleck is a lead in this film (Academy Award nominated him in supporting role really made no sense). I heard there's a 4 hours+ version of this film which Brad Pitt has a lot more things to do. Well, I hope I will have a chance to see it. Anyway, both actors are absolutely perfect for the role. For Brad, this is probably the best role to date. For Casey, 2007 is the best year for him (with the lead in Gone Baby Gone and...this).I can see it why there's only a handful of people went to see this film (in America, of course). They expected for something but, in the end, they've got some completely different thing instead. I know, maybe you don't want to experience another ""Dances with Wolves"" (remember when was the last time you see this one?) I know it is decent movie. But that movie is boring as hell. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" will prove you wrong that a long movie doesn't always have to be boring.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
psychological study/ poetic docudrama,"As other admirers of this film have noted, the majority of those voicing complaint against this film are blaming it for being a bad Western, when in fact it isn't a Western at all. It is an elegiac domestic tragedy, a folk-narrative, a 'docudrama,'a psychological study of rural petty criminals and the myths they would like to perpetuate about themselves to avoid the pettiness of their lives. But it is not a Western. It has more in common with the old Robert Mitchum film about post-WWII moonshiners, ""Thunder Road,"" than with ""I shot Jesse James."" But of course, unlike ""Thunder Road,"" intended to appeal to younger drive-in theater audiences, the present Jesse James film is a straight drama intended for a mature audience. So the other complaint against the film, that it is very slow, is somewhat justified, but misses the point. This is not an action/ adventure film. I have no problem with those who do not like elegiac drams, but those who express disappointment that this is not a Western or an action film are simply off base. Why not complain that ""The Dark Knight"" is not a successful romantic comedy? This would make as much sense.Taken on its own terms, the film, despite its length, is sometimes painfully suspenseful, even knowing the story ahead of time, because what we are really watching are convolutions of character, where every real action, every word spoken or misspoken reveals a little more of the psychology and personalities of the characters. Also, there's no doubt the off-screen narration repeatedly hints that there might be a moral center to be found in the world of James and Bob Ford - but none exists. We certainly have some sense of what is wrong when we see it happen, but no real guide as to what is right.The narration of the film frequently achieves real poetry. The dialog is at once folksy and crisp. The acting is uniformly brilliant, even from Mr. Pitt, of whom I am no fan. The editing could be tighter in spots, but is frequently on target, given the quirky pacing of the story. The cinematography includes some of the most beautiful outdoor cinematography I've seen in many years. It's a sad story, but worthy of attention and praise. And no it's not a Western. But its a dam' good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The old west was a complicated time,"I am willing to bet that the end of the movie is given away in the title in large part because the relationship between Jesse James and the coward Robert Ford is so complex, and James himself so unpredictable, that there is still tension on the way to an ending that we know is coming. Then again, it's also true that not only is the assassination not the end of the movie, and the tension created by violence that we can see coming is, in most ways, more real and more satisfying than even realistic violence, such as can be scene in one particular scene in the recent Collateral when (note a possible spoiler here for that movie) when Mark Ruffalo's character Fanny is so unexpectedly shot.The first thing that struck me about this film was that it is much more stylized than the westerns that I have seen. It's difficult to make wide expanses of empty frontier look anything less than beautiful in an almost mythic way, but the time lapse photography and occasional textured shots of a brooding Jesse James (sort of like a film version of the movie's cover) give the film an almost futuristic feel, which is an odd but pleasing sensation to have in a movie that takes place in the late 1800s.We meet the infamous James gang as they are planning to get out of the criminal world at the height of their game. It strikes me as a time when the mostly agrarian American society was so in need of a hero that they, in many ways, accepted a man who was famous for robbing the very people that deified him. He did seem to have some of the characteristics of Robin Hood, but not many. Mostly, we can identify with him because he is clearly a good father who loves his kids, and for some reason even a brutal killer can gain sympathy from modern audiences for being good to his kids. He is also shown as a loving husband, but one can only speculate on how far his loyalty to his wife goes when he is away from his family for so long.Enter Robert Ford, played with striking effectiveness by Casey Affleck, who has appeared in an impressive list of films in his relatively short career, and now is credited above Brad Pitt. Not a bad career move! He has a fascinating story, not the least part of which is that his wife is the sister of the legendary River Phoenix and the also legendary Joaquin Phoenix. Casey has never been much of a leading man, and it is exactly that fact that makes him a perfect Robert Ford.Some have suggested a homo-erotic lust towards James from Ford, and while I wouldn't go so far as to call it lust, his hero-worship of James certainly permeates his life completely, and the assassination strikes me not as the most intimate that Ford can be with Jesse without sex, but rather, as a sort of If I can't have you, no one will. Although still, I don't see anything sexual at all in their relationship, but rather a lashing out of Ford, who so desperately wants to be accepted by Jesse that, after consistently failing, he resorts to killing him, the less painful of his two remaining options (the other being acceptance of his inherent inferiority and subsequent expulsion from the gang or permanent subservience).The other way that the story presents a surprising level of complexity is after the assassination, where Ford receives the fame that he always wanted and, for some expected and some unexpected reasons, becomes truly miserable. It is a strange exploration of the media's and the public's glorification of violence, as a man who terrorized the public is seen as a fallen icon and the man who killed him is branded a murderer.It seems that Ford's mistake is in so publicly glorifying himself, reenacting the killing in front of live audiences, eventually being heckled by the crowds for being a coward. The problem that he doesn't realize is that the public doesn't understand the relationship between James and Ford, which was always uncomfortable, even as Ford tried so hard to sidle up to James and be accepted as his ""sidekick."" When the assassination happens, James knows it, and so does Ford and so do we. The audiences watching the reenactment only saw Ford shoot James from behind, not really knowing that James knew it was going to happen and allowed it. Maybe even welcomed it.At just under 3 hours the movie is a bit long, but it is also a modern western epic, and there aren't very many of those. This movie will invariably be compared to other recent westerns, such as the astonishingly good 3:10 to Yuma, one of the best and most redeeming westerns I've seen in years. Like that movie, this one also has a spectacular cast who inhabit their roles and give us a look at the old west in a way that I didn't know was possible anymore. It seems that the western genre is coming back to life",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
bad boring movie,"I guess hiring Brad Pitt had to save the quality of the movie. In my opinion, my comic books are 10 times better than the movie. This movie is a waste of time to watch.

"A strongly acted, beautiful Cinematic Masterpiece.","To start of with, I will talk about the film itself. It is not just original, and different than what we usually see, but it had hidden meanings to each scene. A lot of people first talk about how it is so 'slow paced', but I, for one, think it is one of the best paced films ever. It's pace allows us to dig deeper into the story, and to have more feelings and thoughts, and also to allow us to see the characters developing. The screenplay is very effective, and if I had to pick the most realistically talked film of 2007, this would be it. As the title says, the screenplay does take it's time to gather into more and more complex issues, and until the 'bang' finale.The screenplay is also helped by the strong acting in this film. As you can see in the awards page, Casey Affleck got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role. Well, let me tell you, when you are watching him, you cannot really tell if his performance is Oscar-worthy or not. The reason is not because he wasn't good enough, but because it is so realistic, it almost doesn't seem like acting. His performance is so subtle, and I can see he took brave decisions too. I am glad he got the attention he deserved, and I also think he deserved to win the Oscar. Another performance that was just as effective in it's own way was Brad Pitt's. His performance as a bandit leader is also so well done, it is hard to really ungrasp from it. I believe he was underrated, and he did not get the attention he deserved(especially since he has never acted like this before). Sam Rockwell, who plays Charley Ford, also stays on top.The reason this film is so beautiful is not only because of it's screenplay and acting, but because of its absolutely gorgeous cinematography. I believe it should have won the Oscar(even though another magnificent film, There Will Be Blood won). It's cinematographer,Roger Deakins, really knows how to keep an impact. This film is probably the first to open my eyes to cinematography. It is probably the best I have ever seen. It is that effective. Not only was the cinematography great, but the Original Music Score was just as great. This is an aspect that I thought it was also greatly ignored at in the Academy Awards. The reason it could not get an Oscar nomination, or even be in the running, was because it had two composers. That is a real big shame, because I thought that all the music pieces done are absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing, and only support the tone of the film.This film is not only a masterpiece of this time, but I think that when it came out, it never got the attention it deserved. The director, Andrew Dominik, must be one of the smartest I have seen. He made the film what it was overall, and I think that in 50 years, the Academy Awards will be looking upon it as their 'one big miss'. Not only will they look at it, but other critics and fans will look upon it too. It is a film that gets better with repeated viewings, and one that deserves enormous praise.",,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful imagery,"This movie was so dramatic and thoughtful. The director took the approach of draining the colour from the entire film, as well as other visual devices to convey a sense of seriousness, depression, and a stew of other slightly negative emotions. This also enhances the starkness of the characters, setting them in more extremes. As my friend stated, by the end of the movie you feel sorry for *everyone*.It was an amazing film that I recommend anyone to see, but please be aware that it is a violent and serious film that will leave you feeling somber. There are some funny moments, but mostly ironic humour.I hope that this film gets nominated for many awards!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen,"Powerful. Powerful. Powerful. What more can I say. I've never wept at the end of a movie like I did with this one. The acting , storytelling, music, cinematography are all top notch. The interplay between Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt is so strong and only made more intense by the ending you know is coming. It still hits you like a ton of bricks anyways. A true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deconstructing Jesse,"The finest titles, think ""Damage"" or ""Misery"", are revealing and enigmatic at the same time. This one gives it all away, and in more words than I've seen on a movie poster in a long time. The title tells the story. So all the beauty would have to be in the way it unfolds in image and dialog, right? Wrong. ""Jesse James"" is slow for the sake of being slow. One hour into the movie, next to nothing has happened. To make things worse, Casey Affleck (Ford) equates ""good acting"" with ""poor pronunciation"", while Brad Pitt (James) stands, sits, shoots and smokes with his mouth gaping in a most unfetching fashion, no doubt a misguided attempt at developing a trademark expression. Their blathering is so winded you keep thinking the bugger might well die before the claptrap concludes. Think ""Snatch"" on sedatives. Only Nick Cave's signature score and Hugh Ross' quiet off-screen narration tie this thing together. And there's the small reward of Zooey Deschanel's brief appearance as Robert Ford's lover Dorothy Evans. Her three on-screen minutes outshine the entire rest of this three-hour movie. ""Jesse James"" is so boring and pretentious I'm beginning to think of it as Oscar material. Say it ain't so.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very fine piece of art.,"This is such a welcome break from the usual that I had to pause and give praise. The lengthy title of the movie essentially explains the plot, a synopsis of events leading up to the assassination of Jesse James. The title character at this point has become somewhat of a tragic Shakespearean hero, full of doubt and fear, and his mind full of questions as to the loyalty of his minions. Pitt's performance is admirable, probably his best yet and I have much admiration as well for Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, who effectively conveys a young man who loses respect for his idol as he grows closer to him.The real star of the movie in my mind, is the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, who use of subtle lighting, panoramic views of the Canadian prairies and the occasional blurred filters to convey a dreamlike quality when necessary. If I had one fault with the movie it would be that the poetic musings of these romanticized outlaws can be sometimes hard to make out clearly, but it is a small fault and it gives me good reason to watch it again, which I will very soon. Brad Pitt and Ridley Scott are to be commended for taking a hand in producing this lovely bit of cinema, it is not going to be a big money maker but certainly a work that all who were involved with must be very proud of. I always wonder if the western will ever become a genre that will run out of steam due to a sense of it's all been done now. After watching this, I can say that the western may never die as a genre. Absolutely beautiful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A True Masterpiece,Possibly one of the most criminally underrated movies of my lifetime. The performances are spot-on by everyone involved. Casey Affleck is an absolute revelation in this film. Jesse James couldn't be more perfectly cast in Brad Pitt and the cinematography (as said many times before by more qualified folks than myself) is stunning. This is a classic in the truest sense.

A heartbreaking study of hero worship and it's consequences,"It's been a long time since a film brought tears to my eyes, not just for the emotional finish (which it has), but rather for the sheer joy of watching a true work of art. From the first frame to the last, I was spellbound by the sheer beauty of this study of two men, one a sociopath outlaw, the other a naive young man who worships him.Under the sure hand of director Andrew Dominck, the film takes it's time to tell it's story and this may be a problem for those who like fast cuts (I'd be surprised if the release on DVD contains more that a thousand shots). It is best to just surrender yourself to the film and be taken into it's beautifully photographed world.The music is haunting and deserved a nomination and if awards were handed out for voice overs and narration this would be the winner.The acting is top notch, with Brad Pitt as Jesse James notching a career high, in a performance that is both poetic and frighteningly cold. But it's Casey Affleck to whom the film belongs to. He may have been a best supporting actor in the eyes of the Academy Awards but it's really a best actor performance. Where other films have gotten it wrong in the depiction of Robert Ford is that they have made him a cartoon, while here we have a human being with all the failings and yearnings of someone who gets what he wants only to have it all fall apart. It is for this reason that the ending is, without giving anything away, emotionally wrenching.In years to come it is this very film that will stand out as the best film released in 2007. I look forward to the day it will be given the Criterion treatment on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The beautifulest film in the West,"First off, nothing I write here will be considered a spoiler, as the film does this itself. Unusually, even the title sums up the entire film, and the narration explains the forthcoming actions before they happen. So why bother with a film you know what's going to happen in? The Devil is in the details. The title does not convey the arc of Robert Ford's naive attempts to impress his childhood hero that sour into betrayal. The narration cannot show the strength of acting ability, emotions, tensions or sumptuous cinematography present in every scene. It's ponderous, certainly, but majestic and inexorable with it. The running time seems to melt away as the viewer is absorbed into the world of the charismatic but unstable outlaw and the ambivalent teenager trying to connect with him, until before you know it the arc has reached the conclusion of the stories.The cinematography really does merit special mention, it's no surprise the amount of awards this film has garnered. The landscapes are lush, the scenes are all beautiful and authentic, and there is such an eye for art that it will take your breath away. Possibly the most stunning is the arrival of the train near the beginning of the film, it's one of the finest shots that I've seen in the past year. It's a big film, it's a worthy film, but it's haunting and brilliantly realised, one that I'd hesitate without question to anyone willing to spend their time on it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yuk,"I thought that this tripe would never end. The movie was wholly aggravating and I think if I had to hear Casey Affleck snivel one more line, I would have wanted to shoot him too. The show moved at a pace akin to watching ice melt in winter, and nobody had enough acting chops to make you care whether or not they got killed. The cinematography was not bad but if I ever have to look through another distorted window I might have to rob a train, too. This bland fiasco could have been done in three minutes and the impact would not have suffered. By the end of the show I was thinking, ""Kill him already, maybe there will be enough time for me to do something more fun like get a root canal. Brad Pitt wasn't bad in this role, and he really knows how to read a line, but movies are for actors not orators. Somebody in Hollywood owes me nine bucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Underrated Masterpiece,"All the perfomances are excellent, especially Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck who bring their A Game and both give the perfomances of their lives. The Cinematography is stunning and some of the best in cinematic history, the writing is excellent and the direction is suberb. The music is beautiful and criminally underrated. At its core this film is a brilliant psychological thriller that has a very engaging story with brilliant characters that are incredibly complex and fascinating.

The Definition of Perfection,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Genre: Drama Runtime: 159 minutesHere's the thing, when the title of the movie is this long and the subject to the matter is told in the title, there is no element of surprise left in it then.Yes the movie is about assassination of the outlaw named Jesse James who was killed by of his admirers Bob (don't worry folks it's not a spoiler) However, the movie is so beautifully shot that every scene of the movie is worth watching over and over again, the cinematic style blended with lime sepia containing slight mixture of candle light takes and through the glass shots reflect that this movie is nothing short of a modern masterpiece and don't even get me started on the cinematography because that was just ""SHEER BRILLIANCE"" hats off to Andrew Dominik the director and screen writer of the movie, a big round of applause for Roger Deakins for his marvelous efforts in cinematography. The best thing director did in the making of this movie is he didn't miss any little things, every scene represents details of its ownThe cast and crew was picture perfect and the acting was spot on. Brad Pitt as Jesse James was the most real then real characters as if he was born to play the role and Casey Affleck's (Bob Ford) performance was unbelievably second to none. Equally brilliant performances by Sam Shepard as Frank James, Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, Jeremy Renner as Wood Hite, Mary-Louise Parker as Zee James and of course last but not the least Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford.

What Goes Around Comes Around...,"I thought that The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford was one of the best movies that Brad Pitt has been in since Seven. This particular film showed off the acting ability that Brad Pitt does possess, portraying one of the most notorious gunfighters in American History: Jesse James. The film showed some of the soft sides of Jesse James that was rarely written about in the newspapers. Jesse James was a family man with two children and had a wife that loved him very much. James was very cautious and would not let people get very close to him. In my book, a true coward would shoot another man in the back. It would be best to have a fair fight and have the better man win the gunfight. Plainly, if you lose, you lose. If you win, you win. Things have a way of coming back around when you have forgotten about the wrongs committed. It is like Clint Eastwood's character said in Unforgiven, ""We all got it coming, kid.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A breakthrough in western film-making,"An absolute masterpiece, and a breakthrough in western film-making that creates a unique experience as it captures the story of Jesse James poetically and intricately. Every single shot in the film is gorgeous in it's own way, providing the audience with intriguing dream-like images throughout the entire film, and truly capturing the raw and natural beauty of western civilization.Although the narration seems to be criticized by some, and is believed to tell the audience what they can already see, I believe it does an excellent job of creating a story-like atmosphere which is entirely necessary in the context of the film. We are watching a movie that is presenting the life of Jesse James in the format of a past-tense story, although the narration is not boring and does not have a Discovery Network blandness to it. It rather suits the content and is full of depth.Every scene is given the perfect amount of time that allows the audience to study all of the characters thoughts and emotions, it allows every single stare to be taken into account and examined fully. Andrew Dominik has complete faith in his actors to explore the characters intently with silence and gestures. Every single performance is impressive, beginning with Brad Pitt's complete embodiment of a mysterious, terrifying man and Pitt's every single small mannerism communicates to the audience more than any dialog. Casey Affleck's portrayal of a neurotic and obsessive coward is entirely natural and subtly creepy. Every single small role is played perfectly as well, with honorable mentions to Paul Schneider, Sam Rockwell, Jeremy Renner and Mary-Louise Parker.A perfect western that rises above the generally action-packed genre and studies a complex man on a quiet yet epic scale. A truly brilliant film that allowed every detail necessary to explore the tale in its fullness and stylistically portrays the story as a true piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Artful Slow Look At The Jesse James Story,A towering slow burn on the pitfalls of hero worship. A narrative on the myth of fame and how men come to worship illusions spun by media. The tale of Jesse James played by Brad Pitt with such skill and substance that he alternates between sympathy and menace with stunning swiftness. One of Pitt's greatest performances. Casey Affleck as the nervous butt kissing Robert Ford also gives his best performance in this. The slow pace of the movie makes its sudden violence jarring and that's how it probably was back in the days when America was still young. A thoughtful provoking movie.

Jesse James - Hero or Outlaw?,"What you have to first realise is that I am an avid movie fan - I have watched thousands of movies in my lifetime and as time works I have developed an astute sense of films - Whats good and simply whats bad. It is for this reason that I found myself utterly shocked after my first viewing of Jesse James. This is a film, not merely created as a cowboy similar to that of a fistfull of dollars or any of the new, more modern western flicks, this is a film of utter poetry.What works best for the film is its drama; make no mistakes, there are moments where you find yourself immersed in the film, to the extent in which you feel you are witnessing events as they take place - Another element, that of unpredictability is capitulated in Pitt's performance of Jesse and also Ford and the moment when he hopes to transcend the typical twenty year old stereotype - essentially, when is he going to kill Jesse? Moreover, the lighting and setting of this movie combined with the perfectly appropriate soundtrack and narrative are simply awe inspiring - this is a film truly made for cinema, coming with aces in all respects.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Modern Masterpiece.,"The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford currently ranks as my #3 of 2007.A film that has many things to admire. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the score.Brad Pitt is very good playing Jesse James. Not my favorite performance of his, but a strong performance.Casey Affleck absolutely shines in this film. Not only he gave the best performance in the film, he gave one of the best performances in the history of cinema. His portrayal of Robert Ford is nothing short of brilliant. The subtlety, the facial expressions, the mannerisms, the cracking of the voice. A performance that was rightfully praised and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (and should have won, in my opinion).The rest of the cast does a very good job. I'll highlight Sam Rockwell, who was amazing in the supporting role of Charley Ford.The direction is impeccable, and the beautiful and astounding cinematography becomes another character in the film.The score is, along with the score of Atonement, my favorite of 2007. Absolutely beautiful and haunting music that fits perfectly with the visual style of the film.Overall, one of the most important films of the 21st century.

The Review: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"This film was ignored. Don't get me wrong; I think the Academy picked some great picks for their nominations, but they screwed this picture. How did this not win Best Cinematography? How did this not get a Nom for anything else? How did Juno get a damn Nom over this? (Not that Juno is bad).'The Assassination of Jesse James' was a very exciting and moving film with beautiful cinematography, great acting, great script, and so much more. When the film starts out, it sets the tone immediately. The coloring; the music; everything about this film is all very well crafted to carry the movie to viewing bliss.The color of the movie is constantly a blue/gray, like an overcast; no sun showing through the clouds. To boost the look, a heavy yet light score is added with rumbling bass hitting in beat. The best example of this is the scene when they rob a train. Jesse feels the tracks for vibrations, and as the train comes into the view, and we see the light peaking in through the trees, all sound dies, and all we hear is the score.This film is great, and though it might not deserve winning Best Picture, it certainly deserved a nomination. Casey Affleck thoroughly deserved his nomination. He was very unsettling, and yet we felt bad for him, as we did with Jesse.The movie doesn't make you choose who the 'Good Guy' is to root for, because in a sense, no one is good, but no one is bad.This movie is highly recommended from me.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best of 2007,"One of the very best films of 2007 is THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD starring Brad Pitt as the infamous Jesse James and Casey Affleck as his murderer, Robert Ford.In the mid 1800's, the James brothers were the key figures of a gang centralized in Missouri most notably famous for robbing trains all throughout the Midwest. They were in many young men and women's eyes, saviors and modern day legends that broke free from the strain and boredom of everyday life, stealing from the rich, living spontaneously, questioning and denying the government. It was a life that many tried, but only a handful mastered. Arguably the most culturally popular man at the time, for his handsome and eccentric looks, his even yet dangerous temper, and his wily and daredevil lifestyle, Jesse James was envied far and wide; especially by Robert Ford, a young man who once only admired James from comic strips, preaching his law and emulating his gait and dress, but soon, through the connection of his brother Charley Ford, became one of his most trusted side kicks.The rest is history.JESSE JAMES is a beautiful film to look at with great cinematography of wide snow swept landscapes by Roger Deakins and authentic costume design, as well as an interesting and appropriate score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. But the acting really holds this film above the clouds with Pitt and Affleck both giving performances of their careers, Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford is also great in support. Pitt was born to play Jesse James as was Affleck to play Bob Ford.A great study of what these men may have been like, and how fate linked them forever.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A part of American history presented in a genius way,"This is an excellent example of a modern western movie.The new type of western began with Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" and now we have ""The assassination of J.J.""

Too bad for Affleck that he will have to wait for that Oscar. Javier Bardem was definitely better in ""No country for old men""I usually write larger reviews when I hate a movie so I'll keep this one short.One more thing...Can someone in the world explain to me how they nominate crap like ""Juno"" for best picture and leave masterpieces like TAOJJ out of the race??!?!?

A Poetic Elegy,"I just saw The Assassination of Jesse James this afternoon in New York. While I had an interesting cinematic experience, it was not completely satisfying.The film is meditative, poetic and elegiac. Which is to say that it moves at a slow pace and is somewhat obtuse. It is neither Peckinpah nor Sergio Leone, for that type of movie western you'll have to see 3:10 to Yuma.The film is not bad, it did hold my interest. But in the hands of a better director it would have become a true modern day classic like Eastwood's Unforgiven. Brad Pitt is very good in the role and Casey Affleck is great at creating a character that you love to hate; a truly breakthrough performance.I keep wanting to call The assassination of Jesse James an ""existentialist Western."" The only other film that I have given that designation to was El Topo, although the two films have absolutely nothing in common. While Unforgiven was a meditation on the nature of violence and killing, Assassination of JJ is a meditation on the pit falls of celebrity, even among the notorious.The cinematography is the best that I've seen this year and hearkens back to the work of Nestor Almendros on Malick's Days of Heaven. Roger Deakins will be remembered at Oscar time.I've often said that a great film by a mediocre director is not as interesting as a mediocre film by a great director. The Assassination of Jesse James falls somewhere in the middle, it's a good film by a director whose best work is yet to come",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good acting with a beautiful background,"This film is contemplative, poetic and not for impatient people. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford takes its time with every scene. It concentrates on words, images and expressions of the characters. There are lots of long close-ups but the actors manage them well as they also do with their roles in general. The film is full of beautiful sceneries from the American nature and the scenes look like video strips shot in the late 19th century because of their multiple details. The soundtrack fits in nicely. Excellent work altogether. The characters aren't introduced too well in the beginning so if the viewer wishes to keep up with the plot and the characters from the start, I recommend studying the history sources concerning Jesse James and Robert Ford before seeing the picture. This film isn't about twists and turns in the plot but the characters and the atmosphere. It's a historical movie so one can assume many viewers are familiar with the events beforehand. Because of the title, at least the outcome shouldn't be a secret to anyone.The film starts slowly but builds up the suspense towards the end. The last scenes are very intense and worth waiting for. I recommend The Assassination of Jesse James as a ""one-view"" movie, meaning that it is a good film but maybe seeing it once is enough. It's the kind of film that offers you everything it has on a single view. I enjoyed this film but I'm afraid watching it second time would get me bored.",,Anonymous,Biography
Test of Patience Pays Off,"Yes this movie is overlong and ponderous. I am not unsympathetic to the commenter's herein that the movie bored them. But the finer points of Assn. of Jesse James ultimately overcome such. While I can appreciate the observations that this movie intended to show the beginnings of American hero worship, I think this was merely a beneficial side effect. The Oedipal, homo-erotic undertones of the film were so palpable you could almost see them floating on the screen. I didn't read the book and don't know if such was fiction or nonfiction. Accordingly I don't know who to thank but the director and choreographer deserve considerable praise, as do Affleck and Pitt. Not a single actor overdid his/her role. In effect the tone of the movie was perfect. A good example is the various characters' reaction to the shooting death of Jesse's cousin, which was maybe unlike any movie death scene you have ever witnessed. Rather than callous indifference or emotional venting, the survivors remain poised and dignified and behave like people who recognize death as an ordinary aspect of life. As Robert Ford therein remarks, ""Lets wish him well on his journey"". Personally, I enjoyed the use of the English language, which appeared very carefully crafted to reflect the words, patterns and content circa 1880; e.g., delivered best by Afflect and Sheppard by the railroad at the beginning of the movie. Given the limited commercial viability of Assn. of Jesse James..., we should be grateful the film got made.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A crime that is too elegant to punish,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen. The direction, acting, and cinematography are superb. This is one of the few films where the dialogs are remarkably spontaneous as if they were almost the way how real people talk in real life. I was just stunned.I must commend Sam Rockwell's acting. He was really good. I always knew he had a talent and this movie brought out the best from him.The story has stitched the perfect web of entanglement that portrayed a poignant and discomforting human aspect.As regards Brad Pitt's acting, I must say that he had some good and bad points.First, it was not the way real men cry. When alpha men cry, they must not show facial expressions of sadness; when they cry, the tears just flow and when somebody catches them crying, they deny it as if they never cried. Brad Pitt failed to portray this in more than three instances.Brad Pitt cannot avoid having to show off his pretty boy image when he does his cute expressions that they make him appear he wanted to appear in his 'cute' trademark shot. He did this, like, twice, which almost ruined the portrayal of an outlaw. It was just like, Pitt wanted to appear as a cute outlaw.Brad Pitt performed as demanded in most parts of the film, but I will still have reservations towards him if I were to give the Best Actor award.The scenery was powerful. Outstanding cinematography.The film showed a little more than what the story needed to tell. It would have sufficed to have told what happened to Robert Ford after he killed Jesse James in writing. Giving lots of details to what happened to him only added more insult to his injury as if rubbing salt to a wound. Denouement in this point was unnecessary.It is by far the film where I saw the best acting of Casey Affleck. He was able to take my approval when it comes to ""Surprised"" scenes. He did a good job. He did a great acting but he was not able to perfectly portray a character that was not his age. Although Casey looked young, several years younger than the person he is older than (Paul Schneider), his body language, mannerisms, and the way he talked always revealed his true age. I noticed them, thinking that Casey was young and before confirming his real age.It must be a crime not to commend the acting performances of Paul Schneider, Sam Shepard, James Defelice, and most especially Garret Dillahunt (Ed Miller). I could really not ask for more.Overall, this movie is great and to me, it will become a classic and an icon.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant character study on hero worship.,"Based on the novel by Ron Hansen, The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford is a thoughtful, and intelligent movie, looking in the celebrity and hero worship in the so-called Wild West.Robert Ford, played brilliantly by Casey Affleck becomes a member of the gang run by Jesse James (a mesmerizing performance from Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank. As time goes by, Ford becomes a friend of Jesse, who seems to enjoy the worship given to him by Ford. However as time passes, Ford sees the changes in Jesse who is becoming unstable, and has apparently being gunning down members of his own gang. When offered a deal by the law, Ford sees a way out, but has he the courage to do what needs to be done?Directed and written for the screen by Andrew Dominik, the movie takes it's time telling it's story. Although western set, it's not a proper western, in that there is virtually no gunfights and set pieces in the movie. Instead this movie is all about character, and what drives them.Although the main plot detail is giving away within the title, it's also a clever touch. On the face of it, that is what happens. However, as the movie shows, there is much more to the story than simply the gunning down (or assassination) of Jesse James. In fact one of the things the movie shows is what happens after this event, in relation to Robert Ford, and the effect it has on him.The performances from the entire cast are superb, but as mentioned this movie belongs to both Pitt and Affleck. Pitt has shown over the years he can be good with the right material and he's brilliant here.But this is Affleck's movie.Better known, to me anyway, for supporting turns in the likes of the Ocean's 11/12/13 trilogy, here he shows just how good an actor he can be given the right material. With this movie, I think he's perhaps moved his career onto great things.The movie is brilliantly shot by Roger Deakins, showing here, as he did in No Country For Old Men that he is one of the best, if not the best cinematographer working in movies today.Andrew Dominik directs well, allowing the characters and story to breathe. If I had a criticism, then I'd say it is perhaps slightly too long.But that is a minor flaw. This is a fantastic movie, and along with No Country For Old Men has got 2008 off to a fantastic year at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best movie of the last year!,"The first time I've heard about this movie, I immediately thought it would be a typical western with Brad Pitt wielding his guns, acting all Robin Hood... But when I heard that Pitt was presented with a 'best actor' award in Venice festival. It immediately caught my attention. The reviews were great and so I decided to wait for it on a DVD and check it out. And my God, did I not regret that I did! I cannot say for sure but it looks like the best movie I've seen to date! I's got so much depth, morality and truth that you want to believe in. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is unbelieviably beautiful, the direction by Andrew Dominik is flawless, the cast is superb and the leads by Pitt and Affleck are great. Absolutely astonishing experience. It strikes you so deeply and never lets you go. An unforggetable masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of the past year - along with No Country for Old Men and There will be Blood, another western based dramas.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Once upon a time in the zzzzzzzzzzzzz!,Too long and too boring. It starts well with the train robbery but after that stagnates. Its supposed to show the end of the era of cowboy gangs but it's so slow moving and nothing is happening that after 1 1/2 hour I turned off the TV. Boring. Even Brad Pitt whom I always admire as an actor seemed to me a bad actor in this movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Most Boring Big Budget film of all time,"Ignore the elitists and aesthetes who are swooning over this ridiculous cowboy travelogue with its beautiful photography.My god! - what were they thinking? Maybe it's really an allegory about the latent homosexuality of Jesse James and John Ford, If Ford had only mounted Jesse in the finale instead of shooting him; it would have been a more relevant denouement - given the sickening and slow slow slow paced evolution of their ridiculous relationship by this ego maniacal and self indulgent director.Universal must be apoplectic - Pitt is brilliant but no one will watch this clunker who talks to a normal movie goer who suffered through it ahead of them.Yeek! - Unbelievably Awful!",,Anonymous,Biography
"Lighting and shadow, melancholy and pace.","Andrew Dominik's 2007-western is easily one of the most haunting and beautiful western-movies made. Casting Brad Pitt as Jesse James was an inspired choice; he is a haunted man, and Pitt nails his performance with maturity as his underpinned emotions makes it one of his finest performances so far - but even more impressive is Casey Affleck's Robert Ford, a performance worth an Academy Award. THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a movie so beautifully shot that every scene is a jaw-drop; carefully structured scenes carries the movie with enormous inspiration as the slow-paced story creates a astonishing craft from the narrated opening to the brilliantly pulled-off ending. The cinematography and Dominik's eye for art makes this a poetic and beautiful western-movie.This is a movie utterly focused on the beauty and romantic aspects of the Wild West, as it in the same time keeps its hands perfectly on its cold, gritty story. Eye-candy doesn't seem as the right word; but this is surely one of the best-looking westerns Hollywood has ever laid their eyes on.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western","Few films of the calibre of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford emerge within the cinema these days - after all, it is difficult to envision a slow, thoughtful western with a running time as ponderously lengthy as its title being an easy sell to studios who it would seem have primarily lost interest in the genre in the first place - a fact the film's continual failure to pick up a distributor despite the presence of mega-star Brad Pitt is a testament to. But at the same time it is difficult to imagine a more compelling justification for the re-emergence of dusty trails and six-shooters than this one - an astonishingly powerful, engrossing and impeccably crafted modern masterpiece, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a breath of cinematic fresh air, and one of the most impacting films released in recent memory.Director/screenwriter Andrew Dominik has crafted a modern day epic of near unparalleled mood, the sparse script providing a lyrical, crushingly atmospheric revisionist western, musing on fatalism, celebrity worship, madness and the construction of a legend in a truly gripping, inescapably thought provoking fashion. While the film's staggering running time and slow pacing will be enough to deter many viewers unaccustomed to such genre conventions, the film's consistently claustrophobic fatalistic overtones, like a steadily tightening glove, and sporadic, casual bursts of visceral violence make for a taught and engrossing watch throughout its lengthy duration. The film is hardly intended to boast an M. Night Shyamalan style twist, its most impacting plot point revealed within the title, but is instead a treatise on fatalism, and the overpowering, inescapable mood continually palpable throughout is truly crushing and stunning simultaneously. As Roger Deakins' exquisitely composed cinematography haunts the viewer with desolate visions of a withering west (the sequence of the last ever train robbery by James' gang is a moodily beautiful masterpiece in itself), Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' eerily affecting score craft a mood like none other, fully immersing the viewer within the nihilistic realm of the film and wrenching their emotions while flooring them with the impeccable craftsmanship of the work on display.Staunchly driving home the resonance of the film is its powerful cast, each giving a masterfully heartfelt performance simultaneously making the material ring with realism and simmer with incendiary intensity. Brad Pitt inhabits the fragile, world weary psyche of the legendary titular character with pitch perfect muted ferocious charisma, impeccably essaying a character inevitably on the decline while feebly grasping at trace elements of his previous infamy. Behind Pitt's glimmering blue eyes lies the haunted glint of madness, and a single moment, where James lets escape a delirious cackle of a maddened laugh is the film's single most gripping and devastating moment - one of the most full bodied, masterful performances the genre has ever generated. As astonishing as Pitt's performance is, Casey Affleck manages to match him on almost every occasion as the similarly psychologically fragile Robert Ford, toeing the perfect balance between unnerving fanaticism and eerie resentment towards his idol James. However, Affleck refuses to let the audience dismiss Ford as an imbalanced mental case, and bestows enough fractured humanity after a life of rejection within the character to make his performance ring frighteningly sympathetic, a testament to the incredible talent of the rising star. Sam Rockwell also stands out, giving a subtle but powerfully resonant performance as Ford's older brother, Charley, shining in what might have dissipated into a non-existent supporting role in the hands of a less talented performer. Paul Schneider similarly impresses as an oddly verbose outlaw attempting to escape James' gang, and Sam Shepard is a powerful presence as James' older brother, radiating calm fury and muted power ever second on screen.Haunting, resonant and tremendously moving, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford sticks with the viewer for quite some time after its initial viewing. While those unaccustomed with the western genre may find the same faults here as with the majority of its contemporaries, the sheer emotional resonance, muted technical beauty and astonishing performances are enough to buoy the film into the realm of the most powerful and affecting modern westerns, and one of the strongest films of many years past, easily worth pursuing for those seeking a numbingly powerful modern masterpiece.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An outstanding piece of art!,"This movie is amazing.It radiates with excellent performances and it's own unique geniousity.There is no flaw in this movie.The screenplay is great,acting is great,direction is great,acting is great,production is great,....I really can't find the flaw in it.All i can think of writing is what's good in it so i'll just say what's the best thing in my opinion...It's character developing.The character developing is masterfully written in screenplay and masterfully portraited by actor's,especially by Brad Pitt and Casey Afleck!The entire movie actually follow's the story of Robert Ford and his fear respectful obsession with Jesse James.Now as we can see at the beginning of the movie it's clearly that Jese is his personal hero.He believes that Jese is the best gunfighter ever and that frightens him since he asumes that Jese is gonna kill him and the rest of the gang so they couldn't turn him in.The same opinion the other's share.Anyway,Jesse takes him under his wing and that's when the real trouble start's because pretty soon Jesse start's to believe that they might try to kill him even though he still hold's on to his cold blooded look.To short the story...This movie is not a regular western movie like bam,bam everyones dead.No,this is as i already said a piece of art.Which means that it goes really,really slow.It's mostly based on the mental condition of Robert and the rest of the gang since they assume that the best gunman ever is planing on killing them.They start to panic,they can't sleep,they always threat each other's,...and so on....Another great thing is that you don't really know,until the end is Jesse really trying to kill them all or not.That's one of the many thing's that will keep you on the chair through this movie.I watched this movie for like thousand times already and it's a masterpiece if you ask me.However it's not for everyone.Just like There Will Be Blood for example.It's the same kind of movie.If you like one of them,you like both of them.Anyway to end with my comment on this movie i will just say that i think that it's a movie that has to be watched,if not for the movie it self then because of the cast!Enjoy!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watching this movie was like having a session on the couch with my Jewish analyst...,"This is no way a typical ""cowboys vs. outlaws"" movie. It is a wonderful study of characters. What made me uncomfortable watching this movie is the other leading character Coward Robert Ford. In the movie, he is referred to as ""Bob."" In looks (my younger days) and mentality, I strongly identified with Bob in the movie. It was like taking a Fourth Step Personal Inventory in a 12th Step Program. This is the way I behaved in my youth. I was sort of a coward when it came to physical contacts but not in expressing myself with words. With words, I have always been courageous and even foolhardy.I was attracted to men like Jesse James in this movie. I had friendships with Mafia hoods while living in Brooklyn Heights, New York City. The higher up in the Mafia, the more I wanted to be their friend. They wanted to be with me because I was their alter ego. I was the smart college, advertising talent and goody-goody-two-shoes never committing crimes and even being truthful. Yet, they did not trust me as Jesse James, on a gut level, did not trust Robert (Bob) Ford.Watching this movie was like having a session on the couch with my Jewish analyst who looked a lot like Woody Allen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Beautiful, tedious and self-regarding","All right, all right, enough of the glowing reviews! three pages in, and almost every single review I've read is burning with praise for what many seem to consider a 'perfect' film. So of course I'm going to come off like a total philistine, but I don't care. I sat down to seriously absorb this film. After a very short while I was staring at the ceiling with my mouth open to catch flies, making tea, making more tea, fidgeting, picking my nails clean - anything was more tempting than sitting still and watching as the decade's most overlong and tedious 'art' film unfolded itself on the screen.I love the American Story - particularly westerns, of most types, and of which I think this film is one: something of Budd Boetticher's with a barrel-chested Randolph Scott; black and white shoot-em-ups on high speed film accompanied by stirring strings or some warbling tenor; Joan Crawford glorious in Nicholas Ray's ""Johnny Guitar""; revisionist life-with-the-Indians westerns; westerns made by Europeans (such as the VERY interesting ""Eagle's Wing""); ""Brokeback Mountain""; soul-searching 70s offerings such as ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"", ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales""; and, the crowning glory, Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". So I have, I think, an open mind, happy to give an unusual film a go. But so little happens in this film! - not just the lack of physical action - there's no inner life in these characters! They just look out of windows a lot! That's not an inner life! I couldn't wait for the end, and was relieved, and entirely unmoved, when it finally came. Despite being self-important and sententious, I didn't read into the film some crucial message about America's present sense of self. I think these kinds of films, taken from books (see also ""There Will be Blood""), are the triumph of a director's hubris over experience. The magic of a book may be said to lie in being able to explore the psychological drama in the minds of the protagonists over hundreds of pages. In the immediacy of visual media, cenic shots and men looking thoughtful/vain/foolish just isn't a good enough transcription.I don't doubt that Casey Affleck, and perhaps even Brad Pitt, are doing a very good job; but I would never recommend this film, as art, history, psychodrama, western or entertainment. Does that make me shamefully lowbrow? Oh well. For the ultimate slow-burner art film I'd watch Tartovsky's extraordinary ""Nostalgia"" or ""Andrei Rublov"", either of which knock the socks off this. Right now I'm off to watch some terrible TV movie or maybe scoff at some art.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

If you bore easily or have the attention span of a 5 year old then this movie isn't for you.

An Epic of American History,"Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse James (Brad Pitt) since childhood, tries hard to join the reforming gang of the Missouri outlaw, but gradually becomes resentful of the bandit leader.This film is a masterpiece of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Sure, Brad Pitt is hailed as a great actor (and he personally loves his work in it). And you have to credit the director, who made one of the most amazing cuts ever (around four hours). But this is Deakins.Getting the right look for a period film is a challenge. Part of it is the costumes and part of it is the language, but I think much of the job falls on the cinematographer to get the right colors, lighting and angles.

An underrated film that got overlooked at the Oscars.,"I don't' know why this film was not even considered for something other than supporting actor (which Casey should of taken home) and best cinematography. This film was made in the exact same style as There will be blood and was almost as intense as No Country. To some Brad Pitt in the lead role is a turn-off because of his heartthrob image but he brings in a great but yet eerie performance of Jesse James which is portrayed perfectly and not one bit of fiction in his character. The idea of the film was to get into the mind game between Robert Ford and Jesse James and they pull it off perfectly. Some may agree that is was too slow a movie but if you give it time, let the action scenes come when they are needed as oppose to every other scene. My advice is to give this movie a shot, appreciate the music and camera work and enjoy",,Anonymous,Biography
"Great movie, great actors, simply perfect","This is really a great movie, one of the best of the year.

Overrated beyond belief,"First off, when you go to see a movie with Brad Pitt cast to play a Wild West outlaw, you're bound to get suspicious. I mean, Danny De Vito doesn't play Batman, does he? Brad Pitt and Wild West simply do not mix, and there is no plot great enough to conceal this miscasting.Then there's Casey Affleck, whose acting skills (or lack thereof, which is a tradition in the Affleck family) leave you wishing someone would shoot him as soon as possible. His acting is unbearable, flat and one-sided. That's what he's nominated for Oscar for. Laughable.Then you get curious as of what genre this flick belongs to. It's definitely no western (with that much blabbering throughout the movie, all traditional western characters would probably shoot themselves in the first 15 minutes), it's no psychological drama (not with a bunch of two-dimensional, stick figure characters), and it only falls into a bad comedy category due to some unfunny jokes that some of the characters utter from time to time.Did I also mention that it's almost three hours long? Three hours of constant pointless talking, with only a couple of slow horse rides that take the characters to another location where they can continue to rattle their boxes just like all Wild West heroes used to do back then.Overall, I failed to see anything worthy in this movie. It's beautifully shot, and that's about it.",,Anonymous,Biography
Best Western Since Unforgiven,"One of the finest western movies this viewer has ever seen. There is so much atmosphere here it's hard to take it all in. Truly amazing cinematography with every device imaginable. As for the story it's quite interesting because it doesn't try to be too broad, it's narrowly about how Robert Ford's emotional state was such that his idolization of Jesse James turned into an all consuming paranoia...Ultimately leading to the ""cowardice"" way he assassinated who was at the time Missouri's most wanted outlaw.The eccentricity and malevolent ways of Jesse James are portrayed stunningly well by Brad Pitt. Its the framework the entire movie hangs on as there is simply no story without this infamous western icon being portrayed realistically...Exuding dark menace and creating palpable fear among friend and foe alike. James may be a folk hero to some, but Pitt shows him as a heartless and unconscionable empty soul. Devoid of a moral compass, James can shoot a ""friend"" in the back without remorse or pistol whip a young child experiencing no regrets. In spite of this unrepentant personality James was very charismatic...This is a juxtaposition certainly driven home by Pitt's screen presence-simply put, he is the ""Outlaw Jesse James"".This dark backdrop brings us to Casey Affleck's Robert Ford. With James you want him to get caught, but you like him regardless. But, with Ford I was as conflicted as was his character so miraculously inhabited by Affleck. Is Ford as evil as James? Is he sane or insane? Though not loyal is he doing his fellow citizens some kind of justice that he should be commended for? The answers, all of them, are being pondered in every frame here. What may appear to be a slow paced movie is so packed with morality plays it's nothing short of amazing. True excellence in directing and writing make this a wringing experience to watch. But watch you will and somehow two and a half hours pass with little or no regard.Do not miss this movie. Brad Pitt has already shown he can inhabit a character completely, here he raises his personal bar to the highest yet. Casey Affleck will, after this, be A-listed simply because he is able to stand toe to toe with Pitt's great performance, maybe even playing a more difficult character in the bargain and doing so with aplomb. Westerns don't come better...And to beat all it's based on historical truth!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of a Great Movie by God Knows Who,"Easily one of the most beautiful and riveting movies of the 21st century so far.As with many movies, however, it was likely sandbagged by its own trailer. I'm no movie mogul, but I see this not as a western, but as a gangster film. Brad Pitt is the don, torn between his real family and his crime family. The cameo by Sam Shepherd in the early going is brief but important. Contrast that with his willingness to eliminate any gang members who cross him. How is he any different from Tony on The Sopranos?Brad Pitt foregoes his usual twitches and grimaces and offers through his eyes, face and posture a tragic figure who knows he will be betrayed. The careful line he and director Andrew Dominik's walk is that we are not asked to sympathize with Jesse James. He is a stone-cold killer who pretty much got what was coming to him.Casey Affleck portrays Robert Ford in a similarly affecting way: we see his shifting emotions but we don't exactly sympathize with him, either.This is such a mournful, lyrical movie where everyone knows his fate - I mean, it's right there in the title! - but it's the journey that's so captivating.My one quibble is the narration. It's usually a sign you haven't filmed a coherent narrative or you haven't cut a coherent version of the film. When the narration starts telling viewers what is already patently obvious from watching the film, well, then you're venturing into Oliver Stone-level narration-for-moviegoing-d0mmies. Maybe it was Ridley Scott's idea. Frankly, I'm half-surprised there weren't any scenes of unicorns in this movie. Maybe one day they'll show up in a Producer's Cut.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Utterly fascinating,"I think the best compliment I can pay is this: even though it's lengthy, even though it's slowly paced, and even though it has nothing close to an action sequence, it's never boring, it's never predictable, and it's never anything less than utterly compelling. The two leads are fleshed out so deeply that, by the film's end, you know exactly why these two men are doing what they're doing, without need of explanatory dialogue or rich narration. And it's complimented by two of the best performances of the year: Pitt's rogue, mysterious, and near-evil outlaw contrasted perfectly with Affleck's quiet, awkward, and off-putting coward. I think it's fascinating how Ford is the real protagonist of the film, and how his consuming desire to become Jesse James culminates in a devastating and fitting finale. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography (I particularly loved the shots with the hazy edges) and the terrific score, this is a character study of the highest order.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"powerful, poetic, compelling","The title already tells the whole story and yet The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford still manages to enamor its audience with its powerful, poetic cinematography and compelling acting that you will forgive its flaws, which are few.Director Andrew Dominik really took his time (2.6 hours!), but this is established early on, and lulls you into the idyllic environs of the time. You realize later on that this was necessary, as this helps set up the unexpected moments.Playing Robert Ford is Casey Affleck, who is arguably nominated for an Oscar for Best Performance Supporting Actor when he was practically the lead. He was perfect for the role: his cracking voice and shifty manner, his feeble, irksome and spineless performance is exceptional, reminiscent of The Talented Mr. Ripley. He is able to mix showing his deep awe and fear of his childhood idol Jesse James, played by Brad Pitt.For the first time, Pitt becomes the character he plays in the movie and it's unnerving. He was the perfect mix of charismatic yet scary; you don't know when he'll snap so you're also kept on your toes just like the others around him. Disturbed, suspicious and agitated, he could be smooth and suave one moment, then unleash his wrath so quickly. Even when he had no lines, his face and gestures spoke volumes. You could imagine feeling very vulnerable, the way he'd look at people when he's trying to figure out if they were lying. He is at once tormented, charming, and terrifying.Pitt and Affleck successfully translate the complexities on screen: Jesse James is the fierce bandit who made people uneasy yet is able to evoke compassion; Robert Ford tries so hard to please buts ends up forgettable and despised.The attention given to the rest of the cast, which includes Sam Rockwell (as Robert's brother Charley), Mary-Louise Parker (as Jesse's wife Zee), and Sam Shepard (as Jesse's brother Frank) was distracting but they deserve their screen time. Roger Deakins must win the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar for his work in this film, as he expertly toyed between the stark, Spartan settings during the day and the more gritty scenery at night.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A western unlike any other you may have seen,"Revisionist westerns are nothing new. They have been around since the fifties when directors realized they could be used to explore motives and psychologies deeper than conventional good guy versus bad guy histrionics. In 1969 Hollywood gave us two radical 'revisionist' westerns in which the style of the movie itself was used to subvert the genre. Although radically different in tone, both George Roy Hill's ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" seemed to signal, if not quite the death of the genre, then a move away from the kind of western Hollywood had been giving us thus far. Since then, of course, westerns have been few and far between but all of them seem to have been influenced by this departure.Perhaps ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" moves further away than most from the traditional format. It certainly looks traditional. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography vividly captures, not just the wide open spaces, but the dark, lamp-lit interiors to great effect. And it sounds traditional as well. The writer, Andrew Dominik, who also directed the film, in adapting Ron Hansen's source novel, has given full voice to the quaintly idiomatic dialogue of those times. In this respect it is much more traditional than many westerns of the thirties, forties or fifties. In every other respect it qualifies, in spades, for the term 'revisionist'.For a start there is little action. This is no gun-slinging oater but a long, (160 minutes), slow, deliberate character piece. When the film begins Jesse's life is almost over. The narrator tells us of his past deeds and what has brought him to this point. He also fills us in on the psychology of the man with Brad Pitt filling in the rest with a superb, career-defining performance. This is not the Jesse James of legend, (although, of course, in the film he is accorded legendary status); no Robin Hood figure robbing the rich and giving it to the poor but a pathologically unstable man, no longer a boy yet without maturity. His brother Frank, (a superb but under-used Sam Shepard), is like a gnarled father-figure to him. This Jesse is an outlaw first and foremost, a cold-blooded killer destined to live on the hop or be hunted down and killed.Perhaps it is this lack of maturity that draws him to the even more immature Robert Ford. It has been noted that this version of events is really a study in celebrity or rather a study of the perils that celebrity brings. Ford is the ultimate fan but a fan whose final act of homage is to destroy the star to whom he's drawn. At one point Jesse says to him 'I don't know if you want to be like me or want to be me'. It also could be argued that Ford was homosexually attracted to Jesse were it not for the fact he comes over as such a pathetically asexual creature, at least while Jesse is still alive. Rather he becomes Jesse's whipping-boy and you may think, 'is it any wonder the worm has turned'.Much of the film's two hour forty minute running time is taken up with talk and talk that seeks to explore the psychosis of its protagonists. I can understand why this won't be to everybody's taste. We live in an action-fueled age and have short attention spans. This is a film that demands a lot from its audience and amply rewards us. It is a beautifully crafted movie, intelligent and thought-provoking. Dominik's influences range from Peckinpah and Eastwood to Terrence Mallick yet the film seems wholly original, unlike anything in the genre we may have encountered before.If Pitt is a superb, taciturn Jesse then Casey Affleck is a mesmerizing Robert Ford. It's a great performance from this young and basically untried actor who, in every gesture, in the flicker of his eyes, in the faltering speech, inhabits the part entirely, as much in his mind as in his body. He has already won a number of critic's prizes for his performance but is unlikely to pick up the Oscar. The Academy prefers showier displays which is why this magnificent film is unlikely to prove a success either at the Oscars or with the public at large.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Masterpiece of the genre,"Its Jesse James it must be a ""cowboy movie"", it is but it isn't. It's a drama set in the last years of the Old West. I often can't get my head around the fact when all this stuff was going on, here in England we were expanding our underground railway system. Ride the underground in London or or spend the time in the undeveloped states. Like everyone who saw this film, we are not going to really understand how hard life was for the majority of the USA in these times. The beautiful majesty of this film begs the questions.... Why didn't Brad Pitt, get best actor for this? After not winning for this, why didn't he get Best Actor for Moneyball? Why isn't he a 1 to 100 bet with the bookies to grab Best Actor for ""Killing them softly"" Casey Afleck also turned in a brilliant performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Did I begin a movie?,"So I put the DVD in the player and sit back to enjoy a good Western, but what happens? After a brief narration, there is at least five minutes of a bunch of actors in period dress talking 'bout fornicating with women, interspersed with Affleck mumbling to Shepherd. I'm thinking, has this movie officially started or did the director film some sort of rehearsal and accidentally put it into the finished product? Throw out any teaching of plot creation or advancement in this film. At about the five minute mark of this nonsense, I ejected the DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a surprise!,"I expected: good acting, great cinematography but a rather boring story  the title saying it all. You get: good acting, an excellent cinematography, a great score . but also a compelling story, a story about friendship, loyalty and human weaknesses. In the course of the film it manages to make you feel for Jesse and above all quite unexpectedly Robert though they are all in all not very likable characters. Here Jesse James is not a hero and Robert Ford is not coward  How the movie makes you realize that in an almost slinking, Robert-Ford-kind-of way, is the wonder of this film about, well yes, just two mortal human beings like we all are.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A solid modern day western that's absolutely worth your time,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) is a movie that I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows Jesse James towards the end of his career during his final robberies when his gang was made up less of friends and family and more of associates trying to make a name for themselves and some extra cash. We see how this transition leads to the end of the beloved Jesse James.This movie is directed by Andrew Dominik (Killing them Softly) and stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down), Mary-Louise Parker (Red), Jeremy Renner (Avengers) and Sam Rockwell (Seven Psychopaths).Everything about this movie is very well done and meticulously presented. The acting by Pitt, Affleck and Rockwell is outstanding. Their characters feel authentic and their body language, mannerisms and dialogue fit their characters to perfection. You really get pulled into the circumstances and can feel everyone's perspectives in every scene. Every character interaction is unpredictable and James feels like he's pitted up and that he may explode at any moment. The narration is very good and the storyline is well paced and fascinating. This is more of a character piece than an action movie, but the robbery scenes are good, as are the depiction of the circumstances after Jesse passes away.Overall, this is a solid modern day western that's absolutely worth your time. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pure Cinema,"The greatest movie of all the time for me for a number of reasons. The writing is perfect, music by Nick Cave is arguably the best I've ever heard attached to a movie. Andrew Domink is top tier director who doesn't get enough credit for this work. Brad Pitt's greatest performance, he hasn't acted on this level since then. Casey Affleck is amazing and one of the best working atm. Roger Deakins steals the movie with his greatest work, there isn't a cinematographer on his level with the way he captures light and imagery to tell a story. A lot of people do it just for show but his work is purposeful. It's a slight slow burn but worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic western,"This movie is underappreciated. I never see it show up anywhere on best of all time movies lists. Or even best of the decade. It seems to have been forgotten. With Andrew Dominik's new film, Blonde, coming out tomorrow, I wanted to write about this movie. It's carried by the two starring performances by Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck and the cinematography by Roger Deakins. The film's story isn't all that interesting, but it sort of carries its 160 minute runtime. The film's grimy yet beautiful cinematography sort of solidifies Roger Deakins as the GOAT of cinematography. Seriously the assassination sequence in the movie would make a good short film on its own. Roger Deakins was nominated for two Oscars that year and he should have won BOTH. Yeah There will be Blood (2007) also looked good, but seriously HOW DID HE NOT WIN UNTIL 2017. FORGET THE ACADEMY.

A flawed movie but it makes up for it by having great direction techniques,"Though long, this movie contains some pretty moving scenes and it's a great effort which retells the final months of Jesse James life. It's about a younger member of the notorious James Gang who becomes drawn to him but he soon fears him killing him and he thinks about doing the unthinkable. The soundtracks are moving and they're emotional and powerful. For a western, the actual gun-slinging is kept to a minimum as the movie focuses on the characters themselves. Dominik's direction is near flawless. He lingers long on shots and he captures the characters expressions and uneasiness. By using this style, he allows the characters to give near perfect performances. However, the film doesn't explore these concepts thoroughly and leaves it a bit too ambiguous. I don't like it when films spell everything out for me. Another feature the film lacks detail in is the female cast. They are insignificant and are reduced to mere cameos. When this played at the Venice film festival, it was 4 hours long. It was cut shorter since then but my issues with the length would probably be more bigger had it not been cut down. I don't think this movie is a masterpiece like many other people think but it's very close to one and it is rather underrated. If you like slower paced movies then this is for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A great recent film about friendship, betrayal and the Wild West","I had heard great things about this film, decided to see it, and was not disappointed. What had taken me so long was never having seen anything from Dominik before, and a difficulty with both Westerns in general and in taking Brad Pitt's acting seriously, although the allure and the mystique of the Jesse James mythology was certainly enough of a pull for me to eventually give this film a chance, and I was certainly glad in retrospect that I had the courage to watch it. I cannot overemphasize how great was the cast, the music, the direction, and the cinematography. Specifically I would recommend the film to those who like me would nary the thought of watching either a Western or a Brad Pitt-featured film. More films have to be made, not of action and special effects but, like TAOJJBTCRF, that get into the hearts, minds, and souls--the humanity, if you will--of the people with the holsters, guns and horses. Many kudos to Dominik, and I actively look forward to seeing more of his work in future.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I didn't like how this story was told,"(Flash Review)It appears to be a bunch of chopped up memories that are hard to tie together with a cohesive narrative. I guess they build up Jessie James's persona and how everyone is in constant unease or fear of him; even those close to him. The vague dialog doesn't equal character development either. The pacing is terrible and the screenplay is uninteresting and very dull because it is so scattered, meandering, hard to follow the narrative and doesn't have a destination. (Yes, he'll get shot) Go with the flow films can be good if they are intriguing or leave something to the imagination. Ultimately, this is poorly directed, conceived and boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A slow burn but worth it in the end,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a movie with a title that is much too long but fitting. Considered one of the most accurate portrays of the event that I knew nothing about before watching the film, this movie is a slow burn. It follows the last few months of Jesse James (Brad Pitt) life as he meets Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), does his last robbery, and goes through his own self- suffering. It is truly about the psychology of Jesse James and Robert Ford. Jesse James, who seems to be questioning himself and what he has done as he suffers through his own depression. Robert Ford, who has always been obsessed with the life of Jesse James even as a kid and the trauma he suffers through from killing his own idol.The film runs for 2 hours and 40 minutes which is both bad and good. It allows for a great build-up to the fantastic last 40 minutes that are easily the best part of the film but it makes going through the first 2 hours rough at times. Some things definitely could have been cut out. I sometimes felt they spent too much time on other characters when in the end, it really own focuses on three characters. Jesse James, Robert Ford, and Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell). Also, much of the film is told through narration, not by any of the characters, but just a random narrator (Hugh Ross). Sometimes this narration feels incredibly forced and not needed. In some instances, I can tell what the characters are doing through visuals and don't need a narrator telling me. It just feels like I'm being spoon fed information. Occasionally, the narration is needed, but I also felt they could have simply had some more character interaction instead to tell the story.The performances by the entire cast truly are incredible though. Every actor is giving a top notch performance and doing fantastic things in this movie. Brad Pitt manages to handle being the dynamic character of Jesse James while displaying his depression and his criminal persona. Casey Affleck perfectly portrays the betrayal the character of Robert Ford has to suffer through perfectly. If anything, these performances make the characters feel real and human, rarely does Jesse James feel like a completely cold person even if he is a criminal. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful imagery of fields, the sun, and snow and I'm not entirely surprised when we have a cinematographer like Roger Deakins who has been involved in nearly all of the Coen Brothers films and most recently did the cinematography for Skyfall. This film is truly worth watching even if the pacing could have been improved, it's worth it for the last 40 minutes alone which truly delves into Robert Ford and his suffering at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A country for young men,"With this, No Country For Old Men, and There Will Be Blood, we've recently been given a formidable apocalyptic Western triumvirate - you wait fifteen years (Unforgiven was released in 1992) and suddenly three bleak classics come along at once! Watching Andrew ""Chopper"" Dominik's second feature, you'll quickly realise it has as much to say about modern Western society as it has about its 1880s setting. Here are people - REAL people - who are so obsessed by the elusive nature of celebrity that they risk forgetting who they are. When James says to Ford, ""Can't figure it out: do you want to be like me or do you want to BE me?"", it could be that he is really asking, ""Who am I?"". James has spent his life building his own myth; perhaps the reason he wishes to keep Ford so close is because no one knows more about Jesse James than his biggest fan. By the end of it all, Ford's actions serve only to enhance the celebrity of James; heck, Ford needn't have existed at all - after all, the suggestion here is that James effectively killed himself.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' score at once twinkles like a fairy tale, but gradually descends through a kind of dark, apocalyptic malaise, and finally into tragedy, as James' steely facade is stripped away to reveal the depressive underneath. It's a new world for Pitt - a different kind of manic, miles away from his twitchy turn in Twelve Monkeys. His puppy dog eyes capture the madness and the sadness perfectly. He is upstaged, though, by Casey Affleck as the coward himself, and also by Roger Deakins' camera, which prowls the plains like a lonesome wolf.The pacing is slow. But slow never meant the same thing as boring - just ask Terrence Malick, or Stanley Kubrick, or Michael Cimino. Sometimes, they really DO make them like they used to.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Untouchable Masterpiece- A True Depiction of Masculinity,"This is an utterly captivating visual tone poem (like all of Dominik's work) that explains at great length, what it means to be a real man. A masterclass in just about every aspect, films like this make a very strong argument for cinema as the highest artform.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Slow and lengthy is the one obstacle in the way of masterpiece,"Somewhere in the four plus hours of film that New Zealand director Andrew Dominik shot for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" has to be a cut fully capable of winning an Oscar for Best Picture. This version, however, is not it, but it's beautifully filmed and supported by incredible acting. Length (157 minutes) and a few scenes that wander off just enough to deflate the plot's naturally thriving tension are the only hurdles too high for this underrated ensemble to jump.Based on Ron Hansen's book of the same title, ""Jesse James"" is a historical fiction account of the great American outlaw: the man, the myth, the legend (literally) -- Jesse James. It tells the story of how the young man Bob Ford, who would eventually come to kill him, joined the famous gang of bandits and how he came to commit the ""cowardly"" act that forever lived in infamy.Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck as the two titular characters form one of the more intriguing relationships on the screen. As the one huge name in the cast, Pitt is perfectly cast as James, a cold outlaw that creates tension by utilizing the fear of everyone around him. Affleck is the socially awkward Ford, who used to idolize James growing up. Now that he's become part of the gang, Ford's ideal image of his hero has been shattered. The transformation he goes through from being naive to pulling the trigger on James gives Affleck an incredible range to work with. He's simply under-appreciated in Hollywood or he's really selective.That's not to diminish, however, the talent around him. Sam Rockwell, Paul Schneider and Jeremy Renner have impressive chemistry as part of the James' brothers gang. The script provides great subtext for their characters, but each is capable of so many levels. One minute they're joking around and the next they're bullies or even killers.Lastly, cinematographer Roger Deakins does absolutely gorgeous things with the lighting of this film. From the onset there's the scene of the James gang waiting in the woods for a train they've obstructed to stop so they can loot it. The train's headlight shines through the trees as it moves and ripples over their hooded faces, elevating the anticipation of the first action sequence of the film. On the whole, ""Assassination"" has the look of a great cinematic tragedy. The assassination scene in particular is so visually memorable. All the deaths in the film, in fact, have that traumatic effect on the audience.Then there's length. Scenes just kind of get lost. The excellent ending really pulls you back in to the film and leaves a favorable impression, but many middle sections are too quiet despite the ever-growing tension caused by the inevitability of the film's conclusion. It's hard to believe there wasn't a way to edit this film to make it of both tolerable length and a bit more streamlined through the middle because this cast, crew and story is clearly worthy of more recognition for this first-class effort.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Underrated masterpiece,"This is not just a film; it's a profound cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. From the very first frame, I was struck by the film's breathtaking visuals. Roger Deakins' cinematography is nothing short of extraordinary, turning every shot into a work of art. The sweeping landscapes, the play of light and shadow, and the meticulous attention to detail all work together to create a hauntingly beautiful portrayal of the Old West. But what truly elevates this film is the depth of its characters and the performances that bring them to life. Brad Pitt delivers one of his finest performances as Jesse James, capturing the complexity of a man who is both a myth and a mortal. On the other hand, Casey Affleck's Robert Ford is a masterclass in subtlety. His portrayal of Ford is deeply nuanced, revealing a character driven by a toxic mix of admiration, envy, and insecurity. The tension between these two men, and the slow unraveling of their relationship, is the emotional core of the film.On the whole thing film is a meditation on the nature of fame, the inevitability of betrayal, and the tragic flaws that define us as humans. It's a film that challenges the viewer to think, to feel, and to reflect on the complexities of heroism and villainy. This movie is not just a retelling of historical events; it's a timeless exploration of the human condition. For anyone who appreciates a film that goes beyond entertainment and touches the soul, this is an absolute masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch this with your brain turned on,It goes without saying that Roger Deakins' cinematic realization was a master class. The film is beautiful to behold even with the sound turned off.I'm not a viewer who cares much about set design in general. But the authenticity of everything from the costumes to the homes to the blown glass windows was superb in this film. That it wasn't at least NOMINATED for a Production Design Oscar is a travesty.Affleck's anxiety is palpable in practically every scene. Brad Pitt's performance is one of his finest going from smoldering psychopathy to puzzled amusement. Ading Sam Rockwell's underrated performance as Charlie Ford formed a triangle of paranoia in Act III that culminates in the title. Admittedly I wasn't a fan on the first viewing but the second hooked me and the third cinched it.Don't flip this on to escape into an entertaining Western.

"Sensitive and beautiful, but not for everyone.","As this film already has more than a hundred reviews, I will not expound much about it. I would rather share with you my experience and my perception regarding the story.True, this film is a work of art, as many here has already exclaimed. The cinematography alone would move a sensitive soul. As with all works of art, even the most beautiful and revered masterpiece will not appeal to everyone. Watching a movie, like looking at an art piece, is all a matter of taste. This film is no different.The story is not fast-paced, it's not action-packed, nor would bullets be flying around in every scene. Jesse James will not show any fancy gun moves nor will he kill a thousand men. What you will see isn't about Jesse Jame's ""exciting"" life. It's about his death and how it came about in the hands of Robert Ford.I believe this story would appeal more to the person who can appreciate a slow building up of a plot, and who won't yawn at the absence of death and destruction. Kind of like the person who wants to know how a thing came to be, rather than what it can do. If you're like this, then you will be able to appreciate the movie for what it is. If not, it would be best if you skip it. An appreciation of a finished work is not solely about intelligence, it's a sensitivity for such things.If you can see the beauty of this film, however, it is a nice experience. Not mind-blowing, no. I doubt it would move you to tears, but it will be enough to make you sigh in the end.Movie is recommended, but not for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A great story, if you don't fall asleep...","This had potential to be an extremely good movie. It had potential to be one of the finest Western movies made in this decade. However, for some people it gives off the classic ""Did I watch the same movie that everybody else watched"" type of vibe. The movie moved slower than this year's Notre Dame offense, and had the excitement level of watching the Detroit Red Wings home opener. I am one of the biggest Western fans out there, but I struggled just to stay awake during the near three-hour film. It ends giving you a sense of morbidness, while some parts of the movie seem like more of a horror than a Western. Why do most people go to see Western Films??? Action!!! Action!!! Action!!! There wasn't even one good shootout scene in the entire film. And the narration just gave another weird sense of awkwardness towards the film.Some people are trying to say that this is one of the best Western films of the era, but in my opinion, its not even the best one of the year. The remake of the classic 3:10 to Yuma was much more intense and exciting than this movie.Yes, this is all just my opinion, and I'm sure many of you will disagree, but once again, a great story, but poor transitions and terrible lack of action and suspense.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Robert glorifies Jesse and finds him as his idol even though James is clearly not portrayed as an idol.The acting is very good. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck steals the show with their mesmerizing performance. However, it is not often I'll say that another actor is better than Brad Pitt.

Superior film will not be popular,"After leaving the theater and wondering how much I really liked (or disliked) what I had just seen, I came to the conclusion I would have to sleep on it first.After 24 hours, I couldn't get the images out of my mind as I replayed some of the scenes over and over again.One sure sign of a superior movie, in my opinion, is whether or not it makes you think, and then, think some more.The problem with most movie-goers is that they'd rather be extravagantly entertained than encouraged to think. And so, this will not be a popular movie. It will though, engender a strong group of loyal fans and will probably hit cult status in short time.Familiarity with the Jesse James story is not a necessity to enjoy the beautiful craftsmanship that was put into making this film, but it may help with understanding some of the motives behind the lawlessness that was the James gang, and their hatred for the railroads and why they were (at least at first) looked upon as a sort of modern day Robin Hood and his merry men.Yes, the movie is tad long (the only reason I didn't give it a 10), but it is deliberately paced punctuated by short bursts of disturbing violence, accompanied by a brilliant film score.The cinematography and sound editing are top notch all the way. Highly recommended for those who like to think.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" do you wanna be like me , or do you wanna be me""","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. It one of those films that pulls you in right at the start . The cinematography is just beautiful with so many unforgettable and iconic shots that you could hang each and everyone of them up on your walls as a piece of art. I've never been a massive fan of Brad Pitt , only when he working with Fincher do i enjoy him. But now, I just can't get his portrayal of Jesse James out of my head. he doesn't talk a lot but you know what he thinking , he forces you to dive deep into his mind , into his daunting world . This is thanks to the brilliant acting and writing. When it comes to his assassination, the suspense almost becomes unbearable and truly upsetting . We all know it going to happen but we never prepare ourselves for it.Cassey Affleck steals the film for me. When as Robert Ford , some will either hate him or sympathised for him. There every reason to call him a coward , In the law of the American citizens , shooting someone behind their back was proved to be act of cowardice. This is from a guy who Had to endure being laughed at due to his obsession with the James boys , being the the third child in which he states as the forgotten child . He may not become famous as a outlaw but he sure will become iconic when he is known as the guy who killed the almighty famous Jesse James. This is what he believe. When he sends a telegram informing the authorities that he has carried out the assassination with that grin of his face , you just can't prepare your self for the raw powerfulness of the final 20 minutes that is about to come.The last minutes of the film pulls out every emotion from you . There one thing that ties this film together and that is the poetic narration. His voice is calm yet daunting. It adds that extra depth of emotion into the film . Without it then this film wouldn't of been as good. There no such thing as a perfect film but this one comes mighty close. The art design the choice of camera shots, dialogue, costumes, every scene, every word, nothing is out of place. There not one scene which you will dislike . The soundtrack is another vital aspect of the film. The lighting , just to end the list, every single person who worked on this succeeded at using every bit of their ability into making this fine film.

Ingmar Bergman does 'Deadwood'. Not an action western.,"TAOJJBTCRF is a long dramatised documentary of what the title says. Some people here didn't catch the suspense that runs through it - basically who will die next? - and weren't seduced by the top-notch period recreation. Some picked up on the feeling that it might be bit of a Brad Pitt vanity project, allowing him to play a pantomime villain for once. He certainly does Jesse James like a cross between a young Burl Ives and a Midwest Tony Soprano. But for me, it worked. It sagged when the gang members became hard to distinguish, the casual disappearance of Frank James was a bit well, casual, and as others have said the pistol shots seem strangely muffled (a period detail?). To be honest you do get to the point where you feel 'I've watched two hours, I might as well stick with it', but if you take it at face value as a historical psychological study - of Bob Ford and of Jesse (and how the legend was what people wanted), and don't take it as seriously as it occasionally takes itself (the voice-over is a flaw in that respect), you'll be able to enjoy how beautifully made it is. It's epic without having a huge cast or massive number of setpieces, and rewards concentration, a bit like a long stage play put on screen. If you 'get' Ingmar Bergman movies, or liked Deadwood, you'll probably enjoy it. If not, move along, nothing to see here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just shoot him already!,"Of all this puzzling mess's fatal flaws, the one I find most perturbing is what was Andrew Dominik attempting to do with the repetitive panoramas of flying time-lapsed skies? Was it counterpoint to the mindlessly glacial pace of the script or simply a reminder that every other scene was going to be more of the same? More of Casey Affleck's whiny petulance? More of Brad Pitt's gratuitous scenery chewing? More marginal characters whose presence is never wholly explained or understood because they are all swallowing their lines in a desperate attempt to sound more authentic? It is a shame that a lot of the truly meticulous production values were wasted on a self-important story that could have been told far more effectively and succinctly. As many negative writers have already said, I want that 2:40 of my life back, and I wanted Bob Ford to shoot Jesse after about 30 minutes.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Last year's sleeper,"Inasmuch as Robert Ford, this movie feels like it was destined for great things. It truly is a pity it did not garnered more audience, for it truly is an epic. The story is quite complex but also gripping, the characters are simply fabulous, each and every one of them, as for the cinematography, well... the Academy got it right: it is quite the achievement. Also there are so many little details thrown at various points in the movie that, when added up, make for perfect cohesion and reward an attentive viewer.So, what can be interesting about a movie whose ending is predicted in the title? We already know what's going to happen, but the way we get there is so rich that at certain points we almost feel like Jesse James won't really die. And in a way, he doesn't, as the end of the movie shows. Regardless, this just goes to show that Hollywood is getting more and more on the right track to making good - but also entertaining - movies: focus on the story and characters people, that's all you need. Speaking of characters, Pitt and Affleck are both highlights, each in their own right. Pitt manages to completely submerge in his role: he's one mean, loving, vicious, conflicted Jesse James. Affleck has a certain thing - that I've seen in Gone Baby Gone - that makes him truly captivating in any role.But the one thing that really turns this movie into something special is the cinematography. Whether it's the stereoscope view, the nature shots or some specific scene like the train robbery scene, it all makes it worth wile your viewing, even if you're not a Western fan. For truly, this is a Western in it's purest tradition. One that's classic and modern at the same time.

"Simply put, beautiful","I can't say enough praises for this movie, a true masterpiece. From the beginning till the end it has shown us a side of Jesse James which none of us knew existed. To be honest, I didn't know much about Jesse rather than he was a outlaw, but this movie showed me his tough and sensitive side at the same time. Beautiful, gentle, calm and complex are the words to describe this movie. It is a long movie, but that does not show that it is diminutive comparing it to other westerns, but then, it is not a 'real western'. That is not a critic, but a praise. The time of old westerns has passed and the time of new, Andrew Dominik directed ones has come. I am surprised that this film didn't get multiple Oscar nominations, because it deserved them. The direction is flawless and I was surprised of the talent that Andrew Dominik is possessing. I mean, it's hard to create a movie from which a lot of people expected to be a 'yippee', old school western. The Director has made a masterpiece worthy of John Ford. The acting is probably the strongest link of this movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Cassey Affleck and Sam Rockwell, movie was fulfilled with their talent. Brad Pitt has probably made the best film of his career, and should have won a Oscar, sorry Daniel Day Lewis. Casey Affleck has received a nomination and my God it was deserved. It is hard to show a different side of a person that everybody hated and despised for what he has done. Sam Rockwell hold the film together, and is a balance between two forces, Jesse James and Robert Ford. All in all, I recommend this film to all people because it really has a message, which one I will let you decide.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Little Action And Limited Dialogue In A Movie Almost Totally Devoid Of Passion,"As I sat for almost three hours struggling to make it through this snooze fest I struggled to figure out how so many people can have so many good things to say about this movie. For some inexplicable reason, the longest and most boring movies often seem to be the most highly regarded (almost as if people think that there's some sort of artistic value in being able to put together a movie so long and yet so dull) but come on. For a movie with such a dramatic sounding title, this one is a major disappointment. There's very little action in it, the dialogue is extremely limited and delivered in a passionless monotone most of the way through, the sombre and slow musical score adds to the drudgery and even the narration is offered in a voice reminiscent of an elderly college professor who's gone over the same material year after year for decades and can't wait to retire and finally be rid of it. I thought Brad Pitt would put more energy into the role of the famous outlaw Jesse James, but he comes across as dry as the rest of the movie. Ben Affleck was maybe slightly more intriguing as Robert Ford but not much.The movie begins with the James gang's last major job and documents the beginning of the relationship between Ford and James. From the little I know about Jesse James the movie seems to be fairly accurate, but the focus of the movie is more on Ford and his gradual turning against James, leading up - as the title states - to James' killing. The look at Ford's life after James' killing was a bit interesting, although a lot was left out between the end of the stage show Ford and his brother put together that portrayed the killing and Ford's own demise (mercifully so, given the already excessive length of this production.) Needless to say, I didn't care too much for this movie. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
An unexpected beautifully crafted film with extraordinary acting,"This superbly acted, intelligently written, and beautifully photographed film might be this year's sleeper. Less of a western and more of a haunting psychological drama painted with a discerning eye on a sweeping canvas. At moments it's pace seems slow but it is usually in the service of building up the layers of paint in each characters portrait. Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford was inspired. I very much enjoy when an actor can convey a complex series of thoughts and emotions with subtle facial inflections and body language. You read the character in their complexity without the distraction of words. The rest of the cast, including Brad Pitt, all delivered solid performances. This is one of the few films where the voice over narration was eloquent and insightful further rounding out the complex story of these fascinating characters. The film was also beautifully crafted visually, the camera is never just a passive recording device but rather a brush artfully painting the story. I couldn't help but feel this was a labor of love by writer and director Andrew Dominik.I originally rented this movie not expecting much, rather to escape with a western for a few hours. But instead I got so much more and was so pleased at my unanticipated good fortune. I haven't heard many others talk about this film and it's a shame as it seems to have fallen under the radar for some reason. It's worth seeing, which is why it seems destined to be a sleeper, just waiting for others to discover it's merits.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stunning all round.,"You can tell from the opening shots and voice-over that 'Assassination' is going to be a good film. There are no credits and very little to introduce anyone before the James gang embark on their spectacularly shot last train robbery. From the outset the cinematography is breathtaking and as they block the track and get masked up the mist rolls and the music, second outing for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis after last years 'The Proposition', swirls in grand crescendos and fits the haunting night time scene. Brad Pitt is quite the Jesse James flitting from brooding intelligence to moody madness and Casey Affleck's portrayal of Robert Ford from bumbling simpleton to calculated killer and back again is almost as good. The story of Roberts obsession with James is akin to a modern day stalker and had the internet been invented then I'm sure Robert would have started many facebook groups dedicated to his childhood hero, it veers from sinister to just plain creepy. This then brings out the whys, why did James let the obviously obsessed Ford into his gang and inner circle? Was it a case of keep your enemies close or did he in fact love the adoration that ultimately would be his downfall? It posses more questions than it answers and in this respect gives the viewer plenty to think about during and after the film. My only criticism of the movie would have to be the length at two hours and thirty nine minutes it's quite the stamina test and I don't see why this couldn't be trimmed a little and still be as good. But that said strong performances all round, amazing scenery; a twisted tale rooted in truth and a great script makes 'Assassination' one of the best films of the year. A must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of the Myth?,"I'd always resisted this film, due to its title, namely the 'coward' part. More a case of a slanderous slur, rather than a criminal charge.After succumbing, I was swallowed in and was swept through this almost poetic tale of psychological slow-burning. The so-natural dialogue, the paced narrative that was near hypnotic. The colouring - the sparse, sympathetic music. The brilliant cinematography. The narration that was perfection; intelligent and lurid - counteracting the often bitty, scatological dialogue.On this, my second viewing, I was glad that I used the subtitles on the DVD. Casey Afleck's mumbled drawl is certainly in keeping with his character traits but not for following the dialogue. In any case, here in the U.K, we hear of subtitles sometimes being added in the U.S as a matter of course to tell the world what our regional actors are saying.The acting is, of course, absolutely first-rate and Brad Pitt, Sam Shepard (who I could watch forever) and all are totally mesmerising and believable.Yes, it is too long, only that I get restless, not disinterested.What to me is the icing on the cake was the prologue. The counteraction, the irony, the outcome. Which in some way goes somewhere toward addressing my initial concerns.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Worth Seeing.Visually: beautifully ethereal, much too long, but good despite that.","This is a fine movie.Better than 3:10 to Yuma, which is of course simply a very well crafted old fashioned horse opera.I don't know if it succeeds in what it wanted to portray about Jesse James, with too many brooding ""I'm squirrelly"" scenes with Brad Pitt.This movie would have easily easily been an Oscar nominee for best picture this year if it had had 30 to 40 minutes judiciously chopped out.There are some imperfect clumsy scenes including their take on the famous Jesse James assassination scene.That said, there are many many more great scenes in this film.It is intelligent,has a nice score, respects the viewer, and has a wonderful time warp ""ghost of history"" look. Casey Affleck steals the show from solid inspired performances by the other actors including Brad Pitt.The competent use of narration keeps the overly long indulgences of the film in check,barely sometimes though.This is clearly a case where they could not muster the courage to coldly cut beautiful well shot footage and tighten the film up.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bravo To All!,"This epic western may never reach the highest of heights or the greatest of wonders, but it is still one absolutely necessary to see. There have been lots of films that depict the outlaw, but this is one of the best: a revisionist film that tries to push the boundaries of what the genre can do. The only thing it doesn't succeed in is making it long. I am picky with slow-burners and about forty minutes could have been shaved off of this and the result would have been better. Oh well, too late.We never got anything about the young man that killed Jesse James, whose name was Robert ""Bob"" Ford. This is the chance to get more of a perspective of who the outlaw was from more than one point of view. And Casey Affleck nails it as Ford. It was a good call that Ben Affleck's younger brother could deliver a great performance too and a precursor to Casey's mammoth portrayal in ""Manchester By The Sea"" nine years later.Bob Ford was a young man who grew up reading about Jesse James and the James gang. Irresponsibly portrayed in texts as a fun, Robin Hood-esque adventure-seeker, Ford is thrilled when he finally meets his idol in the flesh. Not even twenty-years of age, Ford is able to talk his way into joining the James gang. After spending some time with him, both personally and during missions, Ford's opinion on the outlaw changes. He soon sees Jesse as a no-good killer undeserving of the fame he receives. Ford even sells out to authorities.Brad Pitt almost always shines in his roles and tackling Jesse James was no different. He is sympathetic while still maintaining the psychotic nature that the real James had.But the real star of the film is Casey Affleck. More nuanced and layered than his enemy, it felt that he had the harder job and that more paid off for him at the end. I already said this was a good nudge into his extremely powerful 2016 drama, but I just want to reinforce how underrated Ben Affleck's younger brother actually is. Brad Pitt may be the star and get top billing, but this is Casey's show.With some great filming and great music, perhaps nothing could save the film's slow pace that lags at times. There is about twenty minutes in the first hour that were dull, only saved by the return of Jesse James himself scuffling Ford's cousin. Prepared to forgive this section, the movie makes an even bigger mistake by having about twenty-five minutes after Ford kills James. The focal point is gone and the star changes even more at a faster pace. Instead of making the post-Jesse stuff twenty-five minutes, they should have cut it down to about five or ten minutes and had white text written on a black screen that explains what happened after. It would have been much more powerful that way.If pacing issues were fixed, this movie indeed would have been at the very top.3.5/4.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jesse James and Jesus?,"Anybody see a parallel between how the death of Jesse James was portrayed and the Biblical account of the death of Jesus? Obviously (according to the movie) Jesse knew he was going to die. He was approximately the same age as Jesus. And he had a trusted member of his gang betray him (Bob Ford in the Judas role).I don't know if it was the novelist, the screenwriter/director or Pitt who may have tried to parallel the ultimate hero and the anti-hero but I saw it very clearly.As for the movie, the only redeeming quality for me was the cinematography. The film was interminably long and had all the excitement and action of the dusty picture Pitt was looking at when he was shot. Had they released the original cut at four hours, I would have sought out the descendants of Robert Ford and had him put a bullet in my head.This was obviously a vanity project for Pitt and he obviously called the shots as this was the writer/director's first credit and apparently was there in title only as Pitt's stooge. Another case of the nuts running the nut house. What a waste of film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply amazing.,"Amazing. Simply amazing. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is not a movie more than it is an experience. One that takes us to another place and time entirely. And folks, this is about as good as they come. A deliberate and methodical period piece, this is masterful storytelling on every level with a brilliant score to boot. A true American epic with gut-wrenching performances, 'Jesse James' is nothing short of an art form. It will transfix you, it will mesmerize you, it will haunt you.Written and directed to perfection by Andrew Dominik, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' is filmed in the vast open lands of Canada. There's such a profound and unspoken beauty that reaches beyond the film with strokes of sweeping majesty. Words simply fail you as James walks peacefully through fields of grain, gracefully allowing his fingers to brush against the tall, delicate crops. Not unlike this year's heartbreaking 'Into the Wild', cinematographer Roger Deakins uses nature's sweet marvels to walk side-by-side with Jesse James in the telling one of America's greatest tales.Coming in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, 'Jesse James' is a brilliantly rich and textured story. This is not a typical Western filled with gunslinging cowboys and tense shootouts, but that won't keep you from hanging on every twist and turn this film has to offer. And even though we already know the eventual outcome walking in to this film, it's the poetically layered story filled with fully realized characters that will keep you glued to your seat. Laced with such a detailed narration that seems to have been taken straight from the pages of the source novel, this legendary story stitched into the seams of American lore comes to life with that very same power.Bolstering some of the year's strongest performances, one can't ignore Brad Pitt's piercing gaze that makes him a perfect candidate to transform into one of America's original celebrities. He's a man who has both everything and nothing, and a tight-knit group of comrades that is slowly but steadily ebbing away. As he becomes further isolated, his sense of reality slips away. Pitt's character transformation is subtle but profound, and certainly moving. But it is Casey Affleck's emotional performance as Robert Ford, the man who commits the fatal betrayal, who gives 'Jesse James' a hard-hitting punch to the gut with a downright dynamite performance. Yet another intense character study, Affleck takes us on a roller-coaster ride as the man who puts a bullet in the back of the man he once adored so much. How could a quiet, socially awkward young man who was never paid much attention pull off such an amazing feat? 'Jesse James' paints such a harrowing and tragic portrait of both men, one of the film's most redeeming and unforgettable qualities. Two of the best performances these two men can ever hope to deliver.There's a lot to be said about 'The Assassination of Jessie James'. It's a film for the ages, an unforgettable masterpiece that exemplifies the very definition of perfection. It's achingly beautiful, and unlike anything you have ever seen or ever will see. It's a story that still captivates us, but while this American masterpiece follows no set path, there are many themes that seem more poignant today than ever before. Because I believe the central most theme that can be taken away from a film like this is in fact its study of celebrity status. The fame, the glory, the adoration. Our society's extreme fascination with stars that borders on obsession, it can't be healthy. And perhaps there are things we can take away from 'Jessie James', straight from the mouth of the coward himself. ""He's just a human being,"" he tells us. ""I was surprised by what happened. They didn't applaud."" More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Patient, beautiful storytelling","Patient, beautiful storytelling sets the scene for the unlikely glimpse into the life of Jesse James less colored by infamy and vilification. We're offered instead a movie that revolves around the depth of the characters close to James prior to his death, namely Robert Ford and his obsession with celebrity.Pitt pulls off James' character with subtlety, cunning and a chaotic sort of charisma. The depth and detail of his mind are intricately explored in the silence between words and the way he seems to quietly look through the people around him. Casey Affleck's account of Robert Ford is also very well performed as an envious and emotionally unstable boy who covets the life and fame of Jesse James so hauntingly its almost uncomfortable to watch.The direction and screenplay are deep and thoughtful, building on a surprisingly rich history. The narrative and camera work are poetic and melancholy, using artistic lenses and beautiful scenery to vividly paint a background befitting the cadence of the story.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis compose a sad, quiet original score for this film that I am, of course, enamored with. There were several moments I was touched by the movie and hearing Ellis' lonely violin, I could feel emotion well up within me I could hardly suppress. I'm also a huge Nick Cave fan (which is actually how the movie came to my attention) and was very happy to see him make a cameo appearance.I'm surprised to see anything come out of Hollywood that isn't a brainless action flick and wish there were more films like this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fine Western Revisionism,"Since the release of Clint Eastwood's excellent Unforgiven back in 1990, the Western has slowly been making a comeback, especially in the 2000s, with films like the 3:10 to Yuma, the brilliant TV Series Deadwood to even foreign entries like Australia's the Proposition and South Korea's The Good, the Bad and the Weird. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is the closest out of the modern Western to come need Eastwood's masterpiece.As the title of the film suggests, this film is about Jesse James' assassination. It focuses on the end of Jesse James' (Brad Pitt) career and life and his relationship with Robert 'Bob' Ford (Casey Affleck). Jesse James was an outlaw in Missouri, with a reputation as a Robin Hood like figure. It starts out in a forest where Jesse James was with his gang. This is 19-year-old Bob Ford's first encounter with the man. He gets involved with a train robbery with the gang. Jesse James takes a liking to Ford, but Frank James (Sam Shepard) doesn't trust the kid. Bob Ford quickly becomes a member of Jesse James' gang, rising up the ranks and just happy to be with his idol. The gang act like as an extended family to James, even living with his wife and family. Sometimes Jesse James goes off on his own, and leave the gang with his family. But within the gang there are problems, Bob Ford doesn't get on with other members and some of the member even planned to capture James and give him over to the authorities for money. The gang take the mick out of Bob for his hero worship and this leads to him threaten them. The gang splits up and James derides Bob, forcing him to leave. Bob leaves the gang and plans his revenge. He sees that James wasn't a hero and ends up going to the authorities and works with them. With his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell), plan to kill Jesse James.This is a wonderfully acted, beautifully shot film. Brad Pitt is a great actor most of the time and this film offers one of his strongest performances. This is a rare performance as a villain and shows Jesse James as a psychotic thug. Casey Affleck is also excellent as the creepy Bob Ford. The film also has excellent performances from by Rockwell, Paul Schneider, Jeremy Renner and Mary-Louise Parker (an actress I really like). It also has a surprising performance by the Raging Cagan James Carville who is famous for being Bill Clinton's election adviser.The director of the film was Andrew Dominik, an New Zealand born Australian. This is his first film since the excellent Chopper. With his cinematographer Roger Deakins shot the film with a slightly wash-out look that gives the film a beautiful, but bleak view of the Old-West. A scene which shots Jesse James hand going along with grain blowing in the wind reminded me a little of Gladiator, which isn't surprising seeing Ridley Scott was a producer.The Assassination of Jesse James takes a psychological approach, and looks at the relationship within the group and between the character. It was an extended family. There is no glamour in their criminal lives and Jesse James slowly melt's down as a character. It also looks at the theme of hero worship and how meeting your heroes may not be that rewarding. It takes to take a realistic approach to the Old West. If you want an action-packed film then you are going to be disappointed.Unforuanately the film does have some problems. It is slow at times which makes the film drag. It also reminded me too much of Unforgiven, which was a classic. It was also easy to get lost with the amount of characters and the deals that were made.It's a fine 4 out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
thought provoking cinema,"This is director Andrew Dominik's meditation on fame, trust, the wages of sin, and the scary bond between love and hate, as played out by the legendary serial murderer Jesse James and his cohorts who caught the public's fancy during the post-Civil War westward expansion, just as Bonnie & Clyde and Dillinger did more than half a century later during the Great Depression.One could think of this effort as a sort of action film on valium, as it laconically traces the final days of the disintegrating James gang by exploring the crumbling relationships of its members under the pressure of law enforcement efforts to bring them to justice.Some have pointed out a resemblance to the films of Terrence Malick (which I can understand, especially Days of Heaven and Badlands) but I was also reminded throughout of Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller by the photography, gritty physical environment, linguistically archaic banter laced with jokes, melancholy and sparse musical scoring, and the parallels between Brad Pitt here and Warren Beatty in the earlier film (similar beards, behavioral quirks like a snorting laugh, line readings, and even a resemblance between their respective nostrils). But whereas Altman's vision was chaotic and fuzzy, Dominik's is merely ambiguous but sharply focused.The way James is presented we simultaneously loathe him for his brutal crimes and pity him for the pathetic corner into which his wicked deeds have backed him. Throughout the film he appears to alternate between trust and mistrust of his companions, and between sadistic misbehavior towards other human beings and loving care for his own immediate family until finally he allows fate to take its course – during Easter week no less, in a twisted retelling of the Passion whereby he is finally felled by ""the coward Robert Ford"" after he himself knocks off others in his gang whom he suspects of betrayal. Even this scene is edited so that we can't be quite sure what happened and who did what to whom.But the movie doesn't end with James's demise. It follows his killer, Ford, through his post- James career as theatrical re-enactor of the incident that brought him to prominence, and forward from there to his own ultimate celebrity-driven destiny.Dominik is helped enormously by the set and costume designers whose artistry steeps us in the look and feel of the mid-American late 19th century. And the cinematography of Roger Deakins constantly fascinates and surprises. All of this is held together by a lean, matter-of- fact but pointed narration by Hugh Ross which evokes Sissy Spacek's in Malick's Badlands and lends a formality and framework to the narrative.All the acting is top notch, including a brief bit by (of all people) James Carville, who fits into the late 19th century like a hand into a glove. But Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford is the standout: absolutely mesmerizing as he progresses from hero worship to bitter disillusionment in his relationship with James (Brad Pitt). But I got the feeling that any of the actors would have stood out as impressively, given the equivalent screen exposure.The director's original cut was 4 hours, but economic pressures evidently forced him to excise about 75 minutes. I can only wonder how the original vision was affected by this trimming. The release cut does drag in places, but this pacing problem could have been the result of excision of important connective material that would have given compelling context to puzzling or otherwise uninvolving stretches. Seeing a director's cut will tell the tale.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Amazing Film,"There are few characters in cinematic history that are shown and rehashed more often than the famed outlaw, Jesse James. Despite the fact that this persona has been portrayed from seemingly every angle, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, raises the bar to new heights. Hollywood superstar heartthrob, Brad Pitt, and the lesser known, but arguably more talented Affleck brother, Casey, play the two title characters respectively.The casting itself is genius. Having an unquestionably huge name portraying the also hugely famous Jesse James, and having a B-list actor playing the envious tagalong allows a clear sense of realism with their respective performances. Though Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will be Blood, is the early favourite for Best Actor at the Academy Awards, you can expect Pitt to at least get a nod. Casey Affleck has a very good chance at getting the golden statue for Best Supporting Actor. They are not the only noteworthy performances. The entire supporting cast does an excellent job with their characters, specifically Sam Rockwell, who plays Robert Ford's brother.The story follows both Jesse James, and his murderer Robert Ford. At the beginning we join Robert Ford on his quest to meet his idol, Jesse James. He has heard and read the great tales of James and has idolized him all his life. When he finally meets the man of his dreams, he is sorely disappointed. James is not what Ford expected. As the famed felon reveals that the stories are false, the pained expression grows on Ford's face. The rest of the story develops, as Ford grows angrier with James, before his dramatic murder. Even though the story does not try to hide that Jesse James will be killed (just look at the title) the film still does an extraordinary job of building the suspense for the event.This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. On every technical level The Assassination of Jesse James is magnificent. For starters, the cinematography is the best seen in film in over 10 years. Throughout the whole picture, the cinematography is so achingly beautiful it hurts. The landscapes, and the use of wind, combine for a visceral experience that sucks you into the picture and won't let you out. The dramatic use of light in contrast to shadow rivals that of The Third Man, which is no small accomplishment. The music is another aspect that is hit home by this piece. It is used beautifully to highlight a scene, where needed, and you cannot help but be swept away by it. Though, even more impressive than the use of music, is the use of silence. With music being used so extensively throughout the whole film, when it's quiet it is even more noticeable.The film is not without flaw, though it is close to it. Clocking in at just less than three hours, this film is not for the impatient viewer. Director, Andrew Dominik, takes his time slowly building up the suspense (which could easily be mistaken for poor pacing) for the gut-wrenching climax. If you are going into it expecting to see Jesse James jump off rooftops and kill seven men with a single shot, you will be disappointed. My only real quarrel with the film is the narration. It is used very well at points, but at others it is entirely unnecessary. The viewer should be trusted to sort what was happening rather than being told straight out. It is almost as if they are questioning the intelligence of the viewer. That being said, it is really a rather small quarrel considering the narration is used to great effect at other points in the film. In short, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a cinematic masterpiece and should be viewed by any film fan without a short attention span. ****/4.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sublime atmosphere,"I'm almost reluctant to want to review this film at all; it is both mesmerizing and languid. I'm convinced audiences will fall into either camp, though after the first hour it is nothing short of magnificent. Brad Pitt, who produces, said his preferred cut was 4.5 hours; let's hope it becomes available, though at 2.5 hours for the big screen, its half an hour too slow in its inception.Casey Affleck is exceptional as the lead character, Ford, though accolades have so far been directed more at Pitt for playing against type, which he has done brilliantly in the past in films like Twelve Monkeys, (True Romance anyone?). Performances aside, this is really a study on the pitfalls of celebrity, the folly of youth and perhaps reiterating the cry that last Born's do really want to change the world.The soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is exquisite, marrying with photography and tone perfectly, unlike some of the grating soundscapes they created, perhaps appropriately, for The Proposition.Kudos must go to Ron Hansen for his introspective novel, though Aussie Andrew Dominick in only his second feature as Director creates a sublime atmosphere, hanging on nuance, savoring tension though sometimes guilty of not cutting when he should. Let's hope his efforts don't go unnoticed while the media scramble around Pitt, imitating art, imitating the demise of Jesse James.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is cinematically on a whole other level, giving us brilliant acting and an accurate story - My Ultimate Review","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is written and directed by Andrew Dominik, it's adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same title. This is a film I've seen once before and thought it was excellent and extremely cinematic with scenes which stayed in your mind, I have thus wanted to revisit it and it holds up quite well. With its acting, direction, writing and cinematography which was done by Maestro Roger Deakins. His cinematography alone is worth rewatching this fine film. The musical score done by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis fits the tone and scenes shot so incredibly well, it's masterfully created like the whole production of the movie, the film's production design and all the departments helped make this into one of the best western films in history, an epic revisionist Western. What's interesting about their musical score is how it was finished before they began filming, it reminds me of how Sergio Leone worked with Ennio Morricone on his movies, thus making the scenes flow perfectly with the music.Taking place in Missouri in the early 1880s, the film dramatizes the last seven months in the life of famed outlaw Jesse James, beginning with the Blue Cut train robbery of 1881 and culminating in his assassination at the hands of Robert Ford the following April. In the time between these two fateful events, the young and jealous Ford befriends the increasingly mistrustful outlaw, even as he plots his demise.The cast is full of well known actors, portraying real life figures. Characters include notorious outlaws to lawmen and politicians. Some of the important roles: Brad Pitt as Jesse James, Casey Affleck as Robert Ford, Sam Shepard as Frank James, Jeremy Renner as Wood Hite, Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford, Paul Schneider as Dick Liddil, Mary-Louise Parker as Zerelda James, Zooey Deschanel as Dorothy Evans, Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, Ted Levine as Sheriff James Timberlake and James Carville as Gov. Thomas Theodore Crittenden. To name a few. The film received two nominations at the 80th Academy Awards, for Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor (Casey Affleck). In my opinion, this film should have been nominated for more awards, especially for Brad Pitt's performance as it might be one if not the best acting performance he have done. Of all the films made about Jesse James, his descendants have claimed that this is the most accurate. They were especially enthusiastic about Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck's performances. That's something you should think about when judging their performances, other than the normal critiques regarding acting, they nailed all that but also doing the real life counterparts justice. It's also Brad Pitt's personal favorite movie that he has acted in, he said. I also think the supporting cast does a terrific job with their performances, nailing the dialogue and accent. It's just a joy to watch these actors, who cares. Brad Pitt cared the most, it shows through every second of the performance but also during post-production.Cinematographer Roger Deakins used palettes of brown and black to produce a bleak yet oneiric quality to the film, reminiscent of the paintings of Andrew Wyeth. In one of the most well-known sequences of the film is the scene of a train robbery at night time. Roger Deakins used various cinematographic techniques to give the train more of a presence when it was in pitch darkness. Deakins' work is felt through every scene and every single frame, he should have won the academy award for best cinematography. His work in the film are mesmerizing and of the utmost brilliance. Roger Deakins called the arrival of the train in darkness is one of the high points of his career, that whole sequence is one of my favorite scenes in film history. Brilliantly cinematographed and just perfect in every way. Dylan Tichenor edited the film but left the production early to cut There Will Be Blood and was replaced by editor Curtis Clayton, who ultimately finished the production. The editing is actually quite great, the pacing is slow but edited brilliantly, making each scene flow well into the next. Great transitions. I do wish we would get to see the director cut sometime in the future though, which would have been edited quite differently, but I have no complaints regarding the editing in the theatrical cut. At one point, Pitt and executive producer Ridley Scott put together their own cut. When it tested poorly, they went back to Dominik's cut. The makeup and costume departments needs a lot of praise, their work is felt through each scene with their authenticity and hair and makeup. Something else regarding accuracy is how the sets used were extremely detailed and accurate to the time period, the locations used while filming helped immensely to keep the immersion and accuracy alive. They shot in Calgary, filming also took place in other parts of Alberta, including the McDougall Church in Morley, Alberta, McKinnon Flats, Heritage Park, the Fairmont Palliser Hotel, the Kananaskis area, several private ranches and the historical Fort Edmonton Park. The historical town of Creede, Colorado was recreated at a cost of $1 million near Goat Creek in Alberta. Filming also took place in Winnipeg in the city's historic Exchange District; the Burton Cummings Theatre (formerly known as The Walker Theatre) and the Pantages Playhouse Theatre.Los Angeles Daily News critic Bob Strauss gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and said, ""To put it most bluntly, the thing is just too long and too slow."" Strauss also said, ""Every element of this Western is beautifully rendered. So why is it a chore to sit through?"" Honestly, I don't agree it's too long, I wish we got to see the original edit of the film, which was envisioned by Dominik to be ""a dark, contemplative examination of fame and infamy"", an edit more than three hours in runtime. But then again, I understand why audience and critics find The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford to be extremely slow paced and ""too long"", the director sought to make an accurate adaption to Ron Hansen's 1983 novel. You also need to be in the right mood when you're watching this film, best not to be too tired but also to have patience in the longer more slower scenes, many scenes are dialogue heavy. There is more to the film than being a dialogue heavy and slow film, Andrew Dominik wanted to tell the story of Jesse James and did it brilliantly, giving us an engaging story with flawed and human characters, when the action happens you'll know you waited for something mesmerizing, something superb. Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A and said this and I quote ""The nervy style of this newfangled Western, with its eerie, insinuating score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is so effective that long after Pitt and Affleck have left the screen, emotional disturbance lingers like gun smoke."" I agree fully with her review and opinion. Cinematically, this film is impressive and well, a piece of art in my eyes. It's a film I'm glad I rewatched, this time older and with far more knowledge of the time period and characters. I can only recommend it, it's an experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Acting at its finest.,"If you are looking for a gun-blazing, high intense shoot em' up western, stick with 3:10 to Yuma. This movie is about ACTING and drama. Just under three hours, this film delivers acting at its finest. Casey Affleck, nominated for best supporting actor, deserved the award. No offense to any Ben fans, but Caseys performance in Gone Baby Gone and The Assassination of Jesse James blows Daredevil and Paycheck right out of the water. Brad Pitt does a very well job as Jesse James, showing his cold hearted and distant side from the rest of the cast. A few would say this is a slow movie, I would agree that it was more dramatic than anything. The ""slowness"" only added to the strong plot, without skipping a beat. Very strong plot. Very strong acting, as well as perfect casting. I give this movie an 8/10. Highly recommended for history buffs, strong acting gurus and western fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Film of the Year....quite simply.,"When one watches the Oscars you may assume there was only 5 films released this year: juno, no country, blood and etc. After you really become connected with these characters you'll see a real winner.The film captures the paranoia of James and the demented obsession of Ford. Also the razor tight rope wire his former gang members have to walk.Scenery and setting are beautiful. The drama slowly builds as you witness the transformation of a disorientated/immature boy into a confused young man.Acting is spot on, i thought Affleck was great until i learned he sounds like a bitch in real life. Pitt grows on you (im a fan but at first i thought he sucked)Astounding storyline which unfolds itself like ART BE WARNED you must have the time and attention span to appreciate",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Best Film of 2007,"I loved Control and I thought Into The Wild was extraordinary but I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that Jesse James is the film of the year.Its hard to know which amazing aspect of this film to mention first. OK, so the cinematography is a dazzling amalgamation of epic beauty and harsh, cold hostility.The script is literate, visceral and gives the actors enough room to breath without ever straying to far from the core of the story, which itself is skilfully and painstakingly told with delicate charm and wit, intermingled with scenes of violence and debauchery.The director, Andrew Domink has captured a moment in history that has been mythologized in American popular culture, and redefined it. This film is a place where realism and romanticism can sit side by side without fear of contradiction.The entire supporting cast performs admirably; but its the two central performances that really capture the eye. Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt are Oscar worthy for this work. Affleck is great as the borderline psychotic, homo-erotic, nave young man who becomes equally obsessed and disillusioned with Brad Pitts charismatic and chilling, Jesse James, who has more than a hint of the supernatural about him.Its easy to enjoy this film on many levels; technically its wonderful. The story is thoroughly entertaining and there is a visual and literary commentary on mythologized history and the nature of celebrity throughout.Also the instantly classic soundtrack adds a thick layer of atmosphere to proceedings.Its hard to find a weak spot, perhaps the film lingers a little too long after the key moment, but probably not. Overall, The Assassination of Jesse James is arguably the best western ever made, for my money it is, but others will disagree. But there is no doubt that this film sits comfortably in the upper echelons of the genre, alongside the likes of Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch and The Searchers.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A long and detailed look at the supposed assassin of the famous outlaw Jesse James,"With a long title, this long and serious film takes a hard and detailed look at the self claimed assassin of Jesse James through a soft, romantic and warm lens. I'm not familiar with the details of this famous 19th century American outlaw and the circumstances surrounding his untimely death. So, I cannot attest to it's historical accuracy. In this film, the focus is more on the motives of his would be assassin. For those not familiar with the circumstances after the death of Jesse James, there is a surprise in store near the end of the film. From beginning to end, there's plenty of biographical information, narrated, to inform those not familiar with the details of Jesse James and the story of his supposed assassin.Acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins provides some exceptionally beautiful widescreen Western style photography. For a complicated and dark story, we, the audience, are viewing it through a soft, sentimental, warm and romantic lens. Casey Affleck's performance as the assassin Robert Ford is convincingly complicated and serious.I'm a modest fan of old westerns and more a fan of biographical films of famous historical people. The photography and detailed narration initially drew me into this film. The screenplay, with it's carefully used and timed narration, works effectively throughout the entire film. Curiosity about the famous outlaw aside, the excellent cinematography of Roger Deakins and the acting performance of Casey Affleck, make this long film absorbing and engaging from beginning to end.2 Academy Award Nominations: Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins) and Best Supporting Actor (Casey Affleck).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful Cinematic Experience,"Jesse James is the mot well known outlaw in America. He's a wanted man who lives under a pseudonym and never stays for too long in one place. There's not a single soul that hasn't heard about his courage and bravery or the stories of his robberies.Robert Ford idolizes Jesse James since his childhood collecting everything related to Jesse and dreaming about being more like him or even being him someday.Robert finally meets Jesse but keeps getting teased and even tough he wants to join Jesse's gang he's never taken seriously.Robert gradually becomes resentful of Jesse and when he finally joins the gang he ends up killing Jesse(with Jesse's consent as I see it)... The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford tries to humanize and de-mythologize Jesse James and at the same time show who Robert Ford truly was. Jesse was not really a hero and Ford was not an evil person.Both are often perceived as something they were not. This is a beautiful movie. The musical score was perfect and matched the overall atmosphere of the film.Both Oscar nominations were well deserved, the film is hauntingly beautiful and Casey Affleck performance was truly fantastic.Obviously Brad Pitt was amazing as well and you should know he co-produced the film.A great film. 8/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Society's Mirror - Why this film must be seen,"This film has had what can only be called a tortured genesis. Having been in the pipeline for some time it disappeared shortly before its original release date of autumn last year. Rumours of production problems were rife and expectations fell very low. Now it has arrived, only a year late, and, in what has been a year of many good films but few standouts, this film has rode in to save the day. It is, quite simply, awesome.Andrew Dominik conjures three exquisitely detailed, well rendered and poignant portraits in this film: Jesse James, Robert Ford and a society that must be seen as not so different from our own. Brad Pitt is astonishing as James, portraying the paranoid madness of a man trapped in his own myth whose fascination with and fear of death haunts his every move. However, Pitt is matched by the brilliance of Casey Affleck's performance. Robert Ford is shown as a man obsessed with the myth of Jesse James who, through disappointment, rejection and desire, turns against the epicentre of his dreams. It is this fascinating portrayal that lies at the centre of this film.However, Dominik places this engrossing character drama against a bewildering social background. The two live in a society that has a government that allows murder when it sees fit and punishes it when it doesn't and a public that celebrates a mass-murderer and despises an assassin who shows no remorse. To delve any further in this would give away the ending which, surprisingly enough, is not the one in the title, but the questions that arise from this film are ones about society and its moral nature and the power of obsession on a personal and a mass level.If this sounds dull to you then you're in for a surprise. The film, whilst slow-paced and long, is never boring and grips you from start to finish. Much of the reason for this has already been discussed but credit must also go to the brilliant ensemble. Sam Rockwell is the standout supporting player and his performance is a career best. Then there is Roger Deakins' cinematography which is fantastic and Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' music which is extremely well used. But, ultimately, the showpieces here are the central performances, an interesting and stylish director and a pitch perfect script. This is certainly the most accomplished film I've seen for a long time. It doesn't invite comparison (though it deserves it) with Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", but the assassination scene is not only reminiscent of Leone's final shootout scene but is every bit as good.It may be seen as arduous by some but at some point, at home or (preferably) at the cinema, you must see this film for so many reasons  the technical brilliance, the incredible performances, the experience and, above all, the questions it raises that are some of the most important of recent years.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
So boring I could cry.,"I rarely walk out of or switch off a movie half way through. This was one of those very rare occasions where I feared that I might commit self-harm if forced to sit through any more of it. After what seemed like about 4 hours I looked at the clock and realised I was only about half- way in, if that and finally gave up.If you love deathly boring movies (There Will Be Blood comes to mind), this just may be your favourite movie.

You'll get some Vitamin D that way too.If you actually enjoy some mental stimulation, stay away.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poetic and haunting...,"Andrew Dominik's film is a poetic and haunting masterpiece. It doesn't matter how big your plasma screen is, you have to see this film in a real theater to truly appreciate it. Visually, it's an amazing sight to behold.I think the entire film could be read as a metaphor for the collective American psyche, both in 1881 and the present day. Like it or not, the US is a nation that was built upon spilt blood and this film embodies that history. It's a film that is both beautiful and brutal at the same time.All of the performances are strong, but Casey Affleck's performance in this film is truly remarkable. He certainly deserves all of the award nominations that he has garnered for this performance.My rating: 10/10 stars",,Anonymous,Biography
Revisit and demystify Jesse James.,"Western-themed movies aren't my thing, but sometimes I entertain myself by watching them. This was one of the most recent ones I've seen, and I wasn't disappointed. The plot focuses on the historical figure of Jesse James, murderer and bandit who went down in US history and was, during his lifetime, a social and cultural icon. Talking about him and his image is something that still arouses passions and a lively historical debate. This is not the place to check the veracity of everything that is said about him, but we can say right away that he is a figure in constant revision, and that this film was able to resist the temptation to follow James' mythology, giving us a more historically accurate portrayal of the character.The script doesn't give us an overall perspective on James' life but allows us to see how he ended up dead in treason by the Ford brothers, members of his own band. The film, directed by Andrew Dominik, is a slow drama, in which the pace and duration of almost three hours will surely keep the most restless audience away. There are moments of action, but they are punctual, and the entire film focuses on building and developing the characters, especially Robert Ford.The cast is remarkable and is headed by Brad Pitt, one of the best works of his acting career, at least in my eyes. He's impressive and commanding, and his presence fills the screen and steals attention with strong charisma and remarkable dramatic ability. Casey Affleck, too, was fully committed to his work and was happy in the way he revived Robert Ford. We couldn't demand more or better from these actors. Besides the two of them, the film also features good performances by Sam Shepard, Sam Rockwell and Paul Schneider.Technically, it's an amazing movie, starting with wonderful cinematography, sharp, very focused, with a clever use of darker colors and landscapes. The train arrival scene at night is one of the most visually impressive I've seen in a while. The sets and costumes also play their role very well, and they seemed incredibly rigorous and respectful of the period and historical context. The soundtrack fits the final result very well.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautifully-Shot Movie!!!!,"I just got done watching it - ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" whew... the main reason i went out and rented it was simply because i had seen clips and heard that the cinematography was absolutely stunning. it IS!i'm sorry, but the real star of this film is roger deakins, who also directed the photography of the ""equally-beautiful-but-not-obviously-so"" no country for old men. i think he is one of - if not the best cinematographer Hollywood has today! i am absolutely stunned at what an amazing eye he has! the scene that stole the whole movie for me though was the infamous 'train robbery' scene - where the ghostly white light of the train penetrates the darkness of the forest - revealing the masked robbers. the warm yellow smoke and lighting turns the scene into the most stunningly shot scene in the past 10 years. hands down. i am torn between this and 'there will be blood' - the Oscar winner... very tough...i also am AMAZED at how much talent the affleck family bestowed on Casey. his performance as Robert ford was so complete and breath-taking - i'm sure he would have won the Oscar had Javier bardem not taken his amazing role in 'no country for old men.' and brad Pitt - a star i hadn't thought too highly about until 'babel' is incredible as Jesse James. i am a bit surprised that he was absent from so many best actor lists... oh well - one day soon...AND THE MUSIC! technically this film is nearly perfect. i thought this was one of the most effective, moving, and beautiful scores of the year - in fact i think it could only be topped by the brilliant 'atonement' score. this should have DEFINITELY been nominated for best original score - i mean seriously - the 'michael Clayton' score is just a bunch of sounds - not music! wtf! if you're gonna honor James newton Howard at least nominate him for some GOOD music (hmmm - 'i am legend?') anyway - i am in the process of buying the main theme from the movie off of itunes. check it out!overall, i think the pace was just a HAIR too long, but not that much. the plot was a bit muddled and i found it hard to follow at times... i don't know about other people, but for some reason i had trouble remembering the names of characters aside from Jesse, bob, and his brother... that kinda messed me up a bit... i did watch it later in the night...so basically - i would definitely recommend this movie - if for nothing else that the shockingly beautiful cinematography and beautiful, lullaby-ish soundtrack. enjoy!*******/********** (7/10 stars)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great but no Peckinpah,"Long, sonorous and portentous film about the last days of the outlaw, and the man who killed him. A beautiful and immaculately crafted piece of film-making, it nevertheless seemed to me to be less than the sum of its parts. It doesn't have the withering analysis of the corporate world which was being moved into place with the death of the West which makes Peckinpah's similarly themed films so interesting. We are left with a really rather ahistorical study of a young man who becomes disillusioned with the celebrity criminal he hero-worships. Jesse is a charismatic psychopath but the film sidesteps his virulent confederate racism. The acting is certainly committed and compelling, although a trifle self-regarding; at times, it seems like the film is a gambit from Brad Pitt to sell himself to consumers as a ""movie great"". Afflect's studied edgy twitchiness is potentially an irritating affectation, although it seemed to me an accomplished achievement by the end of the film.It's a film with some great scenes and with real emotional impact. I just wish it had a little more historical or political substance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much Over rated,"At 160 minutes this glacially-paced film is at least 35 minutes too long. It's THE talkiest period western since ""Ride the High Country"" in the 1950s. WAAAY too much character development and not nearly enough gunplay. However, it has good period shootin' irons and leather, and sets the stage in Missourah. Not up to the standard of ""Ride w/the Devil"" but OK. Not enough Pounding Hooves, either, and hardly any Sweeping Vistas.Several reviews laud the cinematography. I admit: I do not get it. The camera work is OK, but much of the story occurs in the bleary drearidom of winter.Writing: the prologue is first rate. Some of the subsequent narration is pretty good.Casting: good to excellent, especially the 2nd tier players who really do look/act low IQ, Ferrell types. As we might expect, James carville is perfect as a sleazy politician (!) and I've not seen Michael Parks since ""Then Came Bronson.""Bottom line: if you see one western this year, miss this and catch the 3:10 to Yuma!",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Prickly, Murky and very Compelling","Plot:As his gang and legend begin to fragment, train-robber and outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) is a haunted man. He can feel his death approaching, but can he foresee that fringe gang-member Robert Ford (Affleck) will be the man to pull the trigger?My Review:Brad Pitt's career takes an interesting turn in this idea of a modernised Western based on a legend. At the helm of a two-time director Andrew Dominik, it's fair to say that new Western has likely left perplexed studio execs somewhat long in the face. It's also fair to say that we expected Mr. Jolie at the back of a greasy gun saying some ponderous if not idiosyncratic line to a enemy facing the other end of the barrel.The source is Ron Hansen's fictional recreation of the chaotic events that brought James-gang-hopeful Robert Ford (Affleck) to shoot his iconic leader in the back as he phased out of the frame of the picture. However, what Mr Dominik has given us is a unconventional thrill seeker, (all those expecting a thrill seeker may want to go get another thrill with more premise) a spurring yet slow and pensive poem-like film that makes existing luxuriant western outings seem less buzzing.Director Andrew Dominik cultivates a not-unfamiliar revisionist aura of America's formative days, a period drama that feels very modern, with the borderline being on the precipice. It shares the unique blend of contemplative power and unmaking of myth from say Unforgiven and shares its sepia-hued authenticity and indistinct morality. This is almost the most unusual form for a conventional idea of a Western with a backdrop of a psychological landscape.Andrew Dominik matches the book's shapelessness faithfully: messy like the throes of garbled history and hear-say with an undercurrent of the actual shards and slivers which is it's composite. Loosely weaved plot that feels more tangled than vague. With its few superlative undercurrents, and beneath a rambling exterior is a true immersing theme of death and assignation so foul that it makes you think of convention planned murder-outings being the weaker copies of this.Pitt is very impressive as he is most effective stalking the fringes of sanity - seeing how he borderlines his 12 Monkeys and Fight Club twitchy-ness that made him luminous - so he is fittingly cast as Jesse James. Affleck also gets more to work with than most previous outings. Each man lives in each others shadow, James parses his infamy in newspapers and observes the edgy brutal loyalty of his gang, especially Ford (Affleck). And when Pitt loosens the hinges a fraction, he really loses it, maniacal laughs like a death has a new best friend.A lot of weather-swept horizons and desolate farmhouses in post-Civil War Kansas and especially Missouri, float across the screen with less Western orientation, more like 'here is the countryside, look at it and ""see"" it'. There is no real colour, more like a bloated texture of a summers afternoon, left to some gold's, bronze's and faded styles of almost 'Deadwood' type haunts and well-dress gents who crave murder.No momentum like any ordinary thriller, more like it's laced with a cruel menace; with an inescapable clash as scenes travel disturbing and unpredictable paths. On that note, no guns, no galore-ness of any kind, very suave and unpleasantly vindictive, but we do get one possibly statuesque of modern train-robbery scenes that you will ever see, brutal and very indicative of the gangs of old. Just how much myth creates monsters is a overall theme.Verdict:Edgy, dark and maniacal in all-sorts, not the Western we all have an idea of. 8.5.",,Anonymous,Biography
Haunting and beautifully filmed study of hero worship and the reality behind a legend!,"Andrew Dominik's THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD, stands out as one of the best films of this year and one of the most interesting modern westerns to come out in recent years, and one that will certainly be ranked among other classic westerns in the future. Despite using the wild west setting the film is more of a study of the perils of hero worship and the reality of the myth or the truth behind the legend of Jesse James. It focuses on the final few years of Jesse James's life and his relationship with Robert Ford one of the members of his gang of outlaws, who worships the ground Jesse walks on. Yet Jesse's unhinged and erratic behaviour eventually disappoint and confound Ford's image and admiration for the man, eventually leading to resentment and fear of his own life, and to the assassination of the 'outlaw hero' at the hands of Ford. Dominik has crafted a true genuine American classic here that sets out to examine the western legend, who has been romanticised in so many novels and Hollywood films, to the point of being a Robin Hood sort of character, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. Yet it's far from the truth, the Jesse James we see here is becoming fearful of everyone around him, increasingly erratic and disturbed and also protective of his outlaw image that he revels in. Pitt is excellent in his role (an best actor nomination surely should be on the table for him), he displays Jesse with many nuances, both funny and interesting though also disturbing and dangerous at the same time. Every time he appears on screen you are unsure of what he is about to do, and Pitt perfectly portrays this charismatic yet disturbed individual. As Robert Ford, Casey Afflek, is excellent perfectly contemplating James' menacing yet alluring charm, with Ford's wide eyed innocence and idol worshipping enthusiasm that soon turns to resentment and fear. On top of the performances the cinematography is beautiful, perfectly done by Roger Deakins (regular cinematographer for the Coen Brothers) that captures the desolate and snowy wastelands and landscape of the American mid-west. If anything the film captures the idea and myths behind the celebrity, James is in love with his image, that masks his insecurity's and Ford, who is more or less a celebrity stalker, worships his hero, yet when meeting him in the flesh soon realises the cold hard truth behind the image of the hero outlaw. Unmissable cinema at its finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is a FANTASTIC film,"This film is fantastic, quite simply the best film I have seen for a while. The acting, directing, cinematography, music are all superb - Pitt, Affleck, Rockwell, the whole cast are submerged in their characters. It works on many different levels. Chopper is a good film, however I feel this work has far far surpassed that. Where some people may have criticised the film for being too long, or starting and stopping, I see this as its true beauty - ebbing and flowing, taking us on a tragic yet beautiful trip, with a truly haunting (spine tingling) soundtrack by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis evoking the building of tension, paranoia and sense of wanting. At its core I feel this film delving directly into the human psyche that has a need to be recognised as somebody and something. This may be the need to be infamous for the outlaws, yet it satisfies their need, or more appropriately it temporarily satisfies their need. This is a film that burns imagery and feelings into your mind, and that, makes me want to see it again. People who under rate this movie in my opinion don't have an opinion worth counting. Each scene is cut to perfection, with sublime cinematography, music and dialogue that represents film in its true creative art form. The scene I love is the build up to the train robbery, not far into the film, which for me begins the trail of inflections.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
like or dislike?,"This movie is a like-or-dislike movie.If you like a deep movie that really penetrates into the feelings of the character you will love it. But, if you are looking for a typical western bang-bang movie, you are in the wrong movie theater.It basically shows the relationship between a sort of Robin Hood, Jesse James, lived by Brad Pitt in a very good performance, and a teenager obsessed about him, Robert Ford, lived by Casey Affleck in a performance of a lifetime. As the title says, it will turn out in Jesse James' assassination by Robert Ford.Although I dislike westerns, this one was, I believe, very-well directed and with an unbelievable score. This movie would not have worked with a poor acting. And, luckily, the acting of all members was rather surprising.Afterall, this movie is aimed for the Oscar, it is not meant to be a blockbuster, and I think it will have quite a number of nominations.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a film that is beautiful and full of spectacle in both appearance and substance,"The only thing about this modern retelling of Jesse James's assassination by Bob Ford that seems out of place is the title, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" which is a tad bit verbose for a film title. Nonetheless, beneath the title's usage of too many words is a film that I found myself simply amazed by. This is one of the best Westerns to come out of recent times. Some critics have called it the best since ""Unforgiven"". It tells a story that has been told on screen many, many times before, but never so beautifully as this.The film stars Brad Pitt as the unstable bank robber and killer Jesse James, in which he gives yet another golden performance that is certainly noteworthy in this film. Casey Affleck is the other title character, Robert Ford, the man who first idolized Jesse James, joined his gang, befriended him, and later felt he had no choice but to kill the famous outlaw. Both of these actors gave spectacular and authentistic performances, especially the first of the two. Affleck got the Oscar nomination and I felt he deserved it, but I was even more fond of Brad Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James. The two real-life characters, portrayed by the actors, are bound by a screenplay that is very realistic, intense, well-written, and full of substance that shows development of the characters as human beings rather than just historical figures.The film's style is very appealing, especially with the fantastic Oscar-nominated cinematography job by Roger Deakins. The sets are very convincing, the gunshot sound effects sound good, and produce a fairly realistic effect on the characters being shot. Gunshots in this film can literally make you jump in your seat even when you're expecting it. Just as a real black-powder weapon would do, the shots are booming loud. Hits look like real hits rather than just squibs with fake blood exploding under the actors' clothing. I did feel the many usages of sped-up shots of the clouds rolling by was inapposite or maybe a bit cliché, but that was no big deal. The film still works. And the great score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis added to the overall feeling of the movie.In short, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a film that I highly recommend for both fans of the Western genre and fans of movies that are simply well-made. It is beautiful in appearance and even beautiful in its substance, which is rare to find in movies these days. But this just shows that the era of symbolic films has not come to an end and despite ""The Assassination of Jesse James""'s poor box office results, it was a critical success and in my opinion, was worthy of more audience members than those who attended it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Should have known from the title this would be long and boring...,"I don't mind long movies. A 3 hour movie can go by in a snap while a crappy 90 minute movie might seem like 3 hours. There's a good movie somewhere in this meandering mess but would have required a few more rewrites to get there. The only tension is between Casey Affleck's character who loves Jesse James the legend and slowly he sees his image being torn down. But there's too many bloated scenes of unnecessary subplots that make you want to hit the FF button.One thing this does prove is that Brad Pitt does not have the chops to carry a film as a leading man. He's trying, but he's not really acting. In this film he's actually kind of hammy. And there were points in the movie when Casey Affleck's purposely whiny, cracking voice almost seemed like I was watching an actor on Saturday Night Live mocking him. I haven't seen a voice that annoying come out of an actors mouth since Mos Def in 16 BLOCKS. If the whiny Affleck doesn't change his schtick, people are going to be laughing out loud at his next flick. Although he was good in Gone Baby Gone.Why they stole the narrative style from The PBS Civil War Documentaries makes sense, I guess, but they beat it to death so much you just wanted it to stop as well. If I want to watch PBS I'll watch PBS, not pay 12 bucks to see it in a theater. And what's with the 'sepia tone' thing happening in Hollywood these days? If you show us a film in sepia tone we're automatically going to think its good? Didn't work in another snooze-fest 'Flags of our Fathers' and it didn't work here.My guess is Pitt, as producer, exerted some control over this and tried to make a 'film' not a movie and he ended up doing neither. I watched half of this on my own, then started it again the next night with my girlfriend and she didn't even want to finish watching it. AND she's the biggest Brad Pitt fan there is! It is completely devoid of any narrative tension and has no other qualities about it to make it worth watching. All the performances are banal. A complete waste of time. This makes you long for the days of the studio system when actors would be forced to make good movies. Too many actors with too much power thinking they know what it takes to make a good movie.Stay away from this one!",,Anonymous,Biography
Ordinary robber or Robin Hood? Demystifying the legend of the Wild West.,"An innovatively treated psychological story from the history of the American Wild West in the guise of an anti-western, refuting the myths sanctified by popular history, but at the same time suggesting a range of motivations that perpetuate the legend: Jesse James - a common thug, cutthroat and quite ordinary robber (at the same time a cruel and common murderer) is full of internal dilemmas and allows take his own life, only to later posthumously scare the public with his images and triumph in the press, and on provincial cinema theater stages in traveling performances he is killed again and again by the ambiguous and mysterious figure of Robert Ford. Subversive yet captivating, with minimalist (Philip Glass, Michael Nyman) and melancholy music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and captivating monochrome photography by Roger Deakins (Oscar nomination in 2008). A film surprising with its pronunciation and formal solutions, distinguished by good roles performed by: Sam Rockwell, Casey Affleck - worthy of the 2008 Oscar nomination (then Javier Bardem triumphed for the unforgettable role of Anton Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men"" by the brothers Cohen from 2007) and - in an unusual employment - Brad Pitt. A cinema not to be missed for viewers who feel ambitious ecstasy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful western,"Another good Western to come out in 2007, along with 'Yuma', though this one is slower paced and more of a drama. In any case, the movie has great acting, beautiful direction, and a superb score. Affleck truly deserves the supporting actor nomination...(read more). The year 2007 will always be remembered on his resume' as a career defining one, after performing well in 'Gone Baby Gone'.There are two things that hurt this movie; the length could have been easily reduced and it is probably what hurt it when it came to awards considerations and attracting crowds. Yes a lot of time was taken with expressions and landscape shots, however there was still room to shorten it up considerably. The second drawback of the movie was its long and spoiler of a title. It obviously gives the story away, not just by saying what will happen, but also by who. Had the title been more subtle, simply 'Jesse James' perhaps, the movie would have been unpredictable and more suspenseful.However, this is a solid movie, worth watching for Western fans. This movie probably rates as my 3rd favorite Western after 'The Proposition' and '3:10 to Yuma'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ken Burns goes Hollywood!,"A lot of this movie felt like a Ken Burns documentary to me (the objective narration, the amazing account of authentic detail).Many viewers might see this movie with hopes of watching a great modern western, but instead we are left with a visually encapsulating narrative that leaves us feeling both sympathy and admiration for both Jesse James and Robert Ford.Casey Affleck is truly stunning as the morally injured Robert Ford.Brad Pitt is like fine wine (keeps getting better with age). His portrayal of Jesse James is something that resembles ancient mythology. He is a heroic character, yet he is so deeply haunted by his ruthlessness that he becomes something entirely different than what is expected on screen.Both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are something to behold in this poetic and tragic retelling of history.Although this movie is very long and somewhat slowly paced, it is one of the few movies this year that makes you care for every single character, no matter how insignificant their roles are.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is nothing short of stunning, and the portrayals of Robert Ford and Jesse James by the two lead actors is enough to enthrall you to the very last minute of this epic, new-age western.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful!,"Well-acted and wonderful movie about one of America's most interesting historical characters, and yes, Jesse James was an outlaw and a murderer, but still interesting nonetheless, Brad Pitt does a wonderful job...some people complaining it's too slow, to me that's the beauty of the movie, the pacing and tempo, too many movies show too much action instead of telling a story, this is the opposite. Oh, and the haunting music is simply amazing. It's become one of my top ten favorite movies of all-time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The assassination of audience by those 3 hours of boredom !,"No offence for those who liked this movie, but I didn't like this movie at all. I went to cinema expecting to see something much better than ""American Outlaws"" (which is an excellent movie, by the way), but I was totally disappointed. It was very, very boring. Long and boring. I guess I was expecting much more action and ... there was almost no action... It's a very.. ""statical"" movie... almost like a theater play... It should have represented at least a part of Jesse James life (robbering and being chased), finalizing with his assassination by Robert Ford, and Robert Ford's assassination, so they can justify those 3 hours this movie runs... No doubt, acting was very good, but... that's all. I saw all kind of movies, I like almost all kind of genres. This is definitely a drama, more or less biographical and a little bit western (only because of the time events took place). So... my opinion (and my friends opinion and everyone I asked opinion) is that it's a mediocre movie. For its action and drama intensity is no more than a 6/10 stars rating movie. It doesn't deserve to be considered a brilliant movie just because it has a good acting and good and known actors. I've seen a lot of dramas, westerns or biographical movies much better than this one with little stars rating. Only because Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck plays in this movie and their acting is brilliant doesn't make this movie brilliant. It makes it good... mediocre. If there weren't Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck and another 2-3 actors... no one would have liked this movie so much. There is a word.. ""Each one with his tastes""... so I didn't judge those who loved the movie... no way.. I only told you my opinion and the only logical explanation I found for that exaggerated rating.P.S.: I didn't grant this movie 1/10 because I think this is the best it deserves. No, I gave it minimum because of those who voted 10/10 only because Brad Pitt plays in this movie, or those who like Jesse James or western stories and that's why I was so angry. In my opinion a fair vote is 6.5/10",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
review,"one of my all time favorite westerns Casey Affleck steals the Whole From Brad Pitt and shows his considerable acting skills in this role Ridley Scott has created a masterpiece in the western genre,it has great cinematography. Brad Pitt does a reasonable job as Jesse James but he is greatly overshadowed by Casey who really brings obscure historical person to life. Also enjoyed performance of Sam Rockwell who a marvelous job in the supporting role of Mr Ford's brother, he is another underrated actor who I enjoy watching his work.

Perfection,"If only seen a few movies that have left me completely silent and amazed when they ended. I have only seen one where I wanted to replay it straight away. But people I was with that night where not interested in seeing one movie twice. ""But the music was awesome! And there's so much I want to see again!"" I kept saying how amazing it was for about a month to everyone I knew.We rented the DVD at a library and the next day it had to be returned. The same day I actually bought the DVD for 10 well spent euro's. I tried to ask all my friends to watch it but when they saw the runtime and the title they where somehow repelled by it. With or without people I had to see that movie again. But when I watched it again, to my own surprise, I noticed that I was watching a movie that was perfect. I didn't notice the camera angles and art-design as much as the first time or even the silences that revealed more about the characters then any words could. I was amazed once again.Acting, location, art, camera, music, storyline and everything else just feels right. Thats why this movie is (to my opinion) perfect.This movie should be on the very top of the IMDb top 250. Jesse James beats Shawshank Redemption any day.Skeptical? Yes of course, you should be! If someone tells you that a movie is amazing you should always check it yourself. So go watch it! and when you watched it, watch it again! And maybe watch it once more when your all alone.

The Assassination of Jesse James has it all except for fast pace but when your watching this film you tend to forget that and just enjoy the sheer beauty of the images presented to you.

"Very Good Ending, but way too long...","Based on a book, the pacing may have been long, necessary and useful in the novel, but from the beginning, I felt that this movie was going nowhere following a bunch of bandits and their uneventful, uninteresting lives. If someone got caught up in the legendary tales of Jesse James like a good portion of America at the time, I certainly did not from watching the movie. Yes, Brad Pitt and director Andrew Dominik portray him as a more down-to-earth, conflicted person which is fine, yet, there is no transmission to the viewer of the type of blind admiration that Richard Ford feels for him.The younger Affleck, Casey, plays the younger brother of the two 'side-kick wannabes' of Jesse James and his older brother. He plays the coward well and is a good counterpart to Pitt's outwardly assurance. From the title, even though it is strategically not actually shown in the beginning of the movie, we know that Ford is going to kill Jesse James. We don't know how and we don't know exactly why, although we have a strong suspicion.Visually, there are a few great moments. Scenery. The outdoors. Horses. Houses. America at the end of the 19th century. Yet, the movie is too static, the story too uninvolving. Not having read the book, but being privy to surely to some of its passages in the voice-over narration, I have to say that I imagine that writer Ron Hansen's delightful descriptions were much more potent than even good actors in a room with regular lines and not much to do. In fact the best parts of the movie were this passages which makes me think that the book may have had additional richness not well translated in the film.In any case, especially at close to 3 hours, this film did not work. The last half hour (the leading up and the aftermath of the assassination) were by far the best part of the movie. If that type of cunning film-making, introspection and moving storyline could have served the rest of the movie, I would be rooting too. Yet I cannot say why this film is so highly-regarded as it stands now and as I have seen it last night. Better luck next time.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

excellent film and accurate as a documentary,The Assassination of Jesse James is not only an excellent entertaining film but it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.The use of music and narration are superlative in this film.

This scene needed extra work to achieve the smooth move of the film...the scene in the film is awkward.The film does not directly address the brutal killing Jesse James did during his career. The film indirectly mentions several of the victims of his attacks but leaves the viewer with less than a true picture of the James' gang.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

But this movie is so much more.I got a 4k Blue Ray and 4K TV to just watch it because the clarity of the cinematography is so superior to everything else.

An absolute must-see for fans of the America's longest-standing iconic figure,"Andrew Dominik's 'Jesse James' is a picture of grand scales and grave tales that is as intoxicating as it is disquieting, and as tranquil as it is beautiful. Dominik's scrupulous study of the two title characters never digresses throughout the film's lengthy showcase and permeates the grounded minds and hearts of its viewers, whose once sturdy estimation of Jesse James is demolished in light of the classic outlaw's truest depiction.The explicit detail of Hansen's novel is evident in each scene of 'James' and is transmitted sinuously by Dominik, leaving little difference between the original text and its ensuing screenplay  which unfolds into an exercise on photographed literature that skips from scene to scene poetically and fluidly. In fact, Jesse James is one of the few films I've ever seen in which the dialogue is so cleanly delivered (whether it's in the first person or narrated in the third person) that if one were to close their eyes, they could just as easily visualize the happenings of the film as they could if they were watching it. Yet, the transposed script by Andrew Dominik could undoubtedly have fallen to failure had it not been for his outstanding cast. Fortunately, the cast succeeded, and did so by following the lead of its stars, Pitt and Affleck, who both bid phenomenal performances.Brad Pitt's portrayal of the Missouri bandit will corrupt every molecule of its onlookers through simple, yet inimitable glares and gestures that indicate the brutality of James that rested behind his sunken blue eyes and charming guise. The famed persona could have been offered to no one else, for Pitt becomes every glitch of James, from his ticks to his truths to the long-dismissed turmoil that had pitted itself deep within his soul.Additionally, Casey Affleck, whose depiction of the young, admiring, obsessive Robert Ford is tremendous, conquers the challenge of displaying the most notable hero anti-hero in American history. Affleck's Ford character speaks words that indicate admiration and wonder, yet his body glimmers of dissolved self-assurance. As the film progresses, we see Ford's approving eyes grow dark with disdain for the story's main character, as he approaches the unsettling disposition that gives the film (and, previously, Hansen's book) its gruesome title.In addition to the stellar supporting cast (which includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, and Sam Shepard as Jesse's older brother, Frank), Dominik sets a suitable pace, while also instituting large-scale tension, most apparent in the film's two climactic scenes (the train robbery towards the film's beginning and the assassination, which comes near the film's conclusion). However, the tension in both of these scenes (and for the duration of the picture) is catapulted by Nick Cave's truly haunting score, which is the very best of the year and corresponds impeccably with the desolate scenery and grabbing visuals of Dominik's absorbing motion picture. Directed with tact and tone, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' is an absolute must-see for fans of movies and of the timeless legend of Jesse James, America's longest-standing iconic figure.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Homage to Western History in a Moody Daguerreotype Style,"THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is one of the finer films about the history of the Old West 'heroes' such as Jesse James. It is difficult to describe the degree of high quality of the way in which this film has been created: the script (adapted by Andrew Dominick from Ron Hansen's novel) is as poetic as it is gritty and flows like a Shakespearean tragedy both in narration and in dialog; the exceptionally fine cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the flavor of the times, shot in subtle lighting whether in darkly intimate interiors or on the vast plains at times heightened by snowlight, but always in the feeling of the quality of daguerreotypes; the musical score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is strangely apropos without seeming to borrow from any previous source; and the cast of fine actors play the film as a true ensemble work. Director Andrew Dominik has accomplished a masterpiece.The story begins subtly in the last year of the James gang at the final train robbery in 1881. Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) have gathered remnant criminals to bolster their decimated gang - Dick Liddel (Paul Schneider), Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt), and Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) among them. The Ford brothers want to ride with Jesse: 19-year old Robert (Casey Affleck) idolizes Jesse and his older brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) enjoys the attention of the gang's fame. Jesse James, at only age 34, is at the end of his career, content to be at home with his wife Zee (Mary Louise Parker) and children. But Robert's adoration results in a chain of events that slowly dissembles the gang and results in Robert's obsessive revenge for Jesse's murder of one of the members fired by the promise of reward for the capture of Jesse James, dead or alive. History and the title of the film tell the plot so there are no surprises here. It is the inevitable unfolding of the drama and the tension of the interplay of the actors that drives the mood of the story. The film does not stop with the killing of Jesse James but instead follows the descent of the lives of Robert (now wealthy and in love a stripper - Zooey Deschanel) and the progressing insanity of Charley to an end that fades like the proverbial sunset on a time in our history we will never forget.Each of the actors is exceptional, and despite the glory of having big name stars associated with the cast, the effect is one of pure ensemble work. The 160 minute running time of the film never seems too long, so well timed is the pacing of the story and the pauses for understanding the interior aspects of each character's mind. This is a haunting film, unusually fine in every detail. It deserves, and demands, attention. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of Jesse James' story,"Worst movie I've seen in years. It's a slow, shallow attempt at art. Some of the acting was good but the story line was week and shallow. Give a dead man a camera and you'll end up with a better movie. If Jesse James were alive he would shoot everyone involved in this miserable waste of time. The only redeeming quality of this movie is as a cure for insomnia. I want my 160 minutes back. Seriously, I would shoot myself if my name was on the credits to this movie. A drunken monkey could fling poo at a wall and create a better, more intelligent piece of art that would stink less. On a beer scale this movie is a keg. You will die of alcohol poisoning before you get drunk enough for this movie to be remotely entertaining. Read the phone book, it's more exciting.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gorgeous Motion Picture, Poetic and Powerful !!!","This movie is all-around beautiful. This story of an American legend is told with such poetry, both visually and narratively, that I could not help but find myself fully engrossed for the full 160-ish minutes. I have not seen a film as beautifully executed in every aspect since ""The Godfather"". The acting, especially from Brad Pitt, is subtle and honest, yet powerfully emotional. This movie is both artistically and historically significant. Many average moviegoers will have trouble tolerating the length and pace of the film, however I argue these are the same people who may dispute ""Citizen Kane"" as the greatest American film ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heroism Is In the Eye of the Beholder,"How sad and painful the story of Robert Ford is and how grimly telling it is of the shallow and insensitive nature of people as a mass. It is a western, yet it's a very patient and ominous western that plays out more like a Terence Malick film than a John Ford or Sam Peckinpah one. Westerns, by the very nature of the backdrop they set for their stories, portray primitive and unwittingly obsolete ways of life confronted modern technological or social changes. This may be depicted by showing conflict between natives and settlers, or by showing ranchers being threatened by the Industrial Revolution. American Westerns of the 1940s and 1950s emphasize honor and sacrifice. Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s have a more negative examination, lionizing a disloyal anti-hero and bringing to light the cynicism, viciousness and discrimination of the American West. The earlier westerns skim the glorious surface of the time and the later ones dig deep into the brutal nature of people in the era, but neither approach is bad. However the typical American-made western uses these elements to tell a simple morality tale that leaves room for barfights, shootouts and the salvage of helpless, entirely dependent damsels in distress. The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford exceeds this by combining the two views and creating a dark, cruel portrait of a dark, cruel time. When the movie ended, I sat staring at the screen, my thoughts entirely arrested by what I had just watched.The only aggravation of which I can think is the film's narration, which gives away subtext right as we would be absorbing it just as clearly without the narration. Sometimes the narrator is needed, sometimes it appears that the narrator baby-steps us through a scene that might be too hard for our little brains to comprehend. I still dismiss it with the wave of my hands, however, because it is there more for the purpose of setting old storyteller sort of feel of the time, and storytelling is the axis of the lives of both Jesse James and Robert Ford, and how they came to meet.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Jesse James is greatest performance, bar none. He is so chilling, not only because he can alternately appear so convincingly vulnerable and lethally menacing uninterrupted from one moment to the next, but also because he gives you the distinct worrying impression that he could truly live a life completely alone, leaving a thorough variable for the outcomes of anyone in his presence. There are many scenes with James where the most telling things he does are very difficult to script and were likely moments where the actor is given to impulse and improvisation. These happen to be some of his best scenes because Pitt renders him with a very clear and acute understanding of his careful, private, manipulative, sensitive personality. In a moment when someone lies to him, well or not well, Jesse doesn't make a very telling face. Pitt simply wears a blank, expectant expression that opens up a gash in the scene where we feel just as certainly as he does that what's just been said doesn't fit. He radiates a subsequent awkwardness to all around him, including the audience, and he somehow seems untouched by it, the only person still appearing comfortable in the room.There is an almost frighteningly natural chemistry between Casey Affleck, who plays the weak yet eager and ambitious Robert Ford, and his idol, Jesse James. His submissive yet obsessive character, hungry for attention and admiration, and James's calmly dominant and sadistic ambiguity towards him is epitomal of real, searing, almost borderline sexual connection between two people who were almost bound by fate to meet and affect each other.Sam Rockwell, one of the most lovable, natural and underused actors working right now, is always a delight to see, his trademark happy-go-lucky imperviousness creating great spark as Robert Ford's older brother Charley, who laughs along with Robert's tormentors but very slowly reveals a more concerned side when his dense mind begins to realize that it's not all fun and games.Andrew Dominik is an auspiciously promising new filmmaker whose successive efforts will hopefully equal this beautifully shot, giftedly atmospheric, all too real masterpiece, but it's difficult to fathom whether or not they could exceed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Incredibly detailed, beautifully filmed masterpiece.","I've always had an interest in the Old West from a young child and this is the story of the build up to and death of the infamous Jesse James and also the story behind his killer Robert Ford. It isn't a film for those who want action but for those who are interested in the background and aftermath of his death this is just about as good as it gets.The casting is excellent, Brad Pitt is an excellent actor and it's obvious he has a strong affection for Jesse James. His is an understated and brilliant performance backed up by an equally impressive performance by Casey Affleck as Robert Ford who idolises Jesse James but eventually turns into his killer. A strong supporting cast which includes Sam Rockwell means you are never going to be disappointed with the acting.The cinematography is outstanding and the best I've seen in any film. It's almost like watching a photograph come to life at times. In addition the narration of the film is a good idea, excellently done.This is a film that strongly led by the characters and dialogue and therefore won't appeal to everyone especially as it's also a bum numbing 2 hours 40 minutes. However for those with an appreciation of the subject and fine acting this is a real treat.I have seen this film three times now and have enjoyed it more each time i've seen it.

Did I see the same film?,"What a snooze fest!I think there are certain actors that should reconsider their choice of a career in acting, the first that comes to mind, anybody with the last name of Affleck, Casey's whiney voice is enough to turn off the film, the second, Colin Ferrel, the third, Brad Pitt. This guy cannot act his way out of a paper bag. He is stoic, he is boring, he delivers his lines without inflection. This stole a great deal from the mood of the film. The film also could have done without the background narration. I thought that was useless and made this already boring movie even more so. All in all, the film, to me, was filled with actors I have no use or need for as actors. This may not make sense to anybody but me, however, if you consider watching this film, do so when there is absolutely positively nothing else to watch.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Keep Your Fans Close and Your Enemies Closer.""","Betrayal never comes from the enemy. No one has ever been backstabbed from a distance. The close-by Coward always puts the last nail in the coffin.The most famous outlaw who ever lived, the mighty Jesse James, was one who could trust nobody. He killed multiple times over and escaped death nearly just as many. He became so well-known that he had to keep his back to the wall nearly all of the time. James was a guarded, loose cannon with crews that were small but tales that were larger-than-life. It's fitting that a myth of such brilliance would be taken out of this world through an unceremonious betrayal. And it's only right for even his assassination to be dramatized and deified to live on in infamy. ""The man who is remembered never decays""The matchup between the titular characters feels like a retelling of David and Goliath in some ways. The ages-old story of the ""nobody"" conquering the giant. Robert Ford was no one all his life, and as far back as he can remember, ""(James) has been as big as a tree."" Whether idolized or feared, Jesse James was recognized everywhere. James was heralded so highly that it felt like shades of a greek god or fabled creature. A man too large for his era could only be brought down by a peasant with a river stone. The giant was then slain by the Coward, through a nearly literal backstabbing. But much to Ford's surprise, he became only infamous but not popular. He never became a King like David but rather caused a fall from grace. It was apparent that this was, in many ways, worse than just being unknown. Robert Ford had taken down his idol while simultaneously conquering his biggest fear. The man he viewed as bigger than a tree, was finally cut down, but no one knew why. Even Ford eventually began questioning why he had killed a true friend of his out of pure envy. Ford had taken two steps forward then one step back, and it eventually led to his own demise.The greatest feat this film accomplishes is its structure. The film alternates between scenes of incredible suspense within thriller-esque scenarios and slow-burn dialogues. This structure keeps you on your toes and doesn't allow you to fall asleep at the wheel, as other Westerns do. ""The Assassination..."" gives us gripping train robberies followed by moments of clarity, and wild shootouts followed by intimate dinners. A back-forth style that's so eloquently balanced, it gives all the depth in the world to the revisionist part of this Western.Technically this movie is incredible. I really don't have much to say on the topic, because the cinematography is difficult to put into words. Also, the lighting is casted to perfection through every window and from every lamp. The shot of Pitt (Jesse James) standing on the railroad completely dark but perfectly outlined by light of train was just *chef's kiss.* Roger Deakins isn't human, and I think that just about covers it. The production perfectly accented the elite performances that were being given. Pitt is unnerving and menacing while also showing signs of doubt. His portrayal of Jesse James is easily one of his greatest. This is possibly Casey Affleck's second best performance ever, just behind 'Manchester by the Sea.'The full title, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" itself tells us how and with whom the story is to be sealed. But this allows the film to let us experience the slow burn of everything in between. That is the beauty of this film, that we get to experience all that's left of James from the first moment we meet him to his last breath, without trying to predict the ending. The dates of birth and death are what's written on a headstone, but everything in between is truly what life is. Andrew Dominik's beautiful story conveyed through Deakins' masterful camera work allows us to absorb every second of the dash in between the dates.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"elaborate, beautiful...long","The death of the John Wayne Western: The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert FordIt's been a long time since a great western movie came out. 1992's Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood' last ride in the genre and later in 1995 the exciting The Quick and the Dead. The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford is a new type of western; it is a non-fiction story beautifully told and well acted by its entire cast of characters. The plot revolves around Jesse James last months. The film begins with Robert Ford trying to join Jesse James's gang. He is accepted and they proceed to rob a train in Blue cut, the year was 1881. The events that follow are grim, dirty and nonetheless captivating.The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, every scene is carefully set and light turning the landscapes into characters themselves. The cinematography is most notable when Jesse James and his gang are robbing a train in Blur Cut, on September 5th, 1881. Shot in near darkness, the camera gently sweeps across a man's silhouette, as it slowly disappears under smoke from the train. Roger Deakins's cinematography is truly spectacular and rightly deserves its Oscar nomination. The pacing is slow and slightly uneven. You will not find many action scenes, and the few that are in the movie, serve only to further the story.The film has a runtime of roughly two hours and forty minutes. It is shot realistically without the overuse of editing; the viewer sees the action as though he or she were there. The narration takes time to get accustomed to but adds clarity to key scenes in the film. The movie itself plays out like that of a discovery channel re-enactment, which is not to say is bad, it simply makes it unique in terms editing and pacing. Brad Pitt showers the screen with emotional restraint and a characterization that overpowers all his previous performances. His portrayal of Jesse James is sly and captures a lost soul. Jesse James is portrayed as an intelligent man that could be kind yet evil, trusting one moment and menacing the next. Casey Affleck is the coward Robert Ford. His soft-spoken portrayal seeks and succeeds in showing a man who truly glorifies Jesse James. In a scene near the end of the movie, he tries on Jesse James's hat, sleeps in his bed and tries to emulate his stance and manner. The movie is long, uneventful, yet wholly captivating. The film is recommended for those who like photography, character studies and period pieces. It is a very good movie, but not great and will probably be disliked by action fans and those that like a lot of explosions in their movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why nobody talks about this gem!,"The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford.Back to the 1880s , Robert Ford tries his best to join the new gang of Missouri outlaw led by his known childhood idol Jesse James ,but Robert gradually becomes resentful of his leader.What a weird title right?Yes, it is weird to put what is going to happen in your film in the title ,but it's surprisingly good ,I loved the idea it made me waiting for the death of the Fearless outlaw by the Coward as they Called him.What I admired the most is the western atmosphere ,very well created taking into consideration that its made in 2007, and it looks like it's from the 80s or something ...
The cinematography can't get any better ,I enjoyed those beautiful frames especially with the amazing production design that respects the era.As you might know Casey Affleck was nominated for the Oscar back then ,it was very well deserved , Casey was impressing playing the role of a coward , and for Brad Pitt , he played a different character that time, being a mentally troubled outlaw that fears no one ,glad to know he has a very big range .It's an interesting historical story about
Bandits partnership and betrayal that everyone should give it a shot ,especially if you're a western movie fan .""Don't that picture look dusty .""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great Story,"Jesse James (Pitt) is wary of his new gang since the old gang was either dead or in prison, and he knows something is up. After all there is a large reward on him, dead or alive, and he is retired now..more or less.I thought the title was too long, and then I saw the movie and the title is exactly right. This is perhaps the most comprehensive story about Jesse James, and Robert Ford. All we ever heard in the past was that James went to fix a picture on the wall and Ford shot him in the back. That's all we ever heard until now.The story is slow, there is narration, and some scenes linger but all are necessary and artfully done. It's like watching a Ken Burns documentary come to life (Burns did excellent documentaries for TV on the Civil War, American Baseball, Jazz, WWII and many more using narration and still pictures that were available for the times) or reading the novel without actually reading the novel, but getting the full flavor of the novel. Say what? Now all of this couldn't have been experienced if it wasn't for the novel by Ron Hansen.There is no language in the movie but the new gang members, in the beginning as they sat around a camp fire, do use code words to describe a woman's parts. It wasn't necessary, not funny and they were probably incorporated to give us a sense of outlaw camp-fire talk, I suppose. Also, when the gang robbed the train (their last), most actors had troubles with keeping their bandanas on over their noses. Kind of funny now that I think about it.Casey Affleck did a great job (an Oscar performance? Maybe) as Robert Ford, but let's face it, he looks so much like brother Ben, that sometimes you see Ben when watching Casey. They look so much alike and have similar facial contortions. Maybe a mustache would help.Mary-Louise Parker was wasted here but maybe she just wanted to be in the movie at any cost. James Carville (political analyst) was good as the governor. Sam Shepard, as Frank James, was in and out so fast you hardly knew he was in here. The performances of the rest of the cast were excellent. As for Brad Pitt, he was Jesse James in every sense of the word that we have come to fantasize about. Can't get better than that. Yes, a great story.Violence:Yes; Sex:NO; Nudity:No; Language:No",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""But the cowardly... They will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."" - Revelation 21:8","Bob Ford reminded me of a man who now rots in prison. A man who unlike Ford, terrifies me just as much as Pitt's performance as the infamous outlaw.That man's name is Daniel Larson.Like Ford, he has obsessive dreams of delusional grandeur with a celebrity he looks up to. Much like Ford, he is emasculate and effeminate and also very childishly prone to emotional outbursts when provoked.Such an outburst would become his downfall as after shouting on Tiktok that he was going to bomb the white house, he was arrested by the FBI and was put in prison.These people shouldn't be this similar, yet here I am spouting their peculiar circumstances with one another. That's how much of an effect this had on me.Tense, frightful direction with the exception of a few too many medium/close up shots. Not enough wide frames. With an aspect ratio like that, the added space should be your friend.Hypnotic, haunting music. As if this film wasn't a real time tell tale of the killing of one of America's most popular sociopaths, but the bear witnessing of undead spirits haunting the rooms of where they once stood, each recollecting the memories of their individual lives.The violence.Dear God, the violence.I don't think I've ever seen a pistol whip look that brutal before. Much less, that realistic.There's two different ways to show violence. Both of which are used to either shock, awe or combine the two emotions.The first way is for the sake of realism and/or grittiness. Mostly to shock audiences to make them feel something different than hyped up excitement. Usually to either gross them out (The Thing), make them feel afraid/jumpscare them (this movie), some are just because it's necessary.The second (and most popular way) is for the sake of emotionally investing your audience's sick tendencies to engage themselves into a violent film so much so when a character gets his balls blown off or his head blown through, the viewers collectively begin soyjaking at the screen for no other reason than because ""It's so much fun, Jan.""Neither of these methods are bad/unnecessary ways to depict violence. But one method clearly shows more class and maturity than the other regarding the way of the director. However, some directors have subverted the usage of the shock and awe method to great effect in order to produce emotions that are more saddening than exciting. (The Passion of the Christ)The Assassination of Jesse James is no stranger to realistic violence. Your heart will jump with every gunshot heard.The script is so unbelievably good with dialogue so sharp that Tarantino could never.This film is truly almost perfect and should not have been snubbed for a nomination for Best Picture. Perhaps if No Country For Old Men or There Will Be Blood hadn't been released in '07 this film probably would have sweeped.Unfortunately for Dominik, NCFOM and TWBB are two perfect movies. Fortunately for Dominik, I'm getting the feeling that I'm gonna adore his next features.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A successful story, but very slow!","Without giving any spoilers from this movie, I could start by saying that it is one of my favorite performances by Casey Afleck, he plays much better than Brad Pitt, I don't want you to think that I am somehow a hater of Brad Pitt, because I have seen legendary performances from him in many favorite movies, but Casey Afleck, he has the acting in his pocket and raises the baton of the movie a lot. A quick recommendation from me, the movie is good but quite slow, it's not for everyone, but it definitely grips you till the end in every way, so if you take your time, the movie can easily be finished by anyone in an afternoon. Without further ado, I wish you a pleasant viewing and a great day.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An epic, sprawling splendor of cinema","The Assassination of Jesse James is an epic, sprawling splendor of cinema, right from its title and through its near-three-hour running time. Dominik and everyone else involved have taken a huge chance with this, as it is a creation that could so easily go wrong, lose its focus, wander off and leave the audience apathetic and bored. Luckily for Dominik, he has the best the cinematic craft has to offer in order to help him along. Starting from perhaps some of the best use of voice-over narration since American Beauty, Dominik manages to capture us and draw us into the whirlwind that is the life and times of Jesse James. Like in Terrence Malick's films, the plot takes backseat to atmosphere, character, and beauty. The film is not about the last robbery of the James brothers, nor is it about the course of their lives after the train robbery that opens the film. Thinking back, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to even recollect any major plot points in the film; certainly not enough to fill its entirety. What interests Dominik are his characters, namely those of Jesse James and Robert Ford but also many others surrounding them, and their ever-changing relationship and dynamics leading up to James' inevitable, title-featured assassination. The film portrays an atmosphere, feelings, musings and character far more than it presents a tangible, developing plot.Extraordinarily for a sophomore film project, especially that of a foreign director, Dominik surrounds himself with the finest cinematic craftsmen Hollywood has to offer. In true Malickian form, Dominik allows these technical, visual aspects to occasionally take center stage and further accentuate the feelings, character emotions, and the atmosphere he is trying to evoke. What particularly stands out is the absolutely stunning cinematography by now-legend Roger Deakins, easily one of the greatest cinematographers working in Hollywood today and second only to Emmanuel Lubezki and Janusz Kaminski in my opinion. Like Malick's two Western masterpieces, Badlands and Days of Heaven, but also featured prominently in his two more recent subsequent features, Dominik embellishes his film with extended shots of the beautiful, wide-open vistas of the rolling fields and wide-open spaces of the 19th century American frontier.Dominik did not only luck out on his technical team, but also with his wonderfully talented acting troupe. His two leading men, one a long-time Hollywood A-lister and the other surely a shoo-in for the same list in the very near future, deliver exquisite, powerful work that is a peak for both of their careers. Brad Pitt, the veteran, observed in a recent interview that he seems to be getting better with each subsequent film role and finds his older work incomparable to his more recent efforts. I have to admit, the man has a point. Although stellar in Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club, Pitt also excelled at delivering bland, single-note performances in films such as Seven Years in Tibet or Meet Joe Black. Recently he has been truly out-doing himself and if his subdued, grayed turn in last year's Babel was the best performance he had delivered up until that point, he manages to even exceed that with his incredible, powerful, dominant role as Jesse James. Pitt nails every little quirk in James; his mannerisms, his ticks, his glances and smirks. His performance is so powerful it dominates the entire film even during extended sequences without his character. But the true stunner is Casey Affleck, who has appeared in smaller background roles in his brother's previous movies but has had two chances this year to truly shine. If Gone Baby Gone seals his abilities as a strong leading man, The Assassination of Jesse James, while not a lead role, certainly seals his undeniable talent as an actor. It is one of those performances that is so exhilarating and entrancing to watch, one can't wait for the character to return to the screen and relishes every moment with him. Another powerful characterization, Affleck absolutely nails the kind of naïve, wide-eyed wonder of Robert Ford, and his interactions with Jesse James; his sheepish grins, his feeble attempts to impress, his embarrassment. It is an incredible, powerful performance that were it not for Javier Bardem would surely be a lead contender for the best supporting performance of the year. Also worth a mention is the criminally underrated Sam Rockwell, who in movie after movie is able to deliver wonderful, fascinating turns. How his leading turn in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind didn't transform him into one of the most reliable leading men on the scene is way beyond me, and I look forward to all of his work. He manages to inject just enough of himself in all of his roles while still remaining loyal to the source material. I hope his big break is on the way.This year saw a revival and an abundant resurgence in two old-Hollywood film genres; the musical and the Western. Between this, 3:10 to Yuma, and the less traditional There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, one could very easily attribute this year as the year of the Western renaissance. It's no coincidence that these four titles are also among the best of the year. I have not seen his previous effort, Chopper, but The Assassination of Jesse James is enough for me to certify Andrew Dominik as a directorial force to be reckoned with. The film truly stands out in a year abundant in excellent sophomore films (for example, Juno and Atonement, just to name a couple), and although not quite the masterpiece it wants to be, it certainly comes as close to it as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Painfully slow and mundane, but shot beautifully","First, I have to say that the movie was shot beautifully. It has amazing cinematography. The acting is also very good, and the sets and costumes are top notch. 10 out of 10 on these respects.Overall, as a story and as a movie though, I hated this film. It takes 3 hours to agonizingly meander through a story that could be told well in 30 minutes. The dialog, with only few redeeming exceptions, was dull, uninspired and rather pointless to the overall plot.

A Great Revisionis Western,"Like all of the great westerns since John Ford this is a film about western films as much as the west itself. Long and leisurely, by the time it starts Jesse James is already part of a mythological west being sold to impressionable young men like Robert Ford. Ford gets close to the myth and becomes part of it himself. Starting brilliantly with a train robbery the film proceeds to deconstruct the myth and in doing so takes it's place alongside ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Wild Bunch"". Brad Pitt has never been better than as Jesse James, he remains a mystery somewhere between an outlaw and family man. Acting honours go to Casey Affleck, just as in ""Gone Baby Gone"" he shows how effective quiet acting can be. Beautifully shot and scored. This is up there with ""No Country For Old Men"" as the best US cinema had to offer in 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good film,"The film version of Ron Hansen's historical novel about Jesse James and Robert Ford starts off sluggishly, but becomes more compelling and intriguing as it progresses. The acting by everyone is really good, but Casey Affleck is excellent as Robert ""Bob"" Ford. Roger Deakins cinematography is excellent. It has a haunting beautiful quality to it that reminds me of Terrence Malick's films such as DAYS OF HEAVEN.One minor flaw is the women in the story, such as Jesse James' wife played by the great Mary Louise Parker. Get short shrift in this film. I would have liked to have learned more about them. Yet, it is a story about men.I am a fan of writer Ron Hansen. I've read the novel some years ago.

Sloooooooooooow,"There are movies your forget immediately after watching them. I kept forgetting what was going on in this movie every 10 minutes. I really don't blame the director for this exercise in the spectacle of drying paint, but the producer. When Hollywood operated as a dream factory and not an outlet for overpriced artisan craft goods, the producer would exercise his (rarely her) authority as audience advocate and insist on discernible plot development, characters you could tell apart, and some action that built to a climax in 90 minutes or less. No, we get to watch every precious frame that the director could not bear to cut. Every so often, people predict the revival of the western as a genre. I assure you that 2007 wasn't the year that that happened.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just don't expect a typical action-packed western,""" Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an intriguing film that takes a deep dive into the lives of these infamous characters. Casey Affleck is mesmerizing as Robert Ford, capturing the mix of admiration and jealousy he feels for Jesse James, played by an equally compelling Brad Pitt. The movie has a slow, deliberate pace that may not be for everyone, but it beautifully builds tension and mood, immersing you in the era.Visually, the film is stunning. Each shot feels like a work of art, perfectly framing the Western landscape and the complex emotions at play. It's less about action and more about the psychological unraveling of its characters, which I found fascinating. If you're into character studies with a touch of historical drama, this film is definitely worth a watch. Just be prepared for a more contemplative experience rather than a traditional Western shootout!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
05/05,"The Assassination of Jesse James is a film about the events that led up to the killing, based on a novel of the same name about Ford who, with the help of his brother tried to join the gang because he looked up to Jesse, who thought they were the only ones he could trust at the time. The film starts off half-way through the Blue Cut train robbery which didn't go to plan because it didn't carry as much money as everyone thought, so a lot of people left James and the gang which opened up a space and Robert was let in with his brother, who was already a member by then. He thought James took a shine to him and would spend the next few months fussing over and trying to impress him, but he started to grow restless and bitter after having been mocked and ignored by James for weeks and was promised a bounty and full pardon if he killed or had the outlaw arrested, who was by then one of the most wanted men in the US.The Assassination of Jesse James is an interesting film. It spends two and a half hours leading up to something I already knew, that it already told us will happen but it caught my attention, it pulled me in, it'll have you thinking about it for weeks and most of the time it felt very well put-together and kept me on track. The performances were great all-round, Sam Rockwell was as fun to watch as ever and Brad Pitt really gave it his all too, he has that same aura and feeling you get from someone like Jesse James, like a dark fear of him and I like the way he put the feeling of Jesse being so distant, even with those closest to him forward like that. He's quiet, twitchy, ruthless but very uncomfortable to try and imagine the characters being around. Casey Affleck's another top performer, his child-like naivety and the voice he put on that made him sound like he was about to break down in tears whenever he's around James bounced off him perfectly. But he felt stressed and out of his body when he needed to, when Ford started to turn his back on James and he didn't know who to trust or what to do around his brother. The last half-hour or so took a bit of a turn away from Jesse who was by then the character we saw the most of or the one I was more interested in at least and it showed us how Ford looked back at his decision to kill James and take the bounty and pardon, and what it did to his life after that. How people started to see him - not as this brave man who did what had to be done but a coward, who begged his way into being let join the gang, who lied and took advantage of a man he looked up to for years and killed him, behind his back, without telling him anything. Without trusting Jesse as he did. He just goes around doing things someone else already did better, embarrassing himself in front of Jesse most of the time we see him. I wanted everyone to care about him more than Jesse, I was upset they didn't but I understood.It's one of the most beautifully shot, scored and acted films I've seen and Roger Deakins was at his best to date by far, which suffice it to say is no small feat given his track record so far. The scenes shot in the farmhouse, at Hite's and the Bolton's draw you into the film with all the characters but when it took us outside, in the wide, open space of field, the towns and all the snow and ice filled uplands it started to feel a lot emptier and the film really picked up from there on. There's a shot from the train robbery scene at the start where it fades to black and we don't see any of the characters or anything next to them and the train just comes out through all the tress and mist to us. Then we see a shot of Jesse walking across the track back to us, waiting for the train to stop and when it does the mist cuts him out the picture entirely. It just sets the rest of the scene and everything he'll end up going through later so well. Don't watch The Assassination of Jesse James thinking there'll be loads of action and shoot outs at high noon or anything like that, it's not that kind of Western. Everyone gave it their all. The way it looked, where and when it was set made it feel a bit like an epic but it always felt grounded and real enough in everything it was telling us when it needed to be. It's a very slow burn of a film but it knew how to get you sitting on the edge of your seat when it wanted to.I like these type of meandering, plotless films as long as they come together and still do something I wouldn't have seen coming but I think The Assassination of Jesse James gave us an idea that there was going to be a lot more going on, so I went in expecting something very different. The cast did really well but there were too many characters who weren't given enough to do to keep track of and if I didn't already know who the cast were beforehand I would've forgotten most of them because they either felt pushed to the side or like they didn't really need to be there in the film at all. The middle of it lost me because it kept jumping from one character to the next, whose grievances and reason for being there in the scene with James or Ford were too hard to keep up with. It needed to be forty minutes shorter or an hour longer because a lot of it's too slow and dragged-out where it didn't need to be and the middle of it felt hard to sit through because James and Ford carried the film, when nothing was going on with them, when they stopped speaking to each other because Jesse didn't think he could trust him anymore and the film chose to focus on the other gang members who were all sent away it felt a lot harder to keep track of and stay interested.But overall it's one hell of a film - a tight, interesting story most of us already knew but it still pulls you in, Affleck and Pitt gave us two of the best performances I've seen and Deakins really went all in, he made it feel a bit like you're watching an earlier Malick film, the narrator talking to us with the sun shining behind the trees and leaves in the background but it still had its own voice and own story to tell. The film will definitely stand the test of time and is a must see I think, to anyone saying westerns have died out and aren't as good as they were anymore. They can be.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
You think it's all made up don't ya? You think it's all yarns and newspaper stories.,"Thanks to the Venice Film Festival for being the only ones that recognized that the real star of this artistic masterpiece is Brad Pitt, not Casey Affleck.This is another western that doesn't fit the mold. It is an art film in every sense of the word. From the brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a seven-time Oscar nominee (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Shawshank Redemption, The Man Who Wasn't There, Kundun, and this film), to the superb acting in an ensemble that provide a thrilling experience for 160 minutes.Yes, Affleck was very good, and probably gave the performance of his career, but Pitt was clearly the star as Jesse James, a man possessed. He could go from friend to unemotional killer in an instant. He possessed an uncanny ability to discern the thoughts of others. He knew his time was over and committed suicide the only way he could.The film was an interesting study of the celebrity cult that we experience today.

Yet it is a treasure chest of acting. Casey Affleck gives his best performance as Robert Ford. Ruthlessly envious, and yes, a coward. Brad Pitt is equally amazing as Jesse James. Deakins is one of the very best cinematographers out there, and this is some of his best work. Even when he's not with the Coen bros. he's killing it elsewhere. Storytelling style was very well done, which included a great narration that reminded me of Ricky Jay's from Magnolia. What is even more interesting than the story leading up to the assassination. is what happens after, and the guilt, or lack thereof, from Rob Ford. He wanted to become a hero, and instead, became a loser, for all the people he thought hated Jesse James, had idolized him. Tragic irony, and karma is the main theme of this film, much like Amadeus.

Someone save us from auteur directors!,"This film is the perfect example of why directors should stick to visual interpretation of the script and leave the writing to someone who really knows how to tell a story in a concise and engaging manner.Film is not a forgiving medium when it comes to character development and this movie is no exception. I would go as far as to say that ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" is trying to be a novel rather than a film. It spends much too long trying to develop characters who, in the end, we can neither admire, identify with nor completely understand due to the obvious time constraints of the medium. With this in mind the entire pacing of the film will leave most movie viewers snoozing in their seats. I certainly caught more that just a few folks doing just that.To put it bluntly Dominik seems to have made this film for the benefit of other 'artists' and not for the movie-going public. The plot is circuitous, the cinematography breathtaking yet pedantic and the individual scenes anti-climactic. I'm sure that the film will be heralded as a masterpiece by critics and other 'artistes' that consider the rest of us to be cretinous 'Philistines'. To the general movie-going public it will be neither exciting, intriguing or particularly enjoyable. I would recommend ""Jesse James"" only to people who find movies such as 'The Thin Red Line' or 'Citizen Kane' compelling.

Artful Authenticity,"Visually stunning from start to finish. A masterful job with the cinematography. The way this movie is shot makes one desire a long run time.The historical accuracy is very applause worthy. This is no shoot'em up western, but a carefully told story of the last few months of Jeese James and his gang of outlaws. This is a well documented event and it seems the filmmakers did all in their power to make it authentic as possible; even fighting tooth and nail with the studio not to shorten it, or saturate it with action that simply didn't happen.They say a really good sign of an actor is if they can make you hate them in a film. This is the case with Casey Affleck, who plays the coward Robert Ford. He grows up obsessed with the outlaw Jesse James who has been romanticized for his crimes (which I've never been a fan of). But then grows envious and desires the fame, only to realize his mistakes later in life.Brad Pitt had given some really good performances up to this point in films such as 'Legends of the Fall', and 'Fight Club'. To say that his Jesse James portrayal is his best is hard to say, but it's definitely up there. The paranoia of Jesse James combined with his cleverness was on full display.This is a film to be appreciated. Simply put, it's good film making.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent but historical flawed,"Many claim that ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford "" of 2007 contains a historic accurate account of the story and aftermath of the Jessie James assassination. But there is plenty evidence that there are some flaws inside Andrew Dominik's screenplay and Ron Hansen's novel.In 1940 Fritz Lang directed ""The Return of Frank James"" where Frank is getting acquitted by the State Court of Missouri after being in jail a year awaiting trial. On Monday August 27th, 1883, the court-case of the State of Missouri v. of Frank James was resumed, which was the third day of his trial. On Monday September 3rd, 1883 Frank James was acquitted. During the trial Frank Woodson James learned about the real facts surrounding the assassination of his brother Jessie, and no doubt went on his own bounty hunt to get Charles and Robert Ford, using the name Ben J. Woodson. Today it is apparently ""universal evident"" that Frank James never went after the Ford Brothers. I have my sincere doubts .In 1939, a year before producing ""The Return of Frank James"", Fritz Lang became a naturalized citizen of the United States, after arriving in Hollywood in 1936. Would Fritz Lang create a movie with inaccurate historic facts surrounding Jessie James and the Ford brothers, having just received citizen ship and making his large screen arrival with Henry Fonda in the leading actor role as Frank James ?In recent years a Dog and Pony show entitled ""Outlaws of Missouri"" has been annotated to Robert Ford, which according legendsofamerica.com was used by Bob Ford to obfuscate the real facts surrounding the murder : ""Night after night, Ford retold his story, carefully omitting that he had shot James in the back. "" Inside ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" of 2007 we see Robert Ford in his theater show ""Outlaws of Missouri"" clearly shoot Jessie James from behind. So there is something very fishy there, as director Andrew Dominik also here clearly missed the motive for the Robert Ford theater play.After knowing all this, this movie is indeed a must watch for anyone interested in the story behind the James gang.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Guess I'm to Old to Enjoy Great Cinema.,"First off with Positive I really enjoyed Brad Pitts in the roll as Jesse James I found it effortless, dark and brooding. I would not be surprise with an Oscar nod for Mr. Pitt. I cannot say the same for Casey Affleck as Bob Ford I found him whinny, irritating and almost un-watchable. The supporting cast was good and for the most part I thought well cast in their rolls I especially liked Jeremy Renner and Paul Schneider. I must give hats off to Garret Dillahunt I honestly felt he was terrified in a later scene with Brad Pitt his fear looked genuine. However the Movie seemed to just carry on for too long and minor details that did not need a depth to them, were carried on for just to long. Trimming this movie to a respectable 100 minutes might do wonders. It's still a movie worth a look just not at today's ticket prices. My rating is a 2 worth a look but wait until its trimmed for network TV.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Assassination of Jesse James,"I went to see this movie because of it had Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck, and it is a western movie with great cinematography.It is a true story is about American legend Jesse James (Brad Pitt) and his new gang member Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), who has idolized Jesse from childhood. There is a sub-plot where Jesse's brother is killed by another gang member and Robert keeps this fact hidden from Jesse, causes doubts and suspicion in the very sharp and neurotic Jesse James  who sees through Robert's lies. This causes a strange bit of relationship between these two characters. Jesse weirdness and swinging moods has such a hold and control over Robert that Robert is scared to death. In one such moment of fear, Robert shoots Jesse and kills him. Robert is honored by government, enacts stage performances of Jesse's killings. Robert is not able to live this life where people around him hate him for killing Jesse. At the end of the movie, Robert is shot by stranger.Brad Pitt is one of the producers and the movie is directed by Andew Dominik (Chopper fame  again based on a true story assassin). Roger Deakins is the director of photography and has shot the movie with such a heavenly feel that irrespective of anything; a true movie lover can go and sit in this movie for the sheer magic of the image on the BIG screen canvas.Bard Pitt has acted very well and remains an enigma personified of Jesse James. But I liked Casey Affleck's awkwardness, subtlety, fear psychosis and dilemmas as Robert Ford are superb.The movie is long, 160 minutes; but the time well worth for getting absorbed into the story and characters. It reminded me of Zodiac. Similarly, this is the sixteenth movie made on Jesse James, and I can assure that the treatment of this movie is amazingly different from any other movie you would have seen of Jesse James.(Stars 8 out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Having slept throughout most of the film, I can still give you a fairly detailed description of everything that happened and why (along with the film-maker's philosophical perspective on the events). How on earth can all these production companies allow this guy 2:40 mins of nearly nothingness? Are the Warners sans Oscar contenders this year?

Holy Moses... this was just..,"AWFULLY long. I had to be kept at gun point to finish it. I only give this two stars because of Deakins' cinematography. The acting was hammy and the overall energy a total bore fest. Stop making movies 30-45 min too long.Brad Pitt can be good sometimes, but here he was annoying. I couldn't care less about any of the characters and frankly, Jesse wasn't played as a bad enough person. If you are going to portray someone like Jesse James, then show him like an evil person so we could hate him. They failed to do that. Who was the protagonist? No one, really, which is why this movie failed. Nor was there really any hero to root for. Casey was a bore. There just wasn't enough character and relationship development to make me care. Unforgiven did a good job with that so we actually cared about the people and rooted at the end. Dances with Wolves also did a great job creating characters we cared about and they showed pure evil so we rooted when Costner triumphed.It is the combination of bad writing and directing that made this a dud.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a western! Not a western!  Not a western!,"I watched this movie finally on DVD and while it had some good not great moments it lacked something. Let me see now, there was no plot, no real tension, the dialog was absolutely boring, no action to speak of, the characters were one dimensional, and the so called Hero(Jesse James) was despicable. Not one character in this movie inspired any remorse in me at the thought of them dieing. The one train robbery that took place was so boring and stupid that it defied logic. Brad Pitts acting abilities were wasted on this show, he did a much much better job in Portraying Achilles in Troy. That movie had some great dialog. In the end this movie can be summed up as a portrayal of one backshooter shooting another backshooter. John Wayne will be rolling over in his grave to think that this movie is called a western. Great movies must have some memorable scenes, memorable dialog, characters that rouse our emotions and we care about, a plot that has us on the edge of our seats, and a purpose for making it. This movie has none of the above and thusly can be said to be mediocre at best.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"aspires to grandeur, but doesn't make it","I was drawn to this movie by the user rating of 7.5, which, after viewing it, I can't quite understand. The Western vistas are indeed spectacular, and many of the scenes are composed in an almost painterly way (which actually becomes somewhat of a distraction, as the camera lovingly lingers on them, as a painting in a gallery). However, the movie would be benefit by some brutal editing. It's not just the time; I have seen 90 minute flicks that seem longer than Lawrence of Arabia, which is so well-made it seems to fly by even at 3 hours and 46 minutes. It's a matter of pacing, which in this flick seems glacial, especially due to the director's having the camera dwell too long on a scene after its essential action has been completed, and having dialogue delivered in as drawn out a fashion as possible.Also, the movie neglects two key aspects of the history involved. First, it glosses over Jesse James's deep involvement with pro-slavery forces (especially in ""Bloody Kansas"") and, later, his involvement with pro-Confederate guerilla forces. Even his robberies often had a political twist, aiming at Republican and pro-Union targets. Second, it completely omits the fact that Robert Ford was convicted for the murder of James, and quickly pardoned by Governor Crittendon.The climax of the movie is of course Ford's assassination of James, but the post-assassination scenes are so drawn out as to seem to me to be almost anticlimactic. And, although the movie does not portray any Robin Hood-like activity by James, the use in the final scenes of the popular song celebrating him for such might mislead the viewer into believing it's true, which it wasn't. My final kvetch - a personal one - is that I have trouble seeing Brad Pitt as a heavy, having seen him play so many off-kilter, eccentric characters (Burn After Reading, Snatch, Bullet Train).",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Avoid this Loser at All Costs!,"Hmmm! 4300 people input a 10 as their evaluation of the most boring movie of 2007. Where does that come from? Are these employees of Warner Brothers? This movie was the biggest let-down of the year. We greatly anticipated seeing it, but found it was boring and stupid in the beginning and remained boring and stupid for 2 hours and 39 minutes.Having almost no story, no suspense, no love interest, and with most of the dialog mumbled and incomprehensible, Brad Pitt and Casey Aflick seem to be in a contest to deliver the dullest and flattest performance of the year.It is not impossible for today's Hollywood to make a good western. HBO's ""Deadwood"" proves that. Deadwood was as full of life and full of entertainment value as ""Assassination..."" is full of boredom and stupidity.The film takes the aura of historical accuracy, but a mere 5 minutes on Google will teach you that most of the alleged accuracy is a lie.Sixty-nine years ago, Henry King directed JESSE JAMES and it became an instant classic, still sought after in 2008. A year later, Fritz Lang made the sequel, RETURN OF FRANK JAMES. Both pictures were superior in terms of acting, suspense, cinematography, musical score, and the ability to entertain --- the essence of quality film-making. Later, Sam Fuller made his B-movie classic I SHOT JESSE JAMES featuring John Ireland's on-target role as Robert Ford. These were quality movies, and they endure decades later. ""Assasination..."" despite the alleged 10 scores was an instant box office failure, and after the current DVD run will be quickly forgotten.Please don't waste 2 1/2 hours on this pile of trash.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is welljust read the title again and you should get the basic idea of what the movie is about.The film is essential about the famed assassination. It starts out slowly, builds up slowly, and ends slowly but still manages to become an incredible peace of work. It is a very well-developed, methodically paced character study of two menJesse James and Robert Ford. This is not a busy story with lots of things happening. Robert Ford (played by Cassey Affleck) is entering adulthood (he is 19 but tells everyone he is 20). He is the youngest of five brothers, and seems like the one who was always teased mercilessly, never taken seriously, and never given any responsibility or respect. In contrast, Jesse James (played by Brad Pitt) is coming to the end of his infamous legendary career (he is 34). He always seems in control, does not show his emotions outwardly and is feared and respected wherever he goes.The majority of the film is Robert attempting to get in the ""in"" group of Jesse's gang. He wants to be the close one to Jesse. He examines and imitates Jesse's every move and gesture with an intense obsession, like a crazed fan of a certain celebrity. His methodical, relentless observations of Jesse border on obsession and are laced with sexual longing overtones.I never was hugely impressed with Brad Pitt's acting abilities until I saw Bable and now he produces another very real, stirring performance brining out more of his talent. Cassey Affleck delivers the best performance of the film as he is able to convey so much emotion, longing, and desire just with expressions and tones of voice. I am curious to see what he does next. I love long films, but I think this should have been shorter because some of the length of the film (2hrs.40mins. to be exact) comes from extended still shots of various people and scenes which, due to the simplicity of the story, bogged the film down and seemed unnecessary. None the less, this is sprawling, languid, beautifully fashioned film.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Everybody love's to see from time to time a western with action and gun's and stuff like this, but this movie make forgot that if you have in the beginning ten minutes of little action isn't making your movie interesting.

A star each for the photography and Candian locations,"When the photography and landscape are the best and only good elements to a film, it is bad. Indeed both photography and location are time used covers for a bad film and this one is really awful.What's wrong with it can be summed up in Billy Wilder's comment about Titanic: Where's the story in that? In this film it lacks any dram at all, it has been written and conceived as a extended Ken Burns' historical film. But like the magisterial series Burns did on the Civil War the explication and narration of events clarifies and reveals, it is not dramatic unless the use of that word is so misunderstood.In ""The assassination...."" the same strategy is used with voice over narrating what is being shown on screen. That is not bad: it's not even admissible to film school, its so bad. Nothing is dramatized, the dialog has all the characters talking in similar cadence and the central relationship between James and Ford is left ambiguous, when it is the crux of the film.The result is a bloated, pompous, and over long movie; of course, as if the narcoleptic effects of such a long film will add significance to it.

A poor man's Terrence Malick.,"I had wanted to see this movie since it came out in 2007. Unfortunately, the wait was NOT worth it. This movie has had mostly glowing reviews, and in some cases people list it as one of the best ""Westerns"" ever. It is certainly ""artsy"", like a poor man's Terrence Malick. The character development is sorely missing for one thing. We don't get to hear or see why Jesse was they way he was. Instead we get a ""legend"" version of Jesse, as a glorified sociopath. Revisionist Westerns like this, are so untruthful and put criminals/sociopaths on pedestals. Like the song about Jesse says, ""he stole from the rich and gave to the poor"", which was total malarky. I didn't believe Pitt was Jesse for one moment. Perhaps a much better actor could have made the movie more impactful. Casey ""blunt"" Affleck was not much better. The supporting cast, however, did deliver good performances. The movie was painfully slow and lacked any kind of depth. The only good aspect of the film, is that it had an authentic look. But,Terrence Malik does artsy/authentic much better. To summarize, a ""handsome"", but overly long, tedious movie with characters you could care less about.

Very Disappointing -- Needs a serious edit,"I was very disappointed with this film. The pacing is slow, very slow. The narration is ponderous and should have been unnecessary, or at least greatly reduced. The film is long.There is nothing shown about Jessie James that explains why the American populace treated him as a hero. There is nothing in the film to support the narrator's suggestion that he gave money to the poor, or cared about anyone outside of his immediate family. Did I mention the film is long?The cinematography is ... wide open spaces ... lots of shots of tall dry grass ... and a way overused ""technique"" -- a focused circle surrounded by out of focus. The focus effect made no sense whatsoever. Was it supposed to be how Jessie saw the world? How Ford did?The music only added to the slowness. Way too many sad slow violins and other strings. The music is lifeless and so is the film. Perhaps that was the point, if so it still could have been made in less time. Hey have you heard how long, and slow, and morose this film is?I kept expecting it to pick up, or for there to be some twist, something beyond what is told in the title. There was not.

A Unique Film Experience That Cures Insomnia,"Never before have I had to watch a film 4 times before I got to the end, it's so boring it just kept sending me asleep. Young Guns, this film isn't.Much of that is to do with Ridley 'Epic' Scott, arguably the most overrated director around. He does the same thing which made other epics like Kingdom of Heaven such a turn off. Talking, plodding, a bit of action here & there, more talking, plodding, repeat. Any film that goes over 2 hours in length better be Pulp Fiction or they end up the Lord of the Rings - slow, plodding, dull movies which take forever to get to the point.Take this film. We know from the stupidly OTT title that Casey Affleck's character is going to shoot the Brad Pitt one before we start viewing. So we wait, & wait, & wait. Finally it happens, 2 hours in & that's it. Or should be, but like the 3rd LOTR movie, it keeps going on, & on, & on. Like the ring in those overrated postcard movies, once Jesse James is gone, it's film over - or should be. The extra half hour or so feels likes an elongated deleted scenes reel & barely relevant to what went on.As for the acting, it's pretty dire too. Brad does his, 'look into my pouty blue eyes, I'm suddenly mad & zany' act for the umpteenth time, whereas Affleck is one-trick wooden pony ('I'm 20, sir' as he tends to remind us enough).All in all, it's a vanilla type film. Pleasant on the eye, adequate to listen to & won't offend anyone. However, it's a really, really bland & boring experience, & if I'm honest, I can't remember how it finished after Bob Ford's on stage breakdown after the 100th showing of his act.

Too long and way too slow,"This is one of those movies that so many people on this web site absolutely love.I have read many of the reviews posted about this movie and find myself in disagreement with most of them.It isn't all bad but I will try and explain just why I can only give this film a five out of ten score.Firstly,I will admit that the cinematography here is fabulous.A really great job was done on the look of this movie.Also,the acting is pretty good throughout although I think that the praise that Casey Affleck(Robert Ford) has garnered has been overplayed.He is good but not brilliant.In his early appearances in the movie he tries too hard to be the naive and slightly odd youngster and his voice is grating.You can just tell he is acting.He is much better later on as he becomes a more cynical character.But it must be said that there are other actors here that are just as impressive especially Garret Dillahunt(Ed Miller) and Sam Rockwell(Charley Ford).Also impressive is Sam Shephard(Frank James),who is very much underused.Brad Pitt is fine as Jesse James.Not an award winning performance but he is OK.Now I come to the two biggest problems.The film is way too long and also way too slow.There are just too many times when the pace drags almost to a stop and there doesn't appear to be anything going on at all.I have no problem at all with films almost three hours in length if they hold the attention.'Godfather 1 & 2','The Good,The Bad & The Ugly' and 'Once Upon A Time In The West' are all wonderful movies simply because the stories are so compelling.They are involving and the pace moves towards a gripping conclusion.With 'The Assassination Of Jesse James' the pace flags too often and by half way I was losing patience and interest.I have read reviews where people have compared this to the films of Sergio Leone.Don't make me laugh!It comes nowhere near to the tension,the sheer drama his westerns can muster.Many people will think my review is a load of rubbish but I stick by it as this is a ponderous movie.Great to look at maybe but a journey that will most definitely make you saddle sore.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

This Film Was Shot In Canada Ahhh!,"I was so let down by this film. It was very slow and I didn't like the script. I honestly thought 3:10 to Yuma was better. Very nicely shot and great costumes and props/sets. Shot in Calgary and Edmonton, AB, and Winnipeg, Canada. I think the camera work was beautiful. Very professionally shot. I was a little let down with the Producing of Ridley Scott and Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt has not made a good movie since Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the Bradgelina curses his career still. Par acting by Brad Pitt, I've seen better from him in older movies like Fight Club. I got all hyped up for this shot em' up cowboy story that glamorized a fading legend. Instead, I thought this film was pretty boring and is going to get looked over by many. There has been many more westerns made that pay better tribute to the genre then Mr. Pitt's latest effort. But thanks Brad for supporting the Canadian film industry as you just love charities and helping humanity with Angelina.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Proof that people follow the I guess lesder, this movie was absolutely horrible and BORING!!","This movie is NOT a western folks! You know 6 shooters, rifles, winchesters, fricking HORSES!! THIS HAD NONE OF THAT it's not a western it's a 100 percent boring DRAMA!, People quit saying something is good because someone else says it is and if it walks and talks like a duck it's a duck!! This is a DRAMA absolutely no western. No action, no adventure, 100 percent pure boredom!! What a waste of a phenomenal cast!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Want a movie with lots of ACTION, SUSPENSE, DRAMA, INTRIGUE, PLOT TWISTS, WITTY DIALOGUE, EXCITEMENT, GREAT ACTING...????","This ain't it.Decent camera work.Otherwise, terribly pedestrian, uneventful and outright boring.Might have made a good 15 minute movie. But when you stretch 15 minutes of content over 2 hours and 40 minutes, you get, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"".If you're going to watch it, try 10x speed.

Ponderous and pretentious,"I consume many movies and love all types of movies. Here are the warnings to anyone before they watch:Voice over is warning number one. A proper movie needs nothing else. Film noir uses it to entertain us with written source- not explain what is going on. 3 hour length is warning number two. Comedies can be one hour plus; great films can push to 2 hours plus (this is based on biology, not culture). The pacing of this film is inexplicable. It serves no purpose, so earns the adjective, ""pretentious"". Sam Rockwell/Charly Ford is the most interesting actor/character is warning number three. Brad Pitt is great, but in the end, not the real story. Casey Afflek is overwhelmed. He does some good and interesting things with the character, but they are buried in the 3 hours of footage. If somebody put a camera on my face for 3 hours, I would (accidentally) come up with some pensive/expressive/interested facial expressions/voices. Doesn't make me an actor. This is a great story and a great idea for a screenplay and it has solid professional actors in it. In this case, I would just judge that the director screwed it up. On this site, fans try to diminish the critics. I love westerns, I love art films, I love Brad Pitt, ...... I just don't love this film",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Drawbacks that Ruin a Film,"A slow pace, art house, western. Like No Country for Old Men, the film explores the theme of the illogical notion of idealizing the past. Both films end up attacking the ""idealization"" by showing the past, like the present, as being a bleak, secular world. For those people looking for an action western-- look for another film; the film is structure mostly on conversations between characters. It is a very, slow pace film.On the positive aspects, Casey Affleck and Sam Rockwell,as well as most of the supporting cast is superb... Affleck ( not Ben) and Rockwell should be cast in more films. Roger Deakins' cinematography is done in an unique, old photograph style, manner. Personally, not a fan of the look, but many people are. Also, the wardrobe and set design appear realistic.The film fails to become a pleasant experience, since there are too many drawbacks. First of all, Brad Pitt is miscast; he is completely overshadow by the rest of the cast. Normally, this would not be a problem, but the film depends on the legend and stage presence of Jesse James(Pitt's character). Though ambitious, the fails to deliver the book, documentary mood. Many directorial decisions, such as the use of narration, hurts the impact of many scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
And the point is?,I failed to see any point in this movie. It is certainly artistic with several Andrew Wyeth type scenes. But there are a plethora of characters who are interchangeable and look alike. There is a voice over that desperately tries to make this movie appear to be a serious undertaking. What we get for over 2 hours is a lot of style with a lot of postcard scenes. Was there any editing done in this movie at all? Or did everyone believe that this was an artistic masterpiece? It's mostly visual pretentiousness.It's a very long movie and the seasons and the scenery change rapidly. There are scenes and dialogue that appear for appearance sake. In the end do we really care about Jesse James?,3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tiresome experience,"If Jesse James was really so void of personality and depth as Brad Pitt portrays him to be, then there should never have been a movie about him. There are attempts to give the guy some soul, but it doesn't work. I don't know why, maybe Pitt simply can't help being himself, and brings to the screen a very confused man who tries to be cool, cocky and depressed at the same time, but you feel it doesn't make for natural viewing at all. Even the way he speaks is very unnatural. He finds it very hard to play anything but himself.The only redeeming feature, and the only engaging character in this film is Robert Ford, played by a magnificent Casey Affleck. He's the only guy one can connect with, even though he's a misguided, delusional youth.That's where the compliments end. Because the film sets out as a deep character study of people without character, and cares not a iota about thrilling or entertaining with plots, it turns out to be one loooong failure.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
