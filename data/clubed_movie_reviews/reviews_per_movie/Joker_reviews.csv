Between a 7 and an 8,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
MASTERPIECE üòç,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Hype is real,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
OK film,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Went for a second time to watch,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness.

Extremely overrated,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Absolute LOVE,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the characters personalities, to the wardrobe, to the overall feeling it gives you..an absolute 10/10! The acting was absolutely phenomenal and this movie is one of those I can watch over and over again! Watching this movie gives you a sense of sadness, laughter and at times anger all in one. It shows a different perspective than the overall known villian; that is the Joker. I love that the movie wasn't made so much so an action but more of the backstory of the joker, all being played out in real time. Like I said; this movie for me will be on repeat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Finally, a REAL movie","This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great.

It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline.

What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger.

It's About a Man,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret.

Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli.

The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe.

CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived,"10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away

Yes, Phoenix's portrayal of his character was riveting. Yes, the story was both gripping and also necessary, especially today when it seems that mental illness is running rampant. Yes, the tone was magnificently set within both the cinematic and art direction.What I have a problem with, is the way it tied into the Batman universe and particularly with what it had in common and what differentiated it from the

Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema,"While the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.I have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.The whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.I have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Joker's laughter is no joking matter,"Writer-director Todd Phillips's new movie ""Joker"" appeals to me on multiple levels, primarily by offering an engaging story, strongly rooted in believable reality, related to audiences mainly by opposing protagonist's prevalent dark depressive moods while using often optimistic soundtrack and sound editing, shallow nonetheless rich visuals, angles and framing, theatricality augmented through expressive costumes, props and sets, but most impressively via great principal performances and acting choices made by Joaquin Phoenix in the lead as a title character (under proper fictional name Arthur Fleck), whose sudden uncontrollable and seemingly inappropriate laughter (justified as a medical condition) easily counterpoints the (painful need for) outcry from Gotham (read: any) City masses, hurt and deprived by injustices of their quotidian existence, as well as by Robert De Niro in a quintessential supporting role of a TV-comedy show host Murray Franklin (both worthy of the end-of-the-year acting award considerations), and by setting believable pre-course for the future adventures of the most realistic DC Comics character, the Batman (not a superhero at all, with his extraordinary capabilities rather resulting from his physical fitness and skills combined with high technology employed), who appears here only as a young boy, and whose later adult activities could be understood as largely driven by what has happened to his parents in the final scene of this movie, an event directly inspired by actions of Joker, henceforth his future main nemeses.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Superficial and often tedious but what a performance!,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not.

What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense.

A man's descent into madness,"There have been several stabs at the Joker story. You've got Tim Burton's version where Joker is a career criminal who is disfigured and then dropped into a vat of chemicals and emerges with his insane tendencies unleashed. And then there is Christopher Nolan's version where Joker is an anonymous person and agent of chaos with no ID found on him whatsoever during the brief time he's in custody in Gotham. He doesn't have rage, he just likes pitting people against one another. Or maybe you prefer the 60s TV Joker who just seems to exist because Caesar Romero's career was flagging late in his life.This version is different from all of the others. Here Joker is an accurate depiction of how mental illness and abuse, when left unchecked by society, can lead an individual towards committing violent and self-destructive acts. So the first three quarters of the film is just how, little by little, an already bullied mentally ill man, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), has everything taken from him - companionship, his job, his hopes for career, his medical care, and even his identity itself.At one point, Arthur commits an act of self-defense on the subway that is spun by the press and the authorities into an act of vigilantism due to the identities of his attackers - Wall Street traders working for Thomas Wayne. Nobody knows who the vigilante is because Arthur was wearing his clown makeup. But that backfires when the incident spawns a true vigilante movement with people in clown masks carrying banners that say ""Kill The Rich"" and committing random crimes. Meanwhile, the act of killing his attackers, plus losing his last thread of support and trust in people, births the Joker we've come to know. Complications ensue.This was a hard film to watch. And that's not because of any excessive violence, although there is some of that, it's because Fleck/Joker is just so disconnected from the world that he doesn't get the people in it, and they don't get him. One scene that really got to me was in the beginning where Fleck is on a bus headed home from work. A little kid a few seats up is staring at him, and so he begins to make faces to amuse the kid, which he does. His mother turns around and sternly tells Fleck to stop bothering her child. She is so stern and dismissive. Everybody just wants him to keep his distance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises,"DC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
great character work,"Gotham is in dire difficulties like New York City back in the 70's. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a mentally unstable clown. He laughs uncontrollably in stressful times. He gets beaten and robbed by a group of youths. He gets fired from his job. He lives with his unstable sick mom (Frances Conroy) who worked for Thomas Wayne and claims him to be her ex-lover and Arthur's biological father. When Arthur is attacked by three drunken suits in the subway, he shoots them dead. Thomas Wayne is outraged by the killing of these three well-educated pillars of society and announces his campaign for the mayor's office. Arthur has a relationship with his single-mom neighbor Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) and admires talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro).This is great character work from Joaquin Phoenix. He is one of the great actors working today. Director Todd Phillips is pounding his chest a lot and deserves some praise. I do have a couple of problems with his work. The smaller problem is the continuous shooting of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne with her pearls. That scene has been done so many times in the past three decades. It may be better to simply suggest it with a clown walking into the alley with a gun. Don't show the shooting. Just do the sound of the shot and leave. It's all been done before and Phillips should know this. The bigger issue is setting up this world. I think Phillips expected that the audience knows this world as a given. The streets have lots of garbage. There are news reports. Phillips fails to spell it out especially if income inequality is such a big theme in the movie. It needs a Wall Street protest or two. At least, there should be a protest in front of Wayne Tower. The first clown protest against Wayne seems to come out of nowhere. The hatred of the rich needs some background. Overall, this is a great new needed voice in the comic book superhero genre which presents ground to build a new franchise on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Phoenix' amazing performance,"The overall visual presentation is strong. The cinematic daylight scenes pop with vibrant, crisp colors, while the darker scenes convey a cold, gritty atmosphere that complements the story's tone. However, there's a lack of coordination in some scenes, where some shots feel out of alignment with the framing grid, and a few are unnecessarily blurred or too dark to fully make out. As for the editing, I appreciated how the film was structured, providing necessary background and context for Arthur's transformation.The plot is heavy, gritty, and dark, diving deep into societal issues like the harsh division between the rich and poor. It's simple but effective, yet I feel the film could have explored these themes more in depth, especially through additional dialogue. Some scenes reminded me of Scorsese's Taxi Driver, particularly in the way it depicts the protagonist's isolation and troubled mind.Joaquin Phoenix delivers an astonishing performance as Arthur Fleck. His portrayal of a man descending into chaos resonated with me on a deep, emotional level. His ability to convey Arthur's pain and frustration is devastating, and his performance left me feeling drained in the best way possible. Phoenix captures Arthur's fragile state so well that it's hard not to empathize with him, even as he spirals out of control.The OST fits Arthur's image perfectly, capturing the haunting and unsettling mood of the film. The music is used with precision and adds so much to the overall experience. The film cleverly plays with sound to reflect Arthur's perception of reality. Some background sounds feel artificial.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Well, society takes the side of murderers when it comes to killing bad guys. In a taxi driver, it looked like an idea to think about, but in the gloomy fictional city of Gotham... well, what's normal) Of course, you can get to the bottom of it and compare all the common elements to say that one copies the other, but why? The emotional coloring of the films is different, as well as the depth of disclosure of the characters, as well as the plot as a whole.The film is a little bit about something else. A person with mental disorders wants to be like Murray, but he makes fun of him. And there will be no peaceful solution after that...I don't want to delve into the plot, because retelling is bad. I'll highlight the elements that also look cool, like the first time.How it was shot, what angles, colors were selected. Music also helps the gloomy atmosphere.

Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic however and the film has all the top production values that you'd expect of a big studio picture but it's generic and predicable in my opinion. It takes from so much that it's not it's own film for me. By no means is the film awful, it's just soulless. I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse and against the tide of support for this film either, there are things as I've mentioned to commend and I'd like to add that going the way of gritty R rated film making is what I've wanted for years, from a more dramatic viewpoint, I thought ""Logan"" did what this film failed to do for me as a darker comic book oriented film. I hope people can respect my opinion just as I respect the free speech of everyone who really liked the film. Finally, I will add that those who have bashed the film for violence do not know what they're talking about. There are far more violent films than this and if one person or even a handful of people were incentivised to cause harm to others, the rest of us shouldn't have to pay for the odd few thank you very much.

A MASTERPIECE,"""Joker"" (2019) - A Masterpiece of CinemaRating: 10/10""Joker,"" directed by Todd Phillips, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It's a bold, gritty reimagining of one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, but it transcends the superhero genre to become a profound character study, driven by Joaquin Phoenix's electrifying performance.Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck, a deeply troubled man who descends into madness, is one of the finest acting performances in modern cinema. His ability to capture the nuances of a broken soul, teetering on the edge of chaos, is both haunting and mesmerizing. Every scene he's in is magnetic, pulling viewers into his unraveling psyche. Phoenix's physical transformation, from his skeletal appearance to his erratic laughter, solidifies him as a force of nature, delivering a performance that is both unsettling and deeply tragic.The film's cinematography is equally stunning. Lawrence Sher, the director of photography, crafts each frame with meticulous care, using color, shadow, and composition to reflect Arthur's journey from isolation to infamy. The use of muted tones in the beginning to emphasize Arthur's bleak existence, followed by more vibrant hues as he embraces his Joker persona, enhances the film's psychological depth. The iconic stairs scene, shot with a mix of exhilaration and menace, will remain etched in cinematic history for its symbolic power.""Joker"" also benefits from a gripping score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, whose eerie and melancholic music perfectly complements the film's dark, oppressive atmosphere.Overall, ""Joker"" stands as a remarkable achievement in storytelling, acting, and visual artistry.

I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
#LetRottenTomatoesRotSquad,"I am a simple guy. I watch films, I enjoy life's simple pleasures.One thing I despise doing in life (because it feels pointless) is being far too judgemental or complex as I watch a film that is portraying a message or story in its own way.Will I compare Rambo to Ace Ventura? No. Will I compare Saving Private Ryan to Endgame? No. I watch each film individually and if it completes its own mission of what it wanted to deliver, then I'm a happy bunny. I will not let life's current politics, or the sensitivity of the pathetic world's expectations to override a successful STORY. For me, a story is the most important part of a film personally.With that being said... JOKER is a successful STORY. In fact, I will call it a masterpiece because of how it delivers the realistic, sympathetic character build ups of one of the most popular villains in the history of time and space.And one of the main reasons I became attached and cared for the character was because of PHOENIX. What a fantastic actor. He nailed it. That is all I need to say. I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and Heath Ledger's Joker... But where Ledger successfully gave us a realistic Joker for the first time, PHOENIX has now taken that championship with respect. PHOENIX has now given us the same in his own way, with a deeper and more engrossing background. Additionally, with an outstanding Joker performance (the dancing and laughing)... Absolutely spot on.The mystery of the Joker is still retained in this movie... And even though its an ""Origins"" story... I still feel like The Joker is a complete mystery.PHOENIX is in almost every scene, and its because of him and his execution and commitment to the role which makes this movie a standalone masterpiece. And it brings the respect back to The Joker character after that terrible representation of... What's his name again?If you want a super hero movie, this movie is not that movie. Joker's mission as a movie is to take the audience on a crazy trip inside the mind of the Joker... Its not about cinematics... Or explosions... Or gadgets... Or casting... It's about ""Why?""And now I see ""Why?""So now ask yourself... ""Why so serious?""",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The internet drama surrounding this movie is more interesting than the movie itself,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and in an endless sea of mediocre cape flicks released every year, the Joker obviously looks like a masterpiece by comparison.The movie itself is not as memorable or clever as the fanboys claim it is, but it still mesmerizes me the passionate reactions everyone seems to have about the Joker, with some acting as if this was some sort of cinematic Antichrist (Similar to the way in which a lot of people reacted to the mere existence of movies like the Da Vinci Code or the Last Temptation of the Christ back then) claiming it would definitely inspire acts of violence.I can't help but find ironic how a movie that demonizes the rich (To be fair, they totally deserve to be demonized) still manages to get lot of love from the same kind of reactionaries that would be against billionaires paying higher taxes, and also a lot of love from people who worship Trump as a god (Despite the fact that Trump and his cronies are very close in personality to the trio of rich jerks that harass Arthur in the subway than Thomas Wayne-Who, by the way, isn't exactly portrayed very sympathetically either)Must be a consequence of these clueless reviews and hot takes made by equally clueless reviewers that only focus in the fact that the main character is Caucasian and male, and not in the fact that he is poor and suffering from bad (physical and mental) health, despite the fact the movie clearly shows he is anything but privileged. And also, despite the fact the events from this movie are told from the perspective of Arthur Fleck, that doesn't mean the movie ""glorifies"" his behavior, nor is he portrayed as a hero (Also remember that plenty of scenes made very clear he is pretty delusional, so his perspective of the events is ambiguous at best, but it seems that modern audiences have become allergic to any form of ambiguity for some reason)Sometimes I wonder why the Batman-related media seems to have such bizarre effect on people. It's the Dark Knight all over again, a decent movie treated as the best thing since sliced bread. And while I admit that while this is better than anything from the MCU, I also think that kind of soulless corporate garbage shouldn't be the measure of quality for anything.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Rise of the Joker!,"Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie.

MOST OVERRATED AND OVER HYPED FILM OF ALL TIME,"The hype the movie generated did absolutely injustice to the film.
The actor did a pretty good job but the screenplay and story is too much boring. The first half its bearable but the last half really let down the film entirely. One of the worst films ever to get such a huge IMDB ratings ever.Wasted my 2 hours completely.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Darkest and grittiest film of the year,"From the director of ""The Hangover"" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's ""The King of Comedy"" with a touch of ""Taxi Driver"". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in ""The Master""). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film ""Blow Out"" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.
The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since ""Casino"". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence).",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Film of the year (if not of the decade),"I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.I just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the ""villain/good guy"" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.The cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible.

His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema.

A gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.,"A confused representation of insanity from a perspective of a sane person, a celebration of madness and chaos.
At last, I have watched one of the most anticipated movies of this year.
I experienced sadness, creepiness, joy, rage, confusion altogether, and it felt good.
The story was above average, sometimes the director seemed confused about what he's trying to say.
There were so many beautiful distinct pieces scattered throughout the film that gives you chills but ultimately they failed to form a complete landscape, eventually it became a gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.
It criticizes our self-centered, pretentious, empathy less society but ironically the movie itself falls under its own sword.Welcome, Tod Phillips to the big boy's club! His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.
The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly! That's why it failed to become a complete cinematic art rather than a montage of eye pleasing scenes, and nothing more.Overall, despite its shortcomings, this movie is definitely one of the most exciting movie of this year.My Rating:7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Thanks to Philipps and Phoenix, a great many young people watched for the first time an honest movie which was made with a very special vision and told almost perfectly the story about a man struggling with life and how society interacts with him. The soundtrack alone is worth the admission. But the performance of Phoenix is out of this world.

A film about mental health,"""Joker"" (2019) defies the typical superhero genre, presenting itself as a cinematic tour de force that should not be pigeonholed as a mere comic book adaptation. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck is nothing short of Oscar-worthy, elevating the film to unparalleled heights with his raw, intense portrayal of a man unraveling at the seams.Director Todd Phillips courageously navigates away from the expected superhero narrative, delivering a character-driven masterpiece that serves as a stark and realistic exploration of mental health. This film offers a chilling look into the psyche of its protagonist, shedding light on the consequences of societal neglect and the complexities of mental illness.The cinematography by Lawrence Sher is a visual feast, capturing the gritty and atmospheric essence of Gotham City. The film's dark and intense tones perfectly complement Phoenix's portrayal, creating an immersive experience that plunges the audience into the depths of Arthur Fleck's troubled mind.Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's hauntingly beautiful score adds another layer of depth to the narrative, underscoring the emotional turmoil of the story. The music becomes a powerful companion to Phoenix's performance, creating a symphony of despair that resonates long after the credits roll.""Joker"" is not just a comic book film; it's a gripping character study that transcends genre expectations. While it may not be suitable for all audiences due to its intense themes, those willing to engage with the film on a profound level will find themselves captivated by its brilliance. Phoenix's performance alone is worth the price of admission, marking it as one of the most memorable portrayals in recent cinematic history.In conclusion, ""Joker"" stands as a testament to the potential of film to provide a realistic and unflinching examination of mental health. A must-watch for those seeking a film that goes beyond the confines of traditional comic book storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Slow Descent Into....Okay,"No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as ""King Of Comedy"" or ""Taxi Driver"" you know where the pieces will fit.
The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one).
The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't.
The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker.
Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of ""gee, isnt the music so different than what we see"" territory.

"Well, it wasn't my cup of tea...","Right, with all the praise and hype that the 2019 movie ""Joker"" from director Todd Phillips have been getting, this is very much a movie that you'd eventually find your way to watching.I did so too, and let me just say that expectations were high when I sat down to watch ""Joker"". Expectations that the movie didn't live up to. Man, this movie was definitely not my cup of tea.First of all, the pacing of the movie. Talk about being prolonged and dragging on, without nothing much of any real worth happening. Sure Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in his acting performance as Arthur Fleck and the gradual downward sloping trip towards becoming the Joker.But the storyline wasn't really one that did much to get me worked up. Director Todd Phillips took quite his time to get from A to B, and without dishing out much in terms of phenomenal storytelling and movie presentation along the way.There was one scene, a single scene, that was glorious, and it was when Arthur Fleck was on the Murray Franklin show and what happened to Murray Franklin on live TV. That scene actually had me laughing. But the rest of the movie was somewhat of a slow-paced drag to sit through. Sure, it was somewhat entertaining, but awfully slow paced. However, this is hardly a movie that I will be watching a second time around.Aside from Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, the movie also bolstered performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy, whom individually were adding something good to the movie, just a shame that they didn't have more screen time.I don't understand why critics are so worked up about this movie, I honestly don't.

This was a technical masterpiece and Phoenix was great.,"But the 10 star reviews that came flooding in were too much for me to take seriously, and I was right.By all means, go see Joker - it's a standalone origin story that needs no knowledge of the Batman series, but it also rewards fans of that series with some very convincing details and very believable storytelling.I won't get into the plot, but there are some twists. Very well done, in fact, even though they are both reminiscent of certain M. Knight Shymalan films. Very tastefully done and expertly integrated into the storyline without overindulgence and quite important for the story and character arcs at play. Bravo in that respect.Also, applause for the cinematography, the style, the homages to previous classics and just the wonderfully realistic atmosphere that the director and his crew were able to bring to life here. Positively the most believable and realistic Gotham ever. Some might find that to be a veiled critique, but it makes this film watchable and enjoyable by those who have no knowledge of the Batman franchise(s).Just altogether airtight production and direction. Hands down.The only gripe I have is with the score - not the songs, necessarily, but the use of over-dramatic violin/cello passages and too-loud unnecessary (and very dark) orchestral pieces that almost take the audience out of the experience. Those who have seen it may know what I am talking about, but no spoilers.All in all, this is very much worth watching even if I feel as though it may spawn some copycats in real life - sure to have a long ""cult film"" life after it fades from the cinemas.7.5/10 with no caveats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Artificial Uprising,"The whole point of this movie is to bring attention to mental illness (I'll do you one better and name a bigger issue than mental illness that the film barely focuses on; the lack of quality mental healthcare) but the film completely discredits its own message with a one dimensional depiction of most of the world and characters that inhabit it. It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world.

"Realistic Origin & Amazing, Gritty Performance","The film starts off slow but straight off the bat, compelling, interesting look into the life of Arthur Fleck, Joker. It is unclear whether or not this is the Infamous Joker aka Batman's nemesis. Without trying to spoil anything, it is unclear whether or not some parts of this origin are true or not, and this is because of an unreliable narrator/main character. This is what makes this movie stand out just as plenty of other stories do as well. The ability to give the audience/reader a chance to analyze the material and theorize themselves what it is that is being discussed or viewed. It was honestly an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It was reminiscent of Ledger's haunting performance that was truly one of a kind. And so is Joaquin's. It was a psychological masterpiece of not only the development of a character (one of the best like walter white level, and Joker is just a 2 hr movie) but the cinematography that made this mental breakdown come to life. I don't know whats up with the critics, but they definitely got this one wrong.I don't believe this needs a sequel... this is by far the greatest origin story for a mysterious villain arch storyline. And this coming from a Wolverine fan, Logan was great, this was superior... all we need is a Punisher Origin story, in the idea of Platoon. Joker deserves a 9.7.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.","It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

YET ANOTHER TAKE FOR DC...,"Just watched this last night, succumbing to all the incredible press that's been surrounding the film lately, and I have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed.First off, does no one remember THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) and Heath Ledger's legendary turn as Joker? Did we really need yet another take on who Batman's arch nemesis is? Although he was quite amazing in an extreme and dedicated performance, I never really felt like I wasn't watching Joaquin Phoenix do some really good acting, vs. seeing the character of Joker emerge from the tortured individual of Arthur Fleck. Yes, his character changed and grew throughout the film, but it was always Joaquin Phoenix I felt like I was watching. Ledger's immersive performance made me forget the actor entirely, seeing only the insane character of Joker throughout. Personally, I feel like I would've responded better had this movie been something other than an origin story, where Phoenix's portrayal would've been able to expand upon Joker's character (perhaps w/flashbacks to his origin). In this way, the established standard presented by Ledger could have been built upon - and even morphed into further (and greater) complexity - rather than feeing like a different take on the same character. Which gets me to my second point...In my view, one of the main problems with the DC universe that Marvel has overcome is the constant need to reinvent itself, rather than build upon an established world that continues to expand through character and story (yeah, I know they're trying - but it ain't workin'). Although a completely new take, with no ties to the existing DC cinematic universe and no intention of further exploration via sequels, JOKER feels like an attempt at making something remarkable that's kinda sorta part of the DC cinematic universe (no, really it's not), but kinda sorta misses the mark. The entire film has a look-at-how-incredible-and- different-I-am vibe that I just could not shake. And, yes, in some ways JOKER is incredible and different. But it's not currently tied to any other part of the DC cinematic universe, nor is it intended to be. So, as a standalone venture, the film becomes nothing more than a harsh, gritty, depressing throwback to other great films like TAXI DRIVER or THE KING OF COMEDY (which might explain why Robert De Niro finds himself in a throwaway role in this film).Lastly... The depiction and use of excessive and gratuitous violence in this day and age, for me, demonstrates an inability to avoid old and tired tropes in favor of more unnerving approaches to filmmaking that isn't so much ""in your face"" with longer lasting effects. Let's be honest: societally, we're so aware of and numbed by the depiction of gun violence on the screen that it has absolutely no punch anymore for most people. Hence the feeling of gratuitousness it brings when seeing it, once again, depicted in all it's violent glory. Joker is a character who, at a minimum, is a master agent of chaos, and this film almost gets that - but not quite. Instead, the focus goes more toward the flashy extravagance of the violence, which screams so loudly at us from the screen that we only catch a glimpse of the character's deeper motives (and satisfaction at achieving them) by the end of the film.Is JOKER a bad film that should be avoided at all cost? No - far from it. But this viewer honestly does not understand why it's garnered all the incredible buzz it's been receiving of late. JOKER is simply another decent film that could've been so much more than it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's just...not that good.,"Cinematography, costume design and one powerhouse performance do not a good movie make. In truth, Joker is poorly paced with a lackluster story that Frankenstiens together elements from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It borrows so liberally I'm amazed it didn't get hit with a plagiarism lawsuit.Additionally, the movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It's sociological commentary is ham-fisted and bland, and it lacks any truly jaw-dropping moments. Outside of the Talk Show scene and a single shot near the end, it's all very forgettable.And the song for the stair dance sequence was so colossally stupid it completely pulled me out of the film.That being said, Joaquin was great and the aforementioned cinematography and costume design were very solid.

"Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period.","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.
Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed ""Fear City.""This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself ""God's lonely man"" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.
The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Joke's on You,"This film is about mental illness. Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.Seriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.Secondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.With regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.The plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.The two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.With the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!,"Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.

So unsettling - a psychological horror movie,"As a bleeding heart liberal and a person who also suffered from mental illness, I often detest stereotyping and simplified portrayals of both ""the disenfranchised"" and the mentally ill. But, despite the tropes and unrealistic nature of the Joker, this made excellent fiction. I think that if you interpret it though symbolism rather than taking it literally, that is where the message really lies.The thing this film adds to the modern DC universe is a truly empathetic story from a villain's perspective - the Joker. DC seems to be the jaded dark and Marvel the innocent Disney light. Don't get me wrong - I love Disney, but DC really balances it out.Of course you have to mention Phoenix, who won Best Actor for this role. We go from cringing and wanting to run away from this character, to sort of rooting for him by the end. Even though I'm just watching this in 2023, I remember everyone talking about his dance on the steps - so delightful. He's actually a good dancer lol. But, it's really at that point that you appreciate this origin story.There could be a lot to rip apart in this movie. While the elements and feelings ring of true representation, no literal interpretation would hold up. That's why I classify this as horror, which is historically full of metaphors and smoke and mirrors for deeper darker themes. It's why I don't get mad for any innuendo someone that doesn't understand mental illness or oppression might take from this. Because if you're trying to find reality in horror, you aren't getting the point.I think that underneath it, everyone can relate to the cruelty of the world and this darker part of you that wants to see someone pay for the unfairness. It's why we can empathize and laugh at the dance. If you don't get that, you must live a pretty charmed life. It's why we watch horror and love to hate violence.

Joker is what happens when one reads Taxi Driver wrong.,"Travis Bickle is also an anti-hero like Arthur Fleck, so many bad things at once, a product of the times, but his actions are never justified or rendered aspirational either through plot or aesthetics of the film. The same goes for Rupert Pupkin in Scorsese's another masterpiece 'The King of Comedy' from which Todd Philips, the director, heavily borrows but without any proper insight or thought. Class divide, neurological issues, childhood trauma and all that glitter is thrown in the movie to disguise the shallow depth of ideas and adds to the confusion. The film tries to be so many things and ends up being none. 'Poser' would be a better title.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is everything though. Very familiar but still feels fresh and knocks your socks off (and oh that laugh is haunting) and he was the singular reason I didn't walk out of the film after the first 15 minutes because the moment Arthur Fleck commits the third murder (and which obviously was not a self-defense tactic), I thought, ""lo beta, ghus gaye na ghhade me! Yahan se impossible hai nikalna."" And making my worst fears come true, this humorless film just kept on digging that first act grave.So, in short: Loved Joker. Just hated the film he was in.PS: Watch HBO's 'Succession' if you want to take notes on how to have a people as your protagonists, humanize them and still maintain that much-necessary ironic distance from them.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A True Masterpiece,"Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning performance as Arthur Fleck, AKA Joker, in this jaw-dropping masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come. It proves to be more than just a comic book villains backstory. 'Joker' meticulously captures the gradual decline of one man's mental health, and shines light on the subject of mental health in general. There are points where you begin to sympathize with the madman. Despite some of the terrible acts he happily commits, you find yourself rooting for him which leads you to question your own morality. The world has viciously beaten this man down, and this is only the beginning of his retaliation.This is, without a doubt, Phoenix's best performance so far. He carries the entire movie flawlessly, and leaves you with a lot to talk about afterwards. The brilliant method actor ensures that people will feel this characters pain, and does not disappoint for one second. Robert De Diro, another brilliant method actor, gives a fine performance as Aurthor Fleck's favorite comedy talk show host, Murray Franklin. Though he's only in the movie for roughly 10-15 minutes total, he does a very well job at depicting a phony, belligerent, television personality. Brett Cullen also gives a fine performance as the billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, and has a part in Jokers madness.The word 'masterpiece' should never be thrown around lightly. It's a term we use to describe an outstanding, almost perfect, piece of art. There are only so many films that can be considered 'masterpieces'. Rarely do we ever see a flawless movie, especially this day in age. With that being said, it is hard to NOT consider 'Joker' a masterpiece. Every scene is just as important as the next, every actor delivers a wonderful performance, and Todd Phillips does an outstanding job directing the villains transformation. 'Joker' absolutely deserves a 10/10, and nothing short of that. This movie holds a mirror up to society; it should make you question what part society takes in one's slow drift into madness. This is very relevant to today, and is a perfect example of why something like this needs to be addressed and taken seriously. Everyone needs to see this movie. Again, it will be talked about for many years to come, and could very well be considered one of the greatest drama/thrillers of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

So that was...quit the expierience.,"K this was an incredible work of art, not gonna beat around the bush. Jauquin pheonix is giving a career highlight here, it might be even better than his performance in the master but I'll have to think about that. Tod philips and cinematographer Laurence shaper have made a beautifully shot movie, and the shot length really gives pheonix and De Niro room to act. The camera work itself is also very well done, but its not the type off camera work that calls attention to itself like that of Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. The blending of reality and fantasy and reality is also extremely well handled, I'm not gonna give spoilers but I will say that its kind of like American psycho and middle school:the worst years of my life (does anybody's remember that book?). It is important to mention that this movie is not for everyone, it is violent and intense, but that being said its not as violent as other art house movies like drive or hereditary. No, its not really the violence as much as the intensity and the emotion that the film evokes, which is most certainly not a complaint its a great aspect of the film. Cinifix's 10 most emotional movie moments has 2 slots in it that focus on second hand embarrassment or cringe and deep uncofortable-ness and I'd say about 87 percent of the film are squarely in those 2 spaces.

Great,"Great, but could have been even better. It was almost there. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic and definitely deserves his long overdue Oscar nomination. It's one of the more interesting DC films out there. There are a lot of great sequences and moments that define Phoenix's version of the Joker; you can feel the tension and creepiness in almost every scene. The cinematography is fantastic, as is the look of Gotham City. It actually feels more like Gotham than the Nolan movies. The one detriment of the film is that it is Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy almost beat for beat. While it is inspired by the films of Scorsese, it feels like it's just copying it straight out. If it were altered from Taxi Driver, but still kept the same slow burn, it would have been just as great. It is an interesting take on the Joker, but the fascination with his character is the mystery, and having his own film will always feel unnecessary. It does deserve credit though, for being different and trying to do it's own thing. Phoenix's costume and mannerisms are fantastic, and I like its homage to Cesar Romero. While it could use some light editing and a few changes to the ending, the film works for the most part, but it's overall goal seems a little unclear. A lot of people seemed to be unsure of the message of the movie, but it feels more like it's up to your own interpretation. It felt like you have to look at it from a certain point of view. Depending on how you look at it, some stuff will work and some won't. I'm a sucker for gritty crime films, gangster movies, and the Joker himself, so if you're a fan of the character and those types of film, it's for you. It is very unique, great production design, great look to everything, and a noteworthy take on a fun character, especially in its ending. It's worth seeing, and I hope it gets a few Oscars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Murdering the Joker,"This film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.They've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.If you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A violent and colorful D.C. Comics film with Joaquin Phoeneix's magnificent acting,"The story takes place in Gotham City, 1981. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown-for-hire for a company called Ha-Ha's. He lives in a city that is collapsing and in which unemployment, crime and chaos are rampant. Fleck struggles with severe depression personally but finds some form of optimism in performing for others and trying to make people laugh. Arthur is tasked with advertising a store by dancing and waving a sign around. Arthur goes back home to a high-rise apartment project, where he lives with his ailing mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). After dinner, they sit and watch a TV talk show with host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). It is revealed that Penny used to work for Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and is obsessed with the millionaire and has been currently writing to him to try and better their living situation. Along the way, Fleck is chased by two Detectives: Burke (Shea Whigham) and Garrity (Bill Camp). Put on a happy face !.Dark and sinister story is made believable and the script has a clown who becomes Joker. Stars Joaquin Phoenex who's reallly terrific playing the depressing Arthur Fleck, a man who works as a clown with a neurological problem that makes him laugh at inappropriate times. Joaquin Phoenix deservedly won the Oscar and the 2020 Golden Globe for best actor as the star of this intense film, one of the winners of the year, which also won the Golden Globe and Oscar for best original soundtrack to composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. Well directed by Todd Phillips and co-starring Robert De Niro, the film closely follows the life of Arthur Fleck, whose series of adventures will make him become one of the great villains of DC Comics. However, The Joker is not a film of superheroes but a realistic story with social criticism included. A film that, despite being based on a comic book character, won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, an award normally associated with what is commonly known as serious or quality cinema.It contains appropriate and evocative cinematography by cameraman Lawrence Sher, showing a decadent New York-Gotham of the eighties. As well as a thrillling and suspenseful musical score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. The motion picture was competently directed by Todd Phillips . Todd frequently casts famous actors/celebrities for cameo roles as Matt Walsh, Juliette Lewis, Zach Galifianakis, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, among them. Todd is an expert on Coming of age and raunchy comedies, such as: ¬®School for Scoundrels¬®, ¬®Due Date¬®, ¬®War Dogs¬®, ¬®Old School¬®, ¬®Road Trip¬®, ¬®The Hangover I,II, III¬®, Frat House, Starsky and Hutch, Bittersweet Motel¬®, although in ¬®Joker¬® he makes an exception by filming an intensely dramatic and violent film.

Best movie of 2019,"Masterpiece movie of the decade to influence generations.
Joker is a Traumatizing psychological drama/thriller that puts the spotlight on a comic book villian called joker.
Though the movie is inspired by the comic world which is imaginary, the movie feels real and authentic.
Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.
The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.
He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil.
The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.
The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.
The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.

Arthur FleckThat definitely feels true. Joker is set in the early 80s and is loosely based on the origin of the Joker (DC Comic character and arch rival of Batman). This version is written and directed by Todd Phillips (the director of The Hangover films...yep) and stars Joaquin Phoenix in the title role.Almost everyone has their opinion of the film and how they feel about it, so take what you can from them, but, this is what I thought of it.The Joker is a gritty hard hitting study of a man's decline into madness. Arthur Fleck is a lonely troubled man, who between caring for his ill mother and performing for kids as a clown, dreams of being a stand up comedian - his only problem, he isn't very funny.This sounds familiar and fans of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese will recall King of Comedy (1982) and the painful Rupert Pupkin having the same dilemma (incidentally De Niro plays the chat show host Murray Franklin whom Arthur adores). Unfortunately Arthur or 'happy' as his mother calls him is living in a world that just doesn't understand him, again sound familiar? Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver (1976). Clearly these two films have influenced Phillips and he borrows seamlessly from them, but this is not in the same calibre as these, it stands alone.The central performance from Joaquin Phoenix delivers the punchlines (sorry). His lean skeleton holds the meat of the film (sorry again). He is mesmerising, he portrays sadness, depression, anger, loneliness and happiness brilliantly. It's a masterclass on acting, he lives and breathes the character.The supporting cast is good, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy to name, watch out for Glenn Fleshler (Remus from Boardwalk Empire) and Brian Tyree Henry (Paper Boi from Atlanta).The music is standout, Icelandic Hildur Gudnadottir sets the right tone and style to the film (to be noted she did the music for this and Chernobyl at around the same time). There has been some subject of debate for one music choice and I don't why that particular piece of music was used when others could have been selected, perhaps Phillips was wanting the reaction? (jerk). The cinematography is good and adds grittiness to the screen, the makeup is good too, I like how Phoenix has adopted a different clown paint - slightly reminiscent of Doink the Clown from WWE though).The film is rated R so be prepared to see violence, however there are probably less deaths in here than in most of the Marvel films, yep, and when it happens you can feel the magnitude of it.I would still recommend seeing this (unless you have coulrophobia) and making your own mind up on how you feel about it, one thing is for certain you will be talking about it for some time, which is what Phillips probably wanted - 'send in the clowns...they are already here'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Disturbingly brilliant film making,"Read all you like about ""Joker"" - there is nothing that will prepare you for the gut-punch to come.

It is an immersive and cathartic experience, and an enthralling and uncomfortable one for the viewer.If there is a more perfect performance than Joaquin Phoenix commands in this film, I would love to debate it. His depth and range is an acting masterclass and somehow demands empathy in a violent and disturbed character.Todd Phillips stamps himself as a modern master with this film. The look and feel of the film has such pace and menace, yet at the same time creates a claustrophobic atmosphere.It is a brilliant film.

I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.

"Great acting, meh movie","There is no doubt in my mind that Joaquin Phoenix deserves at least an Oscar nod, if not the trophy itself. In an odd way, he reminded me of Sean Penn in that when you watch him, you forget he is an actor, all you see is the character. In reality, the rest of the cast were merely props in this one-man show... even Robert De Niro.There are a lot of Easter Eggs as nods to other films of the late 70s and early 80s, which was cool.As an origin story in the comic book universe, Joker was good, better than most. I do not judge movies based on how closely they follow a book or if they follow the rules of physics, but more if they entertain me and allow me to escape my reality for a few hours. In that sense, Joker left me wanting for more. Yeah, there are political nods that you can read into this, but they weren't forced onto the viewer, more of a backdrop.The randomness of Joker's thinking and thoughts was in a word, distracting. Because the director put me in the lead character's psychosis, I had a hard time sympathizing with any character in the movie, which makes it difficult to connect to the story.Maybe the real genius of the movie was that randomness, seeing the world through the psychotic mind of the Joker. But it didn't make for a hugely entertaining experience for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal.

Joaquin Phoenix steals the show,As expected Joaquin Phoenix has done a fantastic job. Todd Phillips as director delivers a rounded film. The support from Director of photography and the music seals the deal.Story is a bit weak and lacks a punch that's expected from an iconic character as Joker.

Movie of the year,"This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job.

funny like a clown,"Greetings again from the darkness. The first thing to know is that this is not a Superhero movie. In fact, there are no heroes in the movie - unless you would like to apply the label to a single mom who lives down the hall from Arthur Fleck. Mr. Fleck lives at home with his invalid mother in a grungy, run-down apartment. He works as a clown-for-hire, dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian, and depends on social services to supply the 7 medications he takes since being released from Arkham State Hospital. It's a bleak existence at a bleak time in a bleak city. Gotham is in the midst of a garbage workers' strike (only the 'super rats' are happy), political upheaval, and a growing chasm between the classes. And then it gets worse for Arthur.The second thing to know is that this is a standalone Joker film, and one mostly unrelated or not connected to previous projects featuring the colorful Clown Prince character played (and voiced) by such memorable actors as Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Mark Hamill, Jared Leto and even Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver) is best known for such extreme comedies as ""The Hangover"" franchise and OLD SCHOOL, so he's a bit outside of his usual wheelhouse. Phillips and Silver seem to embrace not just the history of the character, but also the look, texture and tone of filmmaking from an earlier era. The gritty and outcast feel of Scorcese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY is present, and so are numerous tributes to familiar Joker moments of days gone by.Three time Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, and he delivers Arthur's slow descent into madness, or shall we say further descent. It's clear from the beginning that Arthur views himself as ignored by society, while all he wants to do is bring joy and laughter to others ... and be noticed. His daydreams or visions of himself in a better world send a strong message. Phoenix shows us what full commitment to a role looks like. He lost 50 pounds, leaving a frame that contorts, moves and dances in a manner unlike what we've seen before. In fact, it's a toss-up on which shows up more frequently, his dances moves or his maniacal, pained laughter. We are informed Arthur suffers from Pseudobulbar Affect, also known as emotional incontinence, which causes that creepy laughter to pop up at some inappropriate times. Of course, the comparisons to Heath Ledger's Oscar winning turn in THE DARK KNIGHT are inevitable. The roles and films are written quite differently, and it's safe to say both actors were all-in.Action sequences and special visual effects are both noticeably absent, but the violence is sure to shock. This is not one for the younger kids, no matter how much they enjoy THE AVENGERS or WONDER WOMAN (or any other DC or Marvel film). This gritty, visceral approach is often a tough watch, and is much more a character study of mental illness than a costume drama ... although Arthur's clothes and make-up are front and center. When Arthur states, ""I have nothing but bad thoughts"", we believe him. And the sympathetic back story explains a great deal, and will likely prove quite controversial.Phoenix dominates the film (as he should), and supporting work is provided by Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a TV talk show host in the Johnny Carson mode; Zazie Beetz (DEADPOOL 2) as the single mom neighbor Sophie Dumond; Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's mother; Brett Cullen as a not so empathetic Thomas Wayne; and Shea Whigham and Bill Camp as police detectives. I'll hesitantly mention that Dante Pereira-Olson makes a couple of brief appearances as an adolescent Bruce Wayne, and just for fun, we get a shot of the young man honing the batpole skills he will use later in life. Just don't expect any ""real"" Batman references.Director Phillips delivers a film that looks and feels and sounds much different than other comic book movies. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher is a frequent Phillips collaborator (all 3 Hangover movies) and the dark look and gritty feel are present in most every shot. Hildur Guonadottir (this year's Emmy winner for ""Chernobyl"") serves up a foreboding score - one that never overwhelms, and one that contrasts perfectly with the more traditional songs utilized throughout: Stephen Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", Jimmy Durante singing ""Smile"", Cream's ""White Room"", ""That's Life"" by Frank Sinatra, and Gary Glitter's familiar ""Rock and Roll Part 1 and 2"". The ""Smile"" song is especially relevant as its origins can be traced by to Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES, a silent movie classic featured in this film. Phillips even uses the Saul Bass designed Warner Bros logo to open the credits, making sure we understand the time period (no cell phones, etc).The film traces Arthur's slide into crime ... a transition that he wasn't seeking, and one that he believes was forced upon him. His rise as a savior to the working class is secondary to his own journey, and the chaos is handled on the perimeters of the film, preventing this from becoming a Super Villain movie. Keep in mind JOKER played at Venice, Telluride and Toronto - three prestigious festivals. This is just another thing that sets it apart from others in the genre. Despite the 1981 time stamp, the consistent anti-rich message and class disparity is prevalent throughout. This appears to be Phillips' way of including a contemporary theme in a decades-old setting. And it's a cautionary tale that there should be no clown left behind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

the most profound human analysis among all Marvel DC movies in recent years,"It's not a super British film at all, but a crime film with ordinary low-level citizens as the main characters, and it's probably the most profound human analysis among all Marvel DC movies in recent years. The film creates an excellent atmosphere for Gotham City, with dark and damp roads, streets littered with garbage, and an atmosphere of imminent riots. Such an environment, combined with a tragic background and a bad day, is enough to force an honest and poor person into an abyss, gradually becoming numb and insane from rational kindness, and every step of transformation is truly credible.

Similarly, we might have wondered why Batman's villains were seen as inherently evil without any explanation.""Joker"" dives into the tragic story of Arthur Fleck, a man battling mental illness and societal neglect. Unlike typical villains, Arthur's descent into the Joker is shown as a result of his suffering and mistreatment, not just an innate desire to do bad things. This film highlights how systemic failures and personal trauma can drive someone to dark actions.By exploring Arthur's painful journey, ""Joker"" encourages us to look beyond simple labels and understand the complex reasons behind someone's behavior. It reminds us that empathy and understanding are essential in addressing the deeper issues that lead to what we perceive as evil.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Let's dive deep!,"I heard a lot of people complaining about the fact that this Joker got nothing to do with Batman's Joker that we all know and love. Well, you're missing many points here!1-This movie is supposed to be a non-canon one, meaning it's more of else world story than it's a continuity.
2-The movie is made to tell the story of how society can drive a man into madness and they nailed it.
3-Up till this very moment, The Joker never had an origin story. In the comics you gonna have the vet accident, the failing comedian, the three jokers, the lazuras pit joker, etc. So why all the madness about a story that suggest a different background and taking a page from the comics as well while they do it resulting in the most believable and humane story ever!

A Provocative Powerhouse,"Joker is a phenomenal symphony of film leading up to a breathtaking crescendo.Joaquin Phoenix absolutely outdoes himself. I didn't see him in ""Her"" or ""The Master"", but knew he was special after ""Gladiator"" and ""Walk The Line"" - and his 2010 year-long performance-art piece ""I'm Still Here"" cemented him as a modern acting great. He was just as spellbinding with this interpretation of the most famous comic book villain of all time. Arguably his best work to date.But an actor can't be great without great material. And what (surprisingly) Todd Phillips has done with Joker is nothing short of genius. Not only has Phillips achieved what so few comedy film-makers do by crossing over into the provocative dramatic genre, he has produced a true masterpiece of movie material.Not for the faint hearted. It is disturbing at times. A result Phillips and his team set out to achieve, citing that violence has become too socially accepted in our media. We shrug it off and accept it as part of our entertainment, but with Joker he has made what violence is: Disturbing. Deeply uncomfortable. Painful. He makes the audience feel. An outcome very few mainstream film-makers achieve these days.The film is aptly titled. It is about absolutely no-one else other than its subject. Every character is simply crafted to present the film's focus: Joker. A deeply injured member of society who succumbs to his pain.Masterful film-making in a world drowning in a sea of meaningless media. Todd Phillips selected the best of the best to paint his picture. The strangely haunting score (which fit perfectly into Phillips' world), the perfectly presented cinematography, the costume and set design, the acting, the editing (sound and film!), all masterfully mixed into one of the pieces of the year.While it's unlikely Joker will walk away with Best Picture, don't be surprised if it gets a nomination. Plus a host of other category noms.It's not for everyone. But for this sociological ponderer, it was almost perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A Haunting and Unforgettable Portrait: ""Joker"" Redefines Comic Book Cinema","Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" is a haunting and audacious exploration of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history. Anchored by a tour de force performance from Joaquin Phoenix, this film transcends the boundaries of the genre, delivering a chilling character study that is as captivating as it is disturbing.Set against the gritty backdrop of Gotham City in the early 1980s, ""Joker"" follows the journey of Arthur Fleck, a troubled and marginalized man struggling to find his place in a society that has abandoned him. Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the character's descent into madness with a raw intensity and vulnerability that is both unsettling and profoundly moving.As Arthur's transformation into the Joker unfolds, Phillips skillfully weaves together elements of psychological thriller and social commentary, exploring themes of mental illness, class disparity, and the consequences of societal neglect. The film is a stark and unflinching reflection of the world we live in, shining a light on the darkness that lurks beneath the surface of society.But what truly sets ""Joker"" apart is its refusal to provide easy answers or moral judgments. Phillips and Phoenix invite audiences to empathize with Arthur even as he descends into violence and chaos, challenging us to confront the uncomfortable truths about the nature of evil and the fragility of the human psyche.Of course, ""Joker"" is also a technical marvel, with stunning cinematography and a haunting score that heighten the film's sense of unease and tension. Every frame is infused with a sense of dread and foreboding, drawing viewers deeper into Arthur's fractured world.While ""Joker"" may not be for everyone, those who are willing to engage with its challenging themes and uncompromising vision will find themselves rewarded with a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. In the end, ""Joker"" is more than just a comic book movie; it's a haunting and unforgettable portrait of one man's descent into madness-a film that demands to be seen and reckoned with.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
All It Takes Is One Bad Day!,"Joker was epic. It's a fantastic character study centred around the most popular comic book villain of all-time but crafts a story that makes this incarnation of the character stand on its own. It's a beautifully crafted piece with stunning cinematography and art direction. I'm a fan of this changed appearance of the Joker. And Todd Phillips does a fantastic job in the director and writer's chair. Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Don't confuse great performance with a great movie,"I rarely write reviews but I felt the need to write one for this movie just to tell everyone that it doesn't even nearly live up to its hype. Yes, the actor's performance is undoubtedly amazing and he deserves an Oscar, but the movie itself was kind of boring. The whole time you know what is going to happen, there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that is unexpected about the plot. It is a movie charged with so much negative energy that you end up leaving the theater being emotionally drained. It has a good message though but so do many other movies as well. The only reason why I gave the movie 7/10 and not 5 or 6 is because the actor truly did a good job.

Joker,"This film goes into the in depth of joker mental health I can't wait for the sequel the way Joaquin phoenix played this character was a master piece. Reportedly lost over 50 pounds which led to a kind of madness that helped him get ready for the role, as did a book breaking down the personality types of political assassins. But Phoenix wanted to create a criminal psychopath who wasn't easy to categorize and he did an outstanding job. I didn't find the movie boring like some people did I got really into the movie and have watched it a few times I highly recommend this movie if you haven't watched it yet it was a brutally dark and brilliant depiction of one man's descent into madness, and director Todd Phillips brings all of the elements together to create one of the bleakest incarnations of the classic character. One thing that really impressed me was the fact that it managed to take a few steps back from the Batman universe without completely breaking connections to it which in my opinion got criticized so much but don't let those reviews sway you from watching this film.

Please!!!!,"This is a very different movie from Endgame, so stop the comparisons. If you must compare it to something, compare it to other movies with Joker in it. Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, that's all fine and good. But do not compare it to something that is a different context. If you must compare to a Marvel product, then how bout Logan...if you must. That's even a stretch. Comparing it to the other just shows how biased you are towards DC and or Marvel. Just give your observation and leave it at that. No comparison needed.

Have people seen the film or just giving the trailer a 10?,"Look, in some aspects the film is a triumph. The way it has been shot is beautiful, the score is excellent, there is a true depression to the film that feels authentic and the performance from Phoenix is flawless.The main problem is that the Joker is supposed to be the archetype of a super villain, causing chaos where ever he goes, charming, intelligent and ultra violent. Phoenix's Joker is as far removed from this depiction as possible; a pathetic loser that only by luck it seems fulfils his destiny. Whilst I really enjoyed the premise of the film - a slow decent in to insanity, it would have been a lot more effective if the character was a little bit more sociopathic and a lot less self loathing.Another thing that really stood out for me was the lack of subtlety in the script, it seems as if the director has no trust the viewers intelligence, numerous times throughout the film you are basically force fed the narrative as if you could not figure it out for yourself.For all its attempts of being a psychological thriller, the Joker unfortunately misses the mark, which makes me just a little bit crazy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Uncomfortably real,"Joker is a 2019 drama film directed by Todd Phillips. It could be said that it tells the origin story of Batman's arch-nemesis, but that doesn't actually matter here. This movie is not about superheroes, neither is it really about a supervillain. It's about a person. That's why it's so good, so deep, and so impactful.Arthur Fleck, the man soon to be known as Joker, has a very sad life. That comes across from every single element that surrounds him: his boring routine, his horribly thin body, his tired eyes, his simple clothes, his decrepit apartment building, his lack of friends, the bluish tone that seems to dominate the scenes. However, the more he becomes the Joker, the more violent his acts become - the more confident he gets. The colors on the scenes become more vibrant, just like the Joker's outfit.Beautifully played by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur earns our sympathy on his first few seconds on screen simply with his expression. The sadness in his eyes as he tries to put up a smile seems immediately relatable to the audience. Throughout the movie, even amidst the chaos of Gotham and the violence of some of the Joker's acts, the film always manages to be extremely sensitive, making us understand (and feel) everything that the main character goes through - for better or for worse to our minds.Joker is also a movie that is constantly getting people to laugh, but not because the situations the character faces are actually funny. We laugh because the movie messes with our emotions. It makes us nervous. It shows us how rough the world is, then it throws jokes around, right when things are tense. It gets us to laugh when we shouldn't.It is fictional, but it is real. The feelings we see on screen are strong enough to have that impact. Which doesn't mean that we sympathize with the main character so much that we should excuse all of his misdoings, only that we understand how he got where he got. His journey, even much after we leave the theater, gives us a lot to think about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It holds up to multiple viewings, Arthur Fleck becoming more twisted every time you see it - creepy as hell.I can't wait for the new Joker movie, if it is anywhere near as good as the first it is going to be one hell of a ride.Well done DC üòÄ",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Murray Franklin Show was a great scene in Joker,"One of the most compelling and controversial scenes in Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" is when Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix) appears on ""The Murray Franklin Show"" and confronts host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro). This scene is a turning point in the film, culminating in a shocking act of violence that cements Arthur's transformation into the Joker.Why It Stands Out:Character Transformation:This scene is pivotal in showcasing Arthur Fleck's complete transformation into the Joker. His monologue reveals the depth of his descent into madness and his rejection of societal norms. The tension builds as Arthur sheds his timid persona and fully embraces his Joker identity.Psychological Depth:The scene delves into Arthur's psyche, exposing his inner turmoil and the grievances that have driven him to the brink. His speech about being ignored and mistreated by society highlights the film's exploration of mental illness and societal neglect, providing a chilling insight into his motivations.Intense Performances:Joaquin Phoenix delivers an intense and riveting performance, capturing the chaotic energy and volatility of the Joker. Robert De Niro's portrayal of Murray Franklin adds to the scene's tension, with his initially dismissive and later alarmed reactions to Arthur's behavior. The dynamic between the two actors is electric and unsettling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Ok, the cinematography is good and production values are high. But apart from this, the plot is boring and the references to Batman's universe feel forced. I watch the movie and only see a mentally unstable and sick man getting worse and worse, with a background of social unrest in the city. Also, the Joker was a cunning and cruel villain, so I don't think it's a good choice to make him start as a failed sad clown, where is the intelligence, the ambition? I don't think the clown is the core of this character, but rather a chosen aesthetic that has certain meaning. In summary, I find a disconnection between the character of the Joker in Batman and this guy that we see turning crazy here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Since creator's Jerry Robinson's 1951 version up to Alan Moore's work for DC Comics in 1988, The Joker character developed in a certain direction that could have been amazing to explore in a more artistic way than previous DC films, instead this movie looks like the last assignment of an art student did before graduating, with enough money to hire DeNiro and Phoenix, but that's far from being such a breakthrough art film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Immersive!,"Seldom do you come across a movie that's so immersive. Joker is about oppression and ridicule of a man by an entire system and unapologetically attempts to be a reflection of the world around us. Joaquin's portrayel as a man with a deeply disturbing childhood days and constantly fighting turbulent weather leads to a build up that almost leads you to diagnose the disturbed mind with a magnifying glass. Unending backstabs and an unstable mind's weight lead a marginalised Arthur, aka joker to creep into the centre stage and become a dark symbol of a chaotic revolution. The sequencing of scenes are buttery, natural and episodes, where his condition makes him laugh in despair and agony magically do the job of passing the pain on to you, and to the person next to you as well. What struck me the most is the sincerity with which a comic character was portrayed without the Shakespearean sentences that often come with a character of this stature. Also, subtle moments like Bruce Wayne and the joker crossing paths are imaginations worth a million colours. Super heroes aside, here is a movie that meticulously digs deep to study the rise of a homegrown devil. As the curtain draws on the joker, he almost makes you want to handshake him and wanting to separate the character from his crimes.

Jokery-Pokery,"It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.Ho hum.* * *So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A messy ok movie.,"The story doesn't work for this character and this character doesn't work for this movie.It's quite insulting the prestige this movie is gaining even though it's so poorly planned out. It wants to milk the ""Joker"" name and fan base to please teenagers and fanboys while trying to do a new Taxi Driver and/or The King of Comedy (straight up copying-pasting so many elements!). And trying to go both ways doesn't work.The excessive amount of overexplaining and overacting is annoying and exhausting. We get it! The guy's crazy! People are mean to him! Joaquin Phoenix lost a lot of weight! None of it serves the story!Overall is an ok movie but a waste of a decent story on a comic book character that doesn't fit in it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Joker is NOT an 8+ film, here's why....","A deep scan of reviews has fans that can understand depression become overwhelmed with empathy. There is a reason for everything, and understanding the context of a nostalgic character like the joker is what works.There was not a faithfulness to the scenes in Batman begins. Police chief introduces him during the outro as someone fairly unknown not a state wide celeb as played out in this film, that break in story continuity ruins it for me.Likewise the reinterpretation of Mr Wayne as something he never was. This takes away from the moral clarity of the pending superhero Batman.The greed narrative feels like its something that was force fed without rhyme or reason. While the joker had a substantial arc, the sub plots did not.Nostalgia is what brings the film to life, there is not many ways to not make money from iconic characters, this film should have been attempted years ago!Over the years Hollywood actors have been applauded for playing villians which is the easiest character study of them all. Whats hard is being protector of the realm without it feeling preachy or cheesy. These roles get a natural upscaling.The main plot element of inviting Arthur onto the talk show was not convincing, the stand up performance was not in the genre of 'so bad its good' his first vision from the audience defending his mother was however powerful and well written.A cameo for Alfred the butler would have been special and really pulled us back into the story.The ways this film was lauded in its first week was ridiculous, it does drag in many places over the 2hr hour screening.All the theatrical trailers were an 8 so many of us expected more. To say this is a better production than Batman Begins is shocking.The difficult reality to bare in this over hyped rating and cultural reality is many people in our age really feel like this and are on the verge of rioting after life takes its toll.The broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes is a great story that can be told a million ways, this was not executed well.The dream sequences worked well but the device was still not as good as Heath Ledgers raw portrayal of a psychopathic megalomaniac and the cinematography of Nolan in related films.Simple plot failures like the police not being able to catch up with Arthur who was not trying to be careful was disappointing and took me right out of the story.A good ensemble of actors can't save a bad script, why was this rushed to production? Something as important as Batman origin stories need much more careful work. I believe over time this score must average out and down.Was this an homage to ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King of Comedy"" apparently not. The opportunity for genuine franchise building was surprisingly tossed away and will be hard to repair.Critics who use the word 'masterpiece' and
'groundbreaking' need to have a long hard look at themselves, their surroundings and the education that they all seem to share. There is F all diversity in this mob who keep playing us.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Joker !!,"One thing that really impressed me was the fact that it managed to take a few steps back from the Batman universe without completely breaking connections to it. I think that's partially where some of the criticisms came from: those connections aren't often strong to completely classify this as an all-out comic book adaptation. The cinematography, costume, sound and set design, world building, narrative, and specially the acting from Joaquin's part are nothing short of masterful, I can think of few movies that can truly top this beautiful, entrancing, dark and hypnotic journey that Arthur Fleck goes through as he spirals into chaotic madness and ironically, for the first time in his life perhaps, happiness, the beauty in chaos as some would say.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It's a good film but it wont leave you in a happy or rewarding mood after.

A Riveting Journey into Madness,"""Phoenix's Captivating Performance Elevates the Film""
""Joker"" stands as a testament to meticulous craftsmanship, with Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck serving as its crowning achievement. Phoenix masterfully embodies the character's evolution from a socially awkward outcast to the infamous Joker, delivering a performance that is both haunting and mesmerizing. His portrayal adds depth and nuance to the character, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.""An Engrossing Tale, Despite Some Shortcomings""
While Phoenix's performance is undeniably stellar, ""Joker"" does have its shortcomings. The film could have delved deeper into Arthur's psyche, offering a more profound exploration of his descent into madness. Additionally, certain aspects of the plot feel contrived, particularly Arthur's role in inciting city-wide riots. Despite these flaws, ""Joker"" remains a captivating and thought-provoking film that offers a unique perspective on the iconic character.""An Unforgettable Cinematic Experience""
In conclusion, ""Joker"" is a riveting journey into the mind of a madman, propelled by Phoenix's electrifying performance. While it may fall short in certain areas, the film still manages to captivate audiences with its compelling narrative and haunting visuals. ""Joker"" serves as a poignant reminder of the power of cinema to explore complex themes and characters, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Wonderful main protagonist development but felt more like a prequel to Batman.,"The cinematography is outstanding and leaves an impression that's hard to erase. The focus on how Joker became himself pays off and makes total sense in the end despite it being detriment to society and, as such, prone to criticism from society as an invalid cause by axiom. So this film had to be made as an antidote to Batman universe backdrop.
His interactions as a person with characters you might meet any day of your life are genuine and without shallow disguise.. which makes the movie so tragic.

Joker just so happens to be glorius yet horrifyingly realistic depiticion of the various ""what ifs"" in our dysfunctional world. Granted, this film is a origin story of one of the most beloved antagonists in cinema and comic book history, however, the film also holds a very vital meaning in its delivery. With the help of a Joaquin Phoenix career defining performance, we are able to see the slow dip into insanity of the average man who'd be the least expected to morph into a monstrous villain by the hand of society, caused by neglection. Todd Phillips is a damn genius, and again proves to us that a comedic mind can also hold the most grim ideas. He most certainly proves this by delivering the fun additives, which would be the clever use of violence that is more artsy than controversial (people exaggerate so much it sickens me), a discomforting atmosphere that leaves you feeling the anxiety you never knew you could feel; like watching Taxi Driver times 5, and an ending that you never knew a third act could pull off so masterfully, it becomes more unforgettable than one could imagine. Joker has easily, and most effortlessly, claimed the throne of Movie of the Year.Verdict: Joker is the masterpiece we all knew it would be.

The genius of a mentally unstable character in a world that could happen tomorrowü§°,"The strength of Joker's (2019) film is still, above all, Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The character is emotionally charged and disturbingly authentic. Phoenix's body language, voice and facial expressions take us deep into the mysterious and painful world of Arthur Fleck. Phoenix so immersed himself in the character that this is reflected in interviews years after the film was made. Let's hope that only in his mind is the character still in action. When it comes to why it's simply brilliant the answer lies in the fact that most of the film is based on a worldview through the eyes of a maniac. He does evil and is evil but doesn't realise it himself. But aren't there people like that around us in everyday life?In a sense, the Joker is right. Who is competent enough to say what a comedy is. If we ourselves laugh at something inappropriate on a daily basis then we too can feel the mockery of others. However, why do these people have the right to say what and how things should be.In the film directed by Todd Phillips, the story was also very thought provoking. When you look at the madness that a member of a downward spiralling society, who no one cares about, has to deal with, you start to think to yourself, what are my behaviours when I see a 'different' person. You never know what problems a stranger has to deal with both mentally and physically.The Joker is also a visually striking film. Gotham City is portrayed in a dark and decadent tone that has a chilling effect. The film's cinematography, set design and costumes create a tense atmosphere that fully engages the viewer.However, this is the film's biggest problem. It is too focused on one character and the acting of the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired.

As far as how it compares to Ledger's performance, it does, and it doesn't. It does because both will be talked about for years and will be considered some of the best performances in cinematic history that transcend any comic book movie portrayal by a long shot. Neither actor dialed in their performance; they each put the time and effort into making a unique interpretation of the character, which leads to the part where I mentioned that they don't compare because each version of the character are polar opposites of one another as far as their motives. Ledger's version was an agent of chaos; there was no reasoning behind his actions, he didn't have a clear backstory (it was multiple choice); he was just a guy that wanted to watch the world burn, and he portrayed that to perfection. Meanwhile, Phoenix's version, suffered from a mental illness all while being treated unfairly in life. We're taken through a series of tragic events through Arthur's perspective, that eventually push him over the edge and lead he to become the ""Clown Prince of Crime""; that was portrayed to perfection as well. Side Note: Robert De Niro was great too; even with the limited amount of screen time he had, he nailed the talk show host persona.The film itself is a SLOW burn. It's more of a character driven film that takes it's time to show you everything that happens in the titular characters life, which leads up to a BRUTAL finale. It's because of amount of breathing room this film has, it won't be for everyone; if you're expecting the usual, run-of-the-mill comic book film with tons of fighting scene, guns and explosions, you'll walk out severely disappointed. This is more of a drama/character study that lets you into Arthur's mind but once the chaos starts...OH BOY!!!!.The movie was shot really well; Todd Phillips made some great choices in this film from a direction standpoint; the lighting, certain scene transitions, zoom in/out shots were all terrific. I wouldn't mind seeing Phillips tackle more films like this one. Overall, Phoenix's performance alone was worth the price of admission; he was THAT good; however, as I stated earlier, the film takes a long time to develop, which I usually don't mind because I'm a very patient movie watcher, but if there comes a time where I'm thinking: ""that's been established, we can move on"" that's when I know they're taking a little too long and unfortunately, I had that thought a few times throughout. The good thing is the ending is really good and really established how Gotham became the chaotic, crime-ridden city we all are accustomed to and it shows why Batman is needed...",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Dark, Moving & Beautiful","Before I start this review, I just want to say that I am not very well versed in comic book law or canon, so I will not be reviewing the accuracy of the Jokers origin story in relation to the comics. Now on with the review...This film is sensational! Everything about this film is brilliant, I can hardly find any fault in it! Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent and is deserving of an Oscar nomination in the very least, and from what I've seen of films this year he should probably win the Oscar at this moment, he is mesmeric every time he is on screen, which is the majority of this film, you cant take your eyes off him. Obviously his performance is going to get compared to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker and that for me is not unwarranted, I'm not saying it's as good as one of the best performances ever in cinema, but the fact you are able to draw a comparison between the two tells how good Joaquin Phoenix is. The way the character is portrayed and written is very powerful, it's written in such a way that in the beginning you feel sympathy for this character and you almost side with him, meaning when it comes to the end of the film you almost feel personally responsible for the monster he's become.This movie is very dark and goes to some extremely dark places and really makes you think about our world and our society and for a comic book movie to do that is something special and very refreshing. On to the only fault I could find with this movie and its not even a fault about the film, and that is I cannot believe this film is a 15, for me watching this film the use of violence is very powerful very gory and frequent enough in my eyes to warrant an 18 rating, and that's not to say if your 15 you're not mature enough to watch it, I'm purely comparing it to other 18 rated films and in my eyes it should be an 18.The score, soundtrack, and cinematography on display in this film is masterful, some of the shots you see are works of art and there's a sequence towards the end of the film that tracks the titular character through Gotham which is particularly beautiful. The score is fantastic, and it does something similar to Into the Spider-verse, whereby it uses the same score throughout, but the score slowly swells and swells to a crescendo at the end of the film which really puts you back into your seat. The soundtrack accompanies the score and the film beautifully and changes with the character's descent into madness.All in all, believe the hype for this film, you will not be disappointed it truly is a masterpiece and an exceptional piece of film making, which will surely stand the test of time, go and watch this film as soon as you can!10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

10 months agoHad to watch this movie a second time before I wanted to put up a review. And as I thought, I enjoyed the movie a second time more than the first. We all know this, but it's a very artistic film, and such a fresh take on the iconic clown prince of crime that we all know and love. This movie is probably the most realistic comic book film I have seen to this day, which was an instant plus point in my eyes.

Low-brow message carried by a high-brow performance: Phoenix proves he's one of the greats.,"The people have hoisted this movie high onto a pedestal - and those that haven't have grabbed their pitchforks. This film has arrived during a bewildering time in our country and the world at large, a time when shootings feel more prevalent than ever and months-long protests in Hong Kong have gained international recognition. Given the context, and the importance of the pivotal movement occurring in the new Joker movie's Gotham, some have claimed the film promotes not just protest, but violent protest. I think that's blasphemy. Sometimes, a movie is just a movie. Controversy has been a staple of some dynamic proportion of new films since the dawn of moving pictures, and that doesn't always mean the message is supposed to invoke violence from the masses. Keeping this in mind - and thus watching Todd Phillip's ""Joker"" as entertainment and not an invitation to anarchy - I can say honestly that it was an absolute blast.Nobody is surprised that Joaquin Phoenix was up for taking on the role. He's a phenomenal actor with an impressive range; just watch him play Freddie Quell in 2012's ""The Master"" and then Theodore in 2013's ""Her"" and try to deny his scope of talent. What is surprising is just how enrapturing and satisfying his performance as Arthur Fleck turned out to be. Whatever misgivings you may have about the eruption of violence that occurs around his version of the Joker, Phoenix absolutely elevates this movie, and is impossible (almost to a fault, but not quite) to look away from him. He plays a broken man with a damaged past, and is so completely engrossing, so stunningly bleak, that it makes the film worth watching, and then watching again. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that his arc is a triumph to behold, and I was clinging to every devilish smile, shocking moment, and chilling laugh that flashed across the screen. He's not trying to kick off an uprising for political gain; he just wants to share his bafflement of society's awfulness with the rest of the world.Okay, so the performance was master-class, but was the film a masterpiece? Not in my opinion; the theme of rising discontent with the rich and/or powerful is an old one, and it's beaten with a ham fist at times here. But damn if it isn't difficult to admit that given how gripping and show-stopping the titular character turned out to be. And though he's the best part of the movie by a long-shot, he's not the only great thing that ""Joker"" has going for it. The film is interwoven with a harrowing score written by the same composer that worked on ""Arrival"", ""Sicario"" and ""Chernobyl"", and the music manages to pierce the air at all the right moments, heightening the intensity where it is appropriate and pinning suspense for as long as we can stand it. I have no complaints about the rest of the cast because they are all great (and would you guess this is Robert De Niro's highest grossing opening ever?). The movie is indeed dark, at times nihilistic and very often just bleak, but Phoenix screams ""NUTS to that"" and revels in the blackness as his tragedy-turned-comedy character transforms into a cackling murderer.The critics have complaints: That Joaquin Phoenix was trying too hard, and that the themes were overt and annoyingly crass. I'd like to point out that acting your heart out isn't always trying too hard, and trying too hard doesn't always make you a great actor anyways. While his performance certainly does not feel effortless, I never once rolled my eyes - I was captivated. As for the heavy-handed ""message"", I say please - this is still a comic book movie. I'm not sure what you expected.7.5/10 for the best performance of 2019 in a Cedar Point thrill of a film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of a kind,"Joker is that movie that leaves you breathless. You can't take your eyes from the screen, don't wanna miss any scene and when it's finished you are both thrilled of what you have seen and kind of depressed of all those people around the world who are ""not being seen"". Never forget his laughter that makes you wanna cry. Piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Relentlessly Lurid Spectacle,"Reviewing ""Joker"" in ""The New Yorker,"" the great film critic Anthony Lane called it a ""lurid spectacle"" and a ""miserablist manifesto."" Other IMDB user reviews give away the plot, so I won't recap it, and the film FAQ in this database provides an exceptionally lengthy explanation for all the bewildering plot twists and possible motivations for Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing portrayal of a psychopathic killer with so many mental disorders it is impossible to name them all. Watching this film is like being subjected to a two-hour nightmare--not of anything in the viewer's brain or for that matter in the mind of the main character--unless it's a reminder to take your meds. No, it's all about the writer/director's attempt to cash in on our national cynicism. Although the movie pretends to be on the side of the poor, the abused, and the downtrodden, it also suggests that the evil media, the complacent rich, law enforcement, social workers, and just about every sane person in ""Gotham"" (read New York City) is part of an evil cabal that has taken control of the world. Just in case serial killer John Wayne Gacy didn't sound the death knell for professional clowns, this movie tries its best to do so. Other good films have been made about the insane taking over the asylum but never with this much cold calculated cash in mind and so little insight into insanity itself.""I happen to dislike the film as heartily as anything I've seen in the past decade,"" Anthony Lane said in his September 2019""New Yorker"" review, ""but I realize, equally, that to vent any inordinate wrath toward it is to fall straight into its trap, for outrage merely proves that our attention has been snagged. Just ask the President of the United States.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I feel sorry for Jared Leto,"I waited for a long time to see this movie.I wanted for hype to die off and to see if the movie will endure the test of time. Well, pandemic was as good excuse as any for us to binge watch the movies in safety of our homes but I still didn't want to see it.Until tonight.Here's the thing - I've seen Jack Nicholson's Jack Napier tonight. I've seen Heath Ledger's Joker tonight. But I've only seen one movie and one actor. Joaquin Phoenix was BRILLIANT in the role of Joker, encompassing all the best from his predecessors and adding a twist or two of his own. Masterful performance that will be hard to surpass.And as I said, I feel sorry for Jared Leto if he ever had to play Joker again. After Joaquin Phoenix' performance in this movie, Leto would be doing a career suicide to repeat his performance (and look) as a Joker from the first Suicide Squad movie.On a final note, pure 10/10 for the director.

Joker,"What kind of Joker is this? The kind that cries on the inside.This is a Gotham Horror. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has gone through Martin Scorsese's filmography ranging from Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Bringing Out the Dead to Shutter Island. Robert De Niro appears as a chat show host just to drive home the Scorsese connections.The Joker delivers a bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. He is one of life's losers. Unable to hold down a job as a clown and on seven different kinds of medications but he is still a manic depressive.Set in the early 1980s, Gotham City is in the sewers and there are sightings of giant rats. Social services funding cuts means that Fleck is on his own. The social worker who does not even listen to him is not going to be there for him any more.Like Travis Bickle, Fleck snaps and is then reborn as the Joker. The Joker is not political but this nihilistic slow burn drama takes aim at wealthy Democrat and Republican politicians alike.Thomas Wayne might not be painted as a Trump, but he is a rich tycoon who thinks the 'have nots' are clowns. Watch out for the scene when the moguls dressed in tuxedos are watching a screening of Chaplin's Modern Times. A movie that commented on the desperate conditions many people faced during the 1930s Depression.Joker is a bold comic strip adaptation but it is a low wattage film with no plot.

Horrible job of portraying the character,"If it wasn't for the title and make-up, you wouldn't know it was based on the comic-book character.

Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal.

Of course Phillips landed some blockbusters with Hangover, but he can also direct a serious movie, which really builds empathy with the characters. Despite the excellent possibilities of interpretation of the Joker, the music amazed me.
