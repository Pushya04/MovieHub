I will have trouble sleeping tonight....,"Of all the genre's that Hollywood has to offer, the most tattered of the bunch is without a doubt the horror department. I am so sick of these wannabe 'so called' horror flicks that belong on late night lifetime channel. Im sick of the same old parlor tricks and scare tactics that have been used for the past 10 years. And i am even more sickened by the fact that they keep making the same crap year after year. You would figure after great horror flicks like ""The Decent"" and ""Paranormal Activity"", studios would start realizing what actually works and what audiences want to see. Hopefully in the coming years, this genre' will come back to life.When it comes to horror movies, i think the two most crucial elements are the cinematography, and the musical score. Actually, i prefer there to be no music at all. Almost all the great horror movies never use it, because they rely on scaring the audience with disturbing images, not raised music that makes everyone jump. If i want that, I'll go to a haunted house. When i go to see a horror flick, i want it to leave a lasting impression. However, movies like this are the one exception.This film had such amazing cinematography, that i didn't even care about those 'raised music' sequences. I rarely get creeped out at the theater, and this movie scared the crap out of me. I'm talking' sweaty palms, eyes wide open, my body sunk all the way down in my chair scared. And for those of you who have read my reviews in the past, i hardly ever say that about a horror flick. And what really sold it was the cinematography. This film is packed with tons of really creepy and disturbing images. So much in fact, that you will hate walking into your dark house alone. Yes, they do use the same scare tactics, but since everything in the movie looked so damn creepy and demented, i for once didn't want the lead female to hurry up and open the basement door and get it over with.The storyline is pretty decent. It's not an amazing concept or genuinely creepy on it's own. But it does a decent enough of a job to keep your interest and sell what your seeing unfold on screen. And it's safe to say that this is a very different take on your typical haunted house.Bottom Line......holy crap, i just realized that this movie is only PG-13. Is it possible for a movie to be scary as hell and only be rated PG-13? The answer is yes, and this is a prime example of that. You know when a horror movie has done it's job? It's when it scares you both in the theater, and hours later when you try to sleep at night. Tonight, i will have lots of trouble sleeping. I can easily say that this will probably be the best horror movie of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly Good and Intense,"The film Insidious has done something many horror movies have failed to do recently, and that is to be scary.Insidious has a lot of really intense moments that scare, and then grab hold of you. Its not entirely made up of ""make you jump"" scenes, which it does have, but scenes with genuine horror.Insidious has taken a risk with doing something original, and It works here for them. Without giving anything away the movie does not just talk about whats scary, or show the the aftermath of something going on in a room that you can only hear until its over and the door magically unlocks. Insidious shows you whats scary, and quite often reminds you whats there, and waiting in the dark.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So scary....,"When I first saw a preview for this movie, I knew it looked like it had potential. It had been a while since I saw a decent scary movie so I was looking forward to it. I went into it expecting some scares but nothing too bad. Wrong. This movie scared me out of my wits. I don't think I have ever jumped more during any other scary movie. The audience was spooked too. I saw many other people jumping out of their seats and even heard a few actual screams.What I loved about this movie was that it actually tries to scare you, not gross you out. The images are frightening for sure. Insidious doesn't waste any time trying to creep you out. The scares already start with the opening credits. I sure was not expecting this to be one of the scariest movies i've seen but it lives up to that. That being said, I don't think I'd have the guts to see it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Crazy how Insidious came out 13 years ago,I've seen some of this one awhile ago I don't remember much just figured I'd get caught up before the Insidious:Red Door comes out. I appreciate a lot of James Wan projects and Leigh Whannel is phenomenal! Patrick Wilson has also been great for last couple decades he works well with Rose Byrne. The flow and terror is much better than I could've imagined I'd agree with someone else better than Paranormal Activity. I'm surprised more don't appreciate James Wan he's great at his craft since Saw he's had some great movies and some that weren't as good I'd defiantly recommend this! The terror hit the spot especially with the tip toe song that's brilliant.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worth your time,"Insidious is totally in my list of favourite horror movie. I will not say that this will be the greatest horror movie ever but the cinematography is great and makes the whole mundane plot seems interesting and manage to crap the hell out of me.I hate it when some so-called horror movies use old cheap tricks like the creepy music or sound effects to compensate their poor performance. I watched many scary movies and Insidious is the one that really made it sound and seems so real that it allows audience relate to it. I was expecting to see some people died in horrible way where their guts and bloods are everywhere and floor splashed with red tomato juices. You'll never have to see that kind of scene in here, they keep it as close as possible for you to relate in your real life and in your room while you are struggling to sleep.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest Movie I've Seen In Years!!!,"I went into this movie confident that it would be a cheesy, campy romp with the same ""tried and true tricks of the trade,"" like when the hero is investigating the creepy music coming from the basement and a cat jumps into frame, but I quickly discovered that this would not be case with Insidious. After watching the move and obsessing on it for about 12 hours now, I can honestly say it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. In fact, there were several points during the film where I screamed like a 13-year old girl at a Justin Beiber concert. Keep in mind I was consciously trying my hardest to keep my composure, mainly because I was sitting beside my new girlfriend of 2 months. She, incidentally, didn't make a peep; thankfully, I later found out she had her eyes closed the whole time.I was also expecting to see some blood and guts, especially coming from the guys who made Saw, but there wasn't a drop. Instead, they used just about everything else in their arsenal to scare the bejesus out of me and everyone else in the theater (my girlfriend included). From literally the opening credits, they created an intense, haunting tension that didn't leave my body till several whiskeys and half a Xanax later. And the movie constantly feeds that tension, making even the characters' mundane family life somehow seem utterly terrifying. I was actually exhausted leaving the theater from all of the uncomfortable squirming I was unable to control. I'd say it's the most calories I've ever burned while watching a movie (well, at least a PG-13 movie).Overall, the movie was great. It was crazy scary, thoroughly entertaining, and even surprisingly funny at times. Having said that, it will be quite some time before I watch another horror movie; I have no desire to be turned into a frazzled bundle of nerves again anytime soon. So, if you plan on seeing this movie, please consider this a cautionary reminder: it's probably best to go with someone who's already witnessed you have a complete physical and mental breakdown, so as to avoid an embarrassing drive home. And maybe bring a Xanax as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An entertaining horror film - doesn't reinvent the wheel, but does enough to keep you interested (and scared)","Insidious is the third film in my (reverse order) mini-marathon of James Wan horrors after Malignant (which I loved) and The Conjuring (which I hated). It starts off as basically the same film as the latter: Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh (Patrick Wilson) are a young couple with small children that has recently moved into a new home, when one morning, their oldest son Dalton doesn't seem to wake up. Turns out he's in a ""sort-of coma"" (it's unlike anything the doctors have ever seen!). When other weird stuff starts to happen around the house (old-timey children running around, things moving around on their own, banging on doors at night etc.), Renai starts to become convinced that their new home is being haunted by malevolent presences. And unlike your average horror movie protagonists, the family doesn't ignore the obvious signs and actually moves houses. But when the problems don't stop after they have moved, they call in the help of two young ghostbusters and, later on, a psychic called Elise. Stop me if you've heard this before.But this is where Insidious starts to diverge from The Conjuring (I know it was released before that film, but I watched them in reverse order). My biggest problem with The Conjuring was that it uses the ""based on a true story"" angle to legitimize its horrors. It tries very hard to claim its paranormal phenomena as being of this world, by using a ""real life case"" of ""real life paranormal investigators"" Ed and Lorraine Warren. And the more deadly serious it got in its treatment of the paranormal, the more ridiculous (and less scary) I found the whole thing to be. Insidious, on the other hand, makes no attempt to claim its supernatural presences as part of our world. An explanation for the strange occurrences that have been happening to the Lambert family is offered by Elise, in which esoteric phenomena like astral projection and out-of-body experiences are mentioned as well as another dimension occupied by spirits and demons (""The Further""). It's a very exposition-heavy few minutes and of course it's all silly nonsense, but at least it's original and fun and it firmly sets the film in its own fictional universe where we gladly suspend our disbelief and accept that anything can happen.A detail that I liked is that we don't have to go through the tedious business of the protagonists doubting each other or the imminent danger itself. When Renai tells her husband that she can feel the evil presences in their new home, Josh is initially skeptic, but just a few minutes later (after a particularly eventful night) the family are seen moving houses. Again when Elise explains her theory about Dalton being trapped in the Further: Josh's (very normal) first reaction is to call her out for being dangerous and exploitative (as one would), but after being confronted with a piece of evidence (one of his son's drawings that is a bit too specific to ignore) he is quickly persuaded.Ultimately, Insidious' main goal is to scare the bejesus out of you and it absolutely achieves that. From the opening credits scene (which I really liked) the filmmakers do a good job of establishing a creeping sense of dread that slowly gets under your skin, balanced with some more classical jump scares. While I rolled my eyes at the abundance of clichés in The Conjuring, even these more ""traditional"" scares in Insidious just worked for me. Then there's the intense finale, which may run just a bit too long, but is extremely unnerving anyway. The whole set piece inside the Further is a beautifully realized nightmare, with some seriously creepy imagery that gives this dark realm an appropriately surreal feel.In summary, Insidious is an entertaining horror film by James Wan that doesn't reinvent the genre, but offers an original twist on the classic haunted house story. It does a good job of building its own world, while maintaining a tense atmosphere throughout and sporadically making you jump out of your seat. The film thankfully avoids annoying horror movie clichés to extend its plot, like the protagonists who are oblivious to the dangers around them. Finally, there's a satisfying (if slightly overlong) climax, in which some indelible images are exhibited that'll be burned into my retinas for some time to come. Overall, I'd still rate Malignant higher: that film just went completely balls to the wall, which made it ridiculously enjoyable to me. And although this film certainly doesn't look bad, the cinematography of the former was even better in my opinion. But I definitely liked Insidious a whole lot better than The Conjuring, which was completely unoriginal, took itself way too seriously and didn't manage to entertain or scare me at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Starts well, but soon turns into a pantomime","INSIDIOUS is yet another one of those Hollywood ghost stories involving a possessed child. It follows a predictable format, with minor, isolated incidents gradually giving way to larger-scale, more pronounced apparitions and events before culminating in a full-scale onslaught of evil. And it's all rather silly.I enjoyed the first half of the movie. It's here where things are kept subtle and straightforward, with effectively creepy scare scenes and half-glimpsed figures spotted lurking in darkened rooms. So far, so good. But around the halfway mark, the film introduces a trio of paranormal investigators and things quickly descent into POLTERGEIST-style farce.The problem with depictions of a hellish limbo or netherworld is that, in order to make something scary, you have to pretty much identify with the different fears of each viewer. Sorry, but I don't find tussles with greasy-looking hobos and Darth Maul from THE PHANTOM MENACE to be particularly frightening; in fact, there's something pantomime about the whole thing.The actors, including the dependable Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, do their best but at times in the latter stages they seem to struggle to keep a straight face while the ludicrous events increase in scale and speed. It's a shame that the whole thing goes to pot, because if it had been handled more sensitively (and with less sensationalism) by the team behind the SAW franchise then it could well have worked much better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Scary Movies I've Seen In A While,"I went to an early screening of the movie last night and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I felt like a little child watching The Exorcist for the first time. James Wan did a very impressive for only an $800,000 budget for this movie. If you're going in the theatre expecting to see the typical, run of the mill, haunted house flick you will be sadly mistaken and surprisingly pleased at the same time.The parts that I liked most about the film is the detailing. Everything in the movie means something no matter how small and I love that when the suspense builds up for the audience to be scared, you won't be disappointed to find its just the dog or the tree brushing against the window....it will definitely be something to be scared of. The people sitting beside me kept laughing at me because whenever the suspense would build I would say to myself ""uh uh....uh uh"".But enough of my rambling, the plot was definitely original and James Wan and Leigh Schanell definitely succeeded in bringing the audience something scary, suspenseful, funny, emotional, and frightening all at the same time. The score is amazing. The use of all sound design was great specially since they weren't any fake screams. LOL. The best acting performance, hands down, was Lin Shaye. She did an amazing job with her role. I can't say anymore without spoiling the movie. All I can say is, if you LOVE a good scary movie then you must see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Better than ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Saw"" combined","*** out of (****)Judging by the anticlimactic advertisements you'd think, just why? There's an evil child film almost every year, and what separates one from the rest? You have every right to think so, but not with ""Insidious"". Trust me when I say it. ""Insidious"" is an entirely different beast. One that actually resonates with scares and intrigue. One that relies on character development, and a script to hold it together. This isn't a one trick pony, it's a well made film with some solid production values thrown in as a bonus. If you don't have a film to see this weekend, make sure you make it this one.""Insidious"" revolves around the perfect couple. Beautiful kids. A new home. It's all smooth sailing until Dalton is in a supposed ""coma"", but the actual reality is that he's haunted. What will Dalton's family do to stop this entity?First of all, many complain that the second act bogs down the film and is inferior to its first half. I wholeheartedly disagree. I think as a whole the film is just fine. Yes, there's a drastic tonal shift mid-way, but that doesn't detract from the experience. The first half plays a typical haunted house flick, except it's actually scary, and the suspense is well built. Then the second half is like a cross between ""Poltergeist"", ""House of Wax"", and a little of ""Beetlejuice"" sprinkled in for good measure.Furthermore, the performances while nothing to write home about, are pretty decent to say the least. The two leading protagonists do their job and Dalton is pretty solid given what he had to work with. Moreover, the script is very inventive, and has multiple twists and turns. Yes, this isn't the most unique screenplay, but it still stands on its own, and is actually quite effective.To top it off, the production is just very beautiful. This movie is very easy on the eyes when it comes to cinematography and location. Now the question everyone is dying to hear. Is it scary? I'd say yes, but don't get too carried away. If you walk in thinking your going to have nightmares, or if you're going to see Rosie O' Donnell, chances are you'll be a little disappointed. However, if you're going in expecting a creepy thriller that just happens to have a few intense moments, you'll be in for a fun night out. Also, I love the nostalgic factor this movie has. It feels as though it was made in the 80's. Old school horror strikes back!With a restraint heavy PG-13 rating, and a middle-of-the-road concept, ""Insidious"" isn't looking too pretty. However, looks can be deceiving. This is one movie that doesn't mess around, and doesn't play it safe either. I can easily say I will be revisiting this film from time to time just because it's so fun. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll be entertained. This is what a fun night out should be like. Get your large popcorn and soda, and sit along with the crowd. Be prepared for a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Although familiar and overdone, the talent behind ""Insidious"" makes for a quality film","Haunted houses and questionable children have composed many a horror film, but there's a reason they work. When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. ""Saw"" director James Wan found something of promise in ""Saw"" writer Leigh Whannell's story ""Insidious"" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, ""Insidious"" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.Like ""Paranormal Activity"" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — ""Insidious"" does it old school.Once Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.The best way to describe ""Insidious"" is first half ""Paranormal Activity"" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell,"" which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The ""X"" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.In general, ""Insidious"" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although ""Insidious"" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary but bogs down at the end,"Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) are happily married and have three kids. Then, after moving into a new house, one of their kids Dalton (Ty Simkins) falls into a coma...for no reason at all. They take care of him at home but then scary things happen. Rose starts hearing noises and seeing strange people around the house. They figure the house is haunted and has affected their son. They move to a new house and quickly realize it's NOT the house that is haunted.Pretty good evil spirit story. I avoided this like the plague when it came out because of the PG-13 rating. ALL the PG-13 horror films I've seen (except for ""The Ring"") have been boring and stupid. This was praised by critics so I decided to give it a try on DVD. It was much better than other PG-13 horror films. It IS well made and acted and there were some very scary moments...but it's far from perfect. For one thing after it's established the couple has three kids the other two seem to disappear completely when they move to a new house. Also it has those incredibly annoying jump scare moments. What's even MORE annoying is the writer and director said they tried to avoid using them! There's also at least three fairly long sequences with people wandering around in dark houses and places...and these scenes are deadly boring and bring the movie to a screeching halt. And I HATED the terrible ""it's not over"" ending. Still it did scare me and the acting is good across the board especially by Lin Shaye. It's also nice to see Barbara Hershey in a small role. So--I give it a marginal recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Borrows a lot from other films, yet stands out on its own..enjoyable Horror movie","Just came back from watching an advanced screening of "" Insidious "" tonight with my wife, we both liked it a lot. When it comes to Horror films, there are always the same Horror formulas which film makers really can't escape when making a Horror, because there aren't much they can work with and they are limited to that same formula. So Insidous borrows many of its ideas from other Horror films, one comes to mind is 1982 film "" Poltergeist "", but here we have a family of 5, Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the parents of 2 boys and a little baby girl. after a slow build up, a small accident occur and their older son falls into comma or so it seems !! soon after, weird things start to happen at the house and the mother suspects evil spirits are in the house !!A simple story that as i said was done before, however, I thought it was done differently here, there was a better atmosphere and some elements of the plot stood out as being fresh that made this film unique somehow. As scares goes, this was definitely scary, there were several moments in the film that gave me goosebumps !! there were also the classic jump out of your seat moments too. Some scenes were creepy and the mixing of music and sounds were done superbly to add to the Horror. so the movie does deliver as far as scares are concerned.Acting was superb too, all cast involved did a very good job, particularly Rose Byrne whom I'm fond of after watching her in the excellent TV show "" Damages "". Patrick Wilson was also good here.the atmosphere was creepy, the director managed to catch nice footage of the house and other elements of the film.So in summary, get ready and grab your loved ones and go catch this movie this Friday, it entertains. very enjoyable and scary, and even though it borrows ideas from other Horror films, it never imitates, it stand out as a new and fresh take on traditional Horror !!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Horror Movie for the Ages,"While not a perfect horror flick, Insidious is certainly one of the best of its kind in many a year. Not since Drag Me to Hell have I enjoyed myself so much watching a scare flick. While the formula is a redux of many a ghost story and heavily reminiscent of Poltergeist, the movie still feels fresh and original.The scares in both the cheap and unique variety and it is all in good fun. Gore is definitely underplayed and the visuals and atmosphere are what yank you in and nail your eyes to the screen.Hopefully, the team holds this high standard in what is sure to be a new franchise from the Saw crew (overdone as those movies have become). They certainly have me locked in for Insidious II.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Creepy, jumpy and funny","I saw the screening of this movie Weds, March 23, 2011 and...not bad. Three things to know.1. The acting is good, but the music was great. Very corny, orchestrated string music and loud. 2. The story was actually easy to follow, and not predictable till the very end. I don't think anybody in the theater knew how the ending would be till the very last five minutes of the film. 3. As for being scary, it's more creepy than scary, also jumpy because of the music. Creepy as in ""little children creepy"" with those little giggles and laughs they have.Give the movie time because it takes a while for the movie to get going, but that's what makes this movie good. A creepy person doesn't just come up and scare you right away cause that's just weird. A creepy person sends you messages of I'm there, but you can't see me. Like someone hiding in a bush, and you see them for a split second and you look back and they aren't there anymore. If you are frighten or startled easily, then this is the movie for you. But if you aren't scared easily, then you'll just find this movie really creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""It's not the house that is haunted""","I was pleasantly surprised by the direction of this film. It differed slightly from what I was expecting when watching the trailer. I was thinking along the lines of an entity possessing the young boy, and it would go down an exorcism path. While there was a fleeting moment of this in the film, it was connected to a much bigger story.Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye are the ones to watch, but what caught my eye was the M rating, as I had read so many gleaming reviews about how well the film was executed with plenty of genuine horror moments.Unfortunately, it didn't quite reach the level of hype I hoped it would. It was different from what you normally expect from a standard possession film, which made it pleasingly fresh, and I enjoyed the philosophy of the astral projection concept.The film is well-paced which gives you honest jump scares. There are only brief moments to calm down before the next paranormal occurrence keeping you keenly focused on the story, and regularly on edge.For the first two-thirds of the film, the Lambert family moves out of their current residence thinking that paranormal hauntings are linked to their new home. Unfortunately, they soon realize that it is their son who is haunted and who takes an entity with him.James Wan does a brilliant job of creating an entertaining story and branches it into three different concepts. Haunting, Possession, and Astral Projection without the need of resorting to cheap scares, heavy violence, or a high body count.Some moments in the film feel new and are greatly executed such as the gas mask in the seance scene. Another moment is the smiling family scene which feels like memories, and the souls of real people are trapped in another time.The red-faced man could have been the next Horror icon with its slick movements and Freddy Krueger-like claws, the real let down here is when the creature scales the walls at a rapid pace when chasing the boy. This is where you notice blatantly obvious CGI which takes away most of the fear and realism and just makes you feel far less terrified of the demon.But overall this does make me interested to want to watch the remainder of the Insidious films and see where the story takes us.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Right behind The Exorcist,"I know there is some fanboy out there that thinks I just committed sacrilege by saying that but for me it's very true. Don't let the PG-13 throw you off; consider the standards of today, you have to be 1 step from a snuff film to get an R rating now a days. To me a scary move doesn't just make you jump or squirm in the theater, but its stays with you. Making you check in the back seat, under the bed, and question every little bump in the night. Well Insidious did it, the first thing I said leaving the theater was, ""well I'm never sleeping again, how bout you?"" and what's more amazing it's not gory, which is something I would have expected having the SAW guys on board. Instead the movie works from the Paranormal Activity angle; building suspense to the point where your almost screaming ""oh just do it already"" cause you can't take it anymore (but in a good way). And one of the biggest things I noticed while sitting there was the ""cold"" feeling I had through most of the movie, I haven't had a movie do that to me in a long, long time. If this is the type of movie was can expect from the Paranormal Activity and Saw guys then they need to make more movies, and pronto!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious Activity,"Just before paying for my ticket to see Insidious, I heard a scream come from the woman at the ticket booth. She screamed pretty loud. Looking up to see what happened, I noticed someone scared her from behind. As I paid for my ticket, I told the woman, ""I hope I scream like that when I see this movie."" Of course, she laughed.I can't say that I screamed during Insidious, but some people in the audience did. I must admit I jumped a few times, with help from a rather loud audio when the jump scare happens. There are even suspenseful moments to get your heart racing. For the first half of the movie, I knew I was in for something great.Notice I said the ""first half of the movie.""When the movie begins, it reminded me of one of those old, 1970's horror films with a scary sight, large words of the title appearing on screen, and the classic shrills from the violin as if to say ""BOO!"" At this point, I felt the film was trying too hard but I was giving it a chance since it just started.Then we are introduced to the family moving in, enter Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrnes) who have two boys and a baby girl. They just moved into a creepy looking house that looks right at home in Amityville, and like Paranormal Activity: strange things happen at night.Things take a turn for the worse when their son Dalton falls into a coma and the doctors have no idea why. For three months they keep him on oxygen, and the other boy claims he walks at night. This is where they get strange visits from ghosts and the situation gets so bad, they did something the couple in the first Paranormal Activity should have done.... move. But then, things get worse, to the point where they call in a paranormal investigation team. It is there they discover what's really going on, and why Darth Maul is running around in their house.As I said before, the first half was great. The second half gets so outlandish and weird (though still implementing some good ideas) that it took me out of the movie. Even still, it was like the film lost sight of their main characters. In the first half of the film, we see Renai is struggling to become a musician, while Josh is teaching in school. But as the film goes on, it just seems like the two of them are just going through the motions, losing track of those plot points and just focusing on the entities and that stupid story they are trying to tell. Also, besides the use of the baby monitor, I didn't get why the baby was needed in the film. It didn't help with the plot device, only to serve for a couple of scares. This may be a result of some lazy writing, and the film itself could just be going through the motions.One last criticism that needs to be addressed and I know I am not the first one to point this out: Darth Maul. I can't help but to think that the main ghost that's causing all of this looks suspiciously like Darth Maul. I was waiting for the double lightsaber to come out. This isn't something I should be thinking about when I'm watching a horror film!Insidious is a hit and miss. It's an enjoyable experience, but it will only be enjoyable one time. It won't have the lasting appeal as some of the better horror films out there. If anyone is thinking of going to see this one, by all means go see it. It definitely has its moments.

"Good horror, but a tired premise","I'll start by saying this is a pretty good horror movie. It's not breathtaking by any stretch, but it's worth a watch if you haven't already.I think I big problem I have is that it's quite frankly a tired premise that's been used so frequently in horror the last 20 years or so. Granted this is an older film now and I may not have felt this way when it first came out, but if you're watching this for the first time this could well be an issue for yourself. Nothing really surprised me as we've seen it all before. This isn't me saying this is a bad movie, just if you're watching in 2023 it could well feel a bit tired and boring even.The characters was my other issue, I didn't really find them engrossing or interesting enough to really root for them. I know there's only so much you can do with this genre of horror, but I would have liked a little more depth and intrigue from the parents in particular.Is this film scary? Yes. In a sense that the plot did a fantastic job of keeping suspense throughout the whole hour and a half. The jump scares felt a little obvious to me, but the suspense really keeps you on the edge of your seat.It's 100% worth a watch, it had me feeling scared and I'm intrigued to watch Insidious 2. So all in all I can't complain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pure scares,"I think ""Scream 4"" said it best when it comes to the state of horror films nowadays. It's all either torture porn or failed reboots of famous classic horror franchises (If they decide to remake ""Jaws"" or ""The Exorcist"" I'll never forgive them), or worse, dumb them down to PG-13 tween-friendly spooks that will barely raise an eyebrow for classic horror fans.""Insidious"" does not follow today's trend. It's not gory or bloody, it does not have sex scenes or too much foul language. The PG-13 rating is justified. The movie's sole purpose, like many horror movies, is to scare the crap out of us. And it does. Brilliantly. Using good old fashioned scare tactics without making them cheap - remember the cliché where there is incidental music build up to a probably scary killer/ghost only to cop out to a scared animal or whatever? Nope. None of that here. The music comes strictly when it scares you. The non-music parts greatly serve to build the tension so high to the point that you can cut the tension with a knife. It's old school. I like old school.In fact, it's so old school with the delivery of the scares, that one may mistake the film for being stuck in between the 1970's or 1980's. Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whanell, together with producer Oren Peli, probably fashioned the film to be a homage to the great spook horror films of the past, most notably ""Poltergiest"", with bits of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"" and Peli's own ""Paranormal Activity"" thrown in for very good measure.A script which is a homage to other films can either sink or swim. This one swims, because Whanell uses the classic scare elements and removes the clichés. Wan directs with caution, going mostly against audiences' expectations. The actors play their role straight as per the crew - Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are very good in their roles, and Lin Shaye is a bit creepy as the medium who helps them. With the music by Joseph Bishara effectively eerie at many parts and some truly spooky production design and camera work, Wan's tense direction propels a homage script into their own - a great, solid horror flick that does exactly what it's supposed to do - scare - brilliantly.Look at the horror film directors of the past. John Carpenter. Wes Craven. Tobe Hooper. The granddaddy of horror Alfred Hitchcock. Even Sean Cunningham has a cult following. Does anyone familiar with horror films remember names like Samuel Bayer or Nelson McCormick? Granted, Alexandre Aja and Neil Marshall has done some fairly solid stuff, yet Eli Roth to be honest tries too hard. James Wan isn't up there with the greats yet, but if he keeps up this old-school trend without copping out, he just might very well be. I'm just saying.This is great stuff for a horror film. This was how scary movies were made in the past, this is how it still should be.Overall rating: 80/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not the scariest, but still worth a watch!","Out of all the horrormovies out there, this does not sit on top along with the scariest, even if it has some iconic and effective jumpscares!

Definitely the Best Scary Movie in a LOOOOOONG Time...,"Insidious is by FAR the best scary movie to come out in what feels like a very VERY long time. It wasn't just a ""good"" scary movie, but a genuinely ""scary"" scary movie. From the opening shot to the credits, everything just seemed to work. There were no big special effects and there was no cheesy CGI which in my opinion, really brings down the quality of supernatural movies. The scares were genuine and a few parts really had the whole audience gasping and jumping out of their seats. I myself had chills...which hasn't happened with any scary movie in the past 8 years. Granted, it's not a perfect movie, and there are some of the usual scary movie clichés, but in no way do they rob the movie of being enjoyable. Overall, Insidious is creepy and very scary and most importantly, a FUN movie to watch. It gives you the scare you want and the enjoyment you want from walking through a Haunted House during Halloween time. After watching this movie, horror directors and writers should takes notes and tips from James Wan and Leigh Whannel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thing That Go Bump in the Attic 101,"Despite the fact all his vital signs are normal, a little boy has lapsed into a comatose state after encountering something in the attic of his parents' new home. Handsomely-made ghost story with some shudders, though director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell keep the audience on edge by mechanical means: loud noises, door slams, an earsplitting security alarm and an incessantly crying baby. The only aural effect that shows any ingenuity is a '60s recording of Tiny Tim singing ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" (which is scary all by itself). The family at the center of this thriller are cookie-cutter dull, while the plot developments are derivative and carried out listlessly.

"Great, scary movie!!  Loved it!!","I loved this movie, it was really scary!! I didn't know exactly what the movie was about when I went, hadn't looked it up on IMDb. So I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a typical slasher or ghost movie. I screamed several times and just had chill bumps thru the last half of the movie! In comparison, Paranormal Activity 2 had some chilling moments, but you pretty much knew when they were coming. This movie had LOTS of scary moments!! I loved that it wasn't gory, and it had some great 70's type horror movie scenes/music/sound effects. At the beginning of the movie, when the name of the film came up, the sound and look of the title reminded me of many old scary movies, when they relied more on sound effects than computer generated effects. It was surprising and unpredictable at times. It was not corny, either. Very refreshing for a scary movie lover!! I went with a friend that I always see scary movies with, and we both agreed that this was the scariest movie we have seen in a few years! I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves horror/ghost movies!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Scares (well for a Pg-13),"From the guys of Saw (The original masterpiece not the 6 other movies) it comes this movie with its title INSIDIOUS (which can be meaning also as Malicious).The Beginning is one of the best scene i have seen in a lot of time in one movie, the story is kinda simple A kid in comma is being haunted by some evil spirits and his parents are trying to prevent that to happen. (without get in spoilers) The ending is as well as good like the begin.The Story is good, The acting has his good parts with a Patrick Wilson(Watchmen, Hard Candy) sometimes inspired, a Rose Byrne mixed up (28 weeks later, Knowing) and a Ty Simpkins scary. The dialog fail in some parts but sustains the movie in a good way. For being a movie of the guys of Saw is surprising that there is no blood and guts.In average Insidious is a scary movie that gives sometimes some good scares(for a PG-13 Movie).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling film,"The concept has been done to death, the delivery hasn't. Ghost stories can end up being cheesy and cheep or they can be a frightening experience if directed with creativity and originality. The film does contain some bone chilling scene and is effective in making sure it sticks at the back of your mind when you lay down in bed.It not groundbreaking by any means but it sure trumps over films recently released in the genre. Unlike other ghost tales, this film is quick off the mark and successfully pulls you in.Also like many other ghost films, the father will always be in a state of denial, belittling the claims of their wife's or children. Agreed, the father in this does seem more approachable and in fact becomes centre of the attention. The first act effortlessly drags you in. Second act leaves you wanting more frights and the final act takes you a surreal journey which some may or may not.Overall, the film achieves its goal on delivering a chilling experience and making sure you don't forget it any time soon after viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious Is Scary -- What More Do You Want?,"James Wan, the director of the cult classic SAW returns to make what might be one of the greatest PG-13 horror films ever made. Things may start off a bit slow, but when things start to get rolling the scares don't stop until the very end. You'll be grabbing your arm chair and covering your mouth to avoid screaming the entire time.Let me just say that this review is coming from a very skeptical, very anti-horror film kind of guy. I had low expectations for Insidious and was expecting to just laugh and make fun of the dumb characters on screen. Instead, I was met with an intense and sometimes just downright scary thriller that had me at the edge of my seat to the very end. I think what holds this entire movie together is the music. It intensifies every situation and is what separates its self from other realistic horror movies like Paranormal Activity, which for the sake of realism, didn't have any. The screeching violins, and banging and clawing come together to make a reckless, terrifying soundtrack that ensures that your scared even with your eyes closed.Another strength that Insidious has and most horror movies don't is great acting. The entire cast, although small, makes this film very believable. The main characters feel real so you care what happens to them. Most horror movies fail to make you care at all about any of the characters involved, but you're able to connect with them in Insidious. The script writing is good, I can see some of the lines from this becoming remembered like the famous, ""He doesn't want us to cut off our chains. . .he wants us to cut off our feet"" line from Saw. I'm not gonna spoil anything but the ending sort of let me down and left some questioned unanswered. Other then that, I enjoyed the script and every development within the film.The bottom line is Insidious has everything you could possibly want from a PG-13 horror film and more. It's scary but it's also really good. I can see this becoming a cult classic in the near future. Anyone who enjoys horror movies will DEFINITELY enjoy this. However, this can be enjoyed by anyone. There's absolutely no gore and nothing that'll really gross you out if that's not your thing and I think that's just one more thing that makes Insidious so good. It'll make you scared out of your mind without blood and guts, something that horror movies can't seem to do nowadays.***/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the scariest things i have ever seen,"This movie was absolutely amazing, I went to see it last night with my friend, and it scared the living hell out of me. The guy with the red face kind of reminded me of that guy on star wars though.. and the boy that was dancing was really really creepy, but all i could do was laugh at that part. I think the scariest part of the WHOLE movie, was the old lady, i cant get that image out of my head..i don't know why, but it was just so scary. The movie shouldn't be rated PG 13. It should be like, rated R.. Scariest movie ever. It probably wouldn't be so bad on like a small TV, but seeing it on the big screen terrified me. LOL at one part, I punched myself in the face. Something scary happened, and my arm flew up to cover my eyes, and i ended up hitting myself. Anyway, great movie. Waaay scarier than paranormal activity, when i saw the previews for this, it seemed like one of those movies, but it was SO much better. I'd definitely go see it again, and again, and again. Although i may have nightmares for the next few weeks. I'd recommend it to people of any age, as long as they can handle creepy faces, and scary pop out scenes. :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious haunting,"It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.Having seen 'Insidious', it is not a horror classic, or at least to me it isn't, and it is understandable as to why people don't like it. Especially if over-familiarity, strangeness and silliness are not for you. Personally, 'Insidious' was, warts and all, worth the too-overdue wait, and it is not hard to see why it has appealed to others. There are a lot of merits executed very well.For one thing, 'Insidious' llooks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music, when used, is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull, actually really admired the restraint of the first half, meaning that the film started off incredibly well. 'Insidious' is genuinely scary with a great atmosphere, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Also liked the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The ghosts may be overused but have eerie presences and didn't look that cheap to me. The direction is assured and the performances are strong from particularly an intense Lin Shaye and Patrick Wilson handling his character growth believably. Rose Byrne is also as professional as ever.On the other hand, the restraint does decrease later on and things get a little too over-the-top in some of the second half, very unsubtle over-stuffed kitchen-sink-like. Things do get silly at this point too and less logical, making the sense go out the window. The second half is still intriguing and creepy, the film just worked much better when restrained.It has been said that 'Insidious' is derivative. Definitely agree with this, the over-familiarity from running through as many modern-haunted-house clichés as can muster and having parts similar to other horror films is all over the film and makes one wish there was more freshness.Will admit that the final twist is a shock, but instead of being unnerving of ingenious it came over as out of kilter wacky and not easy to take at face value. The whole ending in fact felt rushed.Summing up, enjoyable and effective but the divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest film since the Exorcist,"I love the horror film genre, seen virtually all and own most on DVD & now Blu-Ray. Not since the 70's when the Exorcist was released, has there been any film which has made me really jump several times, not want to look at the screen on a few occasions and have an effect on me after the film had finished. I left all passage lights on when I went to bed the first time in over 30 years and didn't want to look in the mirror when washing my teeth just in case someone would be looking over my shoulder. Watched Blu-Ray version on 50"" LED TV with HE system at 2:00 am with all lights off and volume up and it scared me big time, it makes the likes of Paranormal Activity 2 look like a kids TV program.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't expect to be scared....Expect a good movie,"Inisidious is not particularly scary, but let's be honest. 90% of horror films don't scare us anymore. If that's what it takes for you to give a thumbs up to a movie, then this won't be the movie for you. Nevertheless, it's well made and well acted. It's a simple retelling of the haunted house genre, that's not about the house. In this case, the house has some unwanted inhabitants because of this family's little boy who is being surrounded by evil deities. I won't go into the explanation for why this is. One, because it's too cheesy to be believed, and two because it would take too long.Aside from that, I still enjoyed the film. The entire movie consists of BOO! moments. I admit I jumped several times, but towards the end I became a little desensitized. What made Insidious work for me is two things. Because I never knew what was going to pop out at any given time, I was always on the edge of my seat. Second, Rose Byrne as the main character was believable and sympathetic. With a lesser actress, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much.So you have-Pros: Exceptional acting, good pacing, spooky atmosphere, good heroine, ending with a twist Cons: Those ""jump"" moments become repetitive, explanation for the haunting is kind of hokey and borderline ridiculousBetter than average, but becomes repetitive and predictable at times. 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jungian subconscious,"The savvy viewer coming into this should know that he will have to struggle with some cheap devices. Overexplaining of the haunting situation with twaddle about the 'further' and astral projection, mumbo jumbo technology that permits us to see the spectra, a bevy of jump scares (some well orchestrated, others not).But the notions are as good as they always were (as far back as The Innocents), haunted rooms mapping to haunted minds. How inside disturbance manifests around us.I only wish that a better filmmaker than James Wan would've tackled the project to deliver a more potent vision of a Jungian subconscious. There is a little of The Exorcist (centered around a seance) and a little of Fire Walk with Me inside of this - I would've liked more of the latter.In other words, when strange figures stand or creep the movie is all that you've heard. When they lunge at us or walk on walls, the effect is diluted.What we get is good enough though, if we deliberately work to discard the cheapening. Then we're left with a few arresting atmospheres to keep; the house as playground of malevolent presence, an empty ceiling by broad light, the house again reversed by a mirror.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Crunch time,"Normally I review very good or really, really bad movies. This falls in the good category. We have to admit that making an original movie is specially difficult; there are too many common places, and while this movie visits quite a few of them, it introduces twists and surprises that takes you unprepared.The initial scene only makes sense once you have watched the last one, bringing the whole tale full-circle. The high-pitch music delivered with the initial title and then repetition with the closing title have devastating effects on your nerves. The depth of the title becomes more and more apparent as the final credits roll. Slowly you start thinking ""that was an insidious b..."". The execution of this film is superb.This is not to say that the movie is without flaws. There are several lost opportunities, and towards the end some of the carefully crafted eeriness dissolves... but only for a moment.

Not as insidious and scary as it could have been,"The trailer is very good and makes you want to watch the movie, although it spoils a few things, so better to avoid if you can. The first half (in the first house) is superbly done: building up suspense, making you unsure what to expect and basically making you focus on the corners of the screens (away from the characters) to anticipate what might appear. This ""where's Waldo game"" starts in the credits where some of pictures have something that shouldn't be there or moving. Scares relied on creepy sounds, shadows, inanimate objects moving and quick glimpses of human shapes and faces where they shouldn't be. So, traditional stuff, but it was creepy, and I was buying it. Then not long after the start of the second half, something weird happened as the more things got supernatural, the less I was involved, the less I was unnerved to the point of being quite calm near the end. That big problem, especially for a horror film supposed to be climaxing, might have been caused by 3 possible things: the introduction of comic relief nerd exorcists, the shift from haunted house story to possession story and showing too much of the ""entities"" (as in lingering too long).Speaking of which, some of the most memorable parts involved a red-faced ""demon"" appearing quickly where it shouldn't be and as a shadow later on. Near the end, the more you saw of him, the less disturbing he became, showing the limitations of his design. So we have a two-headed beast film here: the first half of the movie, scarier, more subtle, insidious even, would be a 8 for remarkable; the second half, flashier, less scary yet still entertaining, would be a 4 for slightly below average. The acting from the family was decent. The acting from the paranormal investigators, especially the old woman, sometimes veered close to caricature. Jump scares weren't cheap, false alert ones and some clichés were intentionally avoided (as heard in the extras). There was some blood but not anything gory or physically disgusting. The Blu-Ray extras, all put together, are a paltry 20 minutes long. If you like that kind of film, you could be doing worse than renting this one, but I wouldn't buy it sight unseen.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best,"Insidious is the latest horror endeavor by the original Saw creator, James Wan, and Paranormal Activity producer Jason Blum that will literally terrify audiences. It revolves around Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne as they move into a new home. Their oldest son, Dalton (Ty Simpson) is an adventurer who likes to explore. One night when venturing into the attic, he falls and hits his head. The next morning, he is in a coma. Unable to do anything, Josh and Renai bring him home to care for in the hope he will one day come out of it. Then, strange things start to happen. Strange noises occur. Faces appear. Things are moved. The alarm sounds. Strange happenings occur more frequently. After a while, they have had enough and move to a small house for lease. It does not help. Apparently, it was not the house that was haunted, but rather Dalton. More bizarre things happen - frightening things. At this point, they turn for help from Josh's Mom, (Barbara Hershey) and Elise (Lin Shaye). She explains the strange things that pervade: what is happening, why it is happening, and how to get Dalton back. This leads to a secret memory that Josh has buried (which was easy to figure out) and a terrifying venture into the spiritual world. Insidious, despite a few flaws is deft craft, using atmosphere, suspense, terror, and stunning visual imagery that will frighten the deepest part of your soul. This accomplishment is primarily done with Wan's wonderful direction that leaves an audience confused, guessing, and frightened. The performances by Wilson, Byrne, Shay, and Simpson are also good, giving the audience people to care about. The story is also engaging, slowly unfolding in a subtle way that keeps our interest. It is part Amityville Horror, part Poltergeist, part Exorcist, and a few other horror gems. The most stunning aspect is the imagery, especially when crossing over into the spirit world. It is not only frightening, but downright disturbing. Yes, it has a few flaws. The explanation offered by Elise seems too convenient and easy, as if writers assumed the audience HAD to know what was going on instead of leaving us in the dark to figure it out for ourselves. The ""surprise"" for the audience is also weak, and is something that can be seen a mile away. Making up for these flaws is a disturbing terrifying movie that relies on suspense and fear instead of buckets of blood and guts. In the end I was exhausted by fear, and it took almost an hour after movie's end for the terror to fade. This is one of the few times a horror movie has infused a fear into my soul. I would rank this as one of THE most terrifying movies I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Great... yet bad.,"When horror films decide to get into the ""other side"" discussion, they need to be very careful. I've enjoyed films such Sinister and Shutter, because they let spirits be spirits, and don't try to explain the unexplainable. I know many of you liked the fact that Insidious moves us closer to the unknown by trying to visualize the ""other side"", but to me it backfired. I do however see the idea and vision, and I think the reason why it's been positively reviewed is because of exactly that, so credit should go to Wan. If Insidious should have been successful in its attempt there should have been a waaay more scary monster (than Darth Maul), a stronger build up (the viewer should have asked him/herself more questions regarding the plot, before it was all spilled to us in a 3 minute monologue) and there should have been stronger acting performances. There is still one horror movie above anyone else (A tale of two sisters) and Insidious does not change that. It is however a refreshing attempt, with its moments, hence 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A pretty darn scary film,"I have been looking forward to this movie for months, so when I finally saw it I was afraid I would have drastically high expectations for it. But when the film ended I was pretty well satisfied. Let's start with the positives... It is scary. It does what it's supposed to do. I jumped. I hid my face. It's realistic, kind of. The family actually moves house! I've never, in all the scary movies I've seen, seen this happen. It's got some good cast members and crew behind it. Now the negatives... The music is crudely used. I know it's there to help build suspense. But it's loud and distasteful. The film doesn't allow the audience to imagine anything. When you see what's haunting Dalton, you'll most likely laugh. Overall, I liked it. For an Aussie(ish) film it was pretty good. Horror films are hard to get right, and I think James Waan & Leigh Whannel did a pretty good job.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not Horrifying but Still a Fun Watch,","Insidious is a decent movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.The movie is certainly not as scary as I thought it was going to be,mainly because many people were recommending it to me and telling me I would be at the edge of my seat all the way through,but to be honest,whenever something scary was going to happen the music and atmosphere let you know it was coming and made you feel too ready to be scared.I did really appreciate that this movie was filmed a lot like an old school horror,the music is very Hitchcock-like and it relies on it's characters a lot instead of just a spooky atmosphere,certainly unique for the horrors of today.Its not an outstanding scary movie,but it is still at times quite thrilling and I would recommend Insidious to anyone looking for a good horror to kill some time.A couple are plagued by a series of ghostly visions after their young son falls in to a coma.Best Performance: Patrick Wilson Worst Performance: Barbara Hershey",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just another horror movie,"""Insidious"" earns a 6/10 for its mixed bag of horror elements. The film has its moments of genuine fright, primarily thanks to a few well-executed jump scares and a creepy atmosphere. Additionally, the concept of astral projection and the ""further"" realm adds an intriguing layer to the supernatural horror genre.The cast delivers decent performances, helping to create a sense of empathy for the family at the center of the story. Lin Shaye's portrayal of Elise Rainier, in particular, stands out as a strong and enigmatic character.However, ""Insidious"" is not without its flaws. While it initially builds tension effectively, the latter part of the film delves into clichéd territory with over-the-top scares and a somewhat convoluted plot. The reliance on jump scares, while effective in some instances, can also feel forced at times, making the scares feel more formulaic than genuinely chilling.The film's pacing is a bit uneven, with a slower start that may test the patience of some viewers before ramping up the horror elements. The storyline could have been more tightly woven to maintain a consistently suspenseful atmosphere.In summary, ""Insidious"" is a serviceable horror movie that manages to offer some chilling moments and a unique take on supernatural themes. However, it falls short of being a standout in the genre due to its reliance on jump scares and occasional lapses in storytelling. A 6/10 rating reflects its potential but also its shortcomings as a horror film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An unexpected surprise...so much FUN!,"This was an unexpected surprise! It had many unique plot twists (the existence of ""the further"") while incorporating both Asian horror films, American classic horror films and tongue-in-check campy ""this is so bad...it's good"" aspects.Hard to describe, unless you've seen it, but the audience was screaming, laughing and groaning. Being someone who was raised on old, black and white Samurai movies and foreign films, like ""Diabolique"" and who loves good supernatural thrillers, old B horror movies (like ""The Mummy's Curse"") and totally terrible, first-time-film-maker attempts at scary movies like the ""The Fanglys"", this was a fun ride from beginning to end.See it, but don't bring your youngsters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
To have a complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.,"INSIDIOUS – CATCH IT ( A ) Ever since I saw first trailer of Insidious, I knew there was something special about it. Then after its release slowly and gradually it got the critical acclaim and became one of the most successful movies of the year. Insidious cost on $1.5 million and it has so far earned over $76 million, which is a great achievement. Finally, I got the chance to watch Insidious all alone in a dark room. Wow, it literally scared the sh*t out of me, there were moments where I was holding my heart just so I can pass through those scary moments. The best thing about Insidious is it deals with a new supernatural element ""Astral Travelers"", which rarely we see in supernatural/horror movies. The director made a great choice to cast Patrick Wilson & Rose Byrne as grieving parents whose son falls into Astral Projection state. Both Wilson and Byrne are famous in indie circle but not on the international level, which makes us really easy to relate to them. Plus both have proved their talent in various movies. Ty Simpkins as Dolton was adorable and impressive, after his innocent face on the poster sold out the movie perfectly. Besides the lead stars, the supporting cast Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Leigh Whannell did an amazing job. In Insidious lots of contribution goes to make-up artist & set designer who created the horror with minimal special effects. Brilliant! Overall, to have complete horror experience must watch it alone in a dark room; it'll scare the hell out of you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious gets so much right that I can't seem to understand why I'm finding it so hard to look past it's flaws...,"oh Insidious...my mother tried to warn me about you.... You smooth talking little pg-13 number. I had my guard up too.. I wasn't about to let your first and second acts woo me into a false sense of security. After all, this is'nt my first rodeo you know. I know better than this.. I really do. You came on strong and told me everything that I wanted to hear... You provided an easy to follow plot with plenty of tension and well acting. You had me all figured out. A couple of drinks later and i'm naked in a truck stop bathroom, trying to find my cell phone and the faint hint of ether still hangs in the air.. I thought you loved me... OK... Now that I've been to group and have the emotional tool sets to cope, lemme give you my real insidious review. Hold on... What I meant to say is, "" let me preface my Insidious review."" I am in the business of horror movies. I have seen the good, the bad, the weird and the batshit intolerable ones. An homage to me at this point is useless. Most modern horror films are already homages, minus the self awareness that makes them endearing. ( see my Scream 4 review) Thus now beginneth the odyssey that is my mixed feelings on Insidious. Insidious gets so much right that I can't seem to understand why I'm finding it so hard to look past it's flaws. Insidious opens with such an oppressive heavy feeling of dread that it's hard not to be affected by the tone of this picture. It is the tone of Insidious that automatically Draws you into it. It establishes a universe that is easy to believe and easy to live in for the duration of the film. It is a universe very much like our own with a couple who could easily be your next door neighbors. They are unspectacular and ordinary in all the right ways and add to the general believability that is one of insidious's many strengths.Make no mistake, Insidious works.. It works so well on so many different levels that it feels like little more then a cheap shot when i start to point out it's weaknesses. I love the paranormal. For all it's nerdy chicanery, the world of the paranormal is still a fun and provocative place. Maybe it is my decade long inundation of this world that ultimately starts to pull me out of the Insidious universe. You see, I am more of a journey than a destination guy. Endings rarely give me the kind of gratification that getting there does (don't let this disuade you from trying ladies.. Ziiiiing!!!!). ""The Further""' the mystical Pangea that connects our world to another for those unluckiest of astral travelers who reach it, works better as an unseen threat. The moment we enter The Further, we enter into a navigable world with rules, guidelines and limitations. It is here that Insidious's creep factor starts to drop off sharply. One of the good things about Insidious is that it has come out in a time where the horror genre is so steeped in pointless torture porn clones that even when it comes dangerously close to ripping off some of it's predecessors (again, sometimes an homage in all it's flattery can still seem unnecessary when the plot device mimicked is a central crux to the story) it is almost welcome.In all sincerity there are many, many good things about insidious including all of the fine performances turned in from Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and the rest of the cast, including Barbara Hershey. It is Lin Shaye that does a pretty good Zelda Rubinstein and makes her part one of the most memorable (sad it is though I will always remember her from the farrely's brothers' Kingpin - ""what is it about good sex that always makes me have to crap?"" Insidious's score is really the trump card here. Joseph Bishara has brought the heebyjeebies and his A-game giving every moment of the film a lush texture of anxiety and fear. For those of you that miss the film's finer visual points, it's hard to knock this soundtrack, one of the better I've heard from a horror offering in years. Insidious is memorable, even if some of those memories may seem a little ""borrowed"". Recommended",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Everyone said it was oh-so-scary...,"Okay, well I had heard nothing but praise for ""Insidious"" and that it was the scariest movie of 2011 so far. So naturally I gave the movie a go, being the horror aficionado that I am.And I will say this much praise for the movie, it was great up until half way through, give or take. The first half of the movie was actually quite good, because it was building up a lot of dread and suspense. And there was a certain feel to the movie, the sort of feel you had going on in the old ""Poltergeist"" movie. You slowly got to see more and more of the haunting and whatever entity it was that was the cause of this.But then you find out what it was, and the movie started to crack and fail. I was thinking they can't be serious about this. So now I know what happened the Darth Maul. Wow, talk about being a major disappointment in revealing what was doing the haunting. I am sure the concept was working well enough, but this Darth Maul look-alike clone? No, not really working out all that much.And to top it off; when Josh went into ""The Further"", as they cleverly called the Astral Plane. That was painful to sit through and look at. There was nothing out of this world about that at all, and it was a shame, because it would otherwise have added a very cool element to the movie.Now, ""Insidious"" is more interesting and more spooky than both of the ""Paranormal Activities"", and that is a big plus. Because they were major disappointments in each their own way. I read that someone compared ""Insidious"" to ""Saw"" and said that ""Insidious"" was more scary? Ehm, yeah, two completely different genre of movies here, so you can't really compare the two. ""Insidious"" had a lot going on for it, especially in the first half of the movie, but then it snapped and went spiraling downward fast. And the whole ""Poltergeist"" feeling (or tribute, not sure what the director was going for), also worked out well for the movie.As for the cast and their acting, well I think they had managed to put together a decent enough ensemble of people here. And it was a bit weird to see Patrick Wilson (playing Josh Lambert) in a movie of this genre. But he did pull off the character and came through with a good performance, so the genre change worked for him. Lin Shaye (playing Elise Rainer) had some big shoes to fill out, standing up against the iconic character Tangina (played by Zelda Rubinstein) in the classic ""Poltergeist"" movies. But still, Lin Shaye did it well and added her own unique touch to the movie.I had been looking forward to watching ""Insidious"", but was sorely disappointed. My low rating for the movie is because of the nature of the entity behind the haunting and the last half of the movie. Had the entity been something else, a high rating would have been given. What pulls up the score is the dread and suspense that the movie managed to build up in the first half. I will say that for a horror movie, then ""Insidious"" does a better job than many others.""Insidious"" provides adequate entertainment for an evening in front of the screen, but for those who have been addicted to the horror movies for many, many years (like I have), there is just something unsatisfying about the end result.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally a modern horror film more than worth seeing...,"Come on people! Why are so many saying this film is not original, i don't know?!

The acting is on point (lin shay is always amazing!) the direction is beautiful (each shot or frame rather is like a series of paintings and the scenes in ""the further"" are breathtaking) the story IS original. The writers set up a world for the dead and its connection with the living that is quite refreshing.You don't need to be a horror film fan to enjoy this film, especially since it has close to no gore,and relies mainly on suspense.

"Silly, but still entertaining horror movie with some good scares","I have watched alot of horror movies and even though Insidious is a very well known one, I just saw it for the first time. It's pretty good.Some good scares to be had here for sure and it's very entertaining for most of it's runtime. It is quite silly though and does get more and more weird the more watch.The first half of the movie is my favorite. It establishes the family dynamics in a very basic level, but still it's good. The first half also has a very good atmosphere and some good tebse moments.The second half is unfortunately a bit weaker. It's not horrible. Some good scares are to be found here. The final 10 minutes of the movie are the weakest, but a pretty good cliffhanger ending does save it somewhat.So in conclusion I think this is a pretty good watch.

Starts well but ended up being funny...,"I had high expectations of this film as I am an avid horror fan but I came away feeling let down.It started well, building the tension, and there were a couple of moments that made both myself and my 15 year old daughter jump, however around half way through the film, the so called 'scary' parts became comedic and I am not on about the two characters others are talking about in their reviews, which in my view were good value.I also took along my mother, who jumps like a cat on a hot tin roof at horror films and even she thought it was silly by the end.The film cost me £25 for the three of us, so If I were you I would save your money and either wait for it on Sky or buy the DVD.8/10 for the first half & 2/10 for the remainder. 5/10 overall",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid movie,"This movie for me started fairly strong in the first act, kind of fell a bit in the second act, but the third act was absolutely worth the wait, very exciting. The lighting in Insidious is near perfect. The paranormal investigators were my favorite characters, they were fun, professional, and actually not scammers. For a pg-13 horror movie, this was professionally done, and fairly scary. The couple were such a believable, and real feeling couple. The ghost kid easily had to be my favorite ghost, the best scene of the movie. The eerie lighting and artful camera angles, chilling soundtrack, hauntingly realistic special effects, and subtle yet effective makeup all come together to create a truly nightmarish atmosphere. Overall I would give this movie a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Child possession,"James wan is one of the greatest horror movie directors. He did The Conjuring, Saw and a movie called Dead Silence.

A stew made out of leftovers,"The first hour was really good: scary, suspenseful and fun with likeable and engaging characters. The movie completely derailed after the 60 min mark when momentum slowed and it suddenly dawned on me that Insidious is a complete, weak heist of Poltergeist without the movie magic or charm. Sure Insidious has its own twists, surprises and unveilings that are completely its own, but it gets further annoying when you notice elements from other classics quietly, but blatantly lifted, rendering this movie almost completely unoriginal. Obvious lifts from The Exorcist and even The Cell, on top of the double fisted theft from Poltergeist, really hamper Insidious's cause. This movie was clearly made for a young crowd that isn't going to want to watch a movie from the early '80s. And truthfully, any seventh grader who loves a scare is going to love this, they just aren't going to know what they're missing. After patiently sitting through Insidious, I have zero interest in watching the sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"In the ""Era of the Desensitized Audience"", this Horror Flick Stands Above the Rest","First things first, I thought this was one of the better scary movies I have ever seen. Well made and as creepy as I would imagine a movie could be w/o being exploitative in some fashion. However, I was shocked when I left the movie w/ my three friends (all of which loved the movie and, like myself, have seen thousands of horror flicks), I heard a meathead-ish guy behind me being like, ""dude, that didn't scare me at all, I thought it was funny.""This reminded me of a few of my other friends that always laughed during scary movies - I was never annoyed by this until I noticed that they laughed harder during movies that I thought were scarier than the average horror flick (e.g. Exorcist, The Shining, etc). Upon further research, I feel quite confident that this type of reaction is disingenuous and, apparently, quite prevalent. Psychologists have examined it for years. Many people, when scared, are able to disassociate from the traumatic situation w/ laughter. This is how they minimize the extent to which they are ""scared"".That being said, w/ people like this out there (and likely critics, too), I would imagine it is a VERY tough battle trying to out-do horror classics. Not only are there these disassociate types, but people are generally more desensitized overall, so you are trying to scare an audience that isn't as easily scared.My point is this - this movie was very well made and very scary/creepy despite some of the comments to the contrary - I'm sure there is merit to some of the criticisms about the acting and such, but I believe very strongly that this movie will eventually get the credit it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So when i finally got time today i decided to watch it with my movie pals.First of all the movie overall is scary and actually creates a frightening atmosphere over the course of the film, however when i walked out of the theater i felt somewhat disappointed probably because i was expecting more. The movie contains a few original ideas of its own and takes an unique approach to the horror genre.

Dark & Creepy....My Kind Of Movie,"Josh (Patrick Wilson) & Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert, along with their baby and two other children, have moved into a new home, but not before long Renai starts to experience strange incidents. These incidents, for the most part, just get ignored, but things change dramatically when their son, Dalton, doesn't wake up one morning. Seeking any help they can, they turn to Elise Rainier, a spiritual psychic, and learn that their son has the ability to astro-project and is actually trapped by a hideous demon in a realm known as The Further. Desperate to get their son back, Josh has to enter The Further to get Dalton back before it's too late.Insidious is a really good and a very creepy movie. The first 30 - 40 minutes are a wee bit slow to be honest with not much happening, but even though it's a bit slow it does build the story & tension up nicely, leading into the last hour which is where it gets much better. It doesn't really rely on the ""jump-boo"" scares either - although there are a couple of good moments of those - but plays more on the psychological scares of just making you feel really uneasy and creeped out....and it works great.The main demon is done really well, and even though you don't see a whole great deal of it, you definitely see enough for it to freak you out. This works really well because with a lot of these kinds of movies it's what you don't see that can actually scare you. Sometimes the thing that scares you the most is your own imagination and this is what Insidious plays on. It doesn't rely on gore or intense violence either. It's just a really good, creepy psychological horror.If you enjoy creepy horrors such as The Conjuring, Sinister and The Amityville Horror then you should enjoy Insidious.

This makes it easy to root for our protagonists and join them in their battle against evil. The movie has the generic and typical setup of the family being haunted but adds in some nice twists and good visuals. Also you have a nice variety of demons and a set of very memorable scenes and an unforgettable antagonist.

One of the scariest movies of all time!,"Insidious comes from two of my all-time favourite filmmakers: James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Nevermind the fact that this film is on a $1 million budget and the cast is filled with no big names. This movie will blow your mind.Keep this all in mind as you watch this horror masterpiece. It takes you on an intense ride that will have you squirming in your seat. It is probably going to be the best horror film of 2011, and one of the top ten of the year, as well. It's just so damn good.It starts off showing a family unpacking boxes in their new home, when strange things start happening making me think of The Haunting in the Connecticut. It quickly dives into depression as the son Dalton falls into what the doctors deem as a coma...but not really. But the strange things don't stop but instead grow more intense. Even when the family changes environments by moving to another house, the family is plagued with the spirits in the house.It doesn't follow the same set-up-pay-off format as Paranormal Activity, and nor does it follow the disturbing nature of Dead Silence. Instead, it combines these two elements to give us the psychological aspect, but while also giving us jump scenes.I lept from my seat at one point because this movie is scary. It doesn't have any bloody scenes but it is not necessary here. It doesn't have any of those scenes like Paranormal Activity, but instead makes it's own scare scenes using lighting and effects. It is truly a freaky film by most of what happens in the the second half of the movie.Perhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the song that is sung by Tiny Tim. It occurs briefly twice in the movie, but both times send some serious shivers down your spine. It chills me and although this movie freaked me out more than any movie has, I would love to see it again. Seriously, folks, if you haven't yet seen Insidious and want a good scare and want a good film to see for the early 2011, go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Decent film, stays fun! Lighten up movie know it all!","I will say that most of these reviews are correct about Insidious. It does borrow a lot from other films. No there are no Academy Award winning performances. No it's not the Exorcist. All that being said for the so called movie review ""experts"" here on IMDb lets remember what movies are for. They are for entertainment.What this film wasn't was the waste of money some people state here. Come on guys. This film was fun. Great camera work here akin to House on Haunted Hill. Awesome music, combined with the odd camera angles makes for unsettling suspense. I also liked the new angles on old concepts.This movie ultimately does not take itself too seriously and that is important. Maybe thats what causes some fellow movie goers to go out of their way to rip this movie to shreds. There are very serious horrors that are the comparisons. The Exorcist, the Sixth Sense, Night of the Living Dead...these classics are for the most part totally humorless and damn scary. Insidious does not fall into this bracket. Phantasm, the Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Poltergiest...these movies remind me a little of Insidious.If you haven't seen it it's worth watching to judge for yourself.

"Like Most 21st Century American Horror, It Goes For Cheap Scares","There's a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells ""BOO"" when I return from the restroom. Sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door, or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen. Every time he uses the same lame ""BOO"" scream because he's too stupid to properly construct an effective scare. It worked the first few times but now it's totally worthless. He can't scare me. I, on the other hand, will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives. His office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim. He'll walk into his office, feel someone's presence, turn around and see a shadow near the door. Is it a part of his imagination or is it real? He squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there. It scares the crap out of him every time, and I don't even need to scream ""BOO!"" Ironically, sometimes when I don't do it he'll stop by my office and say, ""Man, I thought I saw you this morning.""This very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and well-constructed sequences of terror is something that 21st Century American filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon. In case you hadn't noticed, the American horror industry has sucked for quite some time, and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest, laziest routes to producing scares. In the case of Insidious, it's jump scares supplemented with 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs. If Insidious limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments (or even 4 or 5), then it could have saved enough room for more mature, expertly crafted horror elements. Unbelievably, Insidious tosses in approximately 20 jump scares, an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness. The condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. It would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling ""BOO"" every 3 minutes. It quickly becomes a parody of itself.Brian Salisbury from ""Film School Rejects"" makes some good points in his review of Insidious, so I'd like to quote him here: ""Seriously, horror filmmakers: put a moratorium on jump scares. I know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences, but it's time to give up the ghost (pun only slightly intended). I got sick and tired of something popping up like Jack-in-the-Box every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting, and far scarier, story going on behind it. Jump scares are the junk food of horror films – providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment. Soon enough, your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of Twinkies on Thanksgiving Day. When you watch the Oscars and the category of Achievement in Sound Mixing comes up (you know, when you normally make a trip to the bathroom), you may ponder on the value of a film's sound mixer or sound designer. Five minutes into Insidious, you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that we're subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes. Every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious (read: eardrum-shredding) violins. It seems to be operating under the same delusion as Drag Me to Hell that loud = scary. But, along with jump scares, incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright. We are not infants, so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms.""That sums things up nicely. The praise that Insidious has earned for it's cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre, because a transition from the recent torture/gore trend towards jump scare compilations isn't much of a progression for the pitiable American horror industry. Take away the 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs and almost none of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile. (And by ""work"" I'm using the generous term ""startle"", which is probably the laziest way to scare someone.) The storyline is stupid, the acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue ranges from decent to lame, and the dramatic elements are limp. The only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boring.Despite everyone I know complaining about my biased preference for Japanese and South Korean horror, it's pretty damn obvious that my fellow Americans are simply too incompetent to construct long-sustained sequences of terror, produce dense atmosphere, develop interesting psychological/philosophical elements, use ambiguity properly, patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension, or supplement horror with good story lines and characters. If Insidious is the creme de la creme of modern American horror, then it's time to write an epitaph.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Refreshing Old School Scarefest without need for Gore and CGI,"Just seen this at a preview screening in London.From the makers of Saw, this was surprisingly devoid of any gore and instead what we get is a refreshingly old school scare fest, 80s style. No stupid over-used CGI, just good effective camera work and traditional make up effects (akin to that of Sixth Sense).But this film was so similar in structure to one of my favourite 80s scary movie that if I mention what that movie is, I feel I would spoil the whole movie for you! I'm pretty much saying this is an act for act total rip off of that movie. I'm surprised they're not even calling it a remake, or a reboot. But I don't mind the extraordinary similarities as this has its own signature and flavour to win over fans of the ""original"" and definitely will win over those who haven't.Did I jump out of my skin? At least 20 bloody times. At one time I worried if I was too far away to get back in my body. Granted, they are your traditional BOO moments with the sound cranked up to maximum, you know the type but they are pretty damn effective and done with great timing and excellent editing.The audience I saw this with clearly loved the scares whilst dreading it at the same time. It's amusing to find people trying to laugh the scares off and I was one of them, its like a defence mechanism. You know you just got tango'd so what do you do? you try laugh it off!Having said that I think they used that card a bit too many times in the first and second act so it was quite noticeable that later scary moments didn't quite have us jumping out of our seats and in fact some of it fell quite flat.My other gripe was that the last act did not quite reach the urgency of excitement that the film was clearly building to, some more tightening in the editing was needed here. I might have felt that way because I'm uncontrollably comparing it too much to the ""original"". I was also hoping for a little more visual imagination in that last act. But I later found out that this movie was made on a minuscule budget of $800,000. Considering this, they did a damn good job of making use of every penny of it. So it was moderately exciting but not as fulfilling as I would have liked.Even though I think this a clear rip off of an 80s film I love, this delivered exactly what our sadistic inner demons have been crying out for lately, a movie that scares the bejesus out of us.So this is a great movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with your friends and for guys with their dates as I guarantee your arms will be sore as your girlfriends grab you violently several times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but not that much!,"Idk why but I have a different liking for the Conjuring series by Dir. Wan. May be its because of the plane depiction of the sightings or feelings. I did not find anything which seems to be realistic. The main ghostly figure shown is also not upto the mark, but still, I will give it a 6 bcoz, there were some jumpscare parts :-
1. When that ghost appeared just behind Josh. (Scariest, as it is a sudden jumpscare.)(Written only one as, it will be wrong for the first time viewers!)

Three reasons to see this movie:,"1) I haven't logged into my IMDb account in about a year and a half. I did today just to give this 9/10.2) I have never yelled like a little bitch in a movie before. In cinemas or watching at home. I did in this. I am still so on edge and feeling physically ill from being in panic mode for so long I fear I might not sleep tonight. Or, ever again.3) Go see this movie.

Slightly better than run of the mill,"When a kid sees eerie creatures in the night the parents do the usual thing - they comfort the kid and blame childhood fantasy. But when the kid slips into a coma and other people in the house start seeing things they may have been wrong.Films like this are a dime in a dozen and they usually pick one of the more classical films and take whatever they can from that one. This one is no different and leans very heavily on Poltergeist (1982). It's still rather different from that one though so it's OK, it's better to copy creatively than to create badly after all.The tension build in the film is quite good. It starts slowly but gets under the skin eventually. Attempted shock moments are there but are completely ineffective (and might just be designed to be like that) but they don't disturb anything. As the film rolls on and picks up speed it becomes a pleasant watch but never goes above that level. So, all in all, slightly better than run of the mill.7 out of 10 dark intentions",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not good at all!!,It looks like there are either a lot of relatives or a lot of people being paid to write reviews because I don't know how anyone can say this movie was good.The concept wasn't bad but the execution was god awful. The direction was amateurish. The camera angles were awful and (one of my pet peeves) WAY too many close ups. The make-up looked like it was done by high school kids.You never really connect with any of the characters so you don't care what happens to any of them. The whole thing was just BAD.Wait for this to come out on DVD or even cable. I read all the good reviews and thought that the bad reviews were just people that don't really like horror movies. I was wrong. I'm really not kidding when I say that I think people were paid to write reviews.,3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious...One way ticket to see your psychiatrist,"Have you ever been so horrified that you cried tears of fear? Have you ever seen a film so creepy you can't stop shaking for hours? This is one such film. Many have lauded the cinematography and I must give praise as well.The concept, not too out of the ordinary, however, it has a much more concrete twist if you will about it.To me, not only were the images immensely disturbing and frightening, the whole idea of what was happening did me in the most.When people think of haunted houses and ghost it is fuzzy, beyond us. This film eerily made the concept of apparitions plausible almost scientifically.Listen to what is said carefully and think about especially when it comes to the how and why.See this film. Please do not see it if you have health issues. I'm healthy and usually am like a typical man and don't get scared easily (except for psychological films like Event Horizon).This movie made me scream out loud in panic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Behind the Red Door,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, the lost art of horror films. I don't mean slasher films or gore-fests. I mean real horror films. The ""Saw"" series falls into gore-fest and its collaborators, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannel, team up again for a more traditional horror film ... one designed to scare the viewer, rather than just gross out society.The film opens as Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne move into a beautiful old house with their two young sons and infant daughter. By beautiful house, of course I mean terribly creepy with nooks and crannies, creaking floorboards, squeaky doors and an attic designed by Satan. The mom (Byrne) quickly realizes things aren't just right with this house, and as is customary in horror films, the dad finds some lame excuse to work late so the mom and kids can be haunted without him.There are some bits and pieces from classic horror films like ""The Exorcist"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Amityville Horror"" and, yes, ""Saw"" (but not the gory stuff). Remarkably, this film is rated PG-13 which means the filmmakers really have to tell a story ... and they do.The mom gets so desperate, she begs to move. They do. Guess what? Things aren't better. So mother-in-law Barbara Hershey says she knows someone. Next thing you know, two goof-balls that look like they should have their own cable show are in the house confirming something is definitely amiss. So they call in their boss. Unfortunately, the great Zelda Rubinstein (Poltergeist) passed away, so our expert is played by Lin Shayle. She does an effective job explaining astral projection and the next thing you know all hell has broken loose. Nice work lady.What makes the film work are the characters, the setting, the atmosphere and the really nice build-up of suspense and drama. Sure I think there were some details that could have been handled much better. For instance, the ""other"" brother looks like he is going to be a factor, but instead all of the attention goes to Ty Simpkins as Dalton. Simpkins was seen recently with Russell Crowe in ""The Next 3 Days"". Also, more of the backstory with Hershey and Wilson's childhood could have proved very interesting.Still, I will say if you are a fan of horror films, this one is worth seeing. If nothing else, you will absolutely love the opening credits with their haunted images and smoky font. It's a bit of a fun challenge to find the ""image"" in each of the opening sequences. Just make sure to finish your popcorn before the movie starts. That stuff is too expensive to be tossing across the aisle when you JUMP!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"decent, but nothing special","I read some reviews here before watching this film, and at first glance this movie seemed to be very promising. However I didn't feel very scary while watching this film because the plot was easily predictable and primitive at times.The costumes and special effects were not too sophisticated.What rescued this film from disaster is an incredible acting by Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Ty Simpkins. They are the reason this movie was worth watching, but due to flawed plot I am forced to get 4 point away from this film.The problem with these kind of films is that closed space, i.e. haunted house, was used so many times before in other horror movies, that the more you watch such movies, the more silly they look. I love such films as Paranormal activity, or Blair witch project, as they are original in context of other horror movies. A lot of already seen details are not scary anymore, movie-makers have to think more to get an interesting horror movie now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gives hope for horror,"This movie has restored my hope in the horror genre. It does just about everything right. One thing that particularly impressed me is the fact that they managed to keep it scary while revealing what was haunting them. This movie mixes both terrifying visuals and a haunting story to create a old-style yet unique horror experience. As for comedy, it does have a little bit at the very right moments to act as comic relief. And one scene is quirky yet unsettling at the same time. Insidious isn't like any other modern horror movie, it take queues from the classics while mixing in a modern feel and is a very good combination of the two. Also, the acting is superb. Watch this movie if you are a fan of horror.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
2nd half of the film messes up the movie.,***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***The first half of the film was terrifying I thought the scares were so effective and the suspense was high. The film succeeded in showing enough but not too much and the ghosts looked scary. But as the film shows more of its ghosts and demon it ruined everything the first half worked for. The demon looked awfully like dark maul from Star Wars and having it sharpen it's nails in a room full of dolls and puppets with tip toe through the tulips was so cheesy and by then I lost interest. also when it showed the ghosts more and actually had them fighting it just took the realism and scariness from the film. It just did too much for me I'm the type that likes my movies to have many scares but it can't be too much and this film just went off the rails. The conclusion was suspenseful and I knew right from the end there was going to be a sequel no matter how long they took to announce it. Hopefully it's sequel will be an extended full movie of this films first half.,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious is Truly Insidious,"How many horror movies are actually scary? Three, maybe four? Make that five. Insidious just made the list.James Wan's Insidious is unusual in every sense of the word. It's a 100-minute thrill ride that is a homage to countless horror movies, including Poltergeist and The Shining, and often enough, Insidious succeeds in bringing the scares. Terrifying and entertaining, Insidious threatens its viewer with an insulting amount of jump scares, however it does not matter when the result is this good. Popcorn entertainment may not be this fun again for a while.Insidious' plot may sound contrived, and that's because it is. Leigh Whanell's original script borrows a lot of previous horror greats. Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) are a married couple with three children that have just moved into a new house. Yet not everything is perfect. The protagonists' marriage is tense and cold and there's something deeply unsettling about their home. It isn't long before one of their sons, Dalton, falls from a ladder while he is investigating a noise in the attic and becomes comatose. The house isn't done with the Lamberts yet. And the filmmakers aren't done with us either.Wan shows a clear sense of maturity with Insidious. That is to say that he has stepped it up from the bloody albeit twisty Saw and the boring Dead Silence. Insidious alludes to past horror masterpieces frequently, and after all, isn't copying the sincerest form of flattery? Wan uses all this to his advantage--Insidious becomes creaky, slow carnival ride that never lets up. Wan has clearly learned from the masters; now he's just showing off.As if Insidious' atmospheric tone wasn't enough, Wan has made Insidious a textbook example of horror done right. Lighting is used to create intrigue and mystery; the camera whirls and shakes to give the film an unsettling dissonance. Often Insidious verges on corny, but this is all with good intent. Violins certainly hit the high notes to give the viewer chills.But Insidious is far from perfect. In fact, Wan's film is still marred by many flaws, notably a tonal change about halfway through that nearly wrecks any momentum gained in the quiet first act. It also seems that every two minutes there is a jump scene. This is a something that works at first, but by the end of it, it gets to be a bit much. And while there is some much needed comic relief in some of the scariest parts, it doesn't quite hang together when jokes are made. Furthermore, some elements of the plot are nonsensical, yet all this can be missed when disbelief is suspended.In 2009, Paranormal Activity was hailed as one of the scariest movies ever. It's time for Insidious to get the recognition it deserves. Insidious may not be everyone's type of horror movie, but it's an intelligent, scary, and well-made film designed for people who actually care about watching movies. Although Insidious may take itself way too seriously, it's hard to ignore a film that is so intensely scary as this. There's one scene where Lorraine, played by Barbra Hershey, says, ""I had a dream last night. I was in the house. I was very afraid."" Aren't we all, darling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow buildup ruined.,"I saw this movie at a premiere, and wanted so much to like it. It started to build up quite nicely and then abruptly the movie takes a turn into hacksville, driven by Hamfist and his girl Ms. Boring.Heavy handed introduction of 'comedy', over explanation, in your face 'scares' which insinuate the audience is too stupid to get it on their own, and an other realm which is boring as all get out. Even the supposed super bad guy was laughable because he looks like he was lifted right from another movie. With all they could have done with the theme, and the scare credit they had built up it was such a damned disappointment. The best I can say it was like coffee which had too much sugar in it, the thing that was supposed to accentuate it, was overdone, ruining it.Final Analysis: It did have a few shocks, but they were muted in the end when they let the film go off target. Also, the tagline on the poster gave it all away. That is just poor judgment, and quite sad to see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Those with a deep imagination will be awed and spooked. When the film started I was instantly impressed with the title sequence and the creepy fiddle music. The film starts a little slow, appearing( keyword)to be you're modern cliché ghost/suspense film. It takes a dramatic turn into a demonic science fiction. The film has some truly interesting and terrifying avant-garde displays of demonic and supernatural entities. I felt like some scenes even transcended the movie.

Full of inappropriate cuts and unmotivated acting,"As most of Wan's films this film is annoying me with two things. The cuts, which almost are all ruining the rhythm of the film, and are very unmotivated and incoherent. And the superficial acting. It's difficult to believe in the story when the acting becomes so-so. It's not the actors fault, because they are all good, and have proved the self a lot of times. So then again, it comes down to the instructor, or director, if you wish.The movie is a good try, and gives a couple of good scares, but is made very unbelievable and therefore uninteresting. This is done so much better earlier on in other films, so you have to watch this before the others if you are to have a good experience with it.The strangest thing is that when watching the film, you really think you have seen it before.you wonder if you have seen the film earlier. You haven't. It's just copying. Even Ghostbuster's are recognized here.The film also has trouble in being serious. Another reason for it no to function. When people at scared, it looks like they are action, and then it becomes unwillingly funny.I haven't been too fond of the film I've seen by James Wan. They are all lacking believability and heart. They are just to caricatured to me. Death Sentence, Saw (though it was the first and best) and Stygian. They are all overrated due to this. I certainly want more from my films than this, and I'm actually afraid he'll mess up Fast & Furious 7.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of those fewest horror movies that actually scare without being gory..,"It has been a long time since I got so scared by watching a movie. This movie does exactly that. Scare the sh*t out of you. And when you least expect it to.The plot of the movie is about a family which suffers from the ghastly happenings that follow after their eldest son falls into some kind of a coma. How they struggle and how far they go to get him back is what the story is about. The cast was good, the effects were excellent and the direction of James Wan was fabulous. There are a handful of freaky jump scenes, like I said before, when you expect them the least. Well, this you see in many movies.But what makes this movie different is its atmosphere. The art design was so haunting and bizarre. This movie doesn't make you just scream a few times and leave you. It stays with you. It haunts you. It comes to you before you get fast asleep.All this it does with a little amount of gore(actually, there's really no gore, when you compare it to other contemporary horror films). This is what makes Insidious a darn good thriller. And there is this climax which is utterly unexpected.This movie is a must watch for any one who loves a good horror movie. Also, you will know that this movie is successful when you look around and check your surroundings before going to sleep.And you will.. Trust me.. :D",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary thriller does the job without slasher gore...excellent job by Patrick Wilson...,"Despite several implausible gimmicks in the script about astral flights into The Further, INSIDIOUS does the job of keeping the viewer glued to the screen as the shocking incidents begin to pile up before the surprise ending delivers a final blow. Patrick Wilson's performance gives nothing away with regard to the film's last bit of shock value. He's simply the husband who can't believe all he's expected to deal with when Lin Shaye shows up to rid the family of its cursed monster.One of the more obvious effects is the stark use of music for shock impact, but used in connection with what's happening on screen it does manage to deepen the sense of explosive terror. Leigh Whannell's clever script fairs better in the story's first half up until the arrival of a team of specialists--but it's then that the horror elements reach their peak.***** POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*****It's just that the astral aspects of out of body experience don't carry much weight in the way of credibility and the voyage into darkness toward the last fifteen minutes is a bit over the top by the time it's over.Acting-wise, it's fine with good work from Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty Simpkins--but it's Lin Shaye whom you'll ultimately remember in a very intense and believable performance.For thriller fans, this is not the blood and gore type of thing some may be expecting--but an intelligent thriller that plays its mind games with the viewer in a fascinating way. It's handsomely produced and shows no strain from its more modest budget limitations. I found it an extremely effective thriller.Warning: You'll only be able to enjoy the second half of the film if you're willing to accept the startling premise of The Further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest Movie I've seen in a long time... Halloween worthy!,"I think this movie had a good story-line. Definitely some jumpy moments and freaky stuff going on. I especially loved the add-in of Barbara Hershey (From 1982 THE ENTITY) and the historic references. The only thing that turned me off was the near ending. I was good with the premise of a Happy ending. I could have even dealt with a twist, but I didn't like the choke-kill of a certain character (no spoiler) and that's where it all went down hill... But overall well done and worth the price of admission. Good acting, some hokey laughable stuff, on-the- edge-of-your-seat moments and Ghost Busters to the rescue! A must see on the big screen.

Astrally Project This,"So for three years of my childhood I lived with my French mother and Chinese father in the Andes Mountains under the tutelage of a Peruvian shaman.

Not a ghost to be found here and there's all kinds of comic mishaps involving astral projection and lost souls.I give it a big thumbs up for making me laugh so hard, but my monkey apparently was none-too-pleased and decided to astrally project himself to a Dutch whorehouse instead.What can I say?

A Nutshell Review: Insidious,"Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell have burst into our filmic consciousness having being responsible for Saw that launched an enduring franchise, created a new anti-hero and spawned a frenzy in the torture porn subgenre. Horror films are their forte though Wan did branch off for a remake of Death Wish with Death Sentence, before re-teaming with Whannell behind the camera to come up with Insidious, one of the best jump in your seat horror offering in quite some time.It's easy to pass this off as another quick hack out to earn an easy buck at the box office. For instance, the poster has this creepy child, and creepy children have been staple in films such as The Orphan, the remake of The Omen, and countless others in recent years. The opening credits scene is incredibly cheesy and cheap looking, but it gets better, trust me. Then there's the story about a haunted house, a requisite in many, many horror films, but that's only the tip of the iceberg, as Wan and Whannell intended to lull you in with complacency built up from one's horror film experience, before shoving the motherload of scares right down your throat.Even the building of the premise may make you roll your eyes at the expectation that this may be just another Paranormal Activity, since it tells of the Lambert family, with parents Josn and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne respectively) and their three children Dalton (Ty Simpkins playing Wilson's kid again, collaborating before in Little Children), Foster (Andrew Astor) and another toddler in arms who bawl at the slightest of disturbances in the house. And there are plenty, with the usual moving and slamming doors, a very receptive baby monitor and documentary styled camera movements that reminisces that of Paranormal Activity 2, sans voyeuristic eyes from CCTV and found footage.You won't be faulted if you had suspicions that this film took a leaf from Paranormal Activity and combined it with your classic haunted house spooks, but here's where Whannell, who also starred in this film as a paranormal geek alongside Angus Sampson, upped the ante despite having to have the family move house, and came up with a tale that's best kept under wraps to retain the surprises that come along the way, although some may find fault with his rather geeky and detailed explanation through the medium Elise (Lin Shaye), engaged by Josh's mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) that links up with Josh's own repressed past.But as far as scaring the audience goes, Insidious scores top marks. Wan has a knack for designing his scary pieces with aplomb to jump scare even the most jaded of horror film goers, and the best part is, you're primed to expect something to happen, and they do, without too many time wasting red herrings. Wan gives what an audience will expect, and does so without pulling his punches, so much so that it's somewhat of a thrill ride as we journey with the characters to make sense of what's happening. The beauty comes from the simplicity of the ghoul design, clichéd some may be even, and one red faced demon that looked very much like Darth Maul. But they did their job in old school like fashion, complete with a very in your face, scratchy soundtrack that did half the job since this film would not have worked without Joseph Bishara's violin-centric score.Costing only 1.5 million dollars to make and grossing over 50 million to date, Insidious just goes to show how profitable horror films can be, where there's no need for fancy graphical effects, but reliance on simple practical ones to send chills up your spine. If it's a good scare in the cinemas you're after, then Insidious serves that up by the bucketloads without insulting your intelligence. Stay right through to the end credits for one final hurrah. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Insidious,"Now if there is one thing that freaks me out most in movies it is horrors that involve children in any way. So when I sat down to watch a movie from the guys and gals that have given us Paranormal Activity revolving around the story of a possessed child, well lets just say I had my diaper at the ready!Insidious follows a textbook family, the parents- Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) that have it all as they move into their new suburban house with their 3 beautiful children. However all is not as it seems as one of their sons, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), after slipping off a ladder while exploring in the attic falls into a coma. Strange things then begin to happen as objects move, mysterious voices are heard and you catch things in the corner of your eye. After this activity drives them from their new home they enlist the help of a paranormal psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) and the horrifying truth becomes evident. It is not the house but Dalton that is haunted!As with most horror movies, I find they only tend to scare me until I know what I'm up against ie. keep the monster hidden and let the suspense/not knowing get me grabbing for my cushion. This movie was similar in that respect with the majority of the scares coming in the first two thirds before it began to fall away slightly. This was more than enough though and will give you the jumps that you are looking for if you decide to go and see it.Considering what the trailer gives us, I was quite surprised that it took so long to get to the realisation that it was in fact the boy that was possessed rather than where they were living. It is a good 50 minutes to an hour before this is realised which irked me somewhat.The inclusion of the two bickering paranormal activity assistants was a well thought out idea as it gave a break from trying to scare you, injecting a bit of comedy into the fray and enabled the audience to be lulled into a more relaxed state so that when the next scare came you were off guard and less than ready for it.Apart from the scary evil entities, horrors are made or broken by the music or lack thereof that accompanies the suspense and the cinematography. Insidious does not disappoint. The music leads to the creation of an intense tension that stays with you throughout most of the movie and lingers after it finishes and the cinematography is also top notch.Insidious does serve up moments of actual horror that had me keeping an eye out for anything out of the ordinary several hours after the film had finished. It is a far cry from James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer) other collaborations of the Saw series and despite using a tried and tested framework, they made the movie original. It will probably be one of the better horror movies that's released this year but then again, I doubt there will be much competition.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
cheap thrills,"Insidious is a typical b-product from the scary movie genre. Its story is a collection of clichés from the Japanese horror wave of the past decade and the American remakes thereof. Haunted house et cetera.It is a sure sign of poor writing skills when a movie has characters sitting around explaining the plot for minutes on end, and this movie has a lot of that. An awful lot. This is exacerbated by the fact that the audience arrives at every major conclusion about 30 minutes before the characters do, and the predictability of the plot should even make the end quite unsurprising for the average viewer.The dismal and dreary visual style is actually not a bad choice for the subject and some of the photography was quite agreeable, but the editing and overall feel of it seemed a bit much like a television production. The acting was below average and the two geeks were nice distraction though they were clearly under-used.Due to the total lack of atmosphere, Insidious relies heavily on the over-use of cheap thrills like creaking doors, creepy or sudden music or noises and suddenly appearing ghosts and demons. Just like the haunted house at the local funfair. Yes, it will scare you for a moment, but you will call it a rip-off at the exit nonetheless. Some scenes that were clearly meant to provide suspense were even involuntary funny and laughed at by the audience.The only thing that really scared me is that so many users proved to have obviously never seen a really good movie by rating this stinker at an insane 7.0 and nearly half a million people like it on facebook. I personally rate this movie a miserable failure.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Go see this movie!!,"I was pleasantly surprised throughout most of this movie. Basically, surprised at all the jumps and screams from the audience. And the ones coming from myself as well! I thought this film was an extremely fun scary movie to watch. If you like scary thrills and jumping out of your seat, then this movie is for you! I give it ten stars because I thought it had a good plot, with many surprises and twists. It is definitely not just your average gory slasher film. That is hard to find these days. It had substance, as well as scare. And I think it would be great to watch a few more times. And I probably could still not see the scary parts coming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Liked first of half better the second half!,"I really liked the first half of movie.There were two scene that made me jump in the movie and there were some really good tense and creepy scene.but half way into movie, i didn't like were the story went, (i don't what to say anything as i don't what to ruin it for anyone who not seen it,)It kinda of borrows a lot of really good old horror movie that Start with the letter P.For me it's picks up just near the end of the movie again, which I did not see coming at all, really liked that scene.The acting was really good from most of the cast!6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
1hr 45mins of my life I will never get back.,"I watched this film the other day after reading reviews on here. They told me it's really scary and an awesome film blah blah blah. I've wanted to watch a movie that would actually scare me for absolutely ages so was looking forward to this one. Well...I SO should not have bothered I mean honestly this film looked like it was made by low budget teen directors in the 1990's. The 'deamon' looked like a mask you would see kids wearing on Halloween, the 'ghosts' looked like ill people and the acting was absolutely awful. Not to mention the poor camera work and bad effects. It's like a bad remake of poltergeist and that wasn't even a great film!!HONESTLY.... DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY HORROR FILMSWATCH IT IF YOU ENJOY CHEAP AWFUL CRAP!!Hope you guys listen to this review...the film annoyed me so much I signed up just to write this!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good old fashion horror,The Lambert family has moved into a house with a dark spirit lurking within. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) have 3 kids. Their boy Dalton has an accident falling through a ladder in the attic. He hits his head and falls into a mysterious coma overnight. Three months later and he is back home but still in a coma. There are strange voices over the baby monitor. The younger boy Foster is scared of Dalton walking around late at night. Strange things keep happening. They move but the haunting follows them to the new house. Grandma Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey) brings in Specs and Tucker and Elise to find the cause.This is a nice solid little horror using all the classic haunted house effects and possession/ghost story elements. It is a lot of old school filmmaking from horror specialist director James Wan. The performance are all solid anchored by Rose Byrne who plays a compelling young mother. The characters are certainly real enough that I didn't ask why they don't just move. These people actually moved. This is good old fashion horror.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary-ish movie,"I've waited a few weeks for my local multiplex (Brighton) to show a movie that wasn't aimed at pre-teens, and along comes INSIDIOUS, which pre-teens (who'll have to wait for the DVD) will probably enjoy more than I did, since it's about as scary as a good episode of DR WHO.INSIDIOUS is a mish-mash of ingredients: a bit of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, a bit of AMITYVILLE HORROR, a bigger bit of THE EXORCIST and a whole lot of POLTERGEIST. The mixture is fairly well brewed with quite a few make-you-jump moments and adequate performances (though Barbara Hershey is wasted in a thin role and the lady medium reminded me more than somewhat of the late Queen Mum!). The lighting inside the two Haunted Houses is almost as dim before the weird stuff starts as after, and the glimpses of the 'Further' (the Afterlife has been re-branded) are a bit like the Ghost Train at a funfair, with things jumping out of near total darkness at the rider/viewer.It's a relief to have a horror flick that doesn't rely on gross-out gore, but this is only a scary-ish movie. It doesn't hold a (black) candle to Sam Raimi's DRAG ME TO HELL.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Bad Knockoff of Spielberg's POLTERGEIST,"It is very clear that the writer of this film had seen Steven Spielberg's classic horror film Poltergeist because this entire film pulls whole cloth elements from Poltergeist and reworks it to a bastardized version. It is as if this film is written and directed by high school kids who saw Poltergeist and thought it would be cool to make their homage to it with their simplistic understanding of how to create suspense and horror.For these Insidious writer/director horror to them is a person wearing scary makeup and sudden loud noises...nothing more. Insidious wants to be Poltergiest but ends up doing everything wrong. And its embarrassing to watch.To no surprise after finding out that this film was made by the people behind Paranormal Activity and Saw i knew right away one would have to check their brain at the door.For me, i can look by bad acting, poor effects, and amateur-hour directing but if the underlying script is terrible then i am going to bash it. And this my friends is serious high school play writing/directing -- the kind of mess where parents go, sit in the audience and no matter how crappy it is you end up clapping and going home half asleep and thinking about other things.To be fair and give you an idea of what horror films i like:Jaws - Poltergeist - American Werewolf in London - Exorcist - Frailty - Tale of two Sisters (foreign film)It's a small list but they are considered classics by critics and viewers alike (check IMDb's ratings for each). They are so loved because each tells a story in a very realistic way and not looking to cheap tricks for scare value. It's professional storytelling.I'd love to discuss Insidious in a scene by scene way as to what a disaster the thing is but i doubt anyone will read my review outside of seeing my rating of it. 1/10...I'd rate this as UNWATCHABLE and spit but IMDb wont let me.If you are an aspiring screenwriter then watch this film and learn what exactly NOT to do.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A masterpiece,This has to be one of the greatest supernatural haunting movies in the last twenty years.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
not bad for quick fright ;),"Insidious is weird D:, its not what I would call scary, but the maker of paranormal activity has done thyself proud for jumpy bits, good plot and a lot of typical horror features, I would give it 7/10as a negative the piano sound upon the jumps is annoying and if anything to loud, the plot is also very predictable but with a nice twist at the end, although sadly also predictable. But the camera work and lightning create and excellent effect of a horror genre, and the classic horror build up is seen throughout this movieThe story is unique and astral projection is not often visited within movies, I would recommended seeing this movie as it is worth a watch even with its few flaws hence my generous rating of 7/10, good job.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good entertainment,"The Exorcist and Poltergeist are obviously films which have burrowed themselves into the minds of Wan and Whannell, and they have been reborn here into one chilling amalgamation, spurred on by a jarring, fractious musical score by Joseph Bishara, and a memorable performance by Lin Shaye, who plays a maternal but forceful spiritual medium with just the right tone and energy.But Insidious also proves itself to be a genuine entry in the demonic possession film canon. A unique séance sequence is both berserk and entertaining, while the use of astral projection is a feature rarely used in horror movies, and perhaps for good reason, with the third act descending into silliness akin to a ghost ride set in an alternate dimension.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Does what it says...but not much more.,"The movie starts off with a believable story line, albeit copied mostly from nearly every new horror film made these days (scary house etc). There are some genuinely jumpy bits, where the main success of these are down to the camera work, directing and music rather then the use of outlandish special effects (which i prefer).However the plot takes a completely far-fetched turn that i was hoping wasn't going to be the answer and that kinda ruined it for me.. However there is a a nice twist at the end that brought the rating back up a little bit..I would recommend it for watching it with your girlfriend if you are after an 'easy scare', but not if you are expecting a believable story line.Starts Well, ends well, just a few dodgy bits that are hard to swallow. Not bad by any accounts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Should be in the list of TOP HORROR MOVIES..,"One of the best horror thriller horror horror breathtaking breathtaking thriller movie with perfect sound tracks matched with sudden ghost appearances..The creators of Saw and Paranormal Activity have joined forces on this silly horror – which is good for a handful of jumps and guilty giggles before it quickly reaches for the slipshod, hokey contrivances you don't expect until number 2 or 3 in the franchise..You have to pity poor Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, playing the parents of a young family; they must keep straight, serious actor faces while trapped in a haunted house movie, rejiggered into a possessed kid movie when their son falls into a coma – his soul trapped in a nether realm. Cue a cast of undead tortured souls: creepy twins; an old lady veiled in granny-net curtains; a demon luridly covered in black and red face paint like a juggler on ketamine at a rave, most preposterous and unterrifying of the lot. Perhaps aware that they have a largely scare-free experience on their hands, the film-makers insert a comedy sideshow: a psychic who is more Avon lady than exorcist, accompanied by two geeky assistants..",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A genuinely scary horror film,"how often does a film come along that is Actually scary? so many films try, yet all they end up offering is a couple of jumps and maybe a bit of gore. So films now days maybe 'jumpy' and disgusting, making you want to turn your head away, but it's not the same as being actually scared.There have been moments, the end of 'the ring' (original) being a stand out moment. But Insidious really did do the job.OK i was alone, at night, with the lights out. Which helps. but the first hour of the film might well be my favourite hour of horror film ever. it's a shame it kind of turns in a circus (although an extremely frightening one) towards the end, it all of a sudden became like a weird comedy.But i think this is the intention. It's everything i had hoped 'drag me to hell' would be, straight out of the 80's, as cheesy as ever, but very scary.watch this film if you like horror films and have been looking for one to scare you as much as 'nightmare on elm street' did when you were a child. (or maybe that's just me).Don't take it too serious tho, you MIGHT find a few holes in the plot...",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Deleciously Terrifying!!  At 35 years old, I'm afraid of the dark again!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO SEE IN THE THEATER!!","I am an avid fan of horror/ghost films. When I was 5 years old my father took me to see Poltergeist in the theater. That movie stirred fears in me that took decades to quell (remember, I was 5). Poltergeist created a genuine love for the genre but also very high bar for other movies to reach. In other words, a movie has to offer some truly shocking and creepy, unsettling moments to take home with me when the movie is over for me to even remember it,With that being said, this movie will haunt me for years, and that says A lot. I went to see the Sunday matinée (nearly empty theater adds to the creepiness), and I was COMPLETELY FLOORED by the amount of hair raising, spine-tingeing, jumping-out-of-my-own-skin moments that this movie packed. THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING!!I have seen most, if not all of the acclaimed horror flicks, Nightmare on Elm, Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Ring, Paranormal Entity/Activity, Amityville, and many,many,many more. NONE OF THEM CAME CLOSE TO DELIVERING LIKE THIS MOVIE DID!!!!! Poltergeist came on at a distant 2nd place tied with the Ring and maybe the Grudge.I would do this movie an injustice by telling you why I rated it 9 out of 10. See it for yourself and make your own judgement. If you like a good scare, you won't be disappointed.IF YOU WANT A CREEPY MOVIE THAT YOU WILL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME TO COME, AND THAT WILL KEEP YOU GLANCING IN THE SHADOWS FOR WHAT MAY BE LURKING, THIS IS THE MOVIE TO SEE!!!!This is one you will not walk away from empty handed, you might just find those silly childhood fears reemerging in your subconscious. That's what I've been looking for for many years, and I finally found the key to that lock with INSIDIOUS.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worth a watch,"Expecting an old fashion 'style' haunted house movie and that's what the first half was - great suspense, fabulous score and lots of 'jumpy' moments. The second half becomes more 'fantasy' horror with ghouls more than ghosts but in places it's just as scary playing to fears with dolls and puppets. There are also a few 'nods' to Saw as this film shares James Wan as director so look out for those. The end is probably a little bit drawn out (maybe 10 minutes longer than necessary) but the final scene is actually quite good. I didn't leave feeling disappointed although I would've preferred more 'haunted' and less 'demons'. The performances were good and solid, particularly from Patrick Wilson (underrated in my opinion) and Rose Byrne as well as the from the kids. It's worth a watch, and was pretty well received from the 3 out of 4 of us who went today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent Chiller.,"When their young son is injured in a fall, mysterious and terrifying events start to happen to a young family...Horror films, especially recent films from America have become obsessed with violence and gore. The so-called 'torture-porn' horror. There is also an obsession with remaking or 're-booting' films to try and make money from the horror film franchises, like the recent Nightmare On Elm Street. However, what Insidious proves, is that by writing something clever and serious, you can make a new and scary horror film.The key to the success of Insidious is that on the whole the cast play it straight. The cast led by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are all good. It helps that the script, written by Leigh Whannell, while in truth not the most original, taking elements from films such as Poltergeist, it does enough with these elements to work on it's on level. It also helps having James Wan directing. Although still best known for making the first (and best) Saw film, he has made some interesting films since, Death Sentence being one, and Dead Silence which has a similar feel to Insidious.While Wan may not be a high profile director, he does an excellent job here. He creates an atmosphere of tension throughout, including some excellent scares in daylight, a rare feat indeed! And while he does use the 'jump' scare technique, it works very well. Even at the climax of the film, which is a little predictable, he stages a chilling ending.There are faults. The ending does go a bit overboard, loosening the tension created up till that point, and a couple of paranormal investigators bring some unwanted comic relief.But these are minor issues. Whannell and Wan have created a truly unsettling horror film, and one that pretty much succeeds on every level. It takes a lot to scare me when I go see a film. The only ones that can, are those that create the right atmosphere. Most films don't manage that. This does easily. And it did scare me.This is easily one of the best recent horror films I've seen and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys being scared.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Don't be overly cynical, just enjoy the really scary ride","I've anticipated this movie for a few months now. And despite that it has a unoriginal storyline and is at times even a little corny (the opening credits will make you think of a lame Haunted House ride) it's the best horror movie I've seen since Paranormal Activity.This is not because of its originality, because frankly: it is not. Actually, it's the unoriginality that makes this a very scary movie. It uses tested scare tactics to create a suspenseful atmosphere and a few body-jolting moments without it being ridiculous overdone like in Drag me to Hell. I was slightly disappointed that the ending spun a little out of control, but it couldn't bother me so much that I thought of it as a bad movie afterwards. Basically I expected a scary movie, I got a terrifying one. What more can you ask for?It's very easy to dismiss this movie as one with a flimsy storyline or just plain ridiculous. But then you would miss the point of this film. It's not meant to have a great storyline. It's not meant to be original. It's just meant to scare the crap out of you for a (very, very) long hour and a half. And on that last point, it solidly delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't waste your time and money!!,"How much can you hate a movie?Well let me tell you. I went out of my way to register with IMDb to make my protest me knowSimply put, Insidious is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I could not verify this however, I'm sure all the reviewers that have submitted comments for this film were written by people who have not actually watched this movie!I wish I could reclaim back 90 mins of my life, not to mention a refund for hard earned money that was thrown away on this so called 'scary movie'.If you want a fright equivalent to Insidious , just switch of the lights in your house and play loud music with the occasional hysterical scream in the background (that your 5 year could supply at no cost.) I guarantee the experience will be far more likely to scare you than this movie.Be warned. You will hate yourself for watching this crud, save your money and wait for the Sky+ rerun in 3 months.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A chilling thriller set to scare!,"I had quite low expectations for this film, as I heard some reviews claim to be too low-budget for a good scare film. However, I was interested as it was produced from the same people who produced and helped make Paranormal Activity and Saw. I then watched it with two friends, and we were astounded. From the very start there was little things, little hints that lead to the climax.I think it has an interesting story, as it starts off like Paranormal Activity, became the Exorcist somewhat and then transformed into Poltergeist. There were continuous situations that made me jump and eerie happenings that made me psychologically... more aware. I strongly advise you to see it, but not alone!!! There are twists and turns that present new light on the horror genre. I think that Insidious will be the start of a brand new type of sub-genre in horror!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not scary, funny at times, lame storyline","5.5/10Darn, this movie was not scary. I read into all the good reviews here and was biting my nails as the movie began. I was so tensed and stressed out even before it began. I watch horror movies all the time. With regards to this movie, if you are 8 years old you will be scared no doubt, but not for adults. And I even saw a bunch of 8 yr olds walk into the theater and then I knew something wasn't right. It was more like taking your kids to the carnival to see some scary looking clowns. My husband and I were bored half way through, we just wanted it to be over. The script started out pretty well but the writer went overboard. In this day and age no soul would believe the things which the folks in this movie believed. There's got to be a decent scientific explanation to everything, you can't just close your eyes and vanish into the 'Further'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spiders Among Spider Rings,"Hollywood horror films draw from a grab bag of assorted Halloween party favors, but amidst all the cheap plastic spider rings, director James Wan inserts a tarantula or two for good measure. His latest, ""Insidious,"" takes a see-what-sticks approach that can sometimes be as frustrating as it is refreshing, but in a cinematic climate where scary movies are becoming an increasingly on-rails experience, every goose bump is worth its weight in gold (and I imagine it adds up).""Insidious"" has plenty of genuinely chilling moments, and makes better than average use of the oft maligned ""jump scare."" The technique doesn't always deliver the desired impact, but that such instances are uneven in effectiveness is in a way an incredible asset. Emotionally, we're on our toes. Wan puts convention in a blender and the audience is often left reeling from the topsy-turvy inertia. That familiar horror guardrail is gone and we're left groping in the dark.Taking a page from Sam Raimi (not to mention title work more than a little reminiscent of his 2009 flick ""Drag Me to Hell""), Wan keeps us off-balance with unpredictable emotionality. Not every bizzaro changeup he pitches lands squarely in the strike zone—a bumbling pair of paranormal investigators falls flat on the comedy front—but by constantly upsetting our expectations, ""Insidious"" picks a cerebral scab and burrows under our skin. A particularly inspired and disorienting soundtrack choice is the use of Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips,"" proving perhaps definitively that nothing is more terrifying than a ukulele.Little unconventional details help too, and with credit to ""Saw"" screen writing veteran Leigh Whannell, ""Insidious"" makes some subtly interesting choices. For once, our parental protagonists, Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne), are not the progenitors of an only child. Creepy kids are a genre staple, but by diffusing that cliché with siblings, Whannell opens himself to some less-traveled roads. Unfortunately, one of his most glaring oversights is underplaying that idea; in the inferior second half of the film, the other offspring essentially disappear.Or take, for instance, the critic's ace-in-the-hole: ""Why don't they just leave the house?"" Like in ""Paranormal Activity,"" Whannell explicitly explains that the demonic presence is attached to his characters rather than their homestead, but they hightail it out of there all the same. I can't immediately recall another example of haunted protagonists rationally raising stakes in the middle of the second act.It may seem insignificant, but it makes a big difference in a genre as delicate as horror, where the element of surprise is everything. If ""Insidious"" were comprised entirely of offbeat innovations, it would be a perfect film. But just as often, Whannell lets convention get the better of him, or he piles on too many sub-genres—what starts off in ""Poltergeist"" country winds up closer to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" if you can imagine that. The disparate elements clash and complement each other in equal measure.Spearheaded by Wan and Whannell, the ""Saw"" franchise pushed horror in a new direction. ""Insidious"" nudges it back. Inspired by classic seventies spook-outs, the filmmakers crafted what feels like Hollywood's most synonymous effort in years, imperfect though it may be. There are no hidden camera gimmicks, and absent is the also oft maligned ""torture porn"" the pair popularized eight years prior. Instead, expect to be treated to the unexpected. True, the beats and ""Boos!"" are familiar as can be, but when ""Insidious"" jumps the rails, it's one hell of a ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"W O W- I am petrified,","Normally, there are very few horror movies that can really scare and manipulate my mind, and if so I seem to get over it pretty quickly. If you are like me, and really think Hollywood's Horror category cannot scare the pants off you- you need to see this.From the very beginning of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. From then on couldn't eat my popcorn for the next hour and a bit I was petrified.The whole storyline was pretty standard horror, but those guys really put all their work into making it more than the plot. Without the blood and gore (which I completely expected from the director of Saw), it cut to the sheer terror that the idea of paranormal ""things"" can reach us.It was an absolutely brilliant horror, which still stays with me now (the day after) when opening my cupboards. Outstanding.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
'INSIDIOUS' is insistent horror fun!,"'INSIDIOUS': Four Stars (Out of Five)The team that brought us the original 'SAW' once again team up to bring us this creative low budget shocker. James Wan (a member of the unofficial 'Splat Pack'; a grouping of the best of modern horror filmmakers) directs and Leigh Whannell writes this supernatural thriller. The film stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Lin Shaye, Angus Sampson and Whannell (in a rare comedic turn) and was made for a mere $800,000! Which goes to show what you can really do with a limited budget given a lot of passion and creativity. The film is a good old fashioned creepy ghost thriller, sort of like a modern variation on 'POLTERGEIST' in many ways.'INSIDIOUS' tells the tale of the Lambert family, who recently moved into a new house. Dalton Lambert (Simpkins) is one of two brothers who falls into a coma early on in the film, for unknown reasons. His mother Renai (Byrne) keeps seeing creepy images in the house and believes it's haunted. She also thinks the things she's seeing are after her son. Her husband Josh (Wilson) is disbelieving and hides from the family's problems by staying late at the school where he works. He eventually gives in and hires a supernatural expert (Shaye) who discovers something more terrifying than either had imagined.The film, like I said, is just a good old fashioned spook fest. What Wan and Whannell pull off on such a low budget is amazing. There's no CGI here just classic horror gimmicks; clever camera motion, lighting and creepy music. They also do so with little to no blood or gore. This is their first PG-13 effort and it's just as creepy and effective as their other films. I enjoyed this much more than either of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' flicks. The acting is adequate, the screenplay well polished (including some pretty humorous moments) and the directing top notch. If you like this sort of film you definitely won't be disappointed.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Save ur money unless you want to see cheap thrills,"I have no idea what the big deal is with this movie? I mean this was the funniest horror movie I have ever seen. I was laughing the whole time!

It is filled with cheap acting, cheap thrills and the music is basically someone banging on a piano every time there is some monster or creature behind someone or staring at someone.. felt like a rip off of paranormal activity, poltergeist and exorcist in one. The one thing I can't figure out was this movie supposed to really be horror and scary or a comedy? Because if its comedy then I can accept it, but if this is supposed to be scary, man whoever made this movie needs to watch some real movies in that genre. What were they thinking?

"When a real horror turns into ""Ninja Turtles""","Maybe the title of my review is an exaggeration but it's really how I felt after watching this film.It starts very climatic and the story is simple yet solid. ""Solid"" is a good word to describe the first half of the film. It may resemble many other horrors from the past, but it did well in telling its own story at its own pace. Maybe it wasn't an icon to ""the most scary is what you don't see"" philosophy but it did well. Unfortunately something broke down along the way...Such a great potential to make a good horror in the era of torture porn trash thrown away by the creators that gave up to the urge ""to show more"". Not only they shown too much, they can't even show it properly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nightmarish Chiller.,"The first half of the film is a deeply unsettling experience, the film's particular strength is in its juxtaposing mundanity with the supernatural, including some of the most nightmarish images ever seen. Sadly, the plot fizzles out quite early on to be replaced by ineffective set pieces and while the performances are on the whole good later events lose credibility, at times seeming comical.The scares are mostly effective and although the plot does not hold up to later scrutiny it is commendable the film does not rely on gore to supply the shocks.Much to recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It is what it is!,"If you go into this movie expecting to watch a great work of art you are going to have a bad time. If you go into the movie, expecting it for what it is then you will enjoy it and get a few scares along the way.The movies main issue is that it does not do enough to develop the story line as far as ""why this is happening"" goes.As a parent I also find horror movies dealing with children to be a lot scarier then a typical horror movie. It's the kind of movie that's going to make you want to check in on the kids before you try and go to bed!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Poltergeist remade as a horror film?,"A family moving into a new house are disturbed by strange things happening. When their son falls into a coma they need to look for help from paranormal investigation team.That short synopsis makes this film sound like Poltergeist and it's hard to avoid the comparison. But Poltergeist was big flashy special effects extravaganza and this film is much more subtle. The scares come the from mysterious noises and the sudden appearance of things such as a face at a window and bloody hand-prints on sheets. My biggest jump scare came from the appearance of a red-faced demon just behind Patrick Wilson's headI thought the film was very good at building up the tension through the first two-thirds of the film. Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson really were very convincing as the desperate parents trying to get help for their son. Lin Shaye was lot less bizarre as the medium brought into to help than the unearthly Zelda Rubenstein in Poltergeist, at least she was until she put a strange gas mask to talk to spirits. Perhaps the rush of events just left no room for the quiet tension that was so effective earlier and the last third of the film was a bit of let-down. Despite that is still a very good film and I think it is better than Poltergeist, especially as horror film.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Started out a bit slow but wow, had me tensed up all to the end","Unlike what seems like most of the reviews are from, I'm not a movie critic or ""self appointed"" movie expert and I'm not going to use big words to sound all educated and knowledgeable(except this one)...I just wanna let everyone know it's a pretty good horror movie, and it's been a long time since I've seen one as scary.Anyways, I took my girlfriend to watch this and it did start out very slow and had me a bit worried that I picked a movie that might suck. But once it picked up(about 20 mins in) it didn't me down.Scary as hell, that's pretty much all all I have to say. Only thing I would call a ""complaint"" is that the ghost's near the end seemed a bit ""haunted house"" or not very scary at times haha. But that's only at certain times. Most of the time, I was jumping left and right.A lot of the popups were obvious but holy crap, I still jumped haha.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good fun but not very scary,"I was expecting to be absolutely terrified by this film after reading many of the reviews on here. I am a huge horror fan and love to be scared (love eerie films such as the original Grudge, The Ring, The Others, Drag Me to Hell) and love being made to jump, so from that point of view I was very disappointed by this film.I actually found the film pretty enjoyable, good fun and very amusing but not sure that was entirely the intention of the film makers... The acting was fairly ropey, especially from Patrick Wilson who I've not seen in anything else so not sure if he's a sound actor usually?? I love Rose Byrne and she certainly did her best with the material, but why do characters in horror films always act in such an unrealistic and nonsensical way??!! Would you be able to nod off to sleep quite happily on your own the night after witnessing very obvious signs of a haunting in your house?? I sure wouldn't!!My husband and I are normally both very jumpy but neither of us jumped very much at all during this film. I did feel that the tension was built up quite well and loved the music but felt that the scares never really came to anything!! Maybe if I'd watched it at home on my own at night it would've seemed scary, but in the cinema surrounded by other people I wasn't remotely scared! I thought the story line was fairly good and it did maintain my interest but it just wasn't the scare fest I thought it would be!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not for ""slasher"" fans...But a SUPERB SPOOKFEST!!","This is certainly not for horror fans of the slasher genre as there is no gore in this movie, and for this reason a lot of horror fans have unfortunately slated this otherwise superb film! As a horror fan myself for nearly 40 years I was pleasantly surprised by this genuinely creepy and sometimes spooky sinister movie. Yes! it has a lot of idea's that have worked for some of the classics like Poltergeist, but I feel it moulds them together to deliver an excellent adrenalin fuelled ride for those of us who enjoy a refreshing take of a modern day horror movie (sadly there ain't too many these days that don't resort to buckets of tomato sauce and various body parts rejected from the butchers or fishmongers!) This is one of the very few movies that does not rely on the said stuff in brackets to bring a racing pulse and sweaty palms...well for me anyway! I found myself creep ed out in such a way it was almost too compelling to watch in parts. So if you like a creepy movie that is NOT a slash-fest then this maybe the film for you. Just turn the light off. Light a few candles and enjoy. As a side note (and I noticed some others mentioned this too) the overly noisy bangs in the film, meant to make you jump, do get annoying. This is my only criticism. But most films these days (modern ones) rely on overly noisy bangs, do they not? Also I think the PG 13 rating is spot on. Younger children would be a little too freaked by this I think. But because of its no gore value older children may enjoy this too. All in all I feel this will appeal to real ""old school"" horror fans like myself who were brought up on Hammer Horror...the only thing missing was a Hammer babe! The mum in this is a little too thin for that title, but overall I loved this movie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
just plain awful,"I sat through this awful movie last night and regret it.The acting was woeful (even the great Rose Byrne and Barbra Hershey couldn't save it). The suspense was non existent and I just couldn't get into the movie. There was no explanation of why the child was in a coma. They tried to explain it toward the end (badly) but by then, you just didn't care.The story line was just a cheap, bad rip off of Poltergeist. It was just plain dumb. It could have been better developed but the result is an epic fail.Don't waste your time with this rubbish. If you want to see something better, see the original Poltergeist. If you are a fan of Wan and Whannell, stick with SAW.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stylistically scary and a bit eccentric,"I've been looking for reviews on here and was surprised at how split the opinions are. People either seem to love it or hate it. For one thing, when you combine the people from Saw and Paranormal Activity, you are likely to have an audience that does not overlap. I personally only really liked the first Saw and I love both PA's. I felt that Saw 2+ became more like Final Destination where each sequel only seemed to push boundaries and create gruesome situations instead of providing a solid plot line. Therefore, I feel that may be part of the rift between opinions.That said, I'll share mine. I was very surprised with this movie. Like many other people said, I thought it would be the type where you could predict everything and always be ready for what's coming. I'm not a screamer and only really cringe at detailed gore, but this movie kept me uneasy until the end. There are moments of comic relief where you can relax momentarily, but not for long.I feel that's worth mentioning. Many people complain that it tries to be too funny at times or over the top. From the title card, it gave me the feeling of a Dario Argento flick, more like his older ones such as Suspiria. I personally find that refreshing. But what I really want to say is that I think this movie includes these moments to show that it's not taking itself too seriously. Not to say it is not scary, but I think it acknowledges that it's a bit humorous and eccentric at times. To me, the eccentricity of some of the characters in the movie, while some may call it cheesy, adds a dose of madness. A character like Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees are straight up scary. But a character like Freddy Krueger is more eccentric and maniacal. Not to say characters in this movie are like Freddy, but insofar as that Freddy is eccentrically scary. His madness is what makes him so scary and I feel characters in this movies possess that same quality. I feel it might be fair to compare them to the style of the characters from Thir13een Ghosts as well.I feel like this movie took a unique idea and executed it well. There were some parts I wasn't sure they could pull off, but I have to say, especially near the end I feel they pulled it off. There were parts that probably could have been progressed further or deeper, but it's not to the point that it ruins the movie for me. I also think the ending has a classic Argento feeling to it and contributes to what I said about it not taking itself too seriously. If you're going to like this movie, you'll likely still be creeped out at the end.I really liked this movie, you may or may not. It depends on what you are willing to accept and what you consider to be scary. I especially am not impressed with movies that over-gore just to show off their great effects, so for this movie being a PG-13, I feel it managed a very high creep-factor without unnecessary gore.Lastly a bit of advice: if you're the type that lingers after the credits...",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
laughable,"I'm really surprised to see this film is averaging 7.2 at the moment. The film took an eternity to actually get into with the opening 30 minutes of the film a constant cycle of the mundane daily routine of the family affected. The concept of the film doesn't work and seems like a cheesy attempt of a children's bedtime horror. I waited an eternity for a proper scary moment, but it completely failed to deliver this. It also seemed to combine pieces of other films most notably the 'fire demon' seeming Freddie Krugeresque and the start of the film seeming liking paranormal activity. Acting is poor, concept is poor, dialogue is poor. Film is a bore from start to finish. If you want a scary film avoid this at all costs..",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious mostly works,"James Wan's Insidious is an oddly disjointed film. The first half is an extremely successful haunted house fright-fest, while the second half is an incredibly dense and illogical slog. In any horror film of this type, originality is not usually what you're going to get, and you don't here either. What you can hope for however is that the tried-and-true methods of creeping the audience out will be performed expertly, which, for the most part, the filmmakers manage to do. This is a composed and subdued horror film that relies on what you don't see as much as what you do to scare you. Surprising given that it's brought to us by the screenwriter and director of Saw. Read my full review at: http://themuddoctor.blogspot.com/2011/09/insidious.html",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Entertaining but brings up its own questions,"Although director James Wan hasn't made multiple horror movies, his productions usually end being the next box office grab. Not only did he ignite the Saw (2004) franchise, but he also began his second franchise here with this film. It's not a surprise that this happened because of how much of an innate talent Wan has for making horror films. At first his focus was on insane people, then ghosts and now demons. The trend just keeps getting more supernatural. The story depicted is about a husband and wife that end up seeing their son go into a coma. As time goes on however, they begin to also notice strange events going on as well that for some reason deal with their sleeping son.As a narrative, the story is very solid. Leigh Whannell's writing not only makes its audience invest themselves in the characters but also in the new universe (The Further) that is given as well. Unfortunately, there is one drawback and that is, of which this new dimension, The Further is explained. Who discovered this dimension? How does one acquire the ability to enter and leave this particular area? These kinds of questions are rather significant when this specific plot point is the backbone of the story. Besides this, the writing is captivating enough that viewers may not have these questions on the tip of their tongues. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both portray their characters nicely and develop off of each other from time to time. Ty Simpkins plays the child that is in the coma. Although Simpkins does not take part in much of dialog, his part is still a scary position to be in and when he does speak, he shows he can act.The rest of the supporting cast is noteworthy too, of which writer Leigh Whannell is apart of. Along with him are Angus Sampson, Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye who all try to help the couple get their son to good health. The visual aspects to the film also worked in its favor. John R. Leonetti's cinematography helped with the atmosphere of the situation and definitely made good use of his visual style when entering The Further realm. Leonetti also had David M. Brewer work with him. My guess is since Brewer does not have many theatrical releases under his belt, Leonetti was giving him some professional advice and experience. The special/practical effects and horror elements to the film blend nicely too. James Wan also seems to be backpedaling when it comes to gore. Ever since Saw (2004), his other directorial films contain less and less blood. For gorehounds, they will be disappointed but gore isn't always needed to make these kinds of movies scary.The scariest thing about this movie is two parts. The first part are the ghosts smiles, they are downright unnerving. The second is the demon played by musical composer Joseph Bishara. The makeup on him is terrifyingly well done. The only problem however is the way Bishara plays the demon. Originally, his minor appearances are extremely noteworthy. However later on, he's portrayed in somewhat of a campy fashion. Not sure if it was intentional or not but it lowers the terrifying quality of this character when initially his presence was so menacing. As for music, Bishara's composition is a totally different ball of wax. Right off the bat, like many other tracks composed by Bishara, audiences will be introduced to the shrieking strings. Despite that being his way of creating many of his tracks, Bishara actually composes a lot of other emotionally related themes that revolve around the family in the story. This shows that Bishara knows how to compose motifs that are easy on the ears no matter how simplistic and juvenile his other tracks may sound.It has decent scares, believable acting, well-rounded music and a new story to tell that goes beyond the normal ghost stories told before. On the other hand, there are some key parts of information left out that are quite important to the back-story. Plus, some of the terrifying tension may be lost if one can't get past a particularly campy scene.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Drag Me Back To Hell Again,"Insidious is a magpie of a horror movie that steals ideas from other classics and weaves them together to make a fun movie - even if it will seem familiar to any horror movie fan.The opening is J-horror-ish with The Grudge-ey type spooks inhabiting the house of a young family coping with the fact that one of their children has gone into an inexplicable coma.We then move to ""Poltergeist"" territory as the family brings in kooky help to help rid them of the presence in their home and finally, the film evokes ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in the last (and weakest) part of the film as those things which lurked in the shadows are finally exposed (and are frankly kind of disappointing).But even with all these influences, the film it reminded me of most is Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell"" another movie that threw shock after scare at the viewers, contrasting eerie quiet with LOUD in an effort to lift the audience of its seat in unison. And just like DMTH, the impact is spoiled a little by a ""twist"" you will have predicted easily unless you have never seen a movie before everIt's this over-familiarity that stops this movie from being more than a scary ride. It is a fun ride while it lasts but once it's over it will soon be forgotten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A good movie not to take too seriously Sunday pizza day,"good movie, i feel that people who like one type of scary movie and doesn't except more interpretive kinds of 'ghostology' wont get why this movie works on a variety of levels without being too overbearing. The only negative about this movie is that it also fits well into the low budget trendy new horror movie genre as well. If you don't focus too much on the acting per say (which isn't all bad) you can see how this movie has a good build and plot that succeeds away from the cliché.

Scary but not great,"From the moment I saw the trailer I was pretty much into it as it looked scary. Moreover James Wan is the one directing which makes it a must. Well frankly this was a lowdown from dead silence for me. Wan is the person who cleverly places a brilliant twist in the end which makes the movie being rated higher. Its not quite the same thing here. Initially the moment movie starts you're gonna get a hint that this is gonna be scary as hell. The music, the makeups everything adds to the creepy scenario. Actually its scary in places and you might get jumpy. However towards the later part of the movie it feels stupid script-wise. I guess they needed a better script. The direction is in his own style again. Some humor have also been added which makes it more creepy. It could have been much better that's what I feel. Anyways as the matter of fact, its definitely gonna scare you no matter what, so go for it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Started out so promising- then fell flat,"The premise is pretty good. Although it put me in mind of ""Poltergeist"" with the whole having to go to another ""World"" to save someone, or the classic part of Amityville 8 with the final attic scene. This was a very promising story line, I really felt for the characters struggling with their young son who suddenly one day after a fall is in a ""coma"".Cue distraught mother and absent, working late, aggro father refusing to believe that the house is haunted after weird things suddenly start to happen.. before finding irrefutable ""evidence"" (They spend a good deal of time in their own son's bedroom but never spot the one MASSIVE clue?)Some scenes, I admit genuinely had me freaked.. the shoes and the Dalton ""walking around"" while in a coma was very eerie. The creepy guy stood by him pointing. The house in the ""further"" with the very odd family. But the main ""demon"" well, first off didn't even look scary-(We're talking pierced darth maul-esque face, blue eyes, classic cloven hooves under furry legs and razor sharp teeth showing hints of a forked tongue) In fact, It was at the point where he is filing his claws on a sander, surrounded by puppets in some phantom of the opera worthy setting, that I felt the movie had derailed. Also the whole creepy psychic woman who knows more than she lets on trope. Mother's prophetic/flashback dream trope and of course, the token over exuberant paranormal investigators are thrown into the equation.So, a few too many clichés and cookie cutter horror scenarios later..The one saving grace *drum roll*-twist at the end!

The wife and children acted fairly well though.The story flows fairly well. There's not much ""character building""..as its not really needed in this film. Some scenes leave you scratching your head afterward (""what was the point there?"" you ask yourself).As many previous reviews mention...the film starts off well, and then kinda nose-dives: not a total explosive wreck...but a crummy rough landing with some minor injuries..so-to-speak.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyably frightening flick.,"In Insidious, strange happenings and frightening occurrences lead a family to believe that their new home is haunted, especially after a tragedy befalls one of their members and the ghostly presences seem to become stronger.Insidious is definitely scary. I'd challenge anyone to watch it alone at night and not be freaked out by it. The first half will probably meet the approval of nearly any horror fan. It takes time to build atmosphere and establish the characters, while still offering more than enough scares.The second part may be more divisive, though. The story goes in a fairly original direction, and I wouldn't be surprised if some people were put off by the shift in tone. I didn't find it that difficult to adjust to, though I did think the former half was more frightening and satisfying than the latter. I just thought I'd offer a warning that how the movie starts is fairly different from how it ends.Great finale, though, even if it wasn't totally unexpected. Overall this is a more than solid horror movie, and I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
We have just witnessed that horror isn't dead.,"Now I think everyone can agree that the last decade of horror movies has just been one remake and gross-out after another. Nothing has lived up to the expectations of the originals as well as nothing original has come out. It's usually something we've always seen before, however it really isn't the fault of the use of dilapidated old houses or mansions every now and then. It's more from the clichés and no feelings for any characters because the filmmakers have been mostly trying to gross us out instead of trying to make time to create people we care about as well as to do what horror movies should do, and that is to scare us. Yet it was in 2007 when Paranormal Activity came out I caught a glimpse of the future of horror. It replaces Saw as the Halloween movie to see and now we are at last getting something good from these places called ""film studios."" Drag Me to Hell definitely kept things going in the right direction in 2009 and now we have Insidious. Horror movies are finally (as well as unbelievably) getting better. And Insidious is just another reason why we shouldn't give up horror movies.The story is pretty straight-forward. A family moves into this old house then strange things start happening as well as their son falling into coma. Of course you would think the haunting has something to do with it but you never know with these movies sometimes. At first it looks like the same old kind of horror story you find from the Masters of Horror series but it progresses from that into a full blown horror movie that made me jump, squirm, and even almost scream. Even though I didn't scream I still said ""Oh my God!"" maybe a hundred times. This definitely went beyond my expectations.But it's hard to find the perfect movie for its genre and there are a few minor problems. One being that the strength of the film kinda lightens up in the last act but still maintains some of the eeriness of the rest of it. My last complaint is that when the last act starts coming to an end you can pretty much guess how it's going to end. Now with any other movie these would be the problems that could possibly destroy it. And actually those rules don't apply to Insidious. The film is held up by its eerie atmosphere that grabs you from the very beginning and the talented actors to relate to you by being normal people.The film is actually a collaboration from the creator of Paranormal Activity and the creators of Saw, you would think that such a collaboration would be disastrous but it actually was probably one of the smartest collaborations since Wes Craven worked with Kevin Williamson on the Scream movies (first two and the fourth). There is no gore (which surprised me considering the Saw creators were in on it) or even any blood at all. The movie does what scary movies should do and that is to scare and not gross-out. So while there are some problems, Insidious is probably one of the scariest movies of the year and helps create something original out of the so frequently used ghost stories with haunted, old houses. And that's what is so good about Insidious. It shows that most of the time it's not the setting or the story that makes horror movies bad, it can be the filmmakers and no inspiration put into it. So I just hope that this can be a model for other horror movies and show that there is originality in what was once an almost dead genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent movie once again from the creators of saw,"A fantastic original scary movie. I didn't see it in theaters but I still jumped. I probably would have peed my pants if I saw it in theaters. The music is perfect and it is played through out the movie at the right to make it even scarier. The movie starts out at a wife and her husband move into a house with their three children. Then the family starts to see ghosts and demons. While I was watching it, I thought of the amity ville horror and thought it was going to be another haunted house movie. But then the family moved back to their old house and they keep seeing these demons. Then you know its not an ordinary paranormal movie its something more. Since its from the creators of saw you know there will be a twist at the end and there is just not a huge one like saw. Its more like a wow not an OMG ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scariest film of all time!,"When it comes to a horror film for me, 10:00 p.m. in the basement, lights out, headphones on, volume cranked, full screen, and I say to myself, ""lets do this"". No, not really, but yeah. By the time I finished this film, I had some wetness in my pants, and was shaking like crazy. This film is insanely scary to no end. They may be mostly jump scares, but some psychological stuff is thrown in also, and the jump scares fuel them, making them 10x more scarier.The film's dark atmosphere and beautiful and scary music score fuels it into each scene preparing you for the worst, then hits you where you least expect it. BOOM! jump scare, a psychological one here and there. But yeah, not much else but jumpers. But that's still fine. There's nothing wrong with them. Now a days, psychologically scaring someone is almost impossible, so what other choice do director's have. But this one found a way to make it work. Quite a clever maneuver.Some don't like jumpers, and that's fine. But in this film, its an exception, no question. Because the jump scares don't just scare the ever living s**t out of you, but they make the more psychological scares scarier than usual. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Most modern day horror films don't fit the bill of scariness, such as Paranormal Activity. But films such as this, and Disturbia, it works like a charm. When I first heard of this, I thought it would just be another stupid horror film thinking it was scary, and just had pointless bull crap in it. But instead I got something different. I got a horror film and a director, actually trying, and succeeding.This film was simply nonstop scary, and in terms of horror films, that means its good. The scarier the better. And for this film, it couldn't be scarier, so it couldn't be better. Scariest film ever!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
TERRIFIC...,This movie is so underrated when it comes to experience the horror factor. James Wan has directed a masterpiece what a movie it is. The way james has shown the outside world with the use of new technologies and and mixture of lights is way beyond our expectations.

From beginning of the story where a family move to a new house and slowly slowly revealing the secrets and getting to the conclusion. Screenplay is too tight that you can't even blink your eye and the film keeps you till the end and keeps the tension and horror factor till the end.

"A bit creepy and well made, but completely bonkers, forgettable and uninvolving.","The horror film Insidious when I looked at the IMDb rating of 7.3 on here I became very sceptical, thinking due to three previous film experiences that it was highly overrated. The films I refer to (two not being horrors, but still overrated were The Fighter and the hideously bad Thor). The third film which was a horror and had a rating of 7.4 was The Descent, which for me without a doubt is one of the worst horror films in years as I wouldn't even classify as that because it was so bad. So I settled down to Insidious with cautious optimism. I'm afraid to say again like The Descent, Insidious for me has been quite overrated, but it is not as out of proportion and this was much more entertaining than The Descent.The story itself has some promise with demons and spirits which is nothing new. But there are some creepy moments throughout the film when these spirits appear with unending ease, which stayed in my mind for a while during the film. The atmosphere created by director James Wan is done well to an extent with some impressive make up and special effects and his effective use of sound, though mainly this in the first forty minutes. The acting too (though not amazing) was reasonable for a horror. But really the film lost heart after about forty five minutes as it became more and more silly where I just laughed at certain scenes (and I'm glad from looking at the audience reviews on here I wasn't the only one) as it didn't look at all that real. When they camera does an extreme close up of like the demon, it looked like some ridiculous attempt from a child at making a Halloween costume. The thing is Insidious does market itself as a serious horror and me laughing at it is what disrepute's it to being better than it could be for me. It is completely bonkers with a stupid ending, but strangely in a way it being silly made it more enjoyable in a goofy sort of way.But by the end the film had lost it's chilling atmosphere and was half horror and comedy and though it was entertaining, it didn't remotely scare me and was uninvolving and forgettable. It's nothing special but is enjoyable enough to watch and it passes the time and is more entertaining than The Descent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Insidious, so close, so very close","Insidious is the newest film from duo James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer/actor) who were made infamous by their first film, Saw. Except this time, instead of starting a sub-genre, they're paying homage to another: the Haunted House genre, which includes films such as The Amityville Horror and House on Haunted Hill. Now as much as I like campy little tribute pictures, like Brutal Massacre or Grindhouse, I usually don't consider them great movies. The reason? As fun as it is to revisit a genre that is otherwise dead and gone, these movies don't really bring anything new to the table. That being said, Insidious was a delightful surprise.It keeps its heart close to home with the classics, but is totally original in both its execution and plot. Now you may think you've seen this movie before - quick shots of people walking by doorways, turns out a brutal multiple-homicide took place there years before, blah blah blah - but I assure you, you're wrong. The film does have some aspects of familiarity to them, there's no denying that, but it also has a refreshing edge that most recent horror films don't have. One of these things is that Insidious EARNS its scares. Yes, it does have the quick shots of things appearing and disappearing, loud noises, and all that jazz, but it also has a shocking number of scenes that rely on build-up and legitimately creepy circumstances instead of the pop-out scares that we're all so familiar with.Unfortunately though, Insidious isn't consistent. For every brilliant scene that is beautifully done, there are at least 3-4 that either don't make a whole lot of sense or are the cheap pop-out style scares. Also, the big reveal into what's going on in this movie was good, but it also missed the mark slightly; other scenes were carried out a bit too long and got a bit too ridiculous. One can see where they were trying to go with it, but it just didn't come out that great.It is unfortunate that this movie wasn't better received; they came so close to being a notable force in the horror genre, which is so desperately needed right now in main stream cinema, and personally I think James and Leigh would fit the bill wonderfully because they have something that very few people don't: heart, and they've got a ton of it",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Frightening but clichéd.,"Scary children are, well, scary. There's something about a haunted youngster that just gets under my skin. Insidious is no exception. Harking back to the not-so-subtle horror movies of the seventies, this chiller about a young boy with demons leaves no cliché unturned. Doors swing open unexpectedly, cast members venture where no sane person would, and things mysteriously get moved throughout the night. Thankfully though, the Aussie team of James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (screenwriter), who brought us the original Saw movie, provide a plethora of genuinely frightening moments that had me jumping out of my seat. I loved the opening title sequence too. 3 out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"too much, too soon","There's too much material and too little time for adequate cinematic presentation. Everything feels rushed and crammed into one movie. They waste too much time on irrelevant scenes, and not enough time on scenes that should be anticipated. There's too many plot twists that strain credibility, and after an hour the entire situations starts looking ridiculous. Que the nostalgic seventies technology and it gets very close to comedic.Starting with zero stars, I gave one star for originality, one star for competent acting (not Oscar winning but watchable), one star for paying homage to movies that were actually worth a damn, and another star for setting and ambiance.So I hear they are making another installment: Insidious, Chapter Two. But I can't imagine the next movie to do anything but rehash the first one. All the ideas were used in this one.And after the Paranormal Activity series; I get that people don't want to wait five years to figure out what's going on. I just don't think cramming a couple movies into one is a very good idea either.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not as good as expected,"First of all, thought/plot of movie is really nice, that helps to catch your nerve, it scares too 2 or 3 times with few really good scenes, but that all, it builds the horror environment to its peek, but than it just goes fuzzy.last act has always been important in horror movies, this is where the movie really disappoints, though the last mystery unfolding may surprise few.anyways, it is still watchable, it really develops the thrill of horror (most importantly without stupid blood shredding scenes.)story - good, there's never much scope for it but insidious did good. direction - intelligent.

Could have been the best horror movie of ALL TIME,"First off, not up to the hype. It's not as scary as people make it, no matter what you read. I was terrified by it before I actually saw it. Then I was like: really ?!...ok cool, I'm sleepin good tonight.But then, the pros and cons must be distinguished: Pros: * Incredible intro/theme. Very subtle, the perfect intro/credits ever for a horror. * Good use of the music with the momentum of the scenes. * Good ideas for the scare scenes. * A killer plot that had tremendous potential. * Excellent vision for the ""Further"". The perfect nightmare.Cons: * Borrowed or simply copy/pasted a lot from many movies before it. * Acting, direction at times, script and just feel overall too Hollywood, too unreal, too polished - actors are playing mere pre-written characters as opposed to real human beings who react to a horrible reality. * Could have been much scarier given the pieces they had to their puzzle. * Some aspects in bad taste (long haired fiend...) * A bit too unrealistic towards the end.All in all, just like Inception this film touches on subjects of astronomical potential and importance - the realms of dream, reality-meets-fiction, eternity and infinity - and fails like the latter to deliver a complete, whole picture of its monumental failed ambition.Because of the great and the good in this movie, and because of the efforts on the artistic side to make this more than just a polished, soulless Hollywood creation: I'll be generous and give it a 8/10, though a 7 could be in the discussion. But there's no way this movie earns less, and it just doesn't have what it takes to get to 9 or 10.Fully developed and less Hollywood, less commercial - this has the potential to have been the best horror movie of all time...too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An effective chiller,"This chiller opens as Josh and Renai Lambert move into their new house with young sons Dalton and Foster, and Cali, their baby daughter. Shortly afterwards Dalton falls in the attic; he doesn't appear badly hurt but the next day he doesn't wake up. He appears to be in a coma but the doctors can't identify the reason. His condition doesn't change and three months later he returns home to be looked after there. Soon afterwards Renai starts hearing noises and then seeing things. Convinced the house is haunted they move to a new house; the occurrences don't stop; in fact they get worse leading to the Lamberts calling in to professionals.When I watched this I expected it to be really scary as it had been recommended by a friend who is into horror films... I didn't find it quite as scary as I hoped but it had effective moments and a good creepy atmosphere. The setup is impressive as it nicely suggests that we are in for a haunted house film before changing tack and giving us the real reason. While this definitely isn't a comedy-horror there are a few good laughs that lighten the tone... just before it darkens again. The cast is solid; Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne impress as the Lamberts and Lin Shaye is equally impressive as expert as Elise Rainier. Overall I'd say if you want gore this will disappoint but if you prefer creepy/menacing horror like 'Poltergeist' or the more recent 'The Babadook' then I'd definitely recommend this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hasn't aged well,"I remember seeing this for the first time many years ago and honestly would have given it a 7 or an 8, however I watched it there recently and honestly its quite boring, some of the camera shots are really well done however there are some other shots that are quite laughable. I felt as the movie went on it really started to drag and also became quite predictable, the jump scares weren't scary and some of the acting was actually quite poor.Maybe this is an unfair rating because this movie is 14 years old and newer horror films have adopted new ideas for making horror movies scary but Insidious just felt like a movie that has already been done before.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movies insane.,"This movie is definitely one of my favorite horror movies. When i'd first seen the preview, I thought 'Hmm looks like it could be scary' but I got a lot more than i expected. I'm not going over exaggerate but this is THE scariest movie I have ever seen. Some might pick at it so they don't get scared, but seriously, just watch it. Don't expect anything good or bad of it. The way things popped up and how they looked were terrifying, and i typically don't get scared by movies and can predict most of whats going to happen, but when i saw it in theaters, by the 2nd half of the movie i was balled up in my sweatshirt, especially when it was coming closer to the end. Insidious was overall very good, very scary in my opinion and had great freaky music but the only reason i didn't give this a 10 is because i thought that the characters seemed a bit awkwardly written.

You may enjoy it more if you have zero expectations,"I am a horror movie fan and I try to catch horror movies that get a good word-of-mouth. This movie ""Insidious"" is one such movie, with some critics giving it an A rating, very rare in the horror genre.""Insidious"" involves a child, and that is usually a positive thing among horror classics, like ""The Exorcist,"" ""The Omen"" and ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others."" Little Dalton Lambert suddenly falls into an unexplained coma one day, with no plausible medical explanation. From then on, their house began to manifest various ghostly goings-on that scares the living hell out of his parents Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne). Pushed to the wall, they consult paranormal ""experts"" to solve their supernatural problems. Can Dalton still be saved?The device used to explain what happened to Dalton and what can be done to deal with the situation was quite ingeniously conceived by the writer Leigh Whannell. However, the execution though by the director James Wan is a tad disappointing in several parts. This movie pulls out all of the traditional horror tricks to make this movie scary. The shadowy darkness, the loud startling music, all to bring about a creepy atmosphere and jolting surprises and screams from the audience.

"Solid horror film by very talented fellas,  Wan n Whannell.","I saw this first on a DVD in 2011. As a fan of James Wan (Saw, Death sentence n Dead silence), i was excited to see this film. Insidious starts off on a routine note - a family moves into a new house and are absolutely in love with it. Soon strange, supernatural-like things start to happen n the son goes into coma after falling from a ladder in the attic. Sensibly the family moves into a new house. Thinking they've left those occurrences behind, they soon discover that it's not the house that was haunted but their son. Insidious was actually scary at some points. There were several pretty chilling set pieces and the ghost designs were particularly creepy. There is this one scene where the red demon is standing next to the sons bed n the granny inquires the demon. Man, that really terrified me. Another scene was the one wher someone is walking behind the curtains. While watching this scene i turned behind to check my window. The scary moments are well-paced and always effective. Creepy figures emerge from the shadows and appear in the background in an unpredictable fashion. The soundtrack complemented it well. The cast is remarkable. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne n Lin Shaye all gave good performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The first half for me is a winner but as we progress the film starts to feel rushed. The story line becomes odd and the horrors begin to look cheap. It falls fowl of the issues most movies that want to scare us do.You see the evil and laugh, the demons and ghouls look like drama students let loose with makeup, the limited use of cgi which I prefer looks cheap.Did it scare me?

The ghosts or whatever they are, are all annoying and not original- I was waiting for a guy with a mustache, holding his head under his arm to come strolling along at any moment.The part where it turns really bad is when they start talking about the astral projection. That could have been a good, interesting twist, but it just ended up being silly.When the psychic woman gets the guy to draw pictures for her, it seemed pointless. Why does she need him to do that?? What is the point??? Why does she need him to write down what she says too?? What is with the sandman mask? Why can't she just talk normally??

Solid Work From the Saw Boys,"A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child (Ty Simpkins) in a realm called The Further.This film is marketed as being from the creators of ""Paranormal Activity"", which makes sense given the subject matter -- but this is really the brainchild of the ""Saw"" boys -- being directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (who also appears as a character). For an added bonus, horror veteran Lin Shaye is here in one of her best roles.This film is legitimately creepy. I am not big on ""jump"" or ""bus"" scares, and even less of a fan of computer animation, but this film just impressed me. There were so many shots that made it worthwhile, with quick flashes of a shadowy figure -- just enough to get the imagination to conjure up something more. The best balance for horror is the use of the seen and the unseen in a certain mixture -- not sure precisely how much, but the makers of this film clearly do. I think ""Insidious"" was overlooked by many and that is just a shame.The advertising consistently used quotes from reviews to insist this film is the best thing since either ""Poltergeist"" or ""Exorcist"". I assume anyone who reads that thinks it's an exaggeration. But do not think it exaggerates too much -- these are not just cherry-picked quotes. While putting ""Insidious"" in the same league as either of those two films is hard to do, it is not far behind... in fact, I would not even mind saying it gives ""Poltergeist"" a run for its money...While I hope ""Insidious"" does not turn into a franchise (we are all a little burned out on ""Saw"", ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Collector""), as it stands, this film is a winner.

The opening scene was predictable, but it was very creepy and promising. The ending scene was kinda unpredictable, terrifying and I liked it.

"Some clever and big scares, let down with lazy plot","With the 'saw' franchise at its (depressing and three dimensional) end, a horror sized hole in Hollywood has been created. With insidious hoping to fill it. Insidious follows the story of a family who are looking to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called 'the further'. With quite a unique concept does insidious deliver? and above all, scare?The effective technique to 'show as little of the villain as possible' in a horror film applies to Insidious all too much. This isn't a problem for the 1st half of the film, as the majority of the first 45 minutes doesn't include the main bad guy only his 'ghost henchmen'. When the main villain is eventually revealed to us the shocking effect of his first appearance quickly wears of, as he is showed time and time again. If they had just held back his screen time he would have been much more scary and shocking. Unfortunately this villain who was supposed to be the main centerpiece of the scares turns out the be the main centerpiece of the laughs.Saying that, I thought that some scenes where absolutely terrifying, showing sparks of genius at times.Especially at one point, which has to be one of the most unsettling scenes in horror film history ( in my opinion) I won' spoil it, all i'll say is 'tiptoe through the tulips'! The scares are partly down to tempo of the film, it takes a while to get started but once it does the scares hit hard in some clever sequences, this creates a really tense atmosphere that had me in hysterics. However i couldn't help but feel let down after the film as the terrific scares in this film are ruined by the ridiculous and unrealistic plot. As the plot gets more and more silly throughout the film, new characters are added, which just increases my annoyance! 3 characters enter the film who provide no scares or suspense whatsoever, they just drag the film down and pull the viewers away from the suspense by providing awful comedic value.This film provided terrifying moments at times, but the disappointing lack of realistic plot dragged the film down. If this film had maintained its suspense that was created by the 'ghosts' in around the 45 minute mark, this film would be a real winner and one worthy of attention.I want to give this film a 8 stars but the lack of plot, silly characters and unconvincing, tame bad guy means that i have to give this film a 7.Calum.

It kinda combines Poltergeist (though defiantly not the extremely high budget), Paranormal Activity, and The Exorcist all into one with a little of it's own elements. Overall good movie I just hope they don't ruin it with a bad sequel. It obviously needs a sequel I just hope it's not a bad one. Another thing is that it's rated PG-13. What?! Yep it has a PG-13 rating and it's still scary. I've always praised PG-13 horror movies because 1.There is either very little violence or none at all. 2. It's scary without being gory to where you're not flinching at every kill scene but every time there's something scary you're just numb. 3.Every scare is specific; and finally 4.

"The best since ""Poltergeist""","James Wan's finest! A very well-directed and written movie, no doubt. As I was watching i had visions from ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Entity"". Wan payed a great homage to these paranormal movies of the 80's and won't let you down. This is a very good movie, worth watching in a movie theater. And it scares, in these days it's hard to come by. The key Wan uses here is to keep it simple and clean, no gore or violence but following a solid story makes this film much stronger than just a horror and gory movie. Wan is not used to this, that's why we see a more serious side of him, that I loved. This one did take me back to those days and trust me, it scares!

Horrifying movie with a very lackluster finish,"I am not a proponent of giving out any details of a movies plot in a review due to it setting an expectation to another person.

The fatal flaw is that towards the end, and note I am not stating specifically the ending, the movie seems rushed and as if the producers were running low on the budget. If rating the movie from beginning until before the last 15-20 minutes this film would be an 8.5-9.

Worse, shortly afterwards, spooky events take place around the house, causing them to relocate again...only for these events to follow them, causing them to face a terrifying truth about their son that will force them to go above their realm of belief to save him.If Insidious does nothing else right (which it doesn't) it does create a terrific, unnerving atmosphere that fits it's status as a horror film perfectly, not only in the opening titles with the jarring, skin crawling soundtrack, but the impressively grey, drained cinematography in the set up that follows, with an impressive use of no sound to hammer this home.Saw director James Wan shows more restraint and ditches the blood/gore excess and concentrates on setting up the ground work for a decent horror picture. Sadly, he fails to create characters we can care about or a story that is in any way engaging, leaving it to degenerate more and more into preposterousness which robs some of the admittedly eerie scenes of their effectiveness.Horror is one of those genres where if it's done right, things work wonders but when it doesn't, it's just a complete mess, which sadly is the case with Insidious. Atmospherically, and even visually, it's perfect, but sadly all the other components fail to come together and despite being a short film, it feels like a big slog to get to the end. *",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Dreadful, truly one of the worst","I don't really know where to begin with this movie. It has been one of those movies that I never got around to watching and then completely forgot all about it. Well recently I finally got around to watching this film and I have to say by the end I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.Laugh because the movie was absolutely shockingly atrocious, or cry because I'd wasted a part of my life watching this garbage that I will never get back.20 minutes in to the film I thought that it was going to be really good, The story was set really nicely and then I was just waiting for all hell to break loose.Well it didn't, what followed was an hour of utterly ludicrous loud noises aimed to scare the living daylights out of you by having a really low volume for the dialogue and then hitting you with 1000 decibels of noise. It got old very very very quickly. At first I thought it was just me imagining noises being more loud than usual in a horror film, but I realised that was the only weapon this film had up its sleeve. The storyline turned into something that even a few days later I still chuckle to myself about. The effects were some of the worst seen in film since the 70's and the scary things in the film were so terrible they actually made you laugh.Basically the entire film was over an hour of trying to deafen you by playing over the top loud noises when something scary was supposed to be happening and masking the fact that what you were actually seeing was not scary but funny. If you play the supposedly scary parts of this film without the sound you will literally burst into laughter about what you are seeing.People are reactionary on here and review things straight after they see the movie which is understandable. However, it has been a few days since I watched this film, so I have had time to think and evaluate this movie with a clear mind and I can genuinely say this was one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and one of the worst movies in general, I truly don't understand the hype surrounding this film on here and how well regarded it is and the director.I have read the second installment of this joke film follows the same concept of loud noises to create cheap scares so I will definitely give that one a miss, how they can make 3 of these things says everything about Hollywood and $$$$.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A dreadful modern chiller with a classic touch,"James Wan's ""Insidious"" borrows, like almost every Hollywood horror flick, the clichés, jump scares, and ideas from all the commercial horror movies from the past decades. However, it manages to successfully build a mysterious, eerie and dreadful atmosphere. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne headline a cast that delivers a good portrait of the haunted family with a first half that sets the bar high, very high, that will leave you at the edge of the seat and afraid of dark. The final act tough begins too soon and drags for too long, taking the movie through a fantasy outcome that is doubtful and perhaps too literal. It is a nice chiller tough, and those are getting rarer by the day. Well done. Visit thefadingcam blog on blogspot for more!

The best new- released horror movie fore a Long time!,"Insidious is probably the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Getting tired of the ""they live inside a cabin in the woods without coverage on your mobile"" look. This is really something new that makes you not know exactly when something will happen which makes you scared. The story is well written and very good actor in my opinion, it comes with the act and is something I appreciate very much of a horror movie. I fought It would be just like that when I saw that the guys from ""SAW"" directed it ques they are weary talented and together with the ""Paranomal Activity"" gang, they have created together a masterpiece of Horror category.

Also backed up by the directors of paranormal activity and saw. Sooooo what did I do, I gave the film a try. Let me start off by saying the acting is so rubbish a bunch of school kids could of done better. The scare factor is a joke and the story is all over the place.Please don't get me started on the effects and the rubbish application of makeup to make people look dead.This film was a joke if not a load of horse Pooh (which I would consider more valuable).PLEASE LISTEN AND DO NOT BOTHER YOUR LIFE WITH THIS CRAP.YOU WILL THANK ME",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A one-time viewing entertaining horror film,"Rewatched to get hyped up to watch the current Insidious film in theaters. A must-watch early 2010s horror film but if you've seen it once, then everything is less scary and you can predict all the jump scares. If you get easily triggered by horror jump scares, this is a prime film to get that from lol; the music score really amps up that disconcerting, eerie ambience in key jump scares. It still maintains a creepy, chilling vibe with subsequent rewatches. The acting is terrific from Patrick Wilson, Ty Simpkins, and Rose Byrne. Wilson and Simpkins are believable as on-screen father and son respectively. An overall well-directed horror film. I feel like Stranger Things heavily borrowed from The Further/astral projection/spiritual body concepts btw.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I thoroughly enjoyed it without getting scared out of my wits,"It was a horror film. I get scared pretty easy but I did not get scared in this film. And I think that it was because the director made it in a way that the film carried the spook and yet was watchable so that viewers focused more on the story than the spook. Often horror film buffs watch horror films to get the kick out of it, of getting scared out of their wits. This film did not scare me out of my wits. It allowed me to watch, understand and absorb the story that was being narrated through the motion picture. And I liked it. A well made horror film in a while is what I would call it. It was not just sensational horror drama to give adrenaline the kick that a lot of horror film buffs want. The performance given by Rose Byrnes was outstanding. It absolutely was something that new actors should learn from. Overall I had a great time watching this film, it was far from disappointing for a horror film fan. And I hate gore horror films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrifying!! 20 out of 10,"This is by far the scariest movie of a decade! And honestly I dare to say it's my favorite horror movie of all time! I like psychological horror movies and this one goes into every core of your mind. There are just few horror movies that I truly admire. The exorcist and The Ring are these 2. I thought there won't be anything that could possibly beat these two but I was wrong. Insidious is terrifying in every way possible. It just creeps you out. The sound, the story , the characters. Everything connected so well and so intelligently . If you're having second doubts about watching this movie, DON'T doubt anymore. This is the horror movie that will make you go to bed with your lights on! ;) Oh and don't even try to compare Anabelle or The Conjuring with this one. Insidious holds these two in a pocket.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Watched it completely alone in a theater room with... still left me feeling like I got ripped off,"Okay first of all, I was expecting to be scared out of my wits. The beginning left me wanting to leave the theater because the music was so loud and creepy especially because I was at a matinée and no one was there except me. The movie drags for so long. Some scenes feel like Paranormal Activity. Realistic and boring... just waiting for the good parts. I felt as if I was in a cheap haunted house during Halloween. I thought the point of this movie was for the child to be evil and do crazy stuff, but that only happens occasionally and he is completely zombiefied. I would've given this movie 1 star, but there were some scenes I particularly liked. For instance, the scene of the insane family in The Further towards the end and the scene where the little boy's tormentor is up in his crazy room with his machines and clocks... The plot of the story is plain boring. The lines were so dreadful and the actors I just felt like punching in the face especially the father. The only decent and interesting character was the old women who came to help and the other little brother. Everyone else seemed tired and uninterested almost as much as I was. I was falling asleep and forcing myself to watch until the last 20 minutes came in. After that, the mood I got from it was bad. This movie is so cheesy, and I had no trouble sleeping. If you want to watch something scary just pop in The Exorcist.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Disappointing And Boring,"Seriously, don't waste your time on this movie. It's not scary, it's not even laughably bad. It's boring and it was painful making myself actually sit through the whole thing. There's nothing in this movie to try and scare you except ridiculously loud ""shock"" music. In other words, the loudness makes you jump, not the content.What did make me laugh, however, was Lin Shaye's appearance as Elise Rainier, the ""psychic"" slash expert on ""the further"". All I could think of when I saw her was her role as the landlady in ""King Pin"", ugh.I did not enjoy this movie at all. I watched it because the review on IMDb was high compared to most psychological thrillers, but I now know better than to trust user reviews.

Scariest movie of the decade?,"So i saw insidious, and i gotta say, this is the scariest movie i've seen since paranormal activity, if not, scarier. The reason for insidious being scarier than the masterpiece, paranormal activity, is because the subtle scares, detailed demons, and truly scary situations. Insidious is just like the older movie, Poltergeist, only MUCH better. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both play excellent roles in being worried parents, and very dramatic characters. The ending is truly interesting, the musical score was excellent, the acting was superb, i mean, what is there bad to say about this movie?

better than the Conjuring series,I've been on a horror binge and was recently disappointed in the Conjuring trilogy but this one was at least what I expected.

Had us jumping off the couch,"I'd possibly even give 'Insidious' an 8/10, it's very, very scary. It certainly deserves higher than 6.8, but c'est la vie that's the public for you.I have only one major criticism: the producers/director need to learn about DYNAMIC RANGE in sound. Whilst I don't mind loud bumps for making you jump, these aren't so much loud bumps as soooo loud it's WHAT?? WHAT?? I CAN'T HEAR YOU?? WHAT?? - this it does after pulling the childish trick of having everyone speak quietly so that you turn up the volume, then blows your eardrums during a scary part (cinema systems can handle it by themselves). It's immature, pretentious and frankly just irritating - if your playback apparatus has a compressor/limiter function, USE IT.But of the story, the unfolding, the characters, the build-up - all the stuff that matters? Yeah, it's got them! Insidious has the lot.It builds slowly, then starts to scare the hell out of you with macabre events, leaving you unsettled. Then it really starts to pour the action on.It even provides some comic relief in a couple of places - nice to see something that doesn't take itself so seriously that it can't let its hair down - but this just seems to make the scares even worse because you let your guard down!I liked Insidious, and I like the sequel too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Creepy start, chaotic end","Insidious begins as a scary, atmospheric story of isolation, paranoia, and potential insanity and ends as an over the top monster fight. By switching progagonists halfway through from frightened mom, Renai, to traumatized dad, Josh, the film loses its focus, spiraling out of control into a convoluted mishmash of clunky exposition, eerie supernatural tableaus, campy villains, and bizarre ghost hunting tecnhiques. While many conceptual and visual elements of the film remain creepy, its generic shock based soundscape and choatic final act undermine the tension of the first part of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The concept sounded interesting and the movie started off okay, but just continued to go downhill. The acting was not great, more annoying than convincing.

for some reason bring in humour,"I thought a ghost story film with a family, two young children and a baby all in a new house is looking for trouble. The house is very large and of course with the attic and a difficult light to find especially when the ladder needed to use is busted. The scary bangs and strange noises as well as half shadowed figures are decent especially when we have to move house because we are so terrified. All is good about halfway through the film until the paranormal investigators arrive and for some reason bring in humour.

My friends were freaked out too, actually hiding behind me at some points, and they aren't easily scared. Once this movie was over, it made you watch your back long into the night safe at home.

Scariest movie I've seen,"I love the horror genre. I love being scared. Unfortunately most of today's horror movies dont have that effect on me anymore. This genre is being beat to death by cheap jump scares, really bad acting, and recycled plot lines. I still search for the few good ones amongst the bunch and often come out empty handed. It seems one good horror movie will come out every few years with a bunch of really bad ones to fill the gap between them. How's the saying go? You gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. It's like that, but with moviesWell, Insidious was one of the good ones. No, scratch that. It was one of THE BEST horror movies I've ever seen to date. Right from the beginning with that unnerving low volume tone playing during the intro, I was already feeling anxious. I went and saw this in the theatre and I can honestly say it was the first time I've ever actually been scared at a movie. My palms were cold and clammy the entire time. It wasn't just a heart racing kind of scare during the scary scenes, but a kind of scary that makes you uncomfortable, even between scenes.Unfortunately they continue to cheapen this film by releasing terrible, awful, laughable sequels just to make a quick buck so I don't recommend even seeing them.

Some Good Scares...,"I watched this film for the first time recently after hearing good things. I had previously viewed Sinister and was told that Insidious was a similar type of scary. Although the film has some great scream and goose bump inducing moments I felt that the second half and specifically the climax were lacking. The film started off presenting the viewer with some genuinely scary imagery and moments but into the later parts of the film it began to become, in my opinion, silly. (Minor Spoilers Follow) In the climax of the film, I thought the ""Netherworld"" sequence was not very scary and actually took some of the fear away from the movie. The fire faced entity was more laughable than scary. The Final scene of the movie offered a good twist but could not make up for what was a disappointing climax to the film. I hope the upcoming sequel can improve upon this ones mistakes. P.S. If you are looking for a very scary film that is also very good then I would recommend Sinister.

A turning point for Wan's directorial career,"The dawn of the 2010s was a turning point in the horror genre, as it marked the transition of James Wan from an emerging talent to a formidable maestro of creepiness. 2010's 'Insidious' was arguably the specific film that captured this moment, as its shaky-cam, low-budget feel paved the way for many others to follow (see 'The Conjuring' universe).'Insidious' succeeds in marrying elements from classic haunted house films with those of supernatural (and borderline sci-fi) stories. This also marks the first time Patrick Wilson teams up with Wan, as the former plays the patriarch of a tormented family alongside a convincing Rose Byrne. Another standout is Lin Shaye as a clairvoyant who is brought in to try to ""reverse the curse"" on the young Lambert son (Ty Simpkins).There are plenty of jump scares to go around, with some frightening characters who make appearances. But it's the overarching foreboding feeling throughout the film that makes 'Insidious' come across as being more unsettling than the average haunt.It's not Wan's greatest contribution, but it was an important catalyst for many other gripping films that would follow.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What are people on about here?,"This is the first movie that made me come here on IMDb and write a review, so better read it! If this movie was ??scary??, as people are writing here, then Shawshank Redemption was awful... you do the math. To sum it all up the movie was - bad, bad, bad, funny, almost the good part, funny, bad, bad, the end. I do not find it very amazing if horror movies are mixed with humor. It just does not work. This movie COULD HAVE been very very good, if Christopher Nolan (Director of Inception) would have made it. But if you check the budgets - Inception was $160 000 000 and Insidious $1 500 000. I would say that is where the problem came from. If you watch this movie, you will get exactly as much as you paid for, or how much the makers of the movie paid for. Give this script to Cristopher Nolan and he will make this movie watchable. I am just amazed that people are here giving it 10 points and saying how scary it was. I was literally scared for only 0 or 1 seconds throughout the movie. The best way to sum this movie is this - Imagine Inception done with a budget of $1 500 000... would you go watch it?

Insidious - James Wan's Open-Space Ghost Horror,"James Wan sets the tone immediately-a clean suburban house, the kind that screams impending doom faster than an immigration debate on CNews. Dad, Mom, and their three kids move in, everything's chill-until the eldest son falls into a coma as abruptly as a bar shutting down for health code violations. But of course, this isn't a simple medical issue. If it were, the movie would be called ER, not Insidious.Ghosts in Insidious don't do the slow-burn terror of Japanese or Korean horror, where spirits lurk in the background, subtly messing with your sanity. Nope. These ghosts slam doors, screech, and stomp around like angsty teenagers. The spirits here have the subtlety of riot police-they're not here for ambiance, they're here to make it very clear that your kid is trapped in the afterlife, and they're turning your house into an undead Airbnb.When you're a dad, your main concerns should be bills, PTA meetings, and maybe sneaking in a quick visit to YouPorn. But here, Josh (played by Patrick Wilson) gets drafted for a round-trip mission to the underworld to rescue his kid. Because apparently, fatherhood wasn't stressful enough, now he's got to battle demonic squatters in the realm of the dead. Cool concept-except Josh has the charisma of an IKEA bookshelf, which dampens the whole ""reluctant hero"" vibe.The second half of the movie is what saves Insidious from being just another cliché-ridden haunted house flick. The atmosphere finally gets heavier, the tension builds up, and Wan proves he can craft an eerie, otherworldly nightmare like a pro. But what's the point of wrapping a present nicely if the gift inside is recycled? The plot twists are predictable, the story feels like a greatest-hits collection of haunted house tropes since Poltergeist, and the ending leaves you with a ""Wait, that's it?"" kind of feeling.One thing Insidious absolutely nails is sound design. From violins screeching like a tortured soul to unnerving silences that make you question whether your cat is floating down the hallway, the soundtrack is pure nightmare fuel. James Wan knows that horror is half visuals, half audio, and in this film, he tunes every sound cue to maximize your jump-scare-induced heart attacks.At the end of the day, Insidious is quintessential James Wan-stylish cinematography, jump scares timed to wreck your nervous system, and an overall eerie vibe despite a script that's more derivative than a Jean-Luc Mélenchon speech. It gets the job done, but doesn't revolutionize horror.Perfect for a Friday night with friends, beer in hand, laughing at the characters' dumb decisions-until, of course, a closet door slams shut by itself and you all start rethinking your life choices.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Best haunted house film in years, just OK on the demonic possession front","There's a scene in ""Star 80"" where a hooker tells john Paul Schneider (Eric Roberts) why, despite his coarseness and unattractiveness, he's got to be her best lover. ""Honey, you just plain...try harder,"" she laughs. One could say the same about James Wan's films. Though sometimes falling a bit flat in their morass of fantastical elements or dissolving a bit too quickly in their frenetic camera-work, you can't deny the heart and energy he injects into his movies. It they're failures, they're not from a lack of trying.While ""Insidious"" is most definitely not a failure --- it's actually the creepiest haunted house movie I've seen in maybe thirty years --- it suffers from the More is Too Much curse of much modern horror, at least in the demonic possession realm.What keeps it going, and ultimately wins us over, is the acting and the brilliant casting choices. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are usually good in whatever they do, but they're spot on here as a clueless couple whose son falls victim to a mysterious coma (or so they think). In trying to find some solution to not only their son's sinister ""illness"" and to the havoc that plagues not one, but two, houses they attempt to start a life in, they bring in ghost hunter Lin Shaye and her two assistants, one played by Wan partner and (once again) screenwriter Leigh Whanell. Shay is exceptional and Barbara Hershey continues her run of good, believable supporting work since ""Black Swan.""Wan's pacing and shot set-ups are craftily constructed, devilishly executed, and the use of the discordant piano chords (""Black Christmas"" anyone?) is surprisingly effective. The problems come when the demons get a bit too ""visible"" and therefore lose a lot of their shock value. There's a bit toward the end, however, where several wax-looking figures pop up that makes you rethink that rationale...there's something in this sequence that's creepy in the extreme, but it doesn't last long.The demonic possession aspect of the film was an unfortunate combo of chestnuts I've heard before, and an overly complex explanation...it didn't do much for me and explained too much about too little. I'd have been more curious about the apparent homicides that seem to have taken place in one of the houses, though this is never expounded upon.Whatever the details prove out or don't, the overall effect of the movie is unsettling, and while I'd have preferred a bit more atmospherics, what we get is still far and away better than the usual pappy crappy pablum of films like ""The Haunting in Connecticut.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

All the actors did a good job here, from Rose Byrne (bridesmaids) to Patrick Wilson (Little Children) and Lin Shaye, who plays the paranormal investigator, this movie is full of really good jump scares, stunning and scary visuals, good dialogue, a touching message about family, and overall just a shocking scary thrill ride! This movie gave me chills when I watched it, it truly is just really scary, especially at night, when I watched it. And the way they ended it, oh my goodness, the ended just leaves you shocked and scared to sleep alone at the same time. You don't really know what to think at the ending, which is good, it was a cool twist! 9/10 for being truly scary and well written!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The first in a long time scary movie to actually make me jump,"Of course when you watch a horror movie that contains sequels,you know that the original is never going to change as the scariest original masterpiece ever. When I saw the trailer,I was amazed,but not really scared. When I saw the movie,I was amazed and scared. Quite ironic,right? Well,it surprised me quite a lot. Compared to the sequels,which were really good,but the original will always remain as the best horror movie of 2011. There were quite a few good horror movies I have seen throughout this year,but Insidious was the one that terrified me the most. After I saw this movie,I was doing research on the director James Wan,and I saw he was a horror director,which amazed me due to how many movies I know and loved of his movies. The movies I know he made was Saw, Dead silence,and a few other movies made in the future that I also loved. So James Wan is considered to be the next Wes Craven,and he is just my idol. James Wan really knows when not to mess around with horror films,and I am deeply honored by his line of work",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Horrible plot, even worse acting and super low budget effects","With such a horrible plot, even worse acting and super low budget effects I am not sure how anyone would like this piece of trash. I can only assume they are either mentally challenged or being paid by the producer of this terrible movie. I am not sure what is worse, sitting through the first 30 minutes of the movie listening to a baby cry or sitting through the last 30 minutes of the movie listening to the HORRIBLE generic ""scary music"" and watching the terrible effects they must have spent $5.00 on.Stay away from this garbage, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Promising First-Half. Disastrous Second-Half.,"From the director of Saw & The Conjuring, Insidious had the potential to become one of the most brilliant & genuinely frightening horror films of the 21st century but despite having all the ingredients which are used to near-perfection in the first half, the movie ends up being a huge letdown thanks to the tumble it takes down the road during the following half.The story concerns the Lambert family who have moved to their new house with their two sons but soon start experiencing mysterious incidents in the house. Things turn for the worse when their 8-year old son inexplicably falls into coma and when the doctors are unable to revive him, the parents turn to a spiritualist who warns them of the danger their son is in as a demon plans to take possession of his comatose body.Directed by James Wan, the manner in which he sets up the premise & builds up the tension in the first half with expert use of controlled camera movements, sound effects & silence is worthy of praise but after that, Wan simply loses his grip on everything as the promising & brilliantly executed first act is completely destroyed by its ridiculous second act, thus turning an effective horror into a plainly stupid one.The performances are quite good, camera-work & editing works in perfect harmony for a while, the background score gels pretty well with the events, sound effects is one of its biggest strength and James Wan proves his knowledge when it comes to scaring the audience yet the high standards this film set before the halfway mark is never matched or even challenged by its next half, thus resulting in an overall frustrating experience.Opening with a promise of greater things to come, developing its suspenseful & dreary atmosphere with precision craftsmanship and yet missing what was up for grabs by failing to capitalize on the boost provided by its first half, Insidious really had a chance at cinematic greatness but one wrong route around the halfway mark ultimately ended up wasting that opportunity for good. A heartbreaking disappointment.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good Supernatural, Ghost possession","Wan and Whannell have, in effect, ripped pages from the ""Poltergeist"" playbook and stripped the formulas down to old-style gothic scares.

The best scariest movie I have seen,"This is my second scary movie I have seen during my lifetime even I am just fourteen years old. And after I watched this movie, I can't sleep at night. But I was still interest of insidious2 and insidious3, then I watched. But I still think the first one is the best. The insidious2 contains too many unimaginable and unexplained things that make me confused. And I was so disappointed of insidious3 because it makes me bored and it is not that kind of interesting. But it didn't make me feel dislike of these movie.So many times I was scream like a baby, the sound that I can't believe but I made it. I was so surprise of director's imagination, and I saw the red door appeared in all of the three movies, that's the important thing that connect the stories together. The red door led them to the story.At the beginning of the stories Lambert family were moved to a new house to get better life. But one day everything is change, Dalton has fell down from the ladder, then fell in a deep sleep, a coma, he slept about three months and return to home. And the unexplained things happened after that, this make Lambert family uncomfortable and scared, Renai thought this is a haunted house. So they moved, but the things kept happening. They ran out of places to go so they found a person Elise who was work for this, she said everything is not because of haunted house, is Dalton. Dalton has a unique ability, a gift, that Dalton can leave his physical body and able to travel places, to see things when he sleep at night, things that living people not supposed to see, the places called the Further. The Further is a world far beyond their own, yet it's all around them. This ability is handed down by Josh. Dalton left his body so long time, the body becomes a empty vessel so the other invisible things smell it and come and try to enter it. That's why the house was haunted. And Josh travel to Further to find his son Dalton. And he succeed. But the story haven't end yet...This film was so true that I felt I was inside the movie. I like the world called the Further even it was so scary to make me scream. After watched this movie, I have a question:"" Is there Further in our life?"" I know it was a baby question but I don't want to know the answer, because I don't think I will able to sleep if I know the answer. At the end of the movie, a horrible thing was enter Josh's physical body, he killed Elise. This is a foreshadowing of next movie.I like this movie very much, I think it is more better than the first scary movie I watched, the Conjuring. I am scared to sleep at night after watched insidious. But I will still watch other good scary movie if I have enough courage to watch. Perhaps there is insidious4 coming soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A decent horror movie.,"Suspense is good, climax is good, and the characters are passable. I liked the old lady, unfortunately things happen to her that made me a little disappointment. The idea of a demon harboring a young child is definitely scary, and the demon itself without the special effects (which suck) looks scary. There's a certain jump scare that gets me still to this day. The idea of ""The Further"" is definitely creative. However, elements of it don't work sometimes along with a certain sequence of events. It was very rushed. Also, there was a weird decision in the film where they didn't want the old lady's help, it simply didn't make sense. However, I liked the movie ok. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Insidious attack on one's intelligence.,"Do not watch this ""movie"". They've managed to blend every possible horror cliché into one single film (which is no small feat, I must concede).It's the most obvious collection of teenager scares of all time ! Poorly written, awfully acted. And don't be mistaken: It's not the story that sometimes does scare the audience, but the sudden bursts of sound blasting your brains away when the director wants to have you scared.And yes, he did scare me, for I got pretty afraid that the soundtrack onslaught on my speakers would cause damage to them, so I turned off the whole thing and went back to my book.Awful !",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great movie for horror fans..,"'OMG!! The devil-monster entered Josh's (Patrick Wilson's) body. What's going to happen next?' is the first thing to come in my mind after watching this movie. Believe me this movie is so indulging that you can't stop yourself getting that thought. It's equally terrifying right form the beginning. Yes, I have never seen such a spine chilling opening sequence ever in any movie. The way it is presented: the color tone, sound effects etc. really signal that something terrifying is about to come. Music composer Joseph Bishara and cinematographer John Leonetti have done an excellent job in this regard. Unlike other films in this genre, it is very well written and deftly handled. And for a horror admirer like me, this movie satisfied my thirst after a long time. I have seen a lot of horror movies and consistently look for some really terrifying horror stuffs, and finally I got this one. It forced me to cover my eyes with hands several times. Though some of its out of the world concepts like ""astral traveler"" and ""the further"" will bother you like ""what is all this crap?"", but once you accept them you are really going to enjoy it. Also there are certain moments in the movie that draw disbelief, like one can really question ""how can the lady send anyone into the further?"" or ""how can voice from the present world reach the further?"", but stuffs like these are unavoidable in any horror movie. Even the best ones have them. You will also find some weird stuff like the demon lives in a house, works in a 2 storey office outfitted with antiques, and listens to music. But who knows? Maybe this is the way they live. Overall, Insidious is certainly good, but it can entertain you only if you are ready to live in the alternate reality offered by it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
More of a comedy than a horror film,"I went to see this movie with a few of my friends today. It was a waste of time and seven bucks. I went into this movie without really being certain of how I felt about it. Usually I go into a movie thinking it will be good or that it will suck, but honestly, when I walked into that theater, I had no idea what the movie was about or what it would be like other than an ""it looks scary"" from some preppy chick in my geography class. I will tell you this right now: it was not scary. At all.The movie started with its title being thrown obnoxiously at the screen with Psycho-like music playing in the background. It was annoying and loud and unnecessary. The fact that they continued to do it throughout the movie rather frequently only agitated me more.The movie was predictable and relied mostly on things suddenly jumping out accompanied by humongous banging noises to scare you. However, as soon as you got over the initial shock and saw how ridiculously bad the monster or whatever you were looking at was, you started bursting out laughing. I'm not even kidding. The entire theater was laughing most of the time.Of course, Insidious was not meant to be a comedy, and the worst part is that they continued to try to keep it serious, despite how ridiculous it was. The parts where they attempted to develop the plot were boring, and I spent most of the movie just dying to get out of the theater. It would have been better off if they had originally intended it to be a comedy or you know, a parody of Poltergeist, considering the plots were pretty similar.I'm really not sure how this movie managed to get the rating it has on here, considering it was simply ridiculous. I'm also not sure how anyone managed to find it scary either, considering the entire theater was laughing throughout the duration of the movie. Last time I checked, laughter meant something was funny, not scary.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The concepts are nightmare-inducing,"I don't remember much about this movie after watching it about a year ago, but I can say it had a troubling impact on my ability to live normally for the two weeks afterward.It left me with a disturbing fear of going to sleep, with the thought that I could go into a coma and never wake up. The concepts that the movie presented had me uneasy and unwilling to stay in a room alone for too long, for fear that a demon would be in there as well (and it didn't help that my cat often looks at things that aren't really there. There's always the saying that cats can see spirits and things like that, so it terrifies me).Whenever I hear/read about the paranormal, I really have to force myself not to think about Insidious so that I don't become paranoid about the things that I saw in that movie.I can't give it a rating, because I'm not really in to horror movies, so I can't say that I enjoyed it or thought any of the scare devices were effective.And now that I post this, I know the nightmares are going to come back again.

Polternormal Activigeist.,"Seen Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity? If so, then you'll be in very familiar territory with James Wan's Insidious, which borrows heavily from both of these supernatural blockbusters, but thankfully does so with just enough verve to still make it a satisfying experience.As in Poltergeist, Wan's film centres around a suburban family—Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) and their three kids—who experience supernatural activity shortly after moving into their new home. At first the occurrences are fairly innocuous—strange noises and moving objects—but after eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) mysteriously lapses into a coma-like state, the incidents begin to escalate in severity and scariness.Just like Paranormal Activity, even moving house doesn't prevent the creepiness from continuing, leaving Josh and Renai no option but to turn to a team of experts (led by the always delightful Lin Shaye), who discover that it is Dalton himself who is being haunted—by a hideous demon intent on occupying the boy's body.Although Insidious certainly won't win any awards for originality, it successfully does what it sets out do do: frighten the audience silly for an hour and a half with plenty of well executed jump scares and lots of fun freakiness (watch it and just try and tell me you weren't weirded out by the sight of that little kid gyrating to Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoe Through The Tulips'—mind you, the song on it's own is enough to make my skin crawl!).",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Pretty scary and petty fun, but not perfect","We have a nice quiet family living in a nice house. All of a sudden the oldest son gets possessed by a demon. He starts seeing horrific visions and soon they start showing up in the house. This results in a lot of jump scares. Some are scary, but some are really cheap, like the house alarm. Anyway the parents seek help from a group of exorcists to help free the boy from possession.This movie has a lot of effective imagery. The demons look really strange, especially when they're out in the real world. The move does go a little over the top with scare chords and hammy acting, but this is probably deliberate. The exorcism scene is the best scene in the whole movie. It is very intense and dark (literally) and memorable.My problem with the movie is the last act, which gets very slow and almost turns into a completely different movie. The atmosphere changes completely and it pretty much becomes a haunted house ride that drags on for a long time. Also, random things happen at times for no reason other than to scare you. These things brought the movie down a bit.Overall, a good movie if your looking for a few good scares. But don't get dragged down by the bad ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best build up horror movies ever made,"James Wan is a God. He is easily one of the greatest horror movie creators. I love this movie. I saw the Red Door was coming out so I came back to rewatch all 4 before its release and they are even better than I remember. This movie had me so scared for years, especially the fan scene and the ""thing"" standing in the corner pointing at the boy, that scarred me for awhile and I'm a frequent horror watcher. The story is incredible, the scenes make you feel so tense and you never know what to expect or when a jump scare is going to happen. Insidious is a messed up horror movie with a brilliant execution and most importantly, the actors are the best for this movie. Patrick Wilson? Automatic win. Lin Shaye? Makes the movie 10x spookier. Everything about this movie and the rest of the Insidious are so well put together, you will be entertained all the way through and don't be surprised when this series HOOKS you because it does.

Not very original and not very scary,"Some of my friends told me it was one of the scariest movie they ever saw... After having seen it, I am dumbfounded by what makes people scared and what not. I also agree with the people saying it has a lot of poltergeist rip offs. But also from the shining and i presume a lot of other horror movies. The movie was very cliché like... ""Girls always have to scream when they get scared"" ""The electricity always fail when evil is present"" ""small children run around as decoys"" ... etc etc The acting becomes strained because of how strangely the characters react to different situations. There was a lack of genuine response and emotions in certain situations. Take for example the scene where they boy has just been ""comatised""; The father coldly asks the doctor ""so, what do we do...? should we stay here or..."" What parents would even ask such a question? No parent in their right mind, traumatised or not would even think to ask that. If they would have just focused on Rose Byrne's -at least genuine felt- feelings and he just stayed quiet that scene would have been OK.This kind of non real reactions to situations just disturbed me throughout the movie.Even tough I could have coped with this, the movie all of a sudden went very ""theatrical"". Meaning they showed way too much of faces wearing way too much paint, acting way too theatrically. It just killed the suspense, making it more of an ""action"" movie than a horror movie.Thinking back on the movie I think there was too many logical errors. If you can talk about logic when talking about ""paranormal"" happenings. For example... Dead, -evile?- people are trying to get to the other side by using other bodies as vessels... but still they can get through to the other side physically and attack people seemingly when it suits them... So why the h*** do they need a vessel for?... why not take over the world anyways? Other scenes seemed just random, adding no explanation to what was happening.The use of string instruments for creating suspense is OK if used conservatively, but in insidious they were just overused to no end! Sometimes I felt like I was watching a black and white horror movie.There is only one twist in the movie, and you will know where it is if I say that this twist occurs where all horror movies always have a twist. I hope to God though, there will not be an Insidious 2.The cinematography worked, although I felt the camera was sometimes too far away from what was happening where it should have been close to the actor. The smoke/fog machine was used a little bit too much when it was used. The camera angles where non-original and mostly panned, glided or zoomed.What about the good stuff? Yes, what about it? For me, I think the best scene in the movie was when one of the ""nerds"" in the psychic team went around the house taking camera snapshots with different color-filters. It reminded me somewhat of when playing the computer game ""fatal frame"".I give this movie a 5 for cinematography, a 2 for story, and a 3 for acting. In total a 3.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

6-8 quality scares,"You want to know what's scary? Unexpectedly seeing a really scary face, and at the same time hearing a really loud musical cue. I'm being dead serious - it's jarring as heck. The makers of ""Insidious"" have taken this simple premise and crafted an entire film around it. Not only do they understand the formula (scary face + loud music cue = fright), they understand how to space these jolts out over a 90 minute film so that the effect doesn't diminish. They have done this, and only this.It is enough for a 6 out of 10, because so few movies know how to actually scare you. But don't kid yourself into thinking it makes it a great, or even a good film. Without those jolts, what's left is a genuinely silly film, with an overwrought score, unlikeable leads, and some highly sad effects (ie smoke machines).",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very....Insidious,"I watched Insidious for the first time this year, in 2024. For a long time, I avoided the movie because I was the kind of person who couldn't handle horror films. But now, with a few scary movies under my belt, I finally felt ready to give it a try.After watching it, I understand why Insidious made such a splash when it was released in 2010. There are definitely many moments designed to make you feel fear, but I also feel like the movie sometimes tries too hard by relying on loud sound cues. I'm a bit conflicted about this because the real fear for me came after the movie was over. Insidious really lives up to its name-it sneaks up on you. After watching it, I felt genuinely uneasy. Every little noise at night made me anxious.As for the movie itself, I think it's good, but also quite predictable. Even though I hadn't seen anything about it beforehand, I could tell what was going to happen in most scenes. So, don't expect any crazy plot twists-you'll probably guess what's coming next.That said, I truly believe Insidious will leave a lasting impression and continue to inspire filmmakers. In fact, since it came out in 2010, I'm sure it has already influenced a number of directors. Just take a look at some horror short films on YouTube, and you'll see its impact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The stuff that nightmares are made of,"Insidious is a movie where a light goes on but the room still feels dark, where you are too afraid to look but you are forced to anyways, and where things go bump as they always do, but you don't see it coming. Such are the makings of a successful horror film which this is. The photography alone would impress Hitchcock, and even though the material is familiar to the genre, Director James Wan makes it feel juicy and fresh.Wan enjoys the stuff that nightmares are make of, as he has demonstrated here for the third time, following Saw and the arguably underrated Dead Silence. As accomplished and frightening as Insidious is, it's not perfect.Two problems come to mind. First of all, Patrick Wilson's lack of range for a lead role is unacceptable, especially next to Rose Byrne. Secondly, Wan's ambitious starts to take him into curious territory for the climax. Insidous goes from being Sixth Sense to being In the Mouth of Madness. Wan flirts a little too closely to the surrealist category, and while the film maintains perfect coherency, and is certainly no less scary, It gets a little hard to take seriously as Insidious comes to a close.Even so, the film does what it sets out to do. It's memorable and stands out, earning it's place as the horror film of the year. I hope James Wan can keep up the good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Silly at times but still pretty darn scary,"I was in the mood for a really scary movie and I heard this movie was really scary so I decided to check it out. This really is a scary movie although silly at times, but when it comes to the scare factor, it can get really scary and has tension to it as well. I wish the main demon had a different design to it cause some audiences tend to make fun of it a lot instead of get intimidated by it. It basically looks like a Darth Maul Demon and when it actually shows the ghost it loses it's edge. The violin scores is what builds the scare in this movie, cause just the violin scores is frightening. There is almost no blood and gore in this movie which proves that you don't need those elements to make a movie that is actually scary. Anyone looking for a good scare should see this flick.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror films I've seen in years!,"I rarely go to see horror films in the theaters anymore, mainly because 90% or more are complete garbage. They are only there to give a cheap scare, and feature bad acting, and awful scripts. This movie gives some cheap scares, but it also gives more than that. It features images that have been stuck in my brain. It's not all quick jump scenes, but instead, it also has scenes that scare without having a blast of music or a quick run across the screen. This is a film that wants to, and almost transcends the genre of typical horror fare, but kind of falls into a middle ground between trashy horror films and well thought out horror films. Either way, it is still one of the best horror films to come out in the last few years.After their son falls into a mysterious coma, Josh and Renai Lambert begin seeing and hearing frightening things in their new house. They decide to move, and still, mysterious creatures inhabit the house. After calling in a psychic, they learn that their boy is a skilled astroprojector, and in his sleep, his soul traveled too far from his body, and was trapped by malevolent spirits. It's up to Josh to think back to his repressed childhood and astroproject himself to find his son in a horrifying place called ""The Further"".This horror movie has something that most recent one's haven't, and that's likable lead characters that the audience actually cares about. Unlike typical ""kill 'em off"" horror flicks, this film develops it's leads enough for the audience to root for them, instead of rooting for their death. The writing wasn't too bad, and the decisions the characters make don't usually come off as completely idiotic. Often in horror films, the characters never seem to remember the scene before and stay in the house for another night, and while there is a little bit of idiocy going on here, the characters seem real for the most part and don't forget previous scenes of terror just to keep them conveniently in harm's way.Horror is the genre here, so the question is, ""Is this movie scary?"" I would say it definitely is. The atmosphere is tense, and even when nothing is happening, and we aren't waiting for something to happen, things can be really creepy. A scene where Patrick Wilson is looking at drawings is enormously creepy, and never does a jump happen, or does the film make you believe one is coming. A few images here have stuck with me, and when they appeared in the film, they were both genuinely startling, and disturbing, where they stay with you much after the movie is over. And this film is consistently scary. Even the chaotic musical score was scary, and fairly memorable, and I haven't had the music in a horror film stick with me since maybe ""The Sixth Sense"".Rottentomatoes has started writing sillier and less reflective summaries of their movies since they hooked up with Flixter, and this one is a great example of how much I disagree with them. They refer to the third act as shaky...I would actually say that was the most original and interesting part of the entire movie. The astroprojected world is an example of how this film transcends the typical horror movie. It's so creative, and understated at the same time. It's dark, and creepy, but also surreal and artistic, and the creativity of the third act makes this movie feel more like the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Poltergeist"" than say ""One Missed Call"". The dream world is dark and hard to see, but that only makes it all the more fascinating, and the whole trip to ""The Further"" is worth admission price alone. It's an original aspect of a not-so original, but nonetheless effective movie.It was thrilling to see such a competently made and genuinely scary movie in this ever dwindling genre. I highly recommend this one, for a good and scary time at the movies, with a film that surely won't be soon forgotten like so many others of the genre.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for terror and violence, and language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Somewhat slow at the beginning but solid end,"The build up to when everything goes down is a bit slow but I think necessary in amplifying the emotions you feel in the last sequences. There are jump scares though what I found to be most terrifying is the imagery - imagery being one of the motifs of the story as well, initially using drawings and photographs and then to dreams.The music feels a bit cheesy but works and it was a fun movie with solid composition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Was that Darth Maul? WTF,"I really wanted to like this. My sister had seen it a year ago and said it was too twisted and scary and that I shouldn't watch it. So I didn't. But it kind of made me want to watch it more. So I watched it with really high expectations. All i can say is the movie was terrible. The only ""scares"" were jump scares, which don't count because that's being startled, not scared. The ""demon"" was hilarious. When I first saw it I thought of Darth Maul. Terrible CGI when he walks on the wall. The movie was only an hour and 45 minutes but it felt longer than that because I wanted it to end. I left a poor review on here a while back about the film 'Sinister' and I actually think that movie was better than Insidious. Oh well, guess they can't all be winners.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not original, but not bad either","I think it was 'Poltergeist' which set the template for modern horror, i.e. family finds out house is haunted, doesn't believe it, does believe it, calls experts and then resolution. 'Insidious,' like so many other post eighties horror films, follows that formula to the letter. However, whereas most are pretty forgettable, this one has just about enough scares and creepiness in it to make it worth watching.It's hardly worth going into detail regarding the plot, as I'm reasonably smug that I've summed it up sufficiently in my opening paragraph. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the mum and dad. Yup, they're happy, successful and have three children. They play the parts well from everyday doting parents to disbelieving and supernaturally-harassed protagonists and they do nothing to make you not want to root for them. Especially when one of their children slips into an unusual coma and his housebound ever after. But that's when the haunting begins...Instead of being sucked into the TV-dimension, he's stuck in another afterlife and spirits want to get into our world via him. Those dastardly spirits (including one that looks like Darth Maul from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace – so it's nice to see the poor Sith Lord can still get work after that depressing inclusion into the sci-fi franchise) follow the family from house to house until the mandatory local paranormal expert is called in to sort the spooks out.Cue the resolution. I won't spoil it as sometimes the family wins and sometimes they get horribly murdered and it ends on a downer, but, once again, the resolution follows. Like I say, this is 'horror by the numbers' but it's good enough to watch. If you're a horror fan then you've probably seen better, but that's because you've probably got classic horror films among your DVD collection. However, you probably won't see many – recent – horror films that create a creepy/tense atmosphere. Give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I may never sleep again...,"This is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill ""Supernatural Thriller"". No, this movie is more of a ""Supernatural Spine Tingle-er"". I didn't jump. I didn't scream. Nor did I grip the edge of my seat. I simply tingled at every ""Scare Tactic"" and gnawed my fingernails down to the quick. If you are planning to see this movie prepare yourself for something a little different. Perhaps even lower your expectations. Some moments will seem cheesy, but they are perfectly cheesy. Perfectly ""Insidious"". As far as performances go, they weren't the best I've ever seen. But what this movie lacked in performance was more than made up for by execution. It seemed as though someone took the same dusty, old formula for a ghost story and added more depth to it. Making for a great movie experience. Turn the lights off, and crank your speakers to 10. Because not only are the visual aspects bone chilling at times, the sound alone could rattle your senses dull.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
i loved it,"I really liked this movie. Has some great parts that will make you jump a little. I was scared watching this movie. If ""drag me to hell"" scared You in theaters then this one will too. I also love how they made a SAW reference in the movie. I love Patrick Wilson ever since I saw him in angels in America and hard candy. Docyourself a favor and give this movie a shot. I really don't think you will be disappointed. The movie flowed really well and just as long as you pay attention and aren't brain dead, everything should make sense are the end.

Pretty decent story but the movie was very boring,"The idea of this movie is pretty clever, but the actual execution is quite poor. The movie is a 2 hour snore fest, definitely one of the most boring and least scary horror movies I've seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better than most offerings in today's horror market,"I decided to finally get around to seeing this film after seeing that it was time for the second one to come out and I found The Conjuring to be a pretty good modern horror movie. For the first hour of the movie I found the suspense and scares to be well done. It's not often that I can compliment a modern horror movie for that. For the last 40 minutes of the movie, however, I didn't enjoy nearly as much. While it still had that creepy mood I didn't really have the same feeling as the first half of the film. This movie did a good job of establishing its own mythology in the confines of its world and I found it to be overall pretty well done. However, the being that was shown only in shadows was better done by just sticking to the shadows. Later in the movie they show it up close and it lost a little bit of the edge it had while keeping to the edges of sight. The ""home"" of this thing was also quite well done for the design and definitely had a sense of dark humor about it with the workshop (Tiny Tim music was great).The ending, which a lot of people seem to have issues with, makes sense to me personally just due to all the threads laid out all throughout the runtime. However it left some unanswered questions that I'm hoping the sequel will elaborate on and allow for a 2-part end to this storyline instead of pulling a Paranormal Activity which still leaves some unknown things in the air for years.Overall, I actually do recommend this movie. It has a well done suspense feel for the most part and was definitely an enjoyable film for myself since I usually wind up just rewatching horror movies in the 80s and further back. I gave this movie a 7/10 due to some of the issues with the tone change at the hour mark, the (for lack of a better term) sequel bait ending that didn't fully cover the ramifications, and some points that I just wound up losing interest due to some parts having some slow pacing.Regardless of these things, just watch the movie and decide for yourself. It's certainly not a bad movie by any stretch and will allow for some enjoyment of the modern movie market, at least for a horror fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Decent but not flawless,"Even though this movie came out in 2010, the first collaboration I saw between director James Wan and actor Patrick Wilson was 2013's THE CONJURING. They worked together on INSIDIOUS, and this movie carries some similarities in story. As an audience member, I appreciate how James Wan captures and maintains the flavor of normal people being attacked by evil intending, supernatural forces. Seeing Leigh Whannell's name in the opening credits is always a bonus for me, as I have appreciated all of his work in the horror genre since he first put SAW on the map back in 2004.In INSIDIOUS, we are introduced to Josh and Renai Lambert and their three children, adjusting to their move into a new house. Their oldest son Dalton inexplicably falls into a coma which doctors cannot accurately diagnose, and then we are slowly given the explanation as to what has really happened to Dalton. The story further unfolds as we are told, and then see firsthand, what it will take to bring Dalton back.I got a good scare out of this movie, but found the plot development to be a little slow in the beginning. Also, the character of Elise, the older woman who serves as a conduit between the living and the spirits that travel the netherworld, came on suddenly as too intense and one dimensional. But overall those are small complaints in what was otherwise a solid scary movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Complete failure,"This is a very poor effort. The screenplay is weak. It is overburdened with elements that do noting to further the plot and only confuse the viewer. It literally throws in everything but the kitchen sink, but when it finally reaches the climax, nothing really happens. The scary demon we all knew the protagonists would have to face doesn't really do anything, and the film ends on a lazy anticlimax which may or may not be an opening for a sequel. I was hugely disappointed. Also, the film relies almost entirely on jump scares, rather than a solid, immersive story and suspense. There is no cheaper trick in the book than a jump scare, and that's all this film ever does.You must have very poor taste and very low expectations if this film actually impresses you.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A creepy horror movie.  Its definitely a redemption from today's horror movies.,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: Insidious is one of those horror movies that come once every year or so, that ends up to be very creepy. But not in the sense that there is blood flying everywhere, but in the sense that there are unexpected images, creepy music, and characters you actually give a crap for. Your typical horror movie from the past 10-15 years relies on showing blood, not creepy sounds or other things that makes a film scary.The movie follows a married couple, Josh and Renai, with 3 kids. One being a baby, the second kid being about 6, and the third kid, named Dalton, being about 7 or 8. They live in a very expensive-looking house. Dalton gets into a coma after an accident in the house. I'm not going to spoil anything, but some seriously creepy crap happens around the house, and they're so scared that they move to another house to get rid of the things going on.So they have moved, and the creepy things continue to take place. Josh's mother, has heard about this so she calls a physic named Elise who brings 2 people who reminded me of the ghostbusters. They come and see what's going on, and the woman tells them that it's not these 2 houses that are haunted- it's their son, Dalton, who's haunted.No, this movie is not incredibly original. This movie is almost like Poltergeist, except the kid is haunted, not the house. As unoriginal and cliché as the film is, I still did enjoy it a lot. Patrick Wilson (Josh) is very good here, so is Rose Byrne. They give very good and believable performances. The rest of the cast is solid too.This movie is being said as ""the scariest film since The Exorcist"". Is that true? No, not to me. It's not the creepiest film of the decade, or really anything like that. But it is scary, don't get me wrong. The score is so creepy and fantastic, and really sets the movie's mood right away.Insidious doesn't use much CGI, I only remember 2 times where it used it. A lot of horror movies use CGI for the monsters. Insidious uses these these things, that look almost like a mix of The Joker and Ozzy Osbourne. Or just grandmas with creepy make-up. And that stuff is actually pretty effective and is scary.James Wan, who's the director of the first Saw movie (which is the film that generally agree is the best of that series), directs this film. he is a director that can really scare you, with or without blood. He does a great job managing to make this movie feel like an old, classic horror movie with good scares and good writing. This film has a great ending, one of the best in a while.Although this is a very good horror film, the problem with it is that as it grows more insane, so does the dialogue. Not in a good way. The movies dialogue grows very weak and hokey in the last 20-25 minutes of the film. It really did start to bother me.Overall, Insidious is a very fun film, yet it's not flawless.Insidious- 8/10 or 8.5/10",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A very effective movie to horrify you!!!!!!!,"Saw franchise veterans James Wan and Leigh Whannell team with Paranormal Activity writer/director Oren Peli to give the familiar haunted house story an exciting new twist with this tale of a family that moves into an old house and begins to suspect they are under siege from otherworldly forces when their young son inexplicably falls into a deep coma. As devoted parents Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) struggle in vain to uncover the root cause of their son's condition, the stress of the situation gradually begins to take its toll on their once-strong relationship. Later, when darkness falls and specters appear to reach out for them from the shadows, the frightened parents realize they're dealing with powers beyond human comprehension.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Flawed but scary,"The haunted house genre of horror seems to be making a comeback in recent years. I wouldn't call Insidious a breath of fresh air, but it is certainly a fun addition to the genre. The film teams up director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell once again for a horrifically electrifying film. It tells the story of a family who has just moved to a new house in the country. Shortly after moving there, their son Dalton has an accident that puts him into a comatose like state. It isn't specifically a coma, but the doctors can't discern what exactly the state the boy is in is. The family quickly learns that it has a lot to do with the supernatural as strange noises erupt throughout the house and Dalton's mother starts seeing ghosts. Eventually they learn that Dalton is the one who is being haunted, not the house. And so begins a harrowing effort to cast out the evil spirits which have befallen Dalton before its too late.Insidious has all the chills and frights you would expect from a great ghost story, and it presents these spine tinglers in unique fashions that legitimately frighten and disturb. You'll find some intensely frightening images within this film that are sure to haunt the dreams of the weak minded. There are some disturbing things in here which are hard to shake, and make this film a sadistically fun ride. I really do have to give all the props I can to how scary this film is. I wouldn't call it the most terrifying film I've ever seen, but Insidious knows how to be scary and how to frighten us the most. It isn't the kind of scary that messes with your mind and disturbs you for a long period of time, but it is the kind of scary that makes the film nerve racking to watch, but in the most fun way possible.As far as the real substance, the real story of Insidious it is fairly tailor made to be a basic haunted house film. It throws in the twist of the boy being haunted rather than the house, but all the same principles apply. The family moves to a new house, strange things start to happen, things get so terrifying that a ""specialist"" is called in to perform some sort of exorcism on whatever is being haunted. Insidious is even complete with the two comic relief goofball exorcist assistants who come to the house to perform tests and make sure there actually is a supernatural presence.It is these kinds of flaws that I attribute to lazy screen writing from writer Leigh Whannell. This gentleman is also what kept Saw from being a phenomenal film. His dialogue is very poor and he isn't the best at properly structuring a story and creating believable characters. His writing has certainly improved since 2004, but not enough to make Insidious an outstanding film. He takes the easy way out of writing a haunted house flick, simply going through the motions and not presenting anything substantially original. None of the characters are particularly memorable, except for maybe the exorcist, played by Lin Shane. The story is littered with irrational decisions that only serve the purpose of moving the story along, as well as Hollywood conveniences that don't make a lot of realistic sense, but make for some exciting visuals.But if you put some logic aside and take some of the craziness for granted, Insidious is a very fun film. It is legitimately scary and disturbingly exciting. For a story that doesn't deviate much from the original, it still works in making Insidious an engaging watch from beginning to end. The film's far from perfect, but it's not a total disaster either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I love this movie. Very entertaining,"This movie is SCARY! I started to tear a bit after a few scares and jumps. The atmosphere gives the movie a dark, droned, black, unhappy, but horrifying feeling, and it has so many scary moments. I would recommend this movie to anyone with the urge to be terrified! Lol. First of all, this movie is not for the young ones. It contains very dark, and evil themes that might scare some. The movie is very entertaining and very good. The acting is superb. Everything about this movie is great. Its an old idea put to a new perspective. I would go see this again.

Couldn't of asked for anything more.,"Insidious is... Brilliant.I entered the cinema having absolutely no clue as to what I was in for and as the film started I began doubting the movie as the music was a little over the top for my taste, I wouldn't of seen the plot coming in a million years.I'm not going to spoil any of it for you because I am extremely glad that I didn't know what to expect before seeing this film, I went through so many different emotions throughout the duration of the movie and loved that it was so fresh and really did the horror genre proud! It's been an incredibly long time since I've seen a horror movie that I left satisfied with, well I left the cinema with shivers down my spine as the music started again and the massive red block letters of INSIDIOUS appeared on the screen. The ending will leave you in a state and I can confidently say that if you're the same as me, it's like watching a whole movie about your worst nightmares as a kid.I definitely recommend this to anyone that has missed watching a movie that gives you the shakes, makes your pulse race and leaves you terrified. A definite 10/10 from me and a guarantee that I'll be having nightmares tonight, completely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Entertaining and definitely above what passes as average nowadays,"A family of five - including two boys and a baby girl - have just moved into their new home. They attempt to settle in and go about their lives until one morning the father discovers the eldest boy, Dalton, has slipped into a coma; doctors are baffled by his condition. Whilst he is tended to in his home, the family begin to experience strange goings-on in the house.This is the premise for Insidious; a modern horror that makes a solid attempt to deliver a haunted house film reminiscent of Poltergeist and the likes. It opens with a suitably creepy scene in which the camera pans from room to room in a house whilst all sleep, following a foreboding silhouette in a window until fixing upon the figure of an old woman. This really sets the tone for what is to come and draws the viewer right in. What follows in the next hour-and-a-half is pretty much what this film's audience will be expecting but the results are still well executed; the shocks put in place throughout the course of the film are generally well timed and many of them genuinely make the skin crawl regardless of whether or not it's something you're likely to have seen before in a film.Whilst the climax may be a bit generic and will therefore likely disappoint some, it's a decent enough pay-off if all you want is to be entertained. I personally thought it worked and felt natural in context with all the events leading up to it. If I had to give another criticism, it would be the characters who are just bland. But who goes into a film like this for its performances?If you're one of those who complains about all the gratuitous violence and gore in horror these days, you'll find Insidious quite welcome. It isn't massively original and probably isn't a film worth watching again, but it is still well worth seeing and I would recommend it as an excellent rental choice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
bad trailers don't make bad movies,I absolutely LOVE scary movies..since I was only a little kid I would bribe my mom to let me watch them.I have to say that this movie was one of the best if not the best movie I have seen to date.It had all the regular things you expect but they took it to another level.When the movie started I was kinda worried because I had dragged my sister with me and if it was a dud I'd never hear the end of it but by the first half in I had bruises on my arm from her grabbing me.I screamed more than once and have to admit only to you that I did cover my eyes once...OK twice.Yeah I who loves scary movies covered my eyes.If you haven't gone to see this movie yet because of those horrible commercials you may have seen on t.v. check out IMDb trailers or Moviefones.I'm glad I did.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lifeless camera eye,"This fails both in terms of writing and execution. It's a shame that innovation within the horror genre has been close to non-existent in the past couple of decades, especially in Hollywood. This is so simple and formulaic that it looks silly instead of scary.We have a family where the dad and his son are able to travel from one reality to another during their sleep(""astral projection""). At the end, the dad must battle his own repressed memories and fears to bring his son from the ""dead"".The writing had some of the essential structural elements for it to work. However, part of the problem for me here was that the ""reality of the dead"" was underdeveloped which made it difficult to believe and become invested in. The tension and the energy, that I saw glimpses of in ""Saw"", were absent as well. It seems that James has lost his way somewhat. Horror thrives on the synchronization of musical patterns with the dance of the camera eye. Unfortunately, the camera here is lifeless.This made a lot of money. I wonder if the viewers will trust James next time. But yet again, I am not sure if we remember what a well-made horror movie looks like.2/5 - FormulaicP.S.

Why did I not go see this in theaters?,"Let me start off by saying there are too, too many poor horror movies made. the one word titled monster movies filled with gore were too much. thank God for INSIDIOUS!! this movie had little blood. You know a horror movie is good when it can scare you without splattering blood and entrails everywhere! I will explain now why i think insidious is the best horror movie i think of all time.First off, i do not scare easily. i just can't. when this movie was over, the smallest crack or whistle made waves of goosebumps run down my arms. second, i jumped more than a ditsy schoolgirl with a jump-rope. third, the camera angles and quick jolts of subliminal faces and shadowy figures were a blast. by the end of it my heart was pounding, my arms were trembling, and I was begging for the movie to continue. characters, protagonist and even antagonistic were sublime, and the tension the movie built made this movie absolute fun! i give this movie a 9 out of 10 for an unresolved absence of a character during the second half of the movie, it never answered that. but my friend had to bring that up, i was too in love with the beginning, middle, and end of this movie and i have never been this scared in my life..

Really good,"Its very hard to find a good horror movie these days but insidious is definitely one of the better ones. I loved insidious for not doing a lot of cheap jump scares or using lots of gore, Insidious is a lot more subtle than that. It might be something in the background but its a lot creepier when you notice the scare after a few seconds. It had a bit of originality in it but it was a little too close to other paranormal movies to be extremely memorable. That being said as I sat there in the dark at 2 in the morning watching this, it did terrify me. It may not be as original as Saw or Paranormal Activity when they first came out but it is certainly a good horror movie, and with Insidious 2 coming out it could be the start of a new franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Life is all about relativity and humor is by far not used enough in movies that call themselves scary.The only thing that bothered me were the much to overdone and loud sound effects.It didn't need them to make the case and it started annoying me after a while.

This will be a classic.,"It's so easy to make a horror flick, but difficult to make a great one that scares the pants off you and stands the test of time. There are so many being churned out at the moment, a lot which just go straight to DVD. They can be made on the cheap and generate a decent profit for that reason.I saw Insidious today and thought it was very refreshing. It is incredibly bold in the way that it plays with the genre. In the beginning we're led to believe that this is just one of your average, straight-up haunted house flicks, but as the film progresses, it takes many twists and turns. It seemed to touch on the Sci-fi genre a bit as well, which I thought was brilliant. This could've ended up being quite hokey, but the screenplay is well written and the lines are delivered believably, although some people seem to have an issue with the acting. I also thought the score was superb, very old school. Finally a score which is substantial in the mix, like the good old days.I can understand why some may not like it, as it challenges conventions and expectations, but surely we need new films to be doing just that?

I don't see what all the hype is about..,"Yes, I admit in the very beginning (about 20 or so minutes into the movie), it appears rather suspenseful and the movie appears to be going somewhere. However, after these 20 minutes are up, you might as well turn off your TV because what comes after is just ridiculous. I know people say this film is terrifying and that it doesn't use slasher film elements to be scary, but come on! A man with a poorly painted red face as the antagonist is just laughable.I even found myself laughing at the horrendous acting.. I mean to say that if I came into my son's room and his bed and all the furniture was scattered and broken and there was a bloody hand print on the sheet, I wouldn't just breath heavily and look a little flustered like the parents in this movie. I would be absolutely terrified.. same goes for when the mother sees the man walk through her bedroom in the first house.Regarding ""The Further"" and the ridiculous walk through the father goes through to get his son back, this just proves that Insidious gets worse as it progresses. I watched, daring to believe that this is what people regarded as ""a terrifying movie."" If you are a true horror fan, do not see this pathetic attempt at a horror movie. Perhaps if you are 15 or under, you might appreciate this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Should have been so much better!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Saw""; it was suspenseful and fun; James Wan was almost Hitchcockian in his approach. To an extent I enjoyed its sequel, and this would be thanks to Leigh Wannell, who starred in them, but doesn't ever seem to receive much recognition for the writing. It should have ended there, but what are you going to do, the market is what it is, right? Given that ""Insidious"" sees the two guys back together, and after the rather lacklustre ""Paranormal Activity 2"" and the torture porn of late, I was looking forward to a film that would provide a rare opportunity to enjoy some intelligent and genuinely frightening psychological terror. To an extent, they succeed.First the good. Credit must go to the film for some great casting; I'm a big fan of Patrick Wilson (see ""Hard Candy"" and even ""The A-Team"" for evidence of his ability) and Rose Byrne, who are great as this perfect couple, and very busy character actress Lin Shaye (""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""My Sister's Keeper"" and ""Snakes On A Plane"" to name a few of many!) has great screen presence. The problem is they are under the direction of somebody whose intention with the film falters halfway through, meaning they find themselves either doing things that do not make sense, seem silly and absurd, or worst of all, they are wasted by being given very little to do; this is a particularly bad crime when you have someone in your film with as much to give as Barbara Hershey (""Black Swan"").Wan and Whannell spend pretty much the first half of the movie providing a haunted house setup; the initial haunting, the house move (not really a spoiler, given that the trailer TOLD us what the twist of the story is), and the events that take you to the pivotal point of the film are all done very slowly; some would argue a bit too slowly, but it's good to see him taking his time with the creepy setup. Not since ""The Exorcist"" has there been a horror movie I can think of that has been paced in this way; it causes a restlessness in the audience, and a desire to want the story to push forward, which of course heightens your anticipation and makes you more uncomfortable. Wan is very good at the classic vibe; he actually manages to do what ""Paranormal Activity"" did, but better. He tips his hat to many other classic of the genre, a bit too heavily at points, but it remains very solid and creepy.This only emphasises the disappointment we feel when the film reaches the part of explaining what has happened, and sets up what will occur in the second half. Whether it was Whannell's choice to change gear, or instruction from on high to get away from the ""Paranormal Activity"" similarities (same producing team), we can't know, but whoever's it was, they should regret it. The explanation of things feels like a bad re-working of ""Poltergeist"", and the previously scary techniques are replaced with ham-fisted effects and dodgy makeup. Too much is shown, and due to the look of certain aspects of the piece, it starts to become a bit laughable; the on screen events becomes sillier and sillier, and we reach a point where the tone becomes one of ""creepy computer game"", rather than ""scary horror film"". There is an introduction of comedy into the film that is completely uncalled for and though genuinely funny, the jokes could not be more out of place; they ruin all the atmosphere that has been created, and you know it is going downhill. This is also the point where we have stopped being scared, and this is a problem for any horror film, hurtling towards its final act with the audience having been lost some time ago.Speaking of the final act, it is just absurd, and in thinking about the film afterwards, you begin to realise just how many loose ends there are, how many plot holes are left open, and then the question of whether it is all for the sake of a sequel comes to mind. Given that ""Paranormal Activity"" had one, it is hard to imagine them not pushing for one here, which is a shame, because this should have been the brilliant, one-off psychological terroriser the first half promised so heartily, and not the silly theme park walk-through it becomes.All this said, James Wan has some talent, as he has proved, and I will not give up on him just yet. Worth seeing on the big screen, in a room full of people for some of the jump-scares, but otherwise, ""Insidious"" is one to rent.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great Movie, Watch With a Friend","I'd advise any prospective watchers to stop reading reviews, dim the lights, and buy this movie with no further questions. You may not want to watch it alone, however.Insidious was an excellent movie, and from many angles - at first, it was actually heartwarming, which builds your emotional investment in the family. They're a small family, and they have their issues, but they're looking up and things are getting better. Quickly, however, things start going wrong, and the scares are more disturbing than anything - gore is never used, and blood only in minor ways. This movie uses suspense, mostly, as a scare tactic. One thing that stood out to me was the nature of the ghosts themselves - I don't want to ruin anything, but the ghosts seem unusually tangible for a horror film. They're absolutely solid, as in, they're not translucent or vague in any way, and one of the most stressful (for lack of a better word) aspects for me was how they had a tendency to remain on-camera occasionally, rather than popping in and out for shock value. To wrap this up, Insidious was also a funny movie at times, but without trivializing the dark and dramatic nature of the story. And it was certainly scary.As for that, the scariness, that's definitely why I added ""Watch With a Friend"" to the title. I'm not exactly easily scared by horror movies, even though I sometimes wish I were, but this one's truly different. I know that sounds corny, but really- it's true. This is one of those movies that will have you checking corners like a SWAT team come night. Actually, when the movie wrapped up I thought I was fine. It wasn't until I diverted my eyes from the screen and realized that I was in the middle of a big, dark room with numerous open closet doors and hallways and corners all alone that I started to panic. So, seriously, it may be a good idea not to watch this alone, unless you like that trickling panic that sets in and makes you damn near hallucinate. Just a warning, take it or leave it.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Insidious (2010) - Review and Opinion,"After directing two successful horror titles, James Wan presents ""Insidious"" (2010), a feature that marked the genre and became a great icon of mainstream horror cinema of the past decade.The plot, well written and developed, does not sound particularly innovative compared to other films of the genre, but it brings a breath of originality by including astral projection as a central element. The film resembles a modern version of ""Poltergeist"" (1982), sharing several similarities, such as the child in danger, the paranormal team led by a medium and the family haunted in their own home. The entities presented throughout the narrative are memorable and macabre, which contributed to the film's consecration. As is characteristic of productions directed by Wan, there is a certain excess of unnecessary scares that could be reduced. However, the film delivers one of the most well-planned and striking jumpscares of its decade. Photography and direction are worked to intensify realism, using camera games and strategic framing to increase immersion.""Insidious"" stands out as a notable production, influencing several works of its time. Although its formula remains effective, some of its elements have already shown some wear and tear over the years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Surprisingly Scary! It's been a while so the lack of good horror from Hollywood added a point or two.,"As a horror, scare-you-to-keep-the-lights-on, and guaranteed bad dream after watching movie buff; it's been a LONG time. So someone like me goes into this movie with very low expectations. ""the further...?"" come on. Every aspect of this movie advertises cheese. And interestingly they kept some cheese in there. (Something they could work on) The name too.Regardless, you get a lot more then what you expect.You're swept away into the typical ""our house is haunted and it really scares me: lead-stay-at-home mom/actress; honey you have nothing to worry about: dad-etc.""The spooks come on quick and they crescendo at a good pace, never letting you down.If you're like everyone else in judeo-Christian, post-post modern, western civilization then there is that belief stuck in the back of your head that there IS something going on and there could be something like this happening, somewhere. (i.e. ghosts, demons, what have you, do exist) After too many wobbling camera's, weird walking dirty girls who's hair always covers their face for the first 80%, and paranormal activities abounding, this movie steadies the lay of the horror genre by cutting to the chase quickly, and starts the actors running with good old-fashion, I'm keeping the lights on after I'm done watching this, fun. Right place, right time, not necessarily a perfectly orchestrated piece but it is something to keep for the archives.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Snoozer,"If you want to rent this movie - i would recommend seeing poltergeist instead. The premise and concept is the same as poltergeist although a little cheesier. If you have previously seen poltergeist you would be extremely disappointed in this movie.The acting is somewhat bland and the storyline is overly predictable. The special effects were OK at best, which is faint praise for the amount they spent to develop this film. I would have expected much better than the few parlor tricks and simple props they used in the movie.The majority of the audience left well before the movie was over. I was one of the few people in the theater to sit it out (my date wanted to stay). Most patrons left and went into a different movie (one of the benefits of seeing a bad movie at a multi-plex).I am puzzled by the average/slightly above average reviews. My only explanation is most of the reviewers must not have seen poltergeist. I realize there are few, if any, new ideas in today's movies. This movie is just another unoriginal flick trying to put a slightly different spin on an older story. Your red-box dollar is better applied to renting poltergeist.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Finally,"It has been very well documented over the past 10/15 years that there has been a distinct lack of genuinely frightening films with the horror industry relying more and more heavily on sequels and remakes. And although that there has been some standout films from places such as Europe and Asia with titles such as ""Ring"" and ""The orphanage"", America has seen a noticeable drop in the quality of horror films, although once again with some exceptions such as the ""Saw"" films, ""Orphan"" and ""Cabin Fever. However with the help of brilliant and very underrated director ""James Wan"" horror seems to be making a slight comeback. Insidious has almost everything that i believe makes a film scary, a good amount of jump scares, good tension build-up throughout and a very well made soundtrack and although there is little violence within this film it is neither needed to make the film scary or necessary to the story. The direction of this film is very good with some interesting shot choices and good use of panning and zoom. The actors also managed to do their job very well with some excellent performances from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the parents in the film, Josh and Renai Lambert. There are very few criticisms i can make about his films the biggest being that the main antagonist in this film is built up to be very scary and simply isn't, also towards the end of the film there are some slight plot holes, however neither of these things manage to ruin the overall atmosphere and brilliance of this film. This is a must watch for any horror fan but definitely not for the faint hearted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You have no imagination, much less any ability to suspend belief, which is required by most horror movies these days - and I said 'horror', not the typical slash and gore crap that you probably call horror.With notable exceptions, this is a well made suspense movie that's sure to keep you creeped out. I started watching it at night, then resorted to a daytime viewing. It was just weirding me out too much to watch alone at night.The scariest parts happened in the house, not the father-son episode near the end. And the ending is completely out of left field.

A chilling journey into the paranormal,"""Insidious,"" directed by James Wan, offers a fresh take on the haunted house genre, blending psychological terror with supernatural elements. The film follows the Lambert family as they confront the mysterious and terrifying phenomena plaguing their new home, particularly focusing on their comatose son, Dalton.The movie excels in creating an unsettling atmosphere, with Wan's direction and Joseph Bishara's eerie score heightening the tension. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI adds to the authenticity of the scares. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne deliver strong performances, portraying parents desperate to save their son from a malevolent force.However, ""Insidious"" is not without its flaws. While the first half effectively builds suspense, the latter part delves into more conventional horror territory, which might feel predictable to seasoned horror fans. The climax, though intense, could seem over-the-top to some viewers.Overall, ""Insidious"" is a well-crafted horror film with genuinely frightening moments, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre, even if it doesn't completely reinvent the wheel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"It was good, but will be forgotten.","I'm going to go ahead and say that ""Insidious"" is one of the best PG-13 horror movie of the past twenty years, or at least of the 2000's, only to be beaten out by ""Drag Me to Hell.""""Insidious"" is really scary. Let me just state that now. It is scary because it takes successful horror movies, what was scary about them, and applies them. I noticed some parts borrowed from ""Poltergeist"", ""Drag Me to Hell"", and of course, ""Paranormal Activity."" All of which were scary on their own by using their own method. Notice how i said ""borrowed"" and not ""stolen."" This is only because ""Insidious"" was not a flop, but rather a hit in the horror industry.It's true, the first half of the movie is way more scary than the second. Once the actual story starts to unfold, it feels more like a video game. Yes, i know, it is weird to compare a horror movie to a video game, but i felt as though i was in Silent Hill towards the ending. Not that thats a bad thing, but it is honestly how i felt.All in all ""Insidious"" is really good, but in the near future i feel it will be forgotten. it doesn't go the extra mile, and isn't an achievement in the horror industry.

"In spite of its messy final act, Insidious is clever, well-acted and suspenseful.","Summary: In spite of its messy final act, Insidious is clever, well- acted and suspenseful. 73/100 (B)Insidious is a low-budget horror film directed by James Wan. The first act of the movie looks like Paranormal Activity 2 (without the found-footage), but after the first 25 minutes it becomes more original and some scary stuff start to happen. Wan directs very well, the movie boasts a nicely handled suspense, especially in its first act. In addition, it has terrific sound effects. The acting is superb, Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson were great in their roles. The two main characters performed by Byrne and Wilson were believable and very well developed. Insidious is a spooky, well-acted flick and probably Wan's first good film.As I said above, the plot is refreshing and the scares are effective. The characters are well developed and some of them are funny (in a good way), a great example are the two male paranormal experts, both play a hilarious role without being annoying. The film scares you with some creepy noises and unexpected images. Its final act keeps the tension although it's a bit weak in comparison to the last two acts. During its final act there is a scene where this demon is revealed. It was very surprising for me, the demon itself looks very scary and that whole scene was so terrifying.On the upside, Insidious has some thrilling scenes, good performances and unexpected scares; also, its second half is strangely original. James Wan is a director with experience in the genre and creates here a truly scary atmosphere that is reinforced with strong performances by Rose Byrne, Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye. I also liked the camera work, this movie has lots of creepy shots and a good illumination too. See this film if you're a fan of the genre or if you're interested on seeing a strange, weird ass horror film. Also if you like jump-scares. Insidious is a jump-scare fest, a very good one.On the downside, its final act is strange, sometimes confusing and it almost ruined the whole film for me. During its first half, the movie kept the suspense and delivered lots of scares; however, in its final minutes the suspense was totally gone and the movie was not as terrifying as it was before. I liked it anyway, the whole production design is awesome and the special effects are well done in spite of being a low-budget flick. In conclusion, Insidious is a great, scary flick that boasts a creepy demon and originality. My only issue is the final act, it's such a mess. (B)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It depends...,"So, there is this lovely family in the suburbs, but there seems to be a dark secret. Is it the house? Is it the family?

On the other hand, I'm not sure of this director and above all, this screenwriter, warrants any form of praise. If you like your food premasticated, then enjoy this rehash by all means; it looks like the writer or director has plundered the kitchen of the Friday the 13th franchise, The Shining, and above all the Poltergeist family saga.

I have very mixed feelings...,"As I finally got around to watching this movie (by myself... in the daytime... but I had the windows closed and lights off) because I had hear how scary it was which I cannot disagree with especially as it came from the minds of Leigh Wannell, James Wan, and Jason Blum, all of whom I love for their horror films especially the Saw series and Malignant, but the ending and a lot of the script was rather predictable unlike their previous works. The movie is based on a very original and unique concept about astral projection which is awesome because not many people know about it and there are no horror films based on it to that level (perhaps Freddy Krueger in Nightmare on Elm Street though it is not as scientifically pronounced) or where lucid dreaming is even a factor as in this film. Another thing that takes away from the film is the use of big name actors, in particular Rose Byrne, as horror films always seem so much scarier whenever none of the actors are known by the audience. However, the film has good acting, great writing, and great dialogue and plenty scary for anyone who wishes to watch it. The fact that two or three sequels followed take away from this initial film but I intend to watch them nonetheless. The movie has no reply value but everyone should watch it at least once.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

On contrary, every great horror movie had great music score, as every major movie should have. I'm talking about music, not loud sounds combined with tense scenes which would scare about anyone I know, but has nothing to do with the atmosphere of the movie. Most of new movies are made like that and horrors are no exception. Music was and is great part of those great horrors and I kinda miss that in new ones. I'm no fan of horror like I'm no fan of any genre. I just like good movie.

"A little to unrealistic to haunt you with nightmares, but still very scary.","Director of 'Saw' and 'Paranormal Activity' James Wan returns to the horror genre with an at times, intensely frightening paranormal movie which is undone by a few too many over-the-top moments which make the movie unrealistic and the scare factor evaporates.Let me elaborate. The first half of the movie is chillingly scary and builds up atmospheric tension superbly. The second half of the film is a little disappointing and it is much less scary in comparison to the first half of the film, other than the occasional shudder in the movie's climax.Josh Wilson (Patrick Wilson) is a teacher who's family moves into a new but spacious modern day home. However, he and his wife's life (Rose Byrne) is made a living hell when son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is being possessed by an evil spirit cult, leaving him in a coma like state.The story is gripping and the acting is consistently excellent from each casting member. Patrick Wilson is particularly good as the desperate father willing to attempt anything to save his son; his performance has an emotional presence and he portrays a realistic microcosm as a man in this particular situation.Overall, I found 'Insidious' - at its best - a terrifying and well executed piece on the shoe string budget at its disposal.

Things in the house then start to turn very creepy....The likable Wilson here is the family man back to playing the nice guy we saw in 'Lakeview Terrace' & 'Watchmen' as opposed to his comedic villainous role in the recent 'A-Team'. Byrne here although playing a worn and stressed out mother still manages to look good and demonstrates her range.

Freaked me OUT!!!!,"Malaysian born James Wan is most respected by me for coming up with the whole idea for SAW along with Leigh Whanell. Regardless of this achievement, James Wan has not been in the movie scene with prominent presence. But still to be a name in this industry it takes a good number of years, after all Tom Cruise is yet to receive an Oscar. So James Wan has hope. INSIDIOUS; will this contribute to his career. Well firstly return on investment on the movie was over tenfold with comparison to its budget. So I guess he is doing good and his directorial is amazing and is guaranteed to turn your blood cold and send those shivers through you quite a many times. A very ingenious directorial and a fabulous and innovative story line, almost makes me want to use the word EPIC, however I will save it for a better movie. I watch at least 8 movies in a busy week and I have more movie titles in my movie library than a normal person should have and I have not missed out on many movies especially Horror since it's my favorite of genres. I can confidently say I have never heard of a plot as is discussed in this movie. Unfortunately I am unable reveal any due to the respect of the spoilers.Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) are just settling in after a move and is getting used to their new house. Unpacking of boxes and looking after 3 kids is not an easy task for Renai since she gets quite little support from her husband as he is caught up with most of his work. A house by my opinion which is much bigger than what a normal family would need, they have got it. So as I was saying, settling in is a great challenge for especially when things seem to be moving around on its own. Quite inconvenient don't you think? As a housewife all Renai does is look after the 3 kids during the day and when she does have some free time to unwind on the family piano playing and composing some tunes of her own. Everything was as boring as it could be for a housewife until the baby monitor picks up a whisper. Baby monitors pick up a lot of static; I can assure you this was no static. Yet, there was no one at the other end of the baby monitor either. What was that? What's a prerequisite for a haunted house? Yes you're right, an attic or a basement. Ladies and gentleman we have got an ATTIC! Dalton (Ty Simpkins) stumbles up this attic whilst playing and have an accident; he falls off the ladder trying to reach for the ceiling light. He must be quite weak kid since the next morning, he is in a COMA! Why am I not surprised the doctors are unable to diagnose what's wrong with Dalton since he seems to be perfectly normal for a person who is in a COMA. #now are you thinking of watching the movie? #You will never know how good this movie is and how scary it can get until you try it out. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne put up a great show, I think Rose Byrne is the reason for the movie to be successful she convinced me that having an attic or a basement is a bad idea.

A boy goes into a ''coma'' and is possessed.,"I DO NOT agree with this movie is for ages 15+. I have seen many horror films and this is definitely the least horrific one I have seen. We all have different scary levels though, but to me this was not one best horror films I have seen or one of the scariest. I would say this movie is specifically for ages 12 and up. I would say this is a good movie for sleepover or friend get-togethers because it is not too scary. I would not consider this movie for families. I would give the movie a 6 out of 10 for having to draw many conclusions and not having a very strong plot. Also this movie is very low budget with not many good scary scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
On the edge,"WEll like many horrors,,i was a bit unsure of how scary it was actually going to be considering the rubbish that has been released in the last decade,,But haven't said that i was quite excited as i heard people saying mostly good about the movie. I went to see this movie last week one word 'Amazing', loved every last shiver.. Classic music really the movie went very well with it reminds me of hammerhead horrors.Brilliant. I got a shiver as the first title came up. Very good acting lots of jumpy bits and a thrill through out Highly recommend to watch it. Unusual story line, very gripping, was nice to see a horror with a good story line most movies you get they start off a story line and then the rest is just blood and guts galore and always the pretty young girl survives for of course the sequel..very predictable,,,but not this movie this one has you on the edge of your seat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thumbs up!,"At last! After Poltergeist 1982 (the only spooky yet horror film ever leave the scary effect on me so far), this is the next horror film manage to do the same. The story might be a bit slow on the beginning (but not that slow), but it's picking up after the first 30 min. I can go on watching this film even if it's play for more than 2 hours! Good enough to make me wanting for more. Love the idea of different kind of horror. I'm not a coward person for all that I know but this movie had made me scared, scared enough to make me ask my husband to accompany me to the toilet, thumbs up! But not recommended for younger audience since the entire film from begin to end is scary, might be disturbing for some kids. Gonna watch it again!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Started out great, fell off short pretty fast though","I can't give this less than 6, but I can't maintain dignity and give it higher than 6. The movie has a great start, really great actually. It was hauntingly chilling during the first third or so of the movie, but sadly, it began getting unconvincing and unbelievable as the movie progressed. The story just got so preposterous half way through that I had a hard time sitting through it. I found myself rolling my eyes, sighing, saying to myself ""really...? c'mon"".I love movies, horror movies especially, and if this would have maintained the quality and believability of the first third of the movie it would have been a solid 8, maybe even 8.5. For the most part theacting was decent. As usual Rose Byrne acted her role very convincingly. In fact, I only watched this movie because I hold her acting abilities in high regard after watching 4 seasons of Damages, as well as the movie Just Buried (which I watched 3 times).I think when everything is said and done, I almost wished I hadn't watched it. But Rose Byrne was great, it was chilling for a good 40 minutes or so. I won't say how the ending turned out, because that would spoil things, but I'm a fan of non-typical endings, so I was ""ok"" with the ending.I feel bad giving it a 6/10, because Rose Byrne performed so well, but the story just didn't hold up to my expectations as were established at the beginning part of the movie. I'd give Rose a 9/10 easily though, as an actress. Her husband however... I couldn't get over how fake his snores sounded, call me picky, but they just sounded silly... and frankly, it's silly of me even to be bothered by that, yet, oddly... I am.Worth a watch if you like Rose Byrne, but elsewise I can't necessarily recommend it as it felt unbelievable, preposterous, and drawn out, story-wise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tiptoe Through the Tulips.,"Insidious is directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell. It stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Andrew Astor and Leigh Whannell. Music is scored by Joseph Bishara and cinematography by John R. Leonetti.The team behind ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"" bring us ""Insidious"", one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era. Of course that doesn't count for much with those not particularly struck by the formula, but it does seem to be one of the very few horror sub-genre movies to come out with better than average appraisals.Of course it's not perfect, few films, especially in horror world, can stand up and come through unscathed by critics and fans alike, yet for the like minded adults who can set the mood and channel themselves into the boo jump and creepy atmosphere world wrung out by Wan and Whannell, then this is the bomb.Much has been made of the shift in the last third, where the film brings in Astral Projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed. Undeniably the film runs away with itself, goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging. However, it's interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table, something thrown at the wonderful ""Woman in Black"" that followed ""Insidious""down the pipe. Here the makers offer up something different, true, it hasn't worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked, but personally I found on second viewing it is forgivable. It's like riding your favourite Big Dipper, you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments, but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beat.When ""Insidious"" is hitting its heights it's utterly thrilling and unnerving, paced to perfection, it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor Lambert family. The mystery element is strong, just what do they want? Why is son Dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why? How come the entities have followed the Lambert's even when they move house? The latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay, it's a logical move but so often it's not done in other horror movies. The jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time - seriously, I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" again without my blood being chilled. The use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin, while Lin Shaye's arrival as the paranormal physic, and the subsequent use of a gas mask, keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scale (though once the gas mask scene hits it's where the pic slightly falls away).It borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies, definitely, and the second half doesn't live up to the promise of the first; hell I'll even concede that a certain entity is badly designed, but it does have something new to offer the formula, it's also well performed by the cast, that itself is a rarity. It hasn't resonated with all, but it was a monster hit at the box office, making nearly $85 million in profit. The market for a good haunted house spooker is always open, so Insidious, in spite of its second half irks, sits in the top draw with the best of them. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I expected so much more,"I'm struggling where to begin with this movie.I'm amazed that some people have been so generous with a rating over 3 for this movie. It's the beginning of a franchise that has reached 6 movies and I don't know why!I sat down this evening and decided to watch this as some people have it on their scary movie list. I was told that if you like the conjuring you'll love this!Well, I didn't love it! I actually didn't even think it was worthy of being placed in the genre of horror.There's no special effects that would creep you out. In fact it reminded me of an episode of Columbo that was named ""Murder, smoke & shadows"" because that's all there was at the end of the day.Low level lighting, smoke, shadows, painted faces, stupid nursery rhyme music, children running between screens, bad acting by some & nothing eerie at all!",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very enjoyable,"If you have seen poltergeist and enjoyed it you should enjoy this one as well. It seems clear to me they used poltergeist as a frame work for this movie. It even has a psychic/paranormal expert with two side kicks to track paranormal activity. The movie is scary enough, although I watched it during the day at home on DVD with the blinds down. It has a jump factor and I love the addition and the fact that they show you the main demon, really creepy. The ending left me with some obvious questions and clearly appears to be setup for a sequel. I very much hope they do make one and that it's as good or better than this one. If I can be critical for a moment, the movie felt a little shallow and quick to me and somewhat of a rip off of poltergeist. However, all that being said, it's very enjoyable and worth watching if you are a horror fan or want to get your blood going.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Only watch this if you want a scare.,"In all seriousness, this has to probably be the scariest film I have ever seen in my entire life, and I have seen many horrors.Not only is this movie incredibly jumpy throughout, but it plays with your mind in every way. If you're afraid of scary old women and little girls in horror films, I'd love to see your reaction after you see this. The acting is also pretty good, considering there are little known stars in this.I saw this about two weeks ago and still find it hard to sleep now!

Are you ready for a dark ride?,"This movie is one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen. Before I start my review, let me suggest you to watch this flick in the cinemas or at least with a modern home cinema equipment to be capable to appreciate all the noisy sounds, creepy atmospheres and the brilliant score. I might also warn you. This movie is nothing for people that easily have nightmares. You have to like the feeling of getting scared to watch this movie. I was almost crawling out of the cinema at the end of this dark ride because I had so many moments of scary fears and I my heart pumped like a rattling machine gun but I must admit that I somehow like this feeling and when I got out of the cinema this feeling got away and the film didn't haunt me or kept me from sleeping.As you might already suppose, this film is not your usual horror slasher or gore movie as it works much more with images and sounds. It's a supernatural movie about demons and ghosts but that won't stop you from getting addicted from the bottom to the top to this intense and dark movie. It starts all very slow just to get more and more profound and scary and to end with a big bang and a little twist.This is a movie full of ups and downs. The sound rises, the camera moves into a dark room and an actor opens a door or looks somewhere and you expect something scary but nothing happens at all. You get used to it, the music slows down, the actors breathes and feels relieved when suddenly a dark scheme appears and almost freaks him to death in a moment of relative tranquillity. That's what's so strong about this movie. Even if you know what happens and what the strange things mean or look like, you never know when they appear, how they appear and what happens next. This movie plays with wrong expectations, terrible fears and emotions. I have rarely seen anything that was as scary as this.My only reason to not give the top rating is that the general idea of the movie is nothing new and could have been even more original. But the rest is great from the camera works over the realistic acting to the brilliant score. In times of ""Saw 7"" or ""Scary Movie 4"", this flick is a true relief. It helps to vote up the reputation of a genre that has become too commercial, gore and ridiculous in the last few years and should get the status of a future classic. This movie might be the renaissance of a whole genre and is on one level with the scary classics from the seventies and eighties and unites the old and the new generation with its creepy approach. This is the first big cinematic highlight of the year 2011. Don't miss the chance to watch it.Are you ready for a dark ride?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's alright,"Insidious ReviewJames Wan, who has previously directed the Saw franchise, now is the director of Insidious. The movie's produced by Jason Blum Et. Al with a screen play written by Leigh Whannell. It stars Patrick Wilson, Leigh Whannell, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, and Lin Shaye.Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and his family move into a new house. After Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) mysteriously goes into a coma, his parents begin to believe the house is haunted.Even though this film has: eerie music, dark visuals, and some creepy scenes, it isn't compelling enough to capture my complete interest.Joseph Bishara's score gave off a creepy vibe right from the beginning. In those quiet moments and when the camera walks the audience through the house at night, the haunting score is a nice touch.What makes some of the scenes so intriguing is how dark the visuals are. It gives the movie an extra level of anticipation. Combined with the music and visuals, these reasons are what makes the jump scares so affective.When Josh went into the further (the land between the living and the dead) to try and save his son, the supernatural spirits looked and acted like they were dead. In my opinion, Insidious should have spent more time exploring the creatures in the further, instead of so much time on earth with the Lambert family.Rose Byrne did a good job portraying a scared, yet worried mother. I have conflicting feelings on Insidious, I loved the scary parts, however, the characters didn't seem extremely compelling to me because they didn't have much character development.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Should have been titled ""Look There's Something in the Background *LOUD NOISE!!*""","Insidious should have been titled ""Hey, Look At That Thing in the Background"" or ""Loud Music When You Least Expect It"".

How do actors keep a straight face when making a movie so silly? Chances are you'll jump a few times, but that's because the filmmakers lure you in with the quiet and then throw a loud noise at you with a scary face attached.

A solid movie.,"To be honest, I think the only people who didn't like this movie are the stuck-up wannabe critics who like to sit in their rooms and mock everything because it makes them feel like their opinion matters. There was not much to dislike about this movie. The acting was not bad, the effects were pretty good and appealing to see, and I liked the fact that for once a recent horror film did not involve unnecessary blood and violence. It relied on actual suspense. Parts of it were funny, as well. The only thing that may have lacked a little was the way the plot was put together. Parts of the story were truly obscure and almost seemed a little rushed. But, if, unlike said wannabe critics, you can use a small amount of suspension of disbelief, and do not need EVERYTHING to make sense because you have no sense of imagination, you probably will actually enjoy this movie. However, if your response to movies is usually ""HA! That sucked! I could pull a better movie out of my ass! I'm awesome!"", you'll probably hate it and come write a stupid review about it. In my opinion, one of the best put-together, directed, and acted horror movies of recent times. Not a must-see or instant classic, but a solid watch and a fun time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

INSIDIOUS - It wasn't scary... it was TERRIFYING.,"I never really wanted to buy the DVD. I was looking for ""The Expendables"" but the video store had none, so I bought a DVD of ""Insidious"". Due to the disappointment I experienced, I readied myself for an extremely cheesy ""horror"" film. (Although my friend said this was very scary, I dismissed that thought for a while.) Well, what do you know? This movie is not scary.IT IS TERRIFYING!To be extremely honest, I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and felt so horrified. Think ""Paranormal Activity"" and you'd expect jump scares. This movie thinks disturbing (super-disturbing) images. Think ""Saw"" and you'd expect even at least one gore scene. There wasn't any. This movie thinks of turning the otherwise mundane Lambert family's life into a shock fest chock-full of spooky guitar strings and smiling corpses. And don't think you'll be limited to a single apparition. This movie thinks A WHOLE DIMENSION of lost souls craving for life. Add a very disturbing demon and you're more than sold! The plot is unique. (To me, at least. I don't know how many movies have this plot, if there are any.)And the ending was a total shock that, when I thought I saw what was coming, the movie twists the whole thing around and makes you re-think what the hell just happened.""INSIDIOUS"". This wasn't a movie. This was a masterpiece in horror. Promise, every second is a delightfully terrifying treat!10/10 (I would have put 11/10, but the system won't let me.)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pure arrogance and I loved every single second of it.,"Insidious is not an original movie, nor is it groundbreaking. So why in the world did I find this movie so riveting and terrifying? The directing in this movie is fantastically chilling. James Wan masterfully builds tension and earns his scares. From the main title of this movie I was tense and felt something wicked on its way. This film made me feel like there was an evil presence staring me in the face which no other movie has made me feel. Every environment I found the characters in had a life of its own, each one more evil than the last. I felt as if I were walking on thin ice and every scare was a heavier and heavier step. I call this movie arrogant because it does not respect it's audience. It takes everything you have ever felt when watching a horror movie and uses it against you to catch you off guard.

"Suspenseful, yes! Scary? Mootpoint","First of all, I am 38. So, maybe age is a factor. I had nothing to do this evening so I decided to go watch Insidious. I liked the reviews i saw on here that spoke highly of it, and all in all i was not disappointed. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, I did not find it thaaat scary. What I found real scary was the lady behind me who screamed at the top of her lungs every time a door was slammed open or slammed shut. I would rather say you will be startled a lot during the movie, startled rather than ""scared"". In the first half of the movie, what you may find scary is the fear you see and hear everywhere on the actor's faces (And perhaps behind you if that woman finds a seat behind you too). It was during the first half that I was bored with all the slamming doors and gasps leading nowhere. It reminded of the movie Scream Part 1 when Drew Barrymore was being chased outside in the garden and i was thinking ""yada yada they will never kill Drew"" Then she was slain and gone in the first 5 minutes. THAT made the movie. But here on this one, after a 100 slammed doors and screeching windows, I was more exhausted than scared. Then in the second half, what they are afraid of starts to show. The story is a patchwork of so many pieces you have seen from here and there, a minute from the Exorcist, a minute from the Grudge, a minute from Gothica, and indeed a minute from Saw (towards the end when the dad faces his own demons you will see what I mean). the story is nothing amazing and that heck of one single expression on every single actor's face that doesn't change!

Insidious - 2.5 Stars,"""Insidious"" is a horror movie about an average family haunted with supernatural forces that possess a natural tendency to open lots of doors and make funny noises. Most fans of this subgenre will praise it not because it is an excellent film, but because the ones that came before it are infinitely much worse. Have you seen ""The Haunting in Connecticut""?The unlucky family in this horror film is the five members of the Lambert family. Each of them is terrorized by a mysterious creature, but most unlucky is young Dalton, who is in a deep sleep and would not wake up. A doctor says that he isn't in a coma. A psychic claims that his spiritual body is trapped in another dimension she likes to call, The Further. Dalton's parents, Josh and Renai, are, to say the least, confused. Whether any of these explanations makes sense or not is not a major concern, because the story mainly serves as an opening to provide scares.""Insidious"" is conscious of the genre's obvious clichés, but it avoids some of them by conforming to an unhelpful, alternative idea that is soon to be a cliché itself. Characters living in haunted houses are often so traumatized by the ghouls that they forget about the possible action of, you know, leaving the house. The Lambert family makes the practical decision of abandoning their home early on in the film, only to have their efforts thwarted when they are told that it's not the house that's haunted, but their son. ""Oooooooo"". So, instead of one haunted house, we get two haunted houses.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/insidious-movie-review/",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This movie was horrifying,"I just don't understand why people are writing such bad reviews of this movie. I was shaking on the edge of my seat the whole time, genuinely creeped out.

I think my mom almost had a heart attack a few times throughout the film, and she eventually had to leave, because she was beside herself. If you go see this movie, odds are it's going to scare you. If not, maybe you're just not letting yourself be scared. It has the feel that it has been influenced by some other horror movies from the past, but it makes itself unique in many ways as well.

Good horror movie from the golden age of Hollywood horror movies,"Greetings from Lithuania.I saw ""Insidious"" (2010) back on its release. I liked it back then, and liked it the same upon re-watching it now in 2022. This movie is an example of how to make a very effective horror movie having no money, only pure talent behind and in front of camera. And its one of those movies that were created in what i call ""golden age"" of horror movies starting from 2008 until somewhat 2016. A lot of great horror movies were made under the production of Jason Blum - actually, probably the best horror movies in Hollywood history.

"Manages a Good, Creepy Scare Here and There","""Insidious"" belongs to the modern brand of hard-sell horror movies, the ones that try to frighten with loud sound effects, jump scares, and creepy kids.

"A fun, old-fashioned, Haunted House Roller-coaster!","The first minutes of Insidious made it look like what I had thought it would be. A decent-made horror film with decent thrills, although not very original. By the end I sorta was in love with this film, and here's why...The film's basic premise looks like another ghost story, but its actually not like that. As it goes on different images and figures pop up, which I thought was better than just having ghosts. While it's true the basic plot of the film is not very original, there's something quite original about how the film goes about it. I mean, I have not seen a horror film like this, if I recall, in any past years with a climax this 'overboard'. I say that in a good way. Yeah, the final act has been criticized for going overboard, but I thought it made the film stand-out even more. It really does have the tone of a roller-coaster. It sorta reminds me of The Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.Ultimately, I strongly recommend this film. If anything, it is loving in it's ability to play with loud music, creepy, if not scary, images. I didn't find the film scary to be honest, but I had a blast with it, and there are so many 'odd' scenes that years from now I will be seeing over and over again on Youtube.

Mostly these are period pieces set in Victorian or Edwardian times and are generally pretty weak sauce. So it was that I searched out modern ghost stories and came across Insidious.The first two movies are a pair but the third only shares a few characters from the first two chapters and is more a stand alone movie. The second chapter starts more or less where the first ends so it's pretty much essential to see the first movie before watching the second.The first two chapters follow a family whose young son is being haunted. They are helped by a team of ghost hunters and it is this team which appears in the third chapter. Each of the movies feature a young person who is attracting attention from spirits which inhabit a realm called ""the further"". These spirits are attracted to the young person because of their life force, which the spirit wants for themselves. It's all done very well with genuinely spooky spooks and jump scares aplenty. It's nice to see horror movies which don't rely on teenage girls being killed but the instead are intelligent, well written and well acted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Inside you...,"""Insidious"" is a movie that has to do with a boy who the evil spirits trap him and left him comatose. All that starts when the boy started to travel in his dreams in a place that called The Further but this time was lost.I liked this movie because of the plot and the story. I also liked because of the interpretations of Patrick Wilson who plays as the father (Josh Lambert) of the boy and he is outstanding and Rose Byrne who plays as the mother (Renai Lambert) of the boy.""Insidious"" is a movie that has suspense and if you like horror movies then you have to watch it and I am sure that you will like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Clichés galore. Still fun to laugh at.,"Insidious is another one to follow this late horror film tendency which started with the conjuring, to throw all the classic horror film elements onto the grill and shamelessly pretend to achieve something new or fresh, actually not achieving anything at all.As it starts, you can already take your notebook out and start checking on your cliché list: Old widow ghost, check, moving to an old haunted house check, baby monitors check, child's drawings check, rocking toy horse check, skeptical father, kid ghost, twins ghost, Gothic vampire ghost, esoteric technicians installing monitors, esoteric rites, the only missing stuff was the monster of Dr. Frankenstein, the mummy and green slime dripping off the walls.After all that mess, you get to see the father go into the beyond to rescue his child from a pedophile bondage sex loving demon, which instead of horrifying is ridiculous and cheesy as it can get. And predictably, an evil twist the end which of course is the trampoline production wanted to leave there in order to have a stating point for the obvious sequels, because, you never want to stop milking the cookie cutter horror films cow.Seriously, this film is far from horror. Is mostly an exercise for cinema students on how much used resources and clichés can ruin the very fabric of art. Think of this. How many changes should yo make to this film to turn it into a Scary Movie 9 or even an Adventure Time episode? Not many. That's how not scary it is.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Scarier than The Ring, The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity.","What else can I say. At 51 there's not much that scares me in the way of movies since I've seen about every scary movie that's been made, but ""Insidious"" raised the bar and did it with a lot of heart.I can always be reassured of the entertainment value in a movie based on the caliber of actors who choose to be in that movie, and since Barbara Hershey signed on I knew I was in for something with depth and meaning as well as a unique way to tell a ghost story which this movie is and much more.It's how I chose ""The Black Swan"" another of Barbara Hershey's which I also thoroughly enjoyed. Smart actors like Barbara and Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman and others of the same caliber have never disappointed me in the movies they've chosen throughout the years they've been around.Let me just say this movie's portrayal of the paranormal is so uniquely creepy, tense and realistic in ambiance, timing and photography that it's a big notch above Paranormal Activity. I constantly got chills over my entire body literally with how its presented. And the plot is so unique with a great surprise ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Classic Ghost Story with Some Great Scares,"Insidious (2010)*** (out of 4)A father and mother (Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne) are heartbroken when their son falls asleep and never wakes up. It's not a coma but the doctors aren't sure what's going on with him but soon the family start to witness various ghostly figures in their house. When I heard the plot for INSIDIOUS I pretty much wrote it off as yet another haunted house flick but I'm really grateful that I decided to go watch it. I'll be honest and admit that I love ghost stories whether they're in a movie or on something like Unsolved Mysteries. I love them because they really do have a genuine way to be terrifying but quite often they just fall flat on their faces by trying to do way too much. That's not the case here because there are several moments that are so chilling and flat-out scary that you'll be having a wonderful time feeling your body heat lower to pure chills. There were several times in this film where I was rather hot sitting in the theater but something would happen and I ended up pretty much curled up in cold chills. I was really surprised when I saw director Wan's name appear because he's certainly a king of excess, which he showed with SAW but I was happy to see him take the less is more approach here. I'm certainly not going to ruin any of the twists in the story or give away what's wrong with the kid but let's just say there are several ghosts who appear and at times the intensity level is almost too much. Again, I won't ruin the scene but there's one that involves a baby crib that really felt as if someone came up from behind you and stuck a knife in your back. I'm sure if you took a comb over the ""events"" in the movie and the explanation we're given then you could rip the film apart. I think it's fair to say that the movie starts off rather slow and the character development at the start really doesn't do much. I would probably also say that the ended isn't as strong as the stuff leading up to it. I'm sure you could attack a few of the camera shots that are a little too stylish for their own good. You could do all of that stuff but you'd be missing the point because people go into a film like INSIDIOUS to be scared and the movie succeeds on that level. Again, there are several scenes that will turn your blood ice cold. The ghostly images are quite frightening and if you believe in such things they're going to be even more effective. The importance of a film like this is to build up dread and atmosphere and director Wan does both of these things very good. You have an old creepy house. You have lights that don't work as they should. You have floors that crackle and pop with each step. You have a dark attic. All of these elements are in the Ghost Story 101 handbook but it's what you do with them that's important and director Wan puts them all together and delivers a very effective movie. The performances by Wilson and Byrne are exceptionally strong to where you believe they are actually dealing with these events and we get strong supporting work by Barbara Hershey and Lin Shaye.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good one,"""Insidious"" strikes the right chords with a 7/10 rating from me, and I must say, I quite liked it. The acting, particularly Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, adds depth to the terror, drawing us into their family's nightmarish ordeal. The film editing keeps the suspense taut, and its strength lies in its ability to create spine-tingling moments of fear and supernatural intrigue. The music adds a haunting dimension to the story, amplifying the scares, while the cinematography captures the eerie atmosphere effectively.

Definitely an insidious horror film,"You definitely get what you pay for when you see Insidious. Loud booms, a unique premise, and quite a few good scares. It's definitely one of the better horror films I've seen in recent years. It beats the remakes of Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street by a long shot, but still doesn't match the intensity brought in a film like Frozen.The plot: Renai and Josh Lambert (Byrne and Wilson) and their three kids move into a new house which looks like it was built some time in the good ol' days. The eldest of the three kids, Dalton (Simpkins) ventures up to the attic to explore resulting in him falling off a ladder and hurting himself. When Josh can't wake Dalton up the next morning, he takes him to the hospital where we find out Dalton is in a coma after he hit his head when falling off the ladder.After three months, Dalton still hasn't woken up. He is now in The Lamberts' home for in home care. Now a number of paranormal events have been occurring. Renai starts to see different men at night, some resembling demons, and others looking like intruders. It begins to be a nightmare for the whole family.I don't want to go into too much of the story because I feel the less you know going into it the better. I saw this because I heard a few people online say ""it's the scariest film I've seen in years."" I thought I'd see it on the big screen to top it off. It was very effective and very eerie in it's own right, but not a lot is accomplished in it's hundred and two minute run time.We never get a lot of questions answered in the film. It's almost like Battle: Los Angeles. Why is the audience bribed of information? Many don't care, but for someone like me, I want to know pretty much every answer to my questions. But it's a horror film. I must really sound stupid for wanting background information.Insidious is not a slice 'em dice 'em fest so don't go in expecting ""From the MAKERS of Paranormal Activity and Saw"" to go very far. Director James Wan took a little paranormal twist with this and doesn't give us tiresome torture porn or bangs and booms as main scares.

"Great first half, absurd second half","A family is seemingly haunted by spirits from another dimension, which leads to their young son going into a coma. The longer the boy remains comatose, the worse the haunting gets. A medium is brought to solve the issue, who discovers that the boy's spirit is trapped in another dimension known as The Further.I haven't watched very many horror movies at the cinema; mainly because there aren't many top quality horrors out there now. But the pull of a double-bill, and the fact that this is made by the creator of the Saw franchise, dragged me here for this. And for about half of 'Insidious', I was pleased I made the decision to go.The first half of the movie is terrific. The characters and the haunted house is all set-up nicely. You have accomplished actors in Rose Byrne (as Renai) and Patrick Wilson (as Josh) at the helm, and pretty good child actors. Like all good horror movies, the chill factor is amped up. Creaking staircases, dark doorways, scary apparitions – it's all here, and it's all very good. I'll be honest, I was a little scared. There's something quite unnerving about watching a horror movie in a dark cinema, it certainly adds to the ambiance.The second half, though, is ridiculous. As we start to understand what is going on, and what these apparitions are, the film starts to descend into absurdity. The 'monsters' aren't really that terrifying once we see them properly, and the story becomes far too mental for my liking. The best bit about the second half is the introduction of medium Elise (Lin Shaye), who is a breath of fresh air. Similarly, the characters Specs (Leigh Whannell, also the writer) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) bring some much-needed comedy to the proceedings. These three characters keep the film watchable, but doesn't stop it getting ridiculous.'Insidious' is definitely a game of two halves – the setup is nice, the payoff not so much. However, there aren't that many great American horror movies out there. So if we're using its peers as a comparison, then the film is definitely one of the stronger offerings out there. If you're able to tolerate the absurdity of the second half, then I think you'd enjoy the terror of the first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
33 violins,"Mood music, ambiance, and jump scares. If that is what scares you then you must see Insidious. They used 33 violins to create the mood music and ambiance for this thriller.

"Good, but not Great","I finally got around to watching this movie the other day. A lot of my friends have been talking this up as one of the best and scariest horror movies they have ever seen. And while I can honestly say I jumped a few times.... I just don't see how it was that scary. Now don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne both did fantastic jobs pulling off the desperate parent roles. And the little bit that you see him act, the kid was pretty good too. I thought the directing was very good as well. Wan did a good job. The film was dark and gritty. And the jump scares were pretty decent. But in the end that is all that it was to me. A few good jump scares and dark lighting. And I think that that's biggest problem with this movie. There is something lacking in the writing. Which is sad because I'm a big fan of Whannell's other work, with the Saw franchise. But I seriously think he dropped the ball on this one. While the story certainly wasn't BAD. It wasn't great either. It seemed to rely to much on jump scares and never really builds much tension. As I said earlier, I really did like this movie, but I just don't think It's as great as some people say it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Even with this dissonant and fanciful climax that clashes with the realism used until then, Insidious establishes itself as one of the best recent examples of the genre","James Wan and Leigh Whannell stunned the world by releasing Saw in 2004. The pair reunites on the direction and script of a new horror film. Completely distinct from the ""torture porn"" series, Insidious is closer to another scare series, Paranormal Activity - and has, not by chance, the haunting film's director, Oren Peli, in production. The trio employs many of the lessons learned in their previous projects here. First - and most important - they use suggestion to create a powerful atmosphere. In addition, they establish strong emotional connections before they begin to devastate the family at the center of the plot.As has often been proven, the mere suggestion of what might be behind the walls still works as a powerful form of immersion between the viewer and the atmosphere that can permeate horror works. Not surprisingly, the person responsible for the frightening Paranormal Activity appears in the film in question, Insidious, as one of the producers, and anyone who watched that film knows Peli's taste for betting on what the eyes cannot see. And in counterpoint, we have director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, coming from the bloody Mortal Games, indulging in a work that adopts subjectivity as a weapon for a construction worthy of a good film of the genre.Bringing again the acquaintance of the plot of a family that inhabits a haunted house (and because of this, comments about the synopsis become unnecessary), Wan and Whanell's greatest asset in Insidious lies in the clever use of clichés as a mere excuse to craft spooky, spine-chilling sequences. And it is not only in the subversion of clichés that the film finds its great success, but also in the way the script works its characters, transforming them into common figures in the middle of a fantastic situation, easily able to generate some identification with the audience, which obviously contributes to the feeling of fear and claustrophobia.Often, before the scare - and more important than this - comes the suspense generated, the tension caused by the scene, the chills and adrenaline caused by fear; sometimes it's so obvious that something is going to happen, and even then, when it happens, the scare is inevitable (it's the time when essential elements like sound are put to good use). A horror movie has to get the viewer's attention, involve him in the mood of wanting to feel that adrenaline, and creatively cause scares. The plot follows a somewhat disused line these days, which is to tell the story more through the absence of visual information than bombarding the audience with a CGI-created ghost show. In fact, we even have a lot of ghosts in Insidious, but most are made up of actors. And the appearances of these ghosts are quite restricted. In this case, the best scenes in Insidious are those made without seeing a ghost or in which we only have a vision of a shadow. Notably, nothing better than when the medium Elise looks over the boy's bed and seems to see something. Or when the shadow of a strange creature is seen at the bedside of the comatose boy.Insidious is also surprisingly well filmed. There are exceptional sequences, like the shot where Rose Byrne's wife (Omen) goes to take out the trash while a specter dances in the room (and wasn't he there in the corner of the laundry room, facing the wall?). Or the game with angles, with the man in black walking on the porch, and the great scene in which a demon taped to the ceiling is depicted. Wan knows how to use the soundtrack like few others. Armed with extremely uncomfortable songs, which almost form an increasingly strident symphonic disorder, the director fulfills his role of disturbing with his sequences. While this is nothing new in the industry, here (as in much of his work), it makes all the difference. Not to mention the fact that, at times when you think it's necessary, the transition between the diegetic to the extra-diegetic track (it flows from what the character is actually listening to, to what only the spectators hear) are made very efficient and that actually fit the plot.Another very well used resource is photography. With many side camera shots, the director gradually introduces the environment in which the story takes place. In this way, he makes you look at the details calmly, in addition to almost forcing the viewer to pay attention to anything that might suggest a certain importance for the development of the plot. Such use of the resource also makes the rooms appear larger than they actually are. After the plot change point, the image starts to adopt cold and grayish colors, which didactically convey what the characters' emotions and afflictions are. Finally, the union and harmony of the two resources mentioned, result in at least two very efficient jump scares - James Wan manages to scare using only the actors, good makeup and intelligent camera movements.Another great moment in the film is when the father goes to the spirit world to rescue his son. And if in Poltergeist we never saw ""the other side"", in Insidious, it is possible to accompany the father during this good moment in the plot. The Insidious world is shown as a dark place filled with memories of other ghosts. The feeling is almost like being on a ghost train. The totally dark environment dimly lit with red lights, smoke that hides the demonic figures and shows just what is necessary to send chills in the audience through James Wan's framing a disturbing journey, causing chills and apprehension.The script, even if with a certain quality, does not deliver as much as the technical factors. The story, as already mentioned, is based on clichés of the genre, both in its format and in its developments. As usual, the house ends up playing an important role in the story, becoming almost a character, something we are tired of seeing. Another disturbing detail is the lack of communication between the protagonists after witnessing completely bizarre events - which forces them to make highly questionable decisions. Finally, the climax of the third act ends up being a little weak for being too expository, since the greatest asset of the film is the idea of leaving things to the suggestion and imagination of those who watch it.The filmmakers are also betting on a welcome humor, especially in the second half, which makes Insidious bring to mind the eighties productions of the genre and early Sam Raimi movies. The classic Poltergeist - The Phenomenon (Poltergeist, 1982) is also honored more than once. The mix of comic situations and characters (Leigh Whannell himself has a role) with scares, terrifying images and impeccable sound design is accurate.And if Wan surprised in Saw by the creative way his camera could be worked within limited spaces, the director perfects his technique as he walks through long corridors and spacious rooms while still maintaining a growing sense of suffocation and nervousness. Spooky sequences are created from, like the child running through the house in front of mother Renai (Rose Byrne), the depiction of a demon on the ceiling, or when a devilish face is seen on Josh's shoulders (Patrick Wilson, pure charisma). The use of certain artifacts in the projection of a horror film is so characteristic that the use of the element is obvious. James Wan, a filmmaker of memory and the camera game, brings out an essential type of horror especially for new generations who do not always easily find a horror film of other proportions than the one that is exhaustively injected into the circulation, that nothing more is a raw movie with formulas (possessions, free scares and a seemingly happy ending). In Wan's film it is clear to see the influence of fantastic cinema both in its setting and in its climax well used in an agile way, with curious cameras as always, but never for nothing, always looking for and leaving sparks for the final revelation and clues to find the boy (Ty Simpkins) who had left his body in the real plane and his soul in the ""Further"" or ""Beyond.""Something to show Wan's ability, reveals itself even more when during long sequences, especially at the end, the red lights strike, the darkness devours, the creatures already ""known"" by the viewer appear with a different air, the surroundings enter the search for truth and justice, the connection to dreams and briefly to religion (a factor almost impossible to ignore). It makes you believe and then unmasks them, navigating through fears, traumas and childhoods on a journey where the main plot of terror of the plot passes from protagonist to antagonist, reviewing a clear scene where evil is not merely something we think it is, but it is part of a set, something greater than a simple being or something natural.Insidious is a conglomeration of genres and scares, one after the other, based on apparitions, hauntings, dead people walking through the house, footsteps here or there and loud scares punctuating when the audience must scream - that is, you certainly already you've seen it all before, especially if you're a horror fan. Some will really be annoyed, especially the most impressionable ones. The big problem is the inconsistency in the narrative, which in the middle of production, when it abandons the psychological horror (more efficient) to assume a more exaggerated tone, where characters appear out of nowhere to help the family and explain to the characters (and, consequently, to the public), no need, what was going on. Even with this dissonant and fanciful climax that clashes with the realism used until then, Insidious establishes itself as one of the best recent examples of the genre, entitled to all the clichés of all times, but still being a delicious experience, with a terrifying and functional scares.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Darth Sidious 1,"Insidious is really just the same old movie with a bit of polish and a paint job. Don't get me wrong, the paint and polish are nice but when I stop to think about what's actually happening it becomes so obvious how generic this is.Family moves into a house where there's an evil thing, evil thing decides to start tormenting a select couple members of said family, fake out, ending. There's even a whole portion that felt like a straight rip on Poltergeist. The acting is fine, but nothing stellar. Bigger issue is the way the script seems to force some stuff and makes it feel a bit clunky.Still, despite all that, this is filmed brilliantly. There's some legitimately creepy shots here and some fascinating effects. It also does a decent amount of background work which, save for an audio cue, don't have attention drawn to them and I feel like that's often very effective.All in all, the story itself is pretty average, as is the acting but the cinematography really is a saving grace and gives it a bump. If you like horror movies then this one is worth a stream. If you don't, I can't say I felt this was really providing much else to make it more accessible.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Desaturated money-grabbing exercise that somehow does work,"There are a number of negative things that could be said about ""Insidious"": It looks and feels like a TV movie, it doesn't have an original bone in its body, i.e. Is comprised of all the standard horror film elements, the characters are uninteresting and not particularly likeable, either, and you never forget that you're watching a movie that was made to extract money from your pocket. And of course, whenever there is a ghost, it is emphasised with an musical shock effect.Having said all that - the movie is never boring and offers plenty of scares.

To see Malcharon, The chief of Hell's Army,wield his blood covered limbs to torture another undead child in front of it's grieving mother. To see Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, command his swarm to devour the rotten flesh of the dammed for eternity. To see Adramelech, President of the Senate of Demons, drive his fiery spear through the unbeating hearts of the tormented. To see Beleth gather his 85 demon legions, to his trademark brass fanfare, embarking on a violent sortie to sodomise new arrivals fresh from the ferry of Kharron the Boatman. To see all this. This is fear.But this film is OK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Decent, but Wan is capable of better","I'm a big fan of horror director James Wan, but this is the first time I've watched one of his movies and felt underwhelmed. The 'Saw' franchise were much more complete horror movies and 'The Conjuring' remains one of the creepiest, most disturbing films I've ever watched.'Insidious' is still quite scary, but unlike Wan's other films, it didn't have much of an effect on me. Maybe it's because the plot didn't feel believable, or that it relied a little too much on jump scares towards the end. Whatever it was, I just didn't enjoy 'Insidious' as much as I was expecting. There's nothing wrong with it, it just didn't 'wow' me like Wan's other films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Much better than usual,"Pretty standard horror, but convincingly brought with a nice build up, suggestive blurry images, pace, cinematography and acting. No surprises except from the scares and the turn of events at the end. Much better than usual, so as a horror fan I recommend.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spoilt by the comical Ghostbusters.,It's not easy to make genuinely scary horror movie any more. Most great ideas have been done and Hollywood has a lazy habit remaking the best Asian and European horrors and failing Miserably. Insidious is an above average horror that really tries it's best to scare the audience but ultimately is let down by a ridiculous storyline and the introduction of two comical characters.This film is a little bit like freeky 1980's horror film Poltergeist. The kid gets lost in some kind of ghost world so the family call in a specialist to get him back. the problem with this film is that the specialist brings with her a comical pair of ghostbusters and it totally kills the atmosphere.This film does have it's fair share of scary moments and for that it has to be applauded but in the end it just falls short of being a really good horror flick.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finally!,"I watched this for the first time the other day. I was expecting a crappy, wannabe horror film. I've been through the jokes of movies that dare call themselves ""horror,"" such as Step Father, Chernobyl Diaries, Deadly Silence, and (my LEAST favorite) The House at the End of the Street.I was expecting to see a lot of the same mystique. The whole ""What was that!?"" When everyone watching knows it was the bad guy. This film actually was done a LOT differently.I was surprised to learn that this was done by the guys who made Saw, knowing full well the twisted minds that the Kings of all Horror Films. Instead of the barrage of visual horror, used rather effectively in every one of their films, they use psychological more often than not, and do it rather well.How ever, this is not the best film to walk off the movie lot. Yes it's entertaining, yes it does succeed in scaring you, but it's another one of those films that you can go with out seeing, and still be okay. How ever, I am excited to FINALLY see proof that there is still hope for the horror genre after all!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Better Than I Expected, But Not As Scary As Many Claim It to Be","I'm usually not a fan of movies that are full of fake scares, annoyingly predictable musical cues and loud noises, but I was pleasantly surprised by 'Insidious'. And although I don't understand how some think it's the ""scariest movie ever"" or even terribly frightening, I was engaged throughout most of it and never bored. Maybe I'm not scared by loud noises that anticipate scares like I am by atmosphere, but to each their own.I like Whannell's writing and acting, and the ending was well executed and gripping compared to most modern mainstream horror movies. James Wan did a great job directing and making the most out of the small budget, showing how to use practical effects & makeup to create an atmosphere of anxiety towards the end. I wasn't scared so much but the movie was good at what it promises. Way better than 'The Conjuring' & 'Annabelle' movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good ghost story thanks to Tobe Hooper Poltergiest,"Insidious"" ultimately works because of Mr. Whannell's script, which manages to be inventive and unpredictable despite its paint-by-numbers formalism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best horror film coming out from 210-2014,"Insidious is a 2010 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan ( saw , paranormal activity and many more ), and starring Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne and Barbara Hershey. The story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an astral dimension. A family looks to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a realm called The Further. A sequel, Insidious: Chapter 2, was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter. Because of the film's success it was turned into a maze for 2013's annual Halloween Horror Nights. Music- Insidious was composed by Joseph Bishara, who also appears in the film as the demon. Performed with a quartet and a piano, a bulk of the score was improvised and structured in the editing process, although some recording sessions began prior to filming. On describing the approach of the film's soundtrack, director James Wan explained, ""We wanted a lot of the scare sequences to play really silent. But, what I like to do with the soundtrack is set you on edge with a really loud, sort of like, atonal scratchy violin score, mixing with some really weird piano bangs and take that away and all of a sudden, you're like, 'What just happened there?",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It was scary but then it was not!,"I mean, the whole ghosts were very poorly done. Was it lack of budget? The special effects dudes weren't top notch? I don't know but they looked really stupid: like a small town fair horror house. On the other hand, the demon, well, it was stupid too. He really looked badly done with badly makeup. In fact, you could even tell a little bit, the actor portraying him or that it was all makeup. Bad, bad, bad!But this movie scared me because of something, horror movie lack this days. The sound editing was great, superb, really annoying and scary. The sound was great, but everything else, the characters, the plot, the special effects and the funny ""ghostbusters"" dudes was bad, bad, bad!I rate this movie 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The super duper horror movie,"wow, this was the finest horror movie i have seen after evil dead. This is one of the greatest horror movies made.Initially during the beginning of the movie everything looked the same just as any other horror movie I have seen but then this is a whole new concept in horror movies.Watch it to believe it. The acting as well was good but I think the movie is made up of an innovative concept which is new in horror movies and which works !I would give it a 8.Those who love horror movies,please watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
