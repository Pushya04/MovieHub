"Funny, entertaining, a little scary. Perfect as a child's first ""scary movie"".","This movie used to scare me immensely when I was younger. It was the first ""scary movie"" I saw as a kid, and I think that may effect why I love it so much today. Nostalgic purposes, indeed.I think this movie is good for it's purpose. It's not meant to be some life-changing, or hysterically funny, or terrifying suspense movie. It's meant to give you some scares, some laughs, and entertainment. And it does indeed entertain.We've heard since the 50's about little green men, and in this movie, they are there. And they don't even have to come from outer space, just Chinatown. The actual mogwai (what the gremlins are before they transform) are adorable. So at first you are surprised at how this cute little furry creature who sings a little song could produce other mogwais whom are not so nice. I won't give away how they reproduce or turn into gremlins, but it's all kind of strange, and very fantasy-like.A great movies for adults to watch with kids for their first ""scary movie"". I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot. I would recommend maybe six years or older, and if they get too scared, tell them it's really just puppets. (It is.) Overall, this film is entertaining, very 80's, a little scary, and pretty funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best of the small creature attack movies.,"After this movie there were several other movies that tried to capitalize on the success of this movie. For the most part though they failed to live up to the energy and fun of this movie. Heck, not even the sequel of this one had the energy of this movie. Here we have a guy getting a pet as an early xmas gift, a cute creature called a Mogway. It however, does have a few problems, as it needs special care. One thing you can't do to it is get it wet. Well Billy does (that is the guy who got it). This breeds more of the little critters, and they are harmless enough at first as well. Then they are fed after midnight and this turns them into Gremlins. This new form is a beer drinking, candy eating, mischief machine that isn't above killing. Most of the original batch is killed off in a gruesome kitchen scene, but the leader, Stripe, gets away and dives into a ycma swimming pool, so the whole town gets overrun by the little monsters. This movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Even though the Gremlins do kill, this movie never gets as dark as some of the copycats, or too goofy like some of them do. It ends up being a well-made movie that is fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Large numbers of confused parents!!!,"When this movie first came out, a lot of parents made the fatal mistake of thinking it was a cute, children's movie. In fact, it was this movie and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" that prompted the film industry to create the PG-13 rating. This one only got a PG.My mother was one of the parents who confused the movie as one suitable for children.Needless to say I was horrified by this movie as I was only 4 years old. This movie caused me to be severely afraid of the dark for many years. Yet, strangely enough, I wanted to watch it every year at my grandmother's house at Christmas time. It was tradition.I think that if parents knew what they were getting into, this wouldn't have been as big a movie as it was, and would probably have been lost among rummage sales, and good will donations as a movie nobody wanted.I love this movie, and it takes me back to when I was a frightened little boy, who was too scared to check under the bed when he heard those strange noises in the middle of the night. Almost 20 years later, those old scars still haven't healed completely, and sometimes just seeing ""Stripe"" on the cover will send chills down my spine and prompt me to move to a room with better lighting.That's damn good film-making. Freddy Krueger didn't even do that to me.I do get a kick out of the fact that every once in a while, the Disney channel will play this movie around the holidays.Hoyt Axton's monologue at the begining trys to bring us into the movie by being the ""story-teller"" but during the movie, we trick ourselves with ""it's only a movie."" Ending it with Axton's end monologue drags us back into the movie, leaving us with the though... ""There just might be a Gremlin in your house.""",,Anonymous,Horror
Still a classic!,"Made in a time when they had to make use of practical effects instead of CGI, 'Gremlins' still holds very well by today's standards. It's hard to believe this film was made almost four decades ago!The film is an interesting mix of comedy and horror. There are some really silly, illogical moments, but 'Gremlins' is not to be taken too seriously. You might sit shaking your head wondering why the creatures would do the silly things they do, but hey, it's all in the name of fun, right? Since these are also fictional creatures, who's to say what they are capable of and what their behavior should be?Towards the end all hell breaks loose, and some scenes are disgusting (in a comedy-horror good way), and it's wonderful! The film has a good, fairly suspenseful, action-packed final act.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
20th Anniversary Review,"Exactly 20 years ago today ""Gremlins"" opened in theaters across the U.S. It went on to be one of the biggest smash hits not only of the summer of 1984, but of the entire year. And in my opinion, it deserved to be a hit. I remember seeing this movie at a movie theater with some friends of mine right after it opened 20 years ago, and I said afterwards, ""this is going to be a huge hit"". And it was.""Gremlins"" is a story that plays like a darker version of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."" Which is funny, because it was Spielberg himself who had the vision of ""Gremlins"" becoming a movie. Spielberg, along with his then collaborators Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy (the trio founded the production company Amblin Entertainment), served as executive producers of the film. Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies as well as the first two ""Home Alone"" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's ""Piranha"", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit ""Jaws"", and a segment of Spielberg's ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" a year earlier). What they created was a movie that was great fun from start to finish.""Gremlins"" is about a young man who receives a very unusual Christmas gift from his inventor father. He gets a little friendly creature called a Mogwai, which is as cute as a button. But there's a twist. There are three rules that must be followed in caring for the Mogwai: Rule #1 - Keep them away from light; Rule #2 - Don't get them wet; and Rule #3 - Don't feed them after midnight. When the rules get broken, all hell breaks loose as mean-spirited little monsters turn everything upside down. ""Gremlins"" then turns into a super-duper special effects picture, with the creatures created exceptionally by Chris Walas (Oscar winner for the makeup job on the 1986 remake of ""The Fly""). These monsters are scary to be sure, but also very funny with some of the antics they provide.Even though the special effect monsters steal the show, the acting by the human actors is very good too. Zach Galligan makes the most of his film debut as Billy Peltzer, the young hero who tries to stop the gremlins; Phoebe Cates is effective as his girlfriend; the late Hoyt Axton is a hoot as the inept inventor father (some of his crazy inventions are hilarious, especially when the inventions backfire into slapstick catastrophes); Frances Lee McCain is good as the mother and housewife (who has one big scene with the nasty critters); Polly Holliday is wickedly funny as Mrs. Deagle, the meanest woman in town; and Dante regular Dick Miller is a riot as Mr. Futterman, the nice man who's always complaining about hand-made products being made out of foreign parts. Judge Reinhold and Corey Feldman have small roles as Billy's bank co-worker and good friend, respectively, and look for a quick cameo by Spielberg himself.""Gremlins"" was such a big hit in 1984 that it got re-released back in theaters the following year before it made its debut on video. The movie grossed over $153 million at the box office (combining the original 1984 release and the 1985 re-release). And it stands alone as a great creature feature. ""Gremlins"" was also imitated many times shortly afterwards. Following in its footsteps came 1985's ""Ghoulies"", and 1986's ""Troll"" and ""Critters"". All these movies spawned sequels of their own, and none of them came close to capturing the greatness of ""Gremlins"" (although the original ""Critters"" came the closest; it was the only movie out of that bunch that I mildly enjoyed). Six years later came the ""Gremlins"" sequel ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"". It wasn't as good as the original, but it's still a good movie sequel. I'll take ""Gremlins 2"" as well as the original ""Gremlins"" over ""Ghoulies"" or ""Troll"" anyday.***** (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nobody's got a story like this one. Nobody!,"A dark, crazy, twisted, inventive, and violent Christmas classic. There's really no way to classify or categorize Gremlins. It's too mean-spirited to be a kid's film, but not quite intense enough to justify a higher rating (though the 15-rated UK version makes a mockery of the BBFC guidelines). That grown-up 15 logo on the old VHS and the classic John Alvin poster artwork was enough to intrigue me as a kid and I've been hooked ever since.Gremlins has long been an annual tradition for movie fans. The cozy, snowy atmosphere of Kingston Falls (which appears to be in upstate New York somewhere but is, in actual fact, Hill Valley at Universal studios) is the perfect small town that we all wish we came from. Even when the Gremlins invade it's a homely place to be envious of.I was frightened of the Gremlins when I was a kid, but they're really nothing more than gigantic smiles with arms and legs. They exist only to have fun at the expense of human life and private property. I suppose they could be a metaphor for hedonism or apathy. Originally a much more evil script (intended to be an anti-Wonderful Life), Chris Columbus was inspired to write Gremlins as he listened to the rats in his apartment scurry about in the dark during the night. He lightened the material somewhat before filming began, but Joe Dante's wild vision makes it a twisted, festive reality.Special mention must be made of Jerry Goldsmith's outrageous score and that famous theme tune 'The Gremlin Rag', a demented circus fanfare of anarchy and mayhem. It's crazy to think that we had to wait 27 years to get released on CD. It's one of the first movie themes I even began humming as a young child, and I still do to this day.Gremlins sparked the rise of Chris Columbus as a creative force in Hollywood. Only 25 at the time of filming his career has been made up of classics, and Christmas classics, such as The Goonies, Young Sherlock Holmes, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Harry Potter, and Bicentennial Man. Joe Dante never scored a bigger hit, but his subsequent career significantly defined 80s and 90s cinema with movies such as Innerspace, The 'burbs, Gremlins 2, and Small Soldiers. Goldsmith scoring every one of them until his death in 2004 (and movie scoring has simply never recovered from this loss).Neither of them knew the massive franchise and fan-following which Gremlins would provoke, but it certainly deserves it's place in pop culture history.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Infectiously funny,"Zach Galligan plays Billy a young bank clerk, when his father (Hoyt Axton) brings him a some what unusual Christmas gift, a creature known as a mogwai which they name Gismo; his life changes dramatically. After a series of accidents Gismo multiply's and the cute furry offspring soon become little green beasts that terrorise the town, leaving Billy and his girlfriend (Phoebe Cates) to find a way to get rid of these gremlins, before everyone winds up dead.Gremlins is infectiously funny and effortlessly entertaining with its blend of cutsie charm and comic book horror. The creatures themselves are excellently brought to life with some masterful puppetry and Joe Dante's direction really does the film justice.This movie is crammed with memorable scenes, subtle parody and excellent, yet quite humorous horror.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This was THE movie in 1984,"Back in 1984 I was a 11 year old just starting to learn to appreciate movies. In 1984 Gremlins was THE movie. It is the first movie, other than E.T. that had a strong commercial tie-in. I had all kinds of things that were Gremlin, specifically Gizmo related. My favorite was the the little Gizmos and Gremlins that you dropped into water and they grew really big. Man were those things slimy after they grew. No telling what kind of toxic chemicals I was touching with my bare hands. Oh the good old days, I can't help but give Gremlins a 10. It just wouldn't seem right if I gave it anything less. I normally don't like remakes, but I think this one would have potential with all the cool CGI out right now. Maybe Spielberg would even help with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable family movie,"Gremlins is a good family entertainment which is fun and thrilling to watch. Movie's on the point and pacing is also good.

What a blast!,"Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" is an absolutely, amazingly fun time. The concept of the Gremlins themselves being so intriguing and fun, and face it, Gizmo is one of the cutest creatures in cinema history. While this movies first 20 minutes are a bit boring, once the story and absolute fun insanity begins you'll be having such a good time that the run time of the film will completely slip by. I have loved this film since a young age, and sure it may be nostalgia, but god do I really love this movie. I highly recommend watching this on a cold winter night, with hot chocolate, and a warm bowl of popcorn. I guarantee that you will have a fun time with this. It's not a thought provoking film, it won't change your life, but it is a fun ride , completely worth it's length",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
An exciting 80s monster movie for the whole family,"When receiving a brand new pet, Billy Peltzer is told three rules. 1. No Food after Midnight 2. No Water 3. Keep them out of the light. After breaking two of the three rules, his once cute and cuddly pet, Gizmo, squirts out multiplying, aggressive creatures that terrorize a small town.Something so cute and friendly that becomes vicious is a constant fear shown in cinema, even today. Gremlins uses this fear to make one of to make a film that still scares kids now, twenty-four years later. Although Gremlins is quite family oriented, it really is a scary film. It takes a sophisticated idea of nasty things coming in pretty boxes and shows it in a way that is most certainly impressive.Gremlins is not the most artistic movie ever made, but it is most definitely entertaining. After re watching it for a third time after five years, I still laugh at the corny PG jokes and watch intensely as those little creatures tear apart that peaceful town. It is just an entertaining film and there is nothing else to it. Overall, Gremlins will be a classic for years to come due to the original plot and immense entertainment that it provides.I recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It Came From The Eighties,"The sort of film where a good idea suffers from a patchy script and a lot of revisions, ""Gremlins"" reflects the time when it was made. The 1980s were a decade of goofy gimmick movies, and ""Gremlins"" offers exactly that.While scouring Chinatown to sell one of his many inventions, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is introduced to a cute, furry critter called a ""Mogwai."" He names it ""Gizmo"" and brings it home as a pet for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). Gizmo requires special handling: no bright light, no water, and no feeding after midnight. After getting wet, Gizmo produces replicant Mogwai. ""This could really be the big one,"" Randall says happily. He is soon proved tragically correct.When it was released in the summer of 1984, ""Gremlins"" was a marvel of cinematic wizardry on account of the animatronic puppets that make up the title characters. Much of the talk around the film centered on a sequence in the Peltzer kitchen where Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) has to fend off various attacks from the nasty gremlins, and in doing so contributed to the creation of a new MPAA- rating, PG-13.It's a brilliant sequence, the one moment in the film where the special effects (designed by future Oscar winner Chris Walas), the story (by Chris Columbus) and a human performance deliver on the payoff ""Gremlins"" promises. McCain is so intense yet so funny you can get as much from watching her face as you do from the carnage on the countertops around her. It's one of the great moments of 1980s cinema.The rest of the time, ""Gremlins"" is a tonally imbalanced, under- funny concept film that doesn't do much more than flog merchandise in the guise of a story. Conceived as a straight horror film, ""Gremlins"" went through various changes after producer Steven Spielberg took hold of the project, so that when it finally was released, it became a scare comedy without the jokes.Entire plot lines were dropped, but the film is so ineptly constructed that their beginnings remain. We are introduced to Billy's interest in comics, a local pub under threat of condemnation, a poor mother trying to find a way to feed her children for Christmas, an obnoxious co-worker of Billy's played by Judge Reinhold, and other things, all of which vanish when the gremlins take over the second half. None are addressed again; Reinhold, the biggest male name in the cast, disappears entirely once the gremlins attack.Director Joe Dante does what he can to make the filler interesting. I like the Reinhold character's come-on to Billy's girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates), inviting her to his apartment with the tagline: ""I'm talking cable."" It's a very 1980s experience in that and other ways, such as when the gremlins don leg warmers and start flashdancing. But for too long a time, ""Gremlins"" seems to be in a holding pattern, doing nothing much at all except presenting these red- herring story lines that never get resolved while the monsters themselves wait in the wings.It's a very goofy film. One secondary character has a consuming hatred for all foreign things, which he talks about non-stop. A science teacher runs late-night tests on a caged gremlin in a middle-school laboratory. Both father and son Peltzer are walking Murphy's Laws, where anything that can go wrong does. Once they run amok, the gremlins often wear fitted caps and coats, as if they happened upon the little people's section of L. L. Bean.""Gremlins"" kicks into a higher gear with that attack, though it never again achieves anything like the sustained brilliance of the kitchen battle with Mrs. Peltzer. The film posits at one point that the gremlins are subtle creatures who creep into machinery and make the resulting carnage seem like an accident. This would have made for an intriguing idea, but Dante and Spielberg never do anything with it. They are making a gimmick movie, and striving for audience impact in the cheapest way possible.It's fun for young people, I suppose, and those who first saw it when they were children. Give me the sequel instead, where the comedy is much stronger and the story more engaging.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ugly Bunch Of Creatures Causing Chaos,"Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.Basically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn't have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.The film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can't be easy. Most comedy horror films are a joke (such as some of the Ghoulies films which emulated the Gremlins series) but Gremlins is both funny and scary. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well.Gremlins deserves a look from anyone interested in seeing a good comedy horror movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of my personal favorites...,"Some films are not what they seem. Take ""Gremlins"" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see ""Critters""), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future,"" only not quite as eccentric. ""Back to the Future"" came out a year after ""Gremlins,"" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before ""Back to the Future,"" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)""Gremlins"" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like ""Back to the Future,"" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won't kid you -- it's not as complex as ""Future"" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.""Don't ever get them wet,"" Billy is more or less told by his father. ""And don't feed them after midnight."" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film ""Toy Soldiers"" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of ""Gremlins,"" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.)As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.I wouldn't expect many people to love ""Gremlins"" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great Gremlins make an otherwise forgettable movie fun,"I just watched Gremlins for the first time in maybe 20 years, and while that's admittedly a long time, I'm still surprised by how much I didn't remember. Which is everything except the Gremlins.Didn't remember the main star was a teen boy, or that there was a nasty rich lady, or Phoebe Cates, but I sure remember those Gremlins.The movie patterns itself after 50s horror movies, with a pleasant small town overwhelmed by one or more monsters. And like most of those movies, the characters in that small town are bland and generic, with only Hoyt Axton seeming like a character you'd actually want to know better.So at first the movie is pretty much a watchable, vaguely comedic movie about some kid who works in a bank and gets a weird pet. But once things get crazy, the movie becomes a twisted horror-comedy that is terrific fun.This movie is very much one of those film-buff-boy films of the eighties. The movie is constantly referencing other movies, both specifically, as when someone is watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers on TV, and implicitly, as with the doesn't-she-seem-like- Margaret-Hamilton-in-the-Wizard-of-Oz character. This is perhaps why it's a bit more of a horror parody than an actual horror movie - more funny than scary.Anyway, it's not the world's greatest movie, but it is an 80s classic of sorts, and a good Christmas movie if you want something a bit non- traditional.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Remember that old Bugs Bunny ""Looney Tunes"" short? ""Gremlins""","1984's ""Gremlins"" is really one of the best-known of holiday-themed horror and fantasy films that also double as darkly-humored comedies. That's what ""Gremlins"" is, essentially: a Christmas-themed horror-/fantasy-comedy. In that regard, the film has become a perennial Christmas-holiday classic, along the lines of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993) and the more-recent ""Krampus"" (2015).""Gremlins"" is a movie that I grew up watching throughout my childhood, but I don't think that I've ever really sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. But I do know that I've always liked this movie and gotten a real kick out of it.Executively produced by master cinematic craftsman Steven Spielberg, expertly directed by Joe Dante (""The Howling"") and written by future Hollywood hot-shot Chris Columbus (""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire""), ""Gremlins"" is set a few days before Christmas in the fictional Midwestern town of Kingston Falls. As an early Christmas present, Billy (Zach Galligan) receives a mysterious, cute little creature known only as a ""mogwai"" from his inventor father to keep as a pet; Billy names the adorable critter ""Gizmo."" But taking care of a mogwai is a huge responsibility, we learn, and come with three rules that must be obeyed at all times: keep them away from sunlight, don't ever let them get wet, and don't let them eat anything after midnight. Seems simple, right?Wrong.Gizmo accidentally gets wet, and he spawns five more mogwai creatures, but these are different from Gizmo. These newly-spawned mogwai are curiously more malevolent and voracious than Gizmo is, and a series of plot machinations result in them transforming into the true ""Gremlins"" of the film's title, and soon the small Midwestern town of Kingston Falls is overrun with little, reptilian-looking, mischief-making Gremlins. It's up to Billy and his new crush Kate (Phoebe Cates) to put a stop to these creatures before they have a chance to spread beyond Kingston Falls' borders.""Gremlins"" was one of several films released in 1984 that led the MPAA to revise its rating system because the film may not have been suitable for small children - despite its ""PG"" rating. It might have been too scary for some young tastes, according to parental groups who complained about the film's violent content. This led to the ""PG-13"" rating, which is now the go-to rating for most big-budget Hollywood films released today. If ""Gremlins"" was released in 2016, there's no question it would get a ""PG-13"" rating from the MPAA.But nonetheless, ""Gremlins"" is a thrilling, cackling funny little holiday-themed fantasy-comedy film. The creatures in the film, designed by future Oscar-winner Chris Walas (who won an Oscar for David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" in 1986), are wonderful special effects creations - brought to life by a combination of state-of-the-art animatronics, puppetry, miniatures, and stop-motion effects. Gizmo, as the only ""good"" Gremlin, is adorable - but we see what he can become, after witnessing the transformation of his brethren and the havoc they're capable of causing around town. They're dangerous and cause a lot of epic property damage, but Dante and Walas are able to get some incredible laughs out of them later on in the film.""Gremlins"" is a delightful little holiday hoot that you won't see anything like for a very, very long time.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, chaotic, Christmas classic","Classic. This movie is just so so fun. The narration and opening is whimsical and very interesting and even kinda tense. Then when the movie slowly dishes out it's plot gizmo is there being the cutest creature in cinema. Also in general the plot is just fun it's both tense and exciting as it slowly hints at the darker undertones of the movie. When the gremlins do come out the movie is so chaotic and random that it is hilarious, it's exactly my type of humour. The chaos and charisma of all the gremlins is hilarious, the cuteness of gizmo will never get old, the whacky inventions from the dad are always interesting and fun (and very relatable), the music is amazing, the creatures for the most part look amazing and very realistic, this is just a very entertaining and fun kids horror dark comedy Christmas movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not Underrated, Just Underdeveloped","It's strange how some films become not just successful, but hugely successful.  Revisiting this movie recently, it's apparent that not only is it obviously dated two decades later, but it's very much a film which is remembered as being better than it is.It requires an obvious suspension of disbelief to accept the very arbitrary rules of keeping a Mogwai (WHY does feeding it after midnight turn it into a Gremlin?)  That's par for the course for a blockbuster, and not a problem in itself.  The Mogwai's mechanical movement can't help but make it look fake, but we can overlook that too.  The real disappointment here is that the script, having crawled somewhat in the first half, falls away in the second, almost as if the Gremlins themselves had gotten to it in their chaotic manner.  Sure, we see scenes of havoc, but to what ultimate purpose?  The movie got a PG rating, but the Gremlins display the kind of behavior you wouldn't want kids to associate with, especially in the rowdy bar scene, during which Phobe Cates is behind the bar, inexplicably serving them drinks when most people would have high-tailed it out of there as soon as the little devils showed up.The film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone.  Yes, it's a comedy foremost, but with some horror thrown in.  The comedy doesn't entirely work, even and especially in the scenes where the monsters run amok, and the film's lack of real tension undermines any attempt at a darker quality.  It is not aided in the least by the totally nondescript Zach Galligan in the leading role.  He is so bland that if he didn't keep moving you would lose him in the wallpaper.  Hoyt Axton is also ineffective in a stiff, monotone performance as the hapless inventor father, whereas Francis Lee McCain gets to add some beef to her role as typical American Housewife with one of the movie's best scenes as she defends her house, most notably the kitchen, from the Gremlins.  Cates and Reinhold are pedestrian in their supporting roles. The writing is such that the characters pretty much sidle up to an underwhelming resolution, putting the cap on a movie that, like one of Peltzer's inventions, promises much but soon goes haywire.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Mischief and Mayhem in a Cuddly, Furry Package","Gremlins falls into this latter category, and I wondered if it would still hold up after all of these years. In a nutshell, it does... kind of. I love the late 80's Spielbergesque feel to the movie, the quality and tone which I can't ever quite describe but has me thinking of all the films from this era. I love the premise behind the film, Gizmo and yes, the Gremlins themselves. The memorable kitchen sequence still stands up today, and most of the film is carried off to good effect. If you think there's a but in there you'd be right, and this time round I thought the whole bar scene and the finale were too slapstick, but honestly I'm being churlish. This is still great fun, and it's the humor which carries this as much as anything.I do have a couple of problems with the film though. One of them being the casting of Zach Galligan as the son and the main character. When you hear that the father is going to buy a present for his son you automatically assume that the son will be a lot younger than he actually is. I don't know how old he actually is and is supposed to be, but he looked about 19. I just felt that the role was written for a younger character. Saying that there is a love interest in the film (Phoebe Cates) which I suppose couldn't have played if the character was a lot younger. There is another thing I've always wondered. If you can't feed the gremlins after midnight, when can you start feeding them again?! There are also some small roles for future stars Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold. The soundtrack is classic eighties cheesiness in all its glory and splendor. Howie Mandel did a good job as the voice of Gizmo, even if it didn't consist of much. Chris Columbus, Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg prove themselves an excellent team, combining a humorous and witty script with some extremely good movie-making. This movie has become, and will live on as, a cult classic adored by fans of monster and horror films and should not be missed.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a classic alright.,"One of the movies I used to watch, paired with the sequel, as a kid. I wonder if it's next in line to be banned, because the subtext is pretty clear and « offensive ». But who cares, anyway? It's entertaining, the perfect mix of horror and comedy, in 80s little blockbuster fashion. I wouldn't say it's a kids movie, because the horror gets pretty intense sometimes. But everyone can enjoy it, and interpret it differently, depending on your age and state of mind. It did age a lot, though, but it gives the movie a certain charm. It was very similar to Dante's previous work, The Howling. Through cinematography, music and the atmosphere, even. But I often see it as one of Spielberg's on the side movie. My only complaint could be, that they made it too « family friendly », and after reading the original script, I think it would've been better the way they originally planned it. Or maybe not, I guess we'll never know. All we know is how of a cult classic the movie can be, and is still enjoyable after all these years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic Horror/Comedy,"First off I must say I really enjoy watching Joe Dante movies. In fact I can't think of another director I have more fun with watching his or her movies. This I think was his best film. I was lucky enough that at my local movie theatre they were showing free Christmas movies and this was one of the choices. I jumped at the chance and watched this one. Man, I tell you the sound and the music from Jerry Goldsmith were great listening to while watching this film for like the 50th time on the big screen (where it was meant to be shown).The basic gist of the story is well as I mentioned earlier its Christmas and inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is out looking for a gift for his son Billy (played by Zach Galligan). He's going through Chinatown and comes across a store owned by Mr. Wing (Keye Luke). Inside he's got exactly what he's looking for; a cute furry, lovable pet named a Mogwai. Thing is Mr. Wing does not want to sell it. Rand works out a deal with his grandson (John Louie) and gets the pet. Thing is there are three rules that you need to follow: 1) Don't get him wet 2) He hates bright light, in fact it will kill him 3) Don't feed him after midnight. As a first time viewer with no understanding of the Mowgai you are shown exactly why each of these steps need to be followed. To make a long story short these rules are not followed and in the end the nice little town of Kingston Falls is being taken over by green, slimy monsters who to say the least are mischievous.Written by Chris Columbus, who went on to have quite a career directing HOME ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE and a couple HARRY POTTER movies and produced by Steven Spielberg. Also starring Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller, Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold. Howie Mandel did the voice for Gizmo and both Frank Welker and Michael Winslow used their voices for some of the gremlins.The music by Jerry Goldsmith is awesome and was one of my favourites when I was a kid back in the 80s. Its electronic and very 80s. I was whistling it coming out of the theatre.One of the reasons why I love watching Joe Dante movies is because of the hidden things that are in plain sight. For movie buffs I suppose you could say. Like looking for Robby the Robot, the time machine, Spielberg, Goldsmith, Chuck Jones, a Fangoria magazine to name just a few. Its great and Dante always seems to have a wonderful sense of humour in his films as well.On a side note this along with I would say INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM were the movies that helped push along the PG-13 rating. This was rated PG, but the violence and gore are way too intense for a simple PG rating. The one scene in particular (and yes, I love it) where Mrs. Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain) is battling gremlins in her kitchen using a knife, a blender and a microwave all with gory results.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was it supposed to be a comedy or horror?,"I've always asked that. Maybe it's just a parody. But I did enjoy this 80's flick. You have to admit that it is pretty memorable. I loved all the characters. Even the bad guys. It's just fun and exciting to watch. You get your laughs, but at the same time, you get your chills. You do question what age gap this was meant for. I would recommend for pre teens and up. That's for sure. I do have one more question: If the animals can't eat after midnight, then when are they supposed to eat? Even if it's 11:00 P.M., still... isn't that after midnight?Great movie from the 80's. Have fun with it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A ton of fun,"It's fun. In fact, it's a lot of fun.
This was my first time ever seeing Gremlins and to be honest, I had no idea what to expect. I don't think that I could've ever been able to expect this. Who comes up with ideas like filling a movie theatre with Gremlins and making them watch Snow White. Or throwing one of them into a microwave and making its head explode. This movie is just full of the wacky and the wonderful, which I suppose suits the 80s very well.Let me start off with the true hero of the movie, Gizmo. What a special little being. Like mentioned, I had no idea what to expect, and quite frankly, I always thought that this would be a humans vs. gremlins kind of ordeal. It was actually quite fun having one of the creatures fight alongside its human friends.One of the best sequences in the movie is quite early on when the evil gremlins hatch. The scene where Billy's mom goes toe to toe with the first of the Gremlins. It was interesting because in a lot of ways it turned the horror genre completely on its head. The mom became, to a certain extent, the villain, and the Gremlins were the ones being hunted.
Another great sequence was in the tavern where each Gremlin is living its best life. Smoking and drinking and dancing and singing.Some might argue that this a Christmas film. And sure, it could be counted as one. However, I also thought that it worked very well during Halloween. It has monsters, it is surprisingly scary and tense at times, considering that it is a comedy for most of its runtime, and it captures the best parts of 80s horror.
I had a blast with Gremlins and I'm sure I'll visit it regularly in the future around this time of year. It put me in a great mood and made me laugh out loud quite a few times. What more can you really ask from a movie?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is Not A Cute Little Kids Film!,"When this came out, the amazing special-effects helped make this film a big hit, along with an interesting story with a likable little creature (""Gizmo"") who got the viewers involved in the story, rooting for him.However, this isn't some cute little animal picture. His offspring are anything but cute and lovable. They are downright nasty, and scary at times. Because of that meanness, violence and some profanity I do not recommend this movie to kids. The sequel I would recommend instead. That has much more of a comedic tone with less language.There is humor here, too, though, such as the clothing and actions of some of the gremlins. The film is entertaining all the way through, and very intense in spots. On my last viewing of it, several years ago, I was shocked to hear the Lord's name in vain several times by Dick Miller and once by a little kid! That did it for me; now I stick with the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Too scary for kids, not clever enough for adults","""Gremlins"" starts out well enough, as an inventor looking for a Christmas present for his son buys a strange little creature from a Chinese boy, despite the boy's grandfather's warnings that taking care of a ""mogwai"" requires a great amount of responsibility. Gizmo the mogwai goes home with the inventor to a small town where a mean old lady tries to make everyone's life hell and the inventor's son, Billy, has a crush on a girl. There are three rules to taking care of a mogwai: never get one wet, never expose one to sunlight, and never feed one after midnight. Of course, we know that by the end of the movie, all of those rules will have been broken at least once.""Gremlins"" goes downhill once it becomes clear that it's a movie without any kind of intended audience. Gizmo, the only good gremlin, is as adorable as a stuffed toy and the characters are portrayed in a broad way children can easily understand, but shortly after Billy's friend accidentally breaks the ""no water"" rule, the movie turns into something between satire and horror. It's too scary for kids, but not clever enough, scary enough, or sharp enough to hold the interest of adults. Kids will be the ones eager to see the mean old lady get her comeuppance, but the way in which she does will probably give them nightmares. Likewise, Billy's girlfriend's story of why she doesn't like Christmas is completely out of place for a movie geared at children. The movie doesn't know whether it wants us to laugh at the gremlins or to be truly afraid of them. The whole thing might have worked as a campily over-the-top shorter film, but there's not enough substance for a full-length movie, and after a while it grows tiresome waiting for the gremlins to be defeated and the movie to end.I kept thinking of another 80's movie in which buying something strange from an old Chinese man leads to chaos, ""Little Shop of Horrors."" Unlike ""Gremlins,"" ""Little Shop of Horrors"" knows what it is (a satire) and knows who it was made for (teenagers and adults). Its twists and turns are capable of holding the audience's attention and it's genuinely funny. ""Gremlins"" could have been a children's movie about a cute gremlin named Gizmo, a horror film, or a tongue-in-cheek sendup of horror films. Trying to be all three at once doesn't work.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable 1980s Non-Sense,"""Gremlins"" is one of those guilty pleasures.  It is not a very good film, but there is just something about this film that makes it watchable and enjoyable.  Young Zach Galligan gets a pet for Christmas, but everything goes terribly wrong when the pet gets wet.  Now there are several of these cute creatures, but the new ones are evil and after eating a bucket of chicken after midnight, they become the title ""Gremlins"".  Chaos follows and the small mid-western town is torn apart piece by piece.  The film is fun, but pretty short on direction, screenplay, and characterization.  All in all, a film that over-achieves for the most-part.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Horror
Endearing Feel-Good Horror Comedy,"Gremlins is one of my favorite horror comedies in that it boasts some endearing characters, innovative ideas, and excellent execution of story.While this is definitely not for fans of all ages, the exception being younger children, most everyone else will enjoy this fast-paced, twisted romp into the netherworld of magickal, mystical beasties and their lore.Set in what was then contemporary America, and peopled with the popular young actors of the day, this work exhibits some of the same teenage appeal as did most 80's movies, but with the added draw of lovingly created monsters and characters.It is great fun, if somewhat darkling in consideration, although to watch it today, it is rather dated.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie still works,"For me personally, Gremlins is pure youth sentiment. I was only 6 years old when the movie first appeared, but I had a great time watching it then. Of course I wondered what would be left of it now. I'm 20 years older, my taste for movies has developed and I'm used to see a lot of movies (some of them enhanced with the latest technologies and special effects). Would Gremlins still be a good movie or would it all look very dated?Well, I can assure you that overall this movie is still more than OK. The Gremlins still look cool and slimy and the fact that they create a lot of chaos and mayhem is still fun to watch. Another positive thing about the movie is that it doesn't really seem dated. Of course there are always details that remind you of the fact that this isn't a recent movie, but it never really bothered me. If there is one negative thing that I could mention about ""Gremlins"" than it must be the fact that this is still called a horror movie. The Gremlins aren't scary at all, never have been in my opinion. Perhaps to some people they looked scary more than 20 years ago, but today we are used to a lot worse, so calling this a horror movie isn't exactly right anymore.As you probably already know there are three rules that have to be taken into account when dealing with a Mogwai. Never feed it after midnight (otherwise they become monsters), make sure it doesn't get too much light or it will die and never get it wet or it will reproduce. Of course the Mogwai does get some water over him and immediately some furry balls start coming out of his back, which rapidly change into new Mogwai's. The original one is cute and sweet, but his ""children"" aren't that nice. Especially not Stripe, their leader. Soon they turn into little green monsters and start a lot of mayhem.Maybe today it all seems a bit silly, but it still is a very fun movie. And no, it isn't a technological miracle, but that doesn't bother me. The fact that I see it more as a parody on other horror movies and that it still stands after all these years is the main reason why I still cherish this movie. I'm sure that the younger generation doesn't like it anymore because it isn't spectacular enough, but for me this movie still works. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly but a very clever and engaging film- succeeds in both comedy and horror,"I will admit some of it is very silly, but all the same it is infectious fun from start to finish. Directed by Joe Dante, produced by Steven Spielburg and written by Chris Columbus, Gremlins has quickly established itself in my opinion as a comedy horror classic. The direction is rock solid throughout, and is super efficient. The script is funny and inventive, and the story growing from a very simple idea is engaging and delightful. Plus all the characters are credible. And I have to say Jerry Goldsmith's music is a treat, that man knows how to compose a good music score I can tell you. Haunting, shocking and exciting are three ways to describe the score here. The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite. But the acting from the human actors is just as good. Zach Galligan is bland at first, but as the film gets going and you know more of his character you warm to him. Hoyt Axton is indeed a hoot as the inept inventor, and Keye Luke is great as the Grandfather(Mr Wing). Also watch out for a young Corey Feldman as Pete Fountaine. Plus the Christmas speech makes it essential Christmas viewing. All in all, silly it is, but it is clever and consistently engaging. Not only that, it succeeds at both comedy and horror, and that isn't easy to do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Follow 'the rules' to PG horror-lite fun.,"Gremlins came out at the right time. In another decade this low key flick could've sunk without trace even with the Spielberg name prominently associated. But once people realised it wasn't that scary and that it was pretty much all just harmless fun Gremlins took off, even inspiring a same-old sequel that I'll get to soon.A good natured inventor of 'amazing machines that do not work' stumbles across a bizarre, unique and yes; cute pint sized creature in an out of the way Chinatown curio shop. He promptly shills out a couple hundred bucks to the owner's grandson and takes said creature home to the sleepy town of Kingston Falls for his son – who at 20 odd years of age should really be too old for pets, but that's another story.The son is named Billy (Zach Gilligan) and the creature is dubbed Gizmo, the pair bond almost immediately and it seems that aside from 'the rules' it appears that Gizmo is low maintenance and an ideal companion.Aaaaah, but the Rules! Gizmo is a Mogwai, a small fuzzy likable bundle of fur and wing-like ears that hums, gurgles and whistles pure happiness. He appears to be part-ewok with the facial structure of Yoda and the coat of a zu-zu pet. He can eat almost anything, is perfectly happy with only a TV for company and remains cute regardless of the situation.But he happens to be extremely susceptible to bright light (sunlight kills him), has no need for water and in fact the preference is that he steer well clear of it, and in a quite strange twist cannot eat after 12 PM (which leads to many 'what about' logic issues that are acknowledged in the sequel).You'll never guess what happens! It turns out that being exposed to water makes Gizmo reproduce instantly, ping-pong sized fuzzballs that in mere seconds grow to full sized – which still means very small – Mogwais. Only these are a little different to the perpetually cheerful and innocent Gizmo. These ones have a mean streak.Now as it makes no sense to explain three different rules and then not utilise them, that night our furry friends – sans Gizmo – manage to order some late night tucker. This results in a quickfire pupal stage in which they are cocooned in some slimy scaly glowing casings as they trans-Mogwai-fy, followed by a similarly swift re-birth where they emerge as slightly larger, almost hairless, infinitely less cute and more menacing Gremlins.And at this point the film starts earning every bit of its PG rating. The Gremlins immediately set about making mischief, which starts as knocking things over and making a mess, and ends with multiple deaths. As the numbers grow quick the expanded numbers begin to wreak havoc on the formerly quiet little town, and the local residents wonder just what to do with this menace so close to Christmas (it's nearly Christmas, I didn't mention it because it has squat to do with the plot. Neither does the fact that Billy has a pair of pants that burn for his fellow bank employee Kate (Phoebe Cates), that also is a meaningless sub-plot that only means the two have someone to hold onto as they flee the Gremlins).Nothing is taken seriously – nor should it be when you are dealing with a film involving small scaly mischief makers. Billy's Mum has a memorable scene in which she dispatches a small group of Gremlins in her own kitchen, and a bar scene with a large group of Gremlins letting off steam is quite elaborate later in the film.The characters are basically caricatures charged only with maintaining shocked expressions once the fun starts, although Billy's Dad steals the show with his positive outlook in the face of his own failings as an inventor. There is also a bitchy local rich woman and a US proud paranoid xenophobe who blames everything on foreigners.The reason though that the human cast are so bland is that any personality would detract from the real stars of the show: the Gremlins, who remain front and centre and tongue in cheek for the last hour of the film. There are dumb ones, sorta cute ones, slightly scary ones and one downright menacing one with a mo(gwai?)-hawk named Stripe who appears more dastardly than the rest.The pace moves along with breakneck speed after the Gremlins are introduced and some of the Gremlin death scenes are perhaps a little OTT gross and gory (which reflects Director Joe Dante's background in B movie horror).All in all though Gremlins is but a good natured kiddie flick with some funny moments and a simple but effective premise, and even though it is now over 25 years old Gremlins remains as effective and as amusing as it was when I first saw it in the 80s.The sequel on the other handFinal Rating – 7.5 / 10. Like night-club pick-ups in the wee hours of the morning, they start small, cute and fuzzy, and often end up big, ugly and scaly. Maybe they too shouldn't eat after midnight.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""That's Stripe he's the leader""","When his father buys his son a pet as a present for Christmas he explains to his son that what he has bought is no ordinary present and that 3 important rules must be followed when caring for this pet; do not expose it to sunlight, do not feed it after midnight and don't allow it near water. However, when one of these rules is breached all hell breaks loose as 1 harmless Mogwai spawns a multitude of variants who are intent on causing as much harm and destruction as possible...After watching Gremlins I got the distinct impression that characters and any semblance of a narrative were never really important at any time; if you look at the majority of the characters they are either dull or undeveloped (or both in some cases). As much as I disliked Mrs Deagle (truth be told I actually found to be an unnecessarily cruel person) she was, arguably, one of the few people in this film to bring that little bit extra to the table. The carefree attitude towards the writing is further highlighted with Corey Feldman's character who simply disappears from the film without explanation?So going away from the characters we move on to the Gremlins themselves who engulf the latter part of the film (the film is called Gremlins so fair enough), but clearly what you take from this film is how funny or scary you find them as characters. I, for one, never found them scary (not even as a kid), but I think that Columbus and Spielberg pitched this as a black comedy more than a horror so I presume that them not being that scary was intentional. However, the Gremlins don't really provide all that many laughs either as they simply go around causing as much chaos, destruction and harm as they can but I have to be honest after about 10 minutes I started to find it tedious, repetitive and a bit boring.I didn't really laugh, wasn't really scared and never got involved in what little story was placed in front of me. Being a bit older now I found the whole thing to be a bit silly and unsubstantial though younger audiences may find it moderately enjoyable. One critic said of Gremlins ""The humans are little more than dress-extras for the mechanics"" which I think is a perfect way of summing up this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly but fun horror movie for teens with a mean streak running alongside the cartoon violence,"Billy's dad is an inventor and is always looking for cool presents for this son. So just before Christmas, when he finds a strange creature called a mogwai in a dark shop in Chinatown, he just has to have it despite the refusal of the owner. The rules for looking after the mogwai (who they rename Gizmo) are simple but an accident sees some water spilt on him, causing a handful more to reproduce from this one. Billy notices a difference between Gizmo and these new creatures but the full extent of the difference isn't clear until he mistakenly breaks the rule on feeding times and a whole new creature emerges.Criminally screened in the middle of the afternoon by Channel 4 recently (they edited out anything unsuitable for a daytime audience) this film is a lot of fun on many levels. At the start the film exists within an all-American small town with snow on the streets, a sense of community and white picket fences everywhere. It is a world that perhaps owes more to Spielberg more than director Dante but it is a world that the latter takes great pleasure in perverting once the film gets going in earnest. The plot is simple and straightforward, mostly relying on the build-to and delivery of the gremlins' antics and the attempts to stop them. In doing so it produces a great fun horror for older teens and adults. It funnier more than scary but it still manages to do the latter well enough to do the job for the younger element of the audience.The manic humour in the ""horror"" is well done and it produces great energy throughout. For adults there is another element in the usual referencing from Dante. It is occasionally clumsy here but mostly it is unobtrusive and funny  Dante never seems to let the film main get away from him and keeps the dark tone going even when his action is a bit silly. The cast are very much secondary to the creatures and their antics (whether it be the cute Gizmo or the much more fun gremlins) and their performances reflect this. Galligan is average while Cates is quite nondescript. Support is OK from the likes of Axton, Feldman and Miller but mostly they are all second fiddle to the creatures.Overall though this is an enjoyable horror movie for younger audiences. It is very, very slightly scary as instead it is darkly funny during the violence. It is engaging even if it gets silly at times and the material is strong enough for an adult audience while also providing lots of film references for those that get them.",,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins (7/10),"Having seen Gremlins a long time ago as a child and liking the film, it was probably best to revisit it to see if it holds up today. The story (mystical creature bought in Chinatown, dad making clunky inventions) and silly dialogue are typical for the time period, it's a total 80s cheese fest. The biggest mistake that the Gremlins filmmakers made was the lead casting of Zach Galligan, who had stiff acting throughout, and Phoebe Cates who hadn't yet blossomed into the actress she would later become. The movie gets good when the Gremlins action picks up and they start causing havoc in town. The little creature's mannerisms and scheming antics are the most memorable aspects of the film. Aside from the fact it's still a fun Christmas movie, Gremlins has slightly too much hype as a classic. Can't deny though, Gremlins is by far the most impactful small creature film to date.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Essential 80s and Christmas movie,"A man gives his son a strange pet for Christmas which leads to their town being overrun by unwelcome invaders.The scene and mood are established in Kingston (substitute Bedford) Falls with its snow covered streets and larger-than-life characters on the eve of the festive holiday. It's not long before the whole town is in a state of chaos that is both hilarious and horrifying at the same time.Watching this as a 6 year old on VHS tape was quite an ordeal. So much so I remember having nightmares over certain scenes and felt compelled to watch it several times to prove I could take it. Good thing I also found it pretty funny and entertaining. After about ten years I grew to love Gremlins as a Christmas movie and a slice of pop culture that felt part of my own identity as an 80s child. Corey Feldman, Judge Reinhold, Donky Kong, ghettoblasters, legwarmers and breakdancing - as a teenager living in the past, what more could you want?As an adult I saw it for what it was: A homage to classic era Hollywood movies like It's A Wonderful Life, The Wizard of Oz and Invasion of the Body Snatchers; A send up of cliched small town America; Wicked satire of greedy, gadget (Gizmo) obsessed consumer culture. Everything from Dick Miller's comical rant about foreign imports to the numerous scenes involving consumer electronics and the local Santa Claus covered in ravenous Gremlins made sense.The creature effects are wonderful and hold up to this day. There is no way you can get those kind of laughs from CGI characters because knowing that rubber puppets are doing all these things is half the fun.All performances are good but really play second fiddle to the non human characters. Memorable supporting roles include Mrs Deagle (substitute Mr Potter/Wicked Witch of the West), Mr Futterman, Gerald (bank) and the oblivious Sheriff and his deputy.If you like your Christmas movies a bit nastier than Miracle On 34th Street but not quite as harsh as Die Hard, you should watch Gremlins. It mixes the heart and soul of Christmas with the teeth and claws of Halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dante's direction is the star.,"From the Christmas tree attack to the gremlins caroling to the speeding stair-chair flying out the window, the ""horror"" sequences are perfectly shot and wonderfully silly, striking the odd tone (mostly) well. I just wish the writing were up to the task; when Cates talks about dad dying in the chimney, it was such a weird jolt. Still enjoyed it, but can't help but feel like I would appreciate it more if I grew up with it. Thanks a LOT, mom.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lovable family horror comedy,"One of my favorite childhood movies. Easy going horror-comedy, one of the very few that succeeds in mixing those two genres and not ending up as complete crap.

The movie that led to the creation of the pg 13 rating,"When this movie came out the same day as ghostbusters and top secret it proved to be quite controversial as the pg rating was more mature than a pg movie. This movie as well as indiana jones and the temple of doom forced the MPAA to create a new rating..pg 13. The first movie to be given the rating was red dawn, and it proved to be quite popular with people of all ages. So was gremlins, the first movie to feature the wb shield in the intro since early 1972 and a successful spielbergian film directed by first time Joe Dante. The effects on this film are timeless and the score by the late jerry goldsmith really shines. The sequel, while not as popular as the first one is more of a comedy and take on culture and has become a cult classic. A prequel is in the works for next year which will show the origins of the mogwai and how they came to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Crazed Holiday Creature Feature That's Good for More Than Just Scares,"With its inane mix of genres, attitudes and inspirations, there's really no good reason for this movie to work as well as it does. Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown. It's not the perfect picture - there are holes in the plot large enough to roll a bulldozer through - but as a sharp, silly change of pace in the holiday season, one could do far worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Expected more, too long","I'd never seen Gremlins as a kid so I didn't watch it through rose tinted glasses like many others here. Personally I found the movie a bit boring and long winded. They could have trimmed it down by at least 20mins. I can't say I felt anything for any of the actors, except the mom. She was great when she had to protect her home! The rest of the characters though, really could do with some more time in acting school. Wooden and unlikeable at best.For a movie with Spielberg as a producer, quite disappoiting. There are so many older 80's movies that are so much better, so I really was left wanting after seeing this film. Don't expect much, maybe you will enjoy it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Capra-esque chaos with a Dante flavor,"Joe Dante was moving up in the world. He'd met some good success with The Howling, caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, and got the assignment to bring the script by Chris Columbus script about mysterious little anarchic creatures at Christmas. He ended up creating one of those Spielberg-tinged films that helped to define a certain feel of 80s family films that had a slightly more dangerous hint to them while also embracing a certain Frank Capra-esque feel of neighborhoods. I wasn't of the generation that really absorbed it through childhood, not seeing it for the first time until I was well into my twenties, but I can easily see how it would affect those who grew up with it more fully than it hit me.In Chinatown, Randal Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), a hapless inventor, finds a strange creature not quite for sale in a little shop and ends up buying it from the owner's grandson, taking it home as a present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). With his father being unable to sell any of his inventions and his mother remaining a housewife, the household is reliant on Billy's job as a clerk as a bank in the little town of Kingston Falls. He's smitten with his coworker Kate (Phoebe Cates) who also works at nights at the local bar, and he's at the mercy of Gerald (Judge Reinhold) at the bank as well as the wealthiest woman in town, Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday), who is a mix between the Wicked Witch of the West and Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life (a film we see on screen more than once).Things go wrong, of course, when Randal gives Billy the creature named Gizmo, and he starts breaking the three rules. He can keep Gizmo out of the sunlight pretty easily, but his young friend Pete (Corey Feldman) accidentally gets Gizmo wet, spawning five more little Mogwai. Billy takes one to the high school science teacher Mr. Hanson (Glynn Turman) who takes a blood sample for...reasons. But this all leads to both sets of Mogwai to getting their handlers to break the third rule, not to feed them after midnight, turning them from Mogwai to the titular gremlins.This is where the heart of the film is: Dante's combination of his love of 50s science fiction schlock with fun toys on screen with the Gremlins causing havoc wherever they go, first in the Peltzer kitchen where Randal's gadgets fill the place, giving the perfect place for Lynn (Frances Lee McCain), Billy's mom, putting one of them in a blender to wonderfully gruesome effect.The final half of the movie is just an escalating series of chaos as the Gremlins get beaten back, come back in heavily increased numbers, and just run amok all over Kingston Falls. The centerpiece really is the scene in the bar, a technical display of different puppets doing a wide assortment of Looney Tunes-inspired antics that really just gets lost in the puppetry and gags but is the most entertaining the movie gets.That's because the actual story is perfectly competently assembled by Columbus in the script and presented by Dante, but it's never really more than competent. It doesn't help that little subplots just kind of disappear like Judge Reinhold's character just not appearing in the film after about the third way mark even though he was obviously built to pay off with some kind of comeuppance in the final act. Billy doesn't really have much of an arc, which isn't a requirement in fiction (look at Marty McFly in Back to the Future), but he also doesn't have much of a goal other than survive the crazy night. Heck, it's not even really a goal to go out with Kate. He convinces her to go on a date with him before the chaos erupts. At least the chaos includes a fun ending for Mrs. Deagle, though.What drives the film is the technical side of things and the comedy, mostly stemming from the work of Dick Miller as a down and out schlub with Dante giving him room to just be himself.It all balances out to an entertaining little film somewhat in the style of Spielberg but undoubtedly Dante's with Dante wearing his influences on his sleeve. It's one of the things I like most about his movies, manifesting in this with the playing of It's a Wonderful Life to the presence of the Looney Tunes stuffed animals in the store late, Dante isn't afraid of paying explicit tribute to the movies and short films that he loved. It gives his films a young kid kind of energy that makes them surprisingly infectious, even if the actual narratives end up somewhat lackluster.Gremlins is a fun little 80s timepiece, Joe Dante's first effort to prove himself on a decently large scale, evidence that Spielberg had an eye for young talent, and an entertaining technical achievement. It really could have used another draft to both cut out some early stuff that got left on the cutting room floor in the edit and to give Billy something more of a specific goal to achieve through the chaos. Either that, or just lean far more into the chaos. Maybe the sequel will choose one of those two directions.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Makes the 80's feel as classic and classy as the 50's...,"It's quite fitting that Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" features many scenes of people watching black-and-white classics on mini-TV sets, one is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (of course, it's Christmas time) and another is ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (""they're here already, you're next!). It's fitting because in a way, ""Gremlins"" is like a Christmas movie victim of schizophrenia, trying to swim in waters that couldn't have been more different, a Capra-like Family Christmas film and a Sci-fi/Fantasy monster B-movie, appealing to kids and moms with so many 'ow'-inducing moments and to teens and young adults with gross violence, only redeemed by its wicked sense of humor.But as twisted as it sounds, the film works and now, it exudes the same classic vibes as these very classics I mentioned, now that the 80's are like the 50's in the 80's. And that's ""Gremlins"" greatest accomplishment in my opinion, it takes me back to a time that will never be again, and it has nothing to do with chronology, but with a sense of innocent fun that I feel has deserted movies and TV programs as well. It's the kind of film that constantly reminds you of the first time you saw it, and your emotions when you discovered this strange big-eyed creature named Gizmo, perhaps the cutest cinematic creation since R2D2, an improved version of the Ewoks with a Disney-eque touch.I'll never forget that winter morning when I was having my breakfast, my father had just recorded the film the previous night, and before going to school, he was in a hurry to show me the first part, and it started with the gift-moment, which till now, remains one of my favorite Christmas scenes ever. It has everything: a family reunion, the lights being turned off giving it a strangely ominous atmosphere, and the little noise inside the package adding to the suspense, not to mention that haunting whistle tune that will never fail to shed a few tears whenever I hear it. Little Gizmo's entrance is one of the most defining moment of the 80's, and most irresistible too.And Gizmo didn't need any computer support, looking like a cute puppet with lips and eyes movements, so well done that you were convinced you were watching a living creature, so the film doesn't overplay the special effects on that level. The gift scene goes on as the mother (Frances Lee McCain) takes a picture of the creature but the bright light startles Gizmo who immediately seeks refuge into Billy's arms, which is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The father (Hoyt Axton) just remembers there are three rules to respect regarding the Mogwai, and I still see my father telling me to pay attention, rising his index finger as if I was the one to take care of Gizmo, so I religiously listened to the rules: no bright lights, no water and of course, no food after midnight.I was young enough not to tell the 'absurdity' of the midnight clause, but smart enough to guess that each of these rules would be broken sooner or later and things would go out on control, yet I didn't finish the film until the year after. My father told me the movie was creepy and after another viewing, even as an adult, I can tell that the little one I was would have been scared by the film. It's a pity that a story that has so much charm and delight to offer in the first part, gets so hideously violent after, even in a fun way. Yet there is a scene where a kid played by Corey Feldman is first amazed by Gizmo but then he quickly loses interest and starts reading a comic-book, there had to be some horror and the cute material was only the set-up (although it's what I love the most about ""Gremlins"").All the horrific events are still enjoyable and were cleverly sugarcoated by Chris Columbus' script, but I just love the non-violent parts, starting with this opening scene in the China Antiques store where the father's discovery feels like a moment borrowed from Indiana Jones (not a surprise when you know who produced the film). I love the Capra-esque look of small snow-covered town Kingston Falls and her Mr. Potter-like figure, an old hag who's the only human antagonist. And then you have Zach Galligan as Billy, and that was a perfect casting, there's so much likability conveyed by his wide-eyed naive eyes and his timid smile that his bonding with Gizmo feels genuine and real, and their interactions contribute to the film's best moments.""Gremlins"" is full of tenderness and that little piano moment remains my favorite one. There is also a great friendship between Billy and his girlfriend played by Phoebe Cates, and what is more interesting than these two characters (certainly less flashy than the Gremlins) is that they remain as vulnerable and human at the end of the film as when it started. They never turn into some last-minute super heroes, and the last scene takes us back to what makes the film such an endearing classic, it's the perfect emotional reward and it's done in a simple and clever way, letting the final voice-over introducing that ""Gremlins"" so Un-Christmas-like score.""Gremlins"" owes its existence to the monster-premise, no one would have cared about cute little creatures otherwise, but it's for the cute moments that I'm sure the film is still appreciated and beloved. It also reminds of the 80's where even monsters-films could afford to be cute, and special effects could be amazing without CGI, and when we could come up with new inventive creature and amazement to the eyes without rebooting or remaking old stuff. And to twice the nostalgia effect, the film doesn't just remind me of this time, but of that first time I saw it. And both were good.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
seeing it as a kid vs an adult,"Seeing this again in a theater today on 35mm, and it strikes me how much this is a product of the 1980's even as it holds up (that is if you are one of those few brave souls who love the hell out of practical effects and creatures that have to be built - so many of these things have great individual personalities and designs, even as they're all either gremlins or mogwais). Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman, for example, plays the sort of borderline-adorable xenophobe - his one character trait here is that he doesn't trust a single thing that comes from another country - that today in America is not so adorable anymore (a Nixon frame on his wall seems quaint by today's standards). And the gremlins themselves can be seen as the sort of ""other"" or ""outsider"" threat that's coming to get us if we're not careful; it's not that we can't or shouldn't have in these foreign critters, but the responsibility is on us, perhaps, to make sure we don't turn them into hideous terrorists....I may be reading a bit much into this. But it's still a piece of Spielberg Americana, a small suburban town (maybe less suburban than ET but close enough) where everyone seems to know everyone, but given Joe Dante and Chris Columbus's extra-dose of love for B movies and Loony Tunes. It also is wonderful as an homage to the sort of small town one saw in It's a Wonderful Life (which we see on a TV here) and gets sort of featured with the one cantankerous woman who practically runs the bank (her storyline gets put by the wayside for one reason or another).Not unlike with the Evil Dead series, the first movie is more of a horror movie than a comedy, and I think it takes a little while for the comedy to find its footing - as a kid I found Billy's dad, played by Hoyt Axton, to be amusing, though now as an adult he doesn't hold up as well with the running gags of his mishap inventions (it's kind of cute, at first, but runs out of steam). But once the bad mogwais and especially the plethora of gremlins take over the town, it is an amazing pop-comedy spectacle. If nothing else it's worthwhile for the set pieces in the second half: that bar scene with Phoebe Cates at the mercy of all these damn creatures (the highlight of this movie for me is the jazzy, Tom Waits-like gremlin accosted by the one with the hand-puppets); all of them watching Snow White; the finale with 'Stripe' and how it's an actually effective suspense sequence, with maybe one too many false endings.And in the middle is little Gizmo, like the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi built for no other purpose except to be sickeningly cute and... who wouldn't want a Gizmo, long as one is responsible for the little guy? It may take a little while for him to become notable to the plot, but when he does it's also a great deal of fun in that finale. So, there is a lot of nostalgia in this for me, as this was one of the first movies I can remember seeing as a little kid. How I respond to it today isn't too different, though I do recognize some of its flaws. Perfect ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Adorable,"This is a fun twist on a Christmas movie. It's kid friendly but it's not a straight up kids movie.The creature design is adorable and it's obviously all practical which makes all the difference, you wouldn't be as endeared to Gizmo if he was just a CGI thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nasty.,"It's disturbing that this film is supposed to be fun and amusing -- the poor befuddled snowplow driver's home being destroyed; the tavern being trashed while the girl is being terrorized, the science teacher viciously attacked, the murder of the town meanie. It would have been quite possible to make the gremlins pesky and troublesome without urging the audience to laugh at horrible misfortune.The characters were all cookie-cutter cliches: wise old oriental, bungling inventor dad, sad-eyed tragic love interest, perky and resourceful kid, and the resurrection of Elvira Gulch, who was a much better character in the Wizard of Oz.Sure, Gizmo was cute, and the scene where the monsters all gathered to watch Snow White had its charm, but overall Gremlins lacks anything endearing or enduring.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Blame My Youth,"I grew up in the 80's. I look back at that time with great memories. From the clothes to the cars to the music and movies, my life was pretty decent back then.I sometimes like to 'relive' my youth and watch some movies that I remember liking as a youngster. Some of the movies still hold up as being great movies...Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Die Hard to name a few.Others are not so great...Crocodile Dundee, Mannequin and Gremlins fit into this category.The concept of this film is fairly great, and I give thumbs up to Chris Columbus for writing a decent script...well, half a script.The first half of this movie isn't too annoying, but when the Gremlins start their wicked ways, I feel like I'm watching an overblown SNL skit. The amount of juvenile humor is just plain annoying. This is one of those movies that was well talked about back in 1984, but cannot stand the test of time.The highlight of this movie for me this time around was seeing the Back to the Future set being used. Granted, Gremlins came out first, but the clock tower will forever be known for Back to the Future.",,Anonymous,Horror
Still Enjoyable After All These Years,"This film begins with a middle-aged inventor by the name of ""Randall Peltzer"" (Hoyt Axton) browsing in an antique shop owned by an old Chinese man known only as ""Grandfather"" (Keye Luke). While there he happens to notice a strange little animal that he had never seen before and, upon inquiring about it, is told that it is called a mogwai. Noticing how cute and friendly it appears to be, Randall offers to buy it but is told it isn't for sale. Somewhat discouraged, he leaves the store but is approached by the old man's ""Grandson"" (John Louie) who secretly hands the mogwai to him in exchange for the money Randall offered earlier. After eagerly accepting the deal, Randall is then informed of 3 basic rules for taking care of the mogwai--with the main rule being to never feed it after midnight. After acknowledging these 3 basic rules, Randle quickly hurries back home where he presents it to his teenage son ""Billy Peltzer"" (Zach Galligan) as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, not long afterward, Billy accidentally feeds it after midnight--and extreme chaos starts from that point on. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I remember being quite entertained by this movie when it first came out and, having now watched it again, I must say that it still retains most of its earlier charm. Admittedly, the CGI and special effects aren't nearly as novel or sophisticated by today's standards but, even so, this is still an enjoyable movie, and I have rated it accordingly.

Comedy?,"Gremlins was a great movie. It was much better than I expected, in fact the only reason I saw it was because it was Steven Spielberg and I greatly treasure many of his films i.e. Jaws, E.T.. But yeah, It was a very good movie seven stars, very entertaining but after watching it it leaves me with just one question. Family comedy? Don't get me wrong, I myself didn't mind Gremlins at all, but I saw almost no comedy whatsoever in this film. What I saw was light Horror that sometimes became very gruesome and dark. Such as the kitchen seen when Gremlin guts fly, and the seen when a man and his wife are plowed by a Gremlin driving their own plow. This movie I would not recommend for the whole family, it's just too dark, I don't think that parents want their children watching a teenager almost being hacked to bits by a demon with a chainsaw.In summary this was an amazingly good movie, I loved it, but the gremlins slaughtering humans and the intense suspense are too much for young children. This movie should have a PG-13 slapped on it, and be watched by a more mature audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
There's nothing quite like Gremlins,"A charming and silly little Christmas horror tale- Gremlins may suffer from some tonal and pacing problems- but it still manages to be more than memorable and an incredibly fun ride. First off, the obvious highlight of this film is of course the titular Gremlins themselves- quirky little puppets that truly encapsulate the style and energy this film has going for it. They are brilliantly designed, in both forms, and it's just so simply entertaining to watch them mess with people- you could easily make a film just entirely of that. The film is rather well written, a terrific and imaginative screenplay by Chris Columbus, but the execution from Director Joe Dante can at times feel a bit off from its often sillier execution. The acting isn't anything special from most of the cast, although I do feel Billy's parents played by Frances Lee McCain and Hoyt Axton are quite charming throughout the film and truly give their roles their all. The pacing can be a bit slow from time to time, and a bit jumpy at others. Some moments are a little too goofy and feel a bit out of place, but in the end, I truly enjoyed Gremlins for what it was and had a blast. It's by no means a perfect movie, but it's incredibly creative and rather fun to watch, and I never seem to get tired of watching it every Christmas season.My Rating: 8.6/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No Water, No Sunlight, No Feeding After Midnight, Or Else","During the year that Gremlins came out I remember watching the World Series that year and at a certain point when a number of bad plays were ruining the San Diego Padres against the Detroit Tigers, Joe Garagiola remarked that Gremlins were cursing the Padres. Garagiola gave a nice plug to what was one of the best films of that year and horribly neglected by the Academy.Hoyt Axton wants to get an unusual pet from merchant Keye Luke called a Mogwai, but he won't sell. Nevertheless his grandson John Louie does sell the cute little Mogwai to him with three conditions that have to be met in their keeping. No water, no sunlight, and no feeding after midnight or terrible consequences will result.Of course the family is delighted with the new pet especially twenty something son Zach Galligan who is the really responsible one in the family. But things do happen and on that Christmas Eve all three conditions are broken and as a result a horde of ugly little Gremlins start running amuck.I do love this film so because it strikes so many emotions at the same time. You love the little Mogwais, but you are terrified at what they've become. The Gremlins are horrifying, but at the same time you will laugh hysterically at what they do to some people. Polly Holliday, fresh from the Alice series on television plays a mean woman in the grand tradition of Margaret Hamilton. What the Gremlins have in store for her is priceless.Gremlins marked the farewell performances of both Scott Brady and Edward Andrews both of whom graced many a film and unlike some character actors from the studio days never stopped working. It's because both of these guys were memorable on the screen.Director Joe Dante, writer Chris Columbus and most of all producer Steven Spielberg who imparted his always imaginative vision to this film have given us a great one, especially around the time of Halloween.

Good,"I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. It's a film that fails to take advantage of its cool premise, that makes you wish they had done better rather than spoiling a good idea.

Fluffy fun for the whole family!,"Warning: the first paragraph of this review is admittedly very sentimental and irrelevant. For the more objective part of the review, please just skip to the next paragraph. Nothing gives me greater pleasure in life than rediscovering my old childhood favorites, only now nearly 30 years later and in the company of my own 10-year-old son, who's also developing an enthusiasm for bizarre cinema! I literally get tears in my eyes when I notice my offspring cheering over the same highlight-sequences in the same movies that I used to love so much myself. I felt this joy during ""Escape from Witch Mountain"" and ""The Dark Crystal"", but never experienced it so intensively as during ""Gremlins"".""Gremlins"" is ideally representative of the creative and highly original fantasy cinema of the early 80s. With Steven Spielberg as producer and, even more importantly, the eternal inner child embracing Joe Dante as director, the film is a gleeful mixture of delightful special effects, classic cinematic tributes, an engaging plot, colorful characters and just the right balance between slapstick and action. The narrative starts in Chinatown, a couple of days before Christmas. Eccentric inventor Randall Peltzer seeks a unique gift for his son, and finds an adorable little Mogwai they name Gizmo. The fluffy critter is awesome, but he comes with a few responsibilities. He cannot be exposed to bright light, should never be sprinkled with water and must never ever be fed after midnight. This turns out to be a lot more difficult than it sounds, and pretty soon the picturesque town of Kingston Falls is overrun with Gizmo's malignant and monstrous offspring. ""Gremlins"" contains far too many highlights to mention, including every word spoken by Dick Miller and every smallest shot of the unearthly cute Phoebe Cates, and it's even more amazing if you can watch it with the entire family... around Christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Early 1980s Film Makes Modern Standards Look Weak,"An inventor father (Hoyt Axton) wants to get his son (Zach Galligan) something special while traveling on the road. Just in time for Christmas, he returns with a mogwai (unknown to him, ""mogwai"" is Cantonese Chinese for ""demon""). A few rules are broken, and soon the town is overwhelmed with reptilian, green-blooded monsters.""Gremlins"" ranks as one of the classic horror films of the 1980s, dark enough to satisfy the horror people and light enough to be funny and almost a family film. The special effects and puppetry, even twenty-five years later, look as good as we can possibly expect. Followed by an equally great sequel, ""Gremlins"" has secured itself as a memorable and must-see film.The cast is crucial to the plot: notably, Dick Miller. Miller appeared in many B-movies in his day (such as ""A Bucket of Blood"") and casting him was brilliant. Howie Mandel provides the voice of Gizmo, before Mandel was the big name he is today. And Phoebe Cates? Oh my! The darling of the 1980s, and she even appears on screen with Judge Reinhold without taking off her shirt.The action, horror, comedy and cast are held together by Joe Dante, still a fresh face at the time. Steven Spielberg hand picked Dante after seeing ""The Howling"" and he could not have made a better choice. Dante will always be connected with ""Howling"", but I think it would not be out of line to say this film eclipsed his previous work and may be his masterpiece.I do not know why someone would not have seen ""Gremlins"", but if not, you really must. Great for fans of all genres. And I personally suggest purchasing the film on DVD. It is loaded with featurettes, deleted scenes and commentary. The Blu-ray offers no additional bonuses, so unless you're adamant about having up-to-the-minute sound quality, the DVD should be fine and affordable.

Good luck *not* getting the theme song stuck in your mind,"A small cinema nearby showed this last night, it was the first time I have watched this since I was a kid, and the first time ever in a cinema, and enjoyed it a bit more now than I did then.Playing off the idea of gremlins wreaking havoc on unsuspecting people (like that old Bugs Bunny cartoon did, and the Terror At 40.000 Feet episode of The Twilight Zone) this shows a sickeningly cute little creature multiplying and mutating into a mischievous little grotesqueries, who, well, wreak havoc on unsuspecting people in a Wonderful Life-like suburb on Christmas Eve.The town and its people are straight out of a Hallmark greeting card, quite a contrast to the gooey, slimy effects. As naive, childlike Billy, Zach Galligan is good, but also an odd character, old enough to work at a bank and go to a bar, yet he lives in his parents' attic and read comic books with 12 years old Corey Feldman. The mother has a great confrontation with a couple of the little freaks in her kitchen, and manages to use the moronic appliances built by her well meaning, yet dim, inventor-husband to kill them. Also, early in the film, a sign outside the bank reads something to the effect of ""Plan for the future"", which is most amusing because Back To The Future was partly filmed at the same locations as this, and even features that small supporting character, Frances Lee McCain .",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Equal parts warm and cynical,"Gremlins is a certified holiday classic that balances its warmth and cuteness with mean spirited laughs. It establishes very simple rules and relishes the chaos caused once they are broken. It's not scary but as a gateway into horror it does a wonderful job acting as the first steps into the genre thanks to some solid jumps and its ability to maintain tension for an extended period of time.Zach Galligan is easy to like thanks to his kind heart and unwavering kindness as he tries his best to support his dad's clunky inventions. Hoyt Axton as his dad is loveable and you feel so bad when his inventions go wrong. The standout character is obviously Gizmo who is adorable from the very start so you become highly protective of him throughout and when he comes to the rescue it's equal parts funny and satisfying.Joe Dante's direction showcases an impressive amount of practical effects for all the titular Gremlins and dispatches them in some pretty gnarly and always funny ways, which also prevents their antics from becoming annoying. Jerry Goldsmith's score expands his range and that never becomes an issue because it's festive when needed and imbued with a catchy yet sinister edge for the suitably cheeky main theme.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Clever subtext behind a seemingly simple 80's ""Horror"" flick.","I watched Gremlins for the first time when I was roughly 10 years old. Naturally, back then, I didn't see past the simple ""monsters killing humans until they somehow die"" theme to the movie. I watched it again today, and it was simply a pleasure. The movie is so jam-packed with symbolism it's amazing.The movie starts off as Billy's dad (A failing inventor, that only creates havoc in Billy's house, by forcing his family to be Guinea pigs for his..""Gizmos"") brings home a seemingly harmless little furry creature, from a species called ""Mogwai""(Chinese for ""Monster"", cute huh?). The old Chinese guy(Not Asian-American, it's the 80's ;) doesn't want to sell him the Mogwai, claiming that it requires responsibility. His grandson(?) sneaks it out and sells it to Billy's dad, telling him the 3 rules he must keep to prevent things from going bad with the Mogwai. Billy's dad drops it on Billy like a hot potato, and drives off, in Christmas, mind you, to pursue yet another convention to market his gizmos.Billy doesn't do much to keep the rules, and one cute gizmo suddenly creates a few other Mogwais. Ones that are not very cute anymore. Those evil Mogwais like technology. They especially like to use it to do bad stuff, which first means cutting off the power to Billy's digital clock, making him break the worst rule of all, and they grow into full-fledged Gremlins(A word describing a malfunction in a technological device. Etymology unknown, at least not to Webster).The Gremlins start wreaking havoc, but almost never directly. Most of the times they are genuine Gremlins in the Machine, that cause traffic lights to go out, disable car breaks, and so on. Billy proceeds to eliminate them all when they gather in a cinema, except the big bad one, which then leads to the movie's climax: One of the irresponsible ones, trying to regain control of something that now controls him.All in all, the movie's general message is ""Your technology might one day wake up and bite you in the ass, so be vigilant"". Of course, that's a very old argument, but hey, that's pretty much all the philosophical depth behind the much-celebrated sci-fi ""masterpiece"", The Matrix(That, along with the ""What is real?"" notion). Gremlins simply presented it 15 years earlier, with no Carrie-Ann Moss in tight latex.Technically speaking the movie is well-made, with cute camera work, and the acting is perfectly fine(Not good, but I think that's due to the rather flat characters).All in all, a good watch for those who have watched it as a kid. I hope there are no Gremlins in my ADSL modem - I'm clicking SUBMIT now :)",,Anonymous,Horror
A pretty good kid-friendly monster movie,"To many who grew up in the 1980's (like I did), Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" was (and perhaps still is) a particular favourite. It was produced by Steven Spielberg at a time when he was practically the King Midas of Hollywood. Although ""Gremlins"" may not have quite the polish of Spielberg's own directorial efforts, it remains an entertaining movie more than 30 years later.The basic premise of the movie is this: A young man is given a strange, exotic pet by his father, along with three rules to be strictly adhered to. Predictably, those rules aren't followed and mayhem ensues. In a broad sense, the movie takes some of its cues from the monster movies of a bygone era but the titular creatures are actually pretty unique. Sure, some elements of the plot don't really make a lot of sense but this isn't really a movie that's meant to be taken seriously.The movie's approach is definitely more comedic than horrific but the creatures are still fairly menacing, particularly for younger viewers. Naturally, the special effects are starting to show their age but they're not too bad overall. Although I'm not in the target demographic for this type of movie anymore I'd have to say that it's a very good example of its type. I mean, how many successful family friendly horror movies can you think of?The cast is pretty decent, considering. Zach Galligan is just fine as our hero, Billy. He's likable and we can relate to him, much like how we can relate to his failed inventor father, played by Hoyt Axton. The gorgeous Phoebe Cates is also here as the requisite love interest, not to mention giving the movie's single most memorable line reading. Lastly, a couple of standouts in support are Dick Miller & Judge Reinhold.From a technical standpoint, the movie is nicely assembled but not really exceptional. Joe Dante's direction is competent and the movie generally looks decent, including the aforementioned special effects. Jerry Goldsmith's score has some memorable themes but the sound is very much of the 80's, which isn't really to my liking.Overall, ""Gremlins"" isn't exactly a masterpiece but it is a worthwhile piece of fantasy/horror that delivers where it counts most: entertainment value. It will probably help if you're viewing this movie through nostalgic eyes but it's hard to deny that there's just something special about this movie. In short, ""Gremlins"" still captures the imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

80s Christmas Horror cheesefest!,"A timeless classic! Boy gets pet, pet spawns evil monsters, boy and pet have to save town from monsters.It's Christmas, it's the 80's, it a small town in America with kooky residents where nothing ever goes wrong. Horror waits around the corner!Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is given a new pet at Christmas, a Mogwai - a cute little teddy bear of a creature. Looking after a Mogwai is simple as long as you adhere to 3 simple rules; keep it away from bright light, don't get it wet, and don't feed it after midnight. One by one the rules are broken, resulting in the Mogwai multiplying, creating evil copies of itself; which gradually turn from cute fuzzy little creatures, into scaly and slimy monsters with a penchant for chaos and destruction. Before the town knows what's happening it's overrun with Gremlins, and thus the horror is in full swing. Supported by his love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates), Billy and his Mogwai (he's names it Gizmo) have to stop the Gremlins and save the town.This is a fun film and because it's staged over in the festive period you are likely to encounter it year after year. I originally watched this as a child in the 80's and unless modern children have become really soft this is a film which is likely to entertain and not cause an offense. The scariest part, the pantomime villain, is probably old Mrs Deagle who wants to put Billy's dog 'to sleep'. Some of the effects and animatronics look a little dated now, but they still look a little better than some of the expensive CGI that's pushed on us today. It's simple, charming, entertaining, and much like the people in the film who are watching nostalgic black and white movies in the background as they enjoy Christmas, this film is one day going to be the nostalgic film in the background as you enjoy Christmas.A typical 80's family comedy horror film, Joe Dante's film is fun for the family. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best Christmas movies,"Gremlins is essentially a kids movie for adults. This factor has probably got a lot to do with its producer, Steven Spielberg, who pulled a very similar trick with the earlier Poltergeist. Where that movie was directed by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper, Gremlins was helmed by Joe Dante director of The Howling. But both Poltergeist and Gremlins feel like Spielberg movies and the influence of the horror directors is very watered down. I don't think Spielberg was a passive influence as producer; he seems to have been more like the actual director.Whatever the case, Gremlins focuses on an everyman suburban family in a fantastical situation, something Spielberg seems to have had an affinity with. While it is a horror movie, it's never exactly disturbing or frightening. Having said that, it is an odd combination that is occasionally jarring, such as a kitchen sequence where three Gremlins are dispatched of quickly and gorily – one is stabbed to death, another is chopped up in a blender and a third is frazzled in a microwave oven. Moments like that, along with scenes of the Gremlins drinking, smoking, killing and flashing – led to it being problematic with some parents back in the day who thought it was going to be like E.T., which is hardly surprising seeing as the cute and cuddly Mogwai is pretty much in Ewok territory. But really, it's the evil Gremlins who make this movie entertaining. They constantly laugh along to their evil deeds and generally act bad just for the hell of it. What helps matters a lot is that the creature effects are very impressive. Despite these monsters being more or less puppets, they are very well rendered indeed.The family that the film is based around are typical enough. The father is an inventor, or more truthfully a very bad inventor. His long suffering family are forced to try out his proto-type inventions around the house. This leads to a few funny scenes where the devices function disastrously. Early on its made abundantly clear that there are three hugely important rules connected to owning Mogwais – don't expose them to bright lights, don't get them wet and don't feed them after midnight (I always wondered even as a kid that that last rule was a little disconcertingly vague, I mean it's never exactly specified when you can actually start feeding them again!). Anyway the son, alongside his sidekick Corey Feldman, manages to break these rules in about twenty-five minutes. They don't hose the Mogwai down after feeding him pizza at 1am in the morning with a strobe light operating in the background but their idiotic actions really aren't a million miles away from this. But, hey, moronic behaviour is a very useful plot device for a horror film and it does allow for the mayhem to kick into full gear.Gremlins is certainly one of the most consistently entertaining Christmas movies. The holiday season backdrop actually adds quite a lot to the feel of the film to be fair. It's a pretty dumb movie but made with a lot of skill, which is quite a good combination in the final analysis.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Iconic movie of the 80's,"""Gremlins"" is a classic '80s horror-comedy film that skillfully blends humor, horror, and a touch of the fantastical to create a timeless cult classic. Directed by Joe Dante and produced by Steven Spielberg, the movie offers a unique and entertaining experience that has delighted audiences for decades.The film centers on a young man named Billy Peltzer, played by Zach Galligan, who receives an unusual but adorable pet called a Mogwai, named Gizmo, as a Christmas gift. However, as the film's iconic rules dictate, the adorable Mogwai should never be exposed to bright light, water, or fed after midnight. Of course, these rules are promptly broken, leading to the chaos that ensues.What sets ""Gremlins"" apart is its ability to masterfully balance horror and humor. The mischievous little Gremlins, born from Gizmo's transformation, are both sinister and comical. The film's practical effects and puppetry bring these creatures to life in a way that feels tangible and adds to the charm of the movie.Phoebe Cates delivers a standout performance as Kate, Billy's love interest, providing depth and a touch of darkness to the film through her character's memorable monologue about her aversion to Christmas. The ensemble cast, featuring the likes of Hoyt Axton and Corey Feldman, adds to the film's quirky and memorable characters.Jerry Goldsmith's musical score enhances the film's whimsical and eerie atmosphere, perfectly complementing the on-screen action.""Gremlins"" has a unique ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia while retaining its timelessness.

"After seeing this popular 80's horror-comedy, I just have one question: That's it?","After finally seeing Gremlins, after hearing so much about how much better it is than the second(which I've seen two or three times, as my favorite Danish TV network seems to be crazy about it), I can't help but think: That's it? That's what I've been hearing so much positive stuff about? The only horror lies in the horrible out-dated effects, and the humor, or lack thereof, is typical for 80's comedies. Really, what does this film have to offer that any other film doesn't? It's got all of the typical monster-film clichés just to show exactly how uncreative and unoriginal the writer and director is. The main cliché being; no one believing that there is such a creature, until they see it with their own eyes... and even then, they're doubting the hero. The jokes are tired and dull, and repeated into endlessness... the father-character's inventions not working, the Gremlins acting senselessly, noisy and destructively(strangely reminiscent of bratty children or the typical guy who's a jock and/or drunk)... not to mention them acting like humans(""look, it thinks it's people!""). What's funny about dressed up obviously fake puppets smashing things, anyway? I can't imagine why this would be funny to anyone but the kids. The really small kids. The infants. The plot is lame. The pacing is off(I was bored throughout most of the film and was half-asleep when it was done) and uneven. The characters are mostly poorly written clichés not to mention terribly unimaginative... the old lady who's basically a Mrs. Scrooge, the old wise Asian guy(Japanese, Chinese, whatever... he's got those Asian eyes and he's old, so he must be very intelligent, reserved, and spouting nonsensical fortune cookie slogans), the old guy who complains a lot... come on, I mean... did Joe Dante and Chris Columbus just want the paycheck really, really bad, and didn't feel like bothering with giving us viewers a decent product? The acting is nothing special. The special effects are instantly see-through and awfully outdated. The humor is dull and repetitive. Well, I suppose if you like seeing stuff blow up(which the father-character's inventions always do, eventually) and poorly designed puppets destroying pricey items, you might like it. Otherwise, I don't really recommend this to anyone... unless they're die-hard fans of 80's films. One last thing; what the heck was up with the supposedly depressing black comedy-like story Phoebe Cates' character gives towards the ending of the film, to explain her not celebrating Christmas? I mean, I understand her and all, but was that really necessary? It felt very out of place. I don't mind a depressing story about Christmas, not at all, but it just seems like they were originally making a much darker film, and then decided to redo some scenes, but forgot that one. OK, one last thing(I promise): why am I not surprised that the US is one of the few countries to give this film a rating that says that children can watch it? It's got plenty of violence and disgusting imagery, so I can't see why... oh, that's right... there's no sex in it. Silly me. Because, as we all know, sex is the very worst thing in the world and children may not, under any circumstances, be subjected to it(or even a hint of it) on screen. Please. The MPAA are ridiculous in their ratings. This is a childish film, no doubt about that, but hardly a children's film. I recommend it to fans of 80's films and not really anyone else, as I doubt anyone else will enjoy it. My rating is only above 5 to acknowledge the effort put into it. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Because these rules are broken the Gremlins are terrorizing the town (and at Christmas too). One night all of the Gremlins decide to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and that's when Billy sets the Theater on fire.

"despite its faults, it is still enjoyable","I remember that Gremlins took the country by storm back in the 1980s, but I was not allowed to watch it until I was much older. When I did get to watch it in my teens, I did enjoy the film. In fact, I enjoyed it more then than I do now after re-watching it. I think it was able to captivate an audience of the 1980s in the same way that E.T. did, but in today's world of CGI and a higher level of action, it falls short. Either that, or you have to be young to really enjoy this film. (I've just had to re-rate it a point lower than I had previously rated it.) 'Gremlins' is a cute film, and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. The main problem with the film is the acting. The characters were a little boring, despite some of their quirks. I guess Gizmo and the Gremlins are meant to take the spotlight anyway, but whenever the main male or female characters come on the screen, there is an unhealthy dishing of dialogue. The love story is a little silly, but I do think it is done well. However, the serious dialog is often ridiculed as funny -- in part, it's down to some bad acting. The horrible story about the female lead's father is an example of this. It's a horrible story, but the manner in which it is told is almost amusing. It's difficult to take that seriously.Okay, I'll stop criticizing it now. It's a pretty good film, and it is a film that I enjoyed much more when I was younger.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite possibly the best horror comedy of all time,"Gremlins is one of my favourite movies that seamlessly blends comedy and horror or as some might label it a horror comedy. Gremlins takes the innocent time of Christmas and takes a satirical yet dark spin on the holiday, highlighting societal issues of consumerism, patriotism and greed.The film paints a pessimistic view on Christmas and how these issues can inevitably lead to chaos. It's a great metaphor for how the holiday is swept in ideas of consumerism, yet it's painted to be a time of joy and innocence.What's funny about this movie is how it depicts these issues. The Gremlins are mischievous creatures who embody everything wrong with consumerism, once you break the rules everything can go wrong. It's a great satire on how American culture can't always take responsibility for commercial items. Mrs Deagle represents greed and her unlikeable character is hysterical because it epitomises the essence of greed.Joe Dante alludes his premise to 1950's horror movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which are directly referenced in the film. It takes these concepts and takes a satirical spin, using the monsters as a metaphor not as a gimmick.Gremlins is simply brilliant and I notice something new every time I watch the movie.

Quintessential Christmas Treat,"""Gremlins"" from 1984, directed by Joe Dante and produced by Steven Spielberg, is a unique blend of fantasy, comedy, horror and holiday chaos that stands decades later as a quintessential cult classic. Set in the quaint town of Kingston Falls, the film centers around a young man named Billy Peltzer (Zach Galliga), who receives a mysterious pet called a Mogwai as a Christmas gift from his father (Hoyt Axton). However, the creature comes with three strict rules: no water, no food after midnight, and no bright light. When these seemingly trivial rules are inevitably broken, Billy's life and town is overrun by mischievous, malevolent gremlins, leading to a series of chaotic and darkly comedic events. Phoebe Cates plays Billy's co-worker and growing love interest, but neither are prepared for the madness that quickly develops around them. The film's charm lies in its perfect balance of humor and horror, which is heightened by the innovative practical effects (Chris Walas) used to bring the creatures to life. While it has its lighthearted moments, the film doesn't shy away from darker themes, especially in the depiction of the gremlins' rampages, making the film a bizarre yet delightful holiday thriller. Its quirky characters, memorable set pieces, a great score by Jerry Goldsmith, and free mixing of genres, make it an engaging and enduring film, one that successfully toes the line between a whimsical family movie and an outright horror spectacle. Great fun throughout, and most of the gang responsible for this came back together for the requisite and not too shabby sequel, a few years later. A Christmas movie must!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Comedy horror with entertainment, funny scenes and deft satiric edge","A young man inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet, Gizmo (Howie mandel voice), from a gift given by his father (Hoyt Axton). It unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town. The young couple Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate (Phoebe Cates) will suffer several dangers attacked by the nasty Gremlins. Minature green monsters tear through the small town of Kingston Falls. Hilarious mayhem and destruction in a town straight out of Norman Rockwell. So, when your washing machine blows up or your TV goes on the fritz, before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights and look under all the beds. 'Cause you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house. Gremlins appearing to cause chaos , as they don't execute the rules , neither warnings : ¨don't expose them to bright light, don't ever get wet and don't ever , ever feed after midnight¨. Mischievous. Intelligent. Dangerous. You can't get burned seeing 'Gremlins'! Steven Spielberg presents: Cute. Clever. Mischievous. Intelligent. Dangerous. We're Here!. What you see... isn't always what you get. The Gremlins Are Coming!.Take Your Batch to See the New Batch !. Look out , a new batch is on the way !. Here they grow again , we warned you !. Remember the rules !. You didn't listen !. Don't get him wet, keep him out of bright light, and never feed him after midnight. They didn't obey the rules. We're Back!Director Joe Dante presents a quite good and violent but far more campy vision, paying myriad surreal tribute to movies as well as soundtracks with great sense of amusement. Hijinks ensue as a mild-mannered bank teller releases these hideous loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules: No water (violated), no food after midnight (violated), and no bright light. Naturally, there're lots of mayhem , frolics , antics and jokes , this all happening at the town and the result is a gang of nasty gremlins who decide to tear up the houses and cinemas. This watchable enough motion picture was professionally directed by Joe Dante displaying their characteristic surrealist humor and sense of style . The story is nothing more than an amusing excuse to string together gags , silly sketches , ironical craziness , several cameos and fast-paced set pieces. Dante is surely right to let his visual imagination run along with likeable comedy, irony and great inventive. Including ¨Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs¨ and other famous film parodies and other musical extravaganzas of the past. Also incorporates satire , takes on TV news and funny action, adding a lot of rapid-fire surreal sight gags. Along with ordinary starring : Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, appearing here and there a number of familiar secondaries and various cameos, such as : Polly Holliday, Belinda Balaski, Keye Luke, Frances Lee McCain, Dick Miller, Edward Andrews, Judge Reinhold, Chuck Jones, William Schallert, Harry Carey Jr, Scott Brady, Steven Spielberg, Kenneth Tobey Nicky Katt, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks .And musician Jerry Goldsmish who composes a lively and enjoyable score. Followed by a sequel ¨Gremlins II¨, it's inferior to original, set in a futuristic skyscraper in the Big Apple where the young couple: Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates of now work for the money-grubbing tech-mogul John Glover, co-starred by Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky , Robert Picardo, Haviland Morris , Dick Miller , Raymond Cruz , Julia Sweeney , Keye Luke, Kathleen FreemanLavishly Produced by Steven Spielberg , and professionally directed by Joe Dante, with originality enough. Dante's most hits took place when found himself working alongside Steven Spielberg, John Landis and Australian director George Miller for the anthology movie ¨The Twilight Zone, The Movie¨ (1983) in which Dante directed the third segment . Steven Spielberg then hired him to work as director for ¨Gremlins¨ (1984) which was another box-office success. He directed some episodes for the Sci-Fi series ""Amazing Stories"" before directing his next Science Fiction feature which was ¨Innerspace¨ (1987) which, whilst critically well reviewed, was another box office failure. After directing five episodes of ""Eerie, Indiana"", Dante returned to the big-screen with the well-received ¨Matinee¨ (1993), an affectionate period satire set in 1962 against the background of the Cold War. Dante spent the next several years working for television and directed a satire on politics with ¨The Second Civil War¨ (1997) . Dante's next two films, ¨Small Soldiers¨ (1998), and ¨Looney Toons: Back in Action¨ (2004) garnered good reviews but were not commercial hits. Gremlins rating : 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gizmo is simply adorable,"'Gremlins' is certainly worth a watch.The cast do an OK job, but it's the Mogwai that pretty much carry it. They're funny and look fantastic, especially given this film came out in the early 1980s - Gizmo is simply adorable. The ending drags out a little, which is my only real criticism.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bright lights!!,"Who would expect a sweet little creature like Gizmo to cause so much trouble? Well to be fair to Giz, it was Corey Feldman's fault, he's always causing problems.This film is still just as good today as it was in 1984. Yes the special effects aren't the best, but actually I think that sometimes makes it creepier.There are some hilarious moments and while I wouldn't necessarily say it's fun for all the family (toddlers might get upset), I don't think it would terrify kids as much as it did when I was younger.Some funny small town characters help to build a view of the type of town they're in and Billy, played by the cute Zach Galligan, seems to be the only one with any sense, apart from his awesome Mum that is.I'm not sure I'd go as far as saying that it is essential Christmas viewing, but it is a good film and enjoyable all year round really.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Too produced, and an odd mix","If this had been made a straight up R-rated horror film it really could have been something, since the animation of the gremlins is so well done. Unfortunately it feels like the producers wanted to cash in on appealing to a younger audience as well, so it ended up being in a really weird place for me. On the one hand, it has the feel of a polished Speilberg feel-good blockbuster, with cute moments and an annoyingly bombastic soundtrack. On the other hand, it has some really dark moments and grisly violence when gremlins (and some people) are killed off. I love Phoebe Cates to death but her little speech about childhood trauma ending in ""and that's how I found out there was no Santa Claus"" is ridiculously bad in every respect. There are several other off-putting aspects - the product placement, the character who speaks badly of foreign-made products, and the imagery of Chinatown straight out of the stereotypes of the 1930's (though it was nice to see Keye Luke at age 80). Overall, just not something that engaged me - it felt too produced, and there wasn't a lot of intelligence in the script. Great creatures though.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins-A great 84 movie,"Anybody who doesn't like this movie just doesn't understand comedy.  I thought this movie was excellent.  It's about a son who got a Mowagi for Christmas, a cute furry animal that sings.  The only thing is there are 3 simply rules you have to follow.  Don't get them wet, don't feed them after midnight, and bright light can kill them.  Sounds easy enough till he accidentlly spills water on them and instantly 3 or 4 others pop right out his Gizmo (voice by the wonderful Howie Mandel from St. Elsewhere).  One night the Mowagis were begging for food, looking at the clock and seeing it wasn't quite midnight, Billy gives in and feeds them some chicken.  When he wakes up the next morning they are in a nasty looking cocoon.  All hell breaks loose when the mowagi, now gremlins, hatch and the town goes into haywire.  They manage to kill all but one of the gremlins, Spike the leader. They trap him in the store and Gizmo saves the day by making the blinds raise showering Spike with bright lights just as he was in some water. 10 stars.

"With mogwai, comes much responsibility...","The 1984 ""Gremlins"" movie is a classic in the horror comedy genre, and it actually still is capable of standing its ground today. So it is definitely a movie that is quite worth watching if you haven't already seen it. ""Gremlins"" is a movie that I have watched countless times, and will continue to watch every now and then with some years in between each viewing. If you haven't already seen ""Gremlins"", then you are definitely missing out on a great classic horror comedy.I feel that it is redundant to summarize the storyline, especially because ""Gremlins"" is the type of movie that everyone should already be familiar with. But in the off chance that you aren't familiar with the movie, then let's just quickly summarize the storyline.The story told in ""Gremlins"" is about a young man whose father gives him a most unique creature named Gizmo for a pet, a creature known as a 'mogwai'. There are three simple rules to keeping the furry, cuddly little creature. 1) Don't expose it to water. 2) Never feed it after midnight. 3) No direct sunlight. When the rules are accidentally broken, the creature reproduce, but these creatures do not share Gizmo's friendly and peaceful demeanor. And the small township is soon overrun with green, nasty gremlins wrecking havoc and terrorizing the Citizens.""Gremlins"" is a good combination of story elements and genres, which makes for a very memorable movie that you can watch again and again, because the story never gets old.And while the movie is from 1984, then the special effects are actually quite good, even by today's standards. And the movie does stand its ground still, and it is still quite watchable.The creature design, both for the mogwai and the gremlins is quite good, and very memorable. Once you have seen ""Gremlins"" for the first time, you will never forget the mogwai or the gremlins, trust me. Yes, it is that memorable.There are also some memorable acting performances in ""Gremlins"". Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates really carried the movie quite nicely. But there were also some very memorable appearances by Hoyt Axton and Dick Miller. Furthermore, it was also fun to watch a young Corey Feldman make a small appearance here.""Gremlins"" is a movie that can be watched by adults and kids alike, because there is something for just about everyone here, whether you like comedy or little green monsters and everything in between.This is indeed a wholehearted movie that will never become obsolete. And as of 2017, the movie has luckily not yet gone through a reboot of older movies, as Hollywood has been making heaps of within the last couple of years. And I hope this classic doesn't go through the butchery of a remake or reboot, because it is great as it already is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wickedly funny classic,"Gremlins is the classic creature-feature with the lovable cutie Gizmo and his offsprings who set the small town of Kingston Falls completely ablaze when their owner Billy fails on one of the 3 crucial rules; feeding them after midnight.Everybody knows Gremlins and it's a complete classic. Gizmo was a household name in the 80's and most kids had numerous toys and teddy's of him. Snow White got somewhat revived as it was the creatures' favorite film and that's just funny. Many hilarious moments are here as the Gremlins start chewing up the little town and wrecking more havoc than George W. Bush could with all his arsenal (Mrs. Deegle's fate is, as said before, a classic).Gremlins was so good when I was a kid but you notice some other things as well when you see it as an adult. The level of violence is surprisingly brutal and the little critters are very, very nasty. This is nasty humor all the way. And my god is Zach Galligan a horrible actor. I thought David Duchovny was the most expressionless actor around but I was wrong. There are also some very downbeat moments thrown in here which could so easily have been edited out (a point which Gremlins 2 actually made fun of).Overall the film completely deserves the classic stamp though. Gizmo is priceless, the critters even more priceless and it's wickedly funny with many hidden gems (ever noticed that time machine at the convention!). And it's surprisingly well crafted with good special effects that don't look bad at all today.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Crazed lil' villains go on a romp.,"Gremlins is one of those defining 80's films headed by Steven and Kathleen, modern Hollywood royalty. Unfortunately, the film hasn't aged well which is normally the case when a film relies on the tech of the time to bring otherworldly things to life. I get the simple fun romp by crazed silly villains theme but times have changed, and young people and adult today are unlikely to find this as endearing as it was. The mechanics are clunky as is the story telling. The story progression is all too predictable especially when it's trying to be suspenseful which makes it feel frustrating instead. I probably would have voted this a 7-8 in the late 80's when I first saw it as a young kid. However, as an adult now, while I wouldn't discourage someone from watching it today, it's no ET. The tech in ET is on par, but the telling of the story is much better than Gremlins.Gets a 6 for the fun it brings.By the way IMDB users, voting down reviews because you disagree is not the same as saying a review is unhelpful. You just disagree. Keep that in mind.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror gone B-Movie funny...,"...You watch it and find yourself sucked into an otherwise story by numbers movie (hey, the old guy says ""no sunlight, water or food after midnight"" so you're warned what to expect already).  Main criticism of course is its lack of focus on the hilarious antics of the evil Gremlins (something the sequel did a little better) who destroy a good portion of a town, but aren't seen nearly enough to make you detest them - instead they're little more than pests.The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a ""kids"" movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
-,"I watched this thinking I had already seen it, only having seen the sequel. And not remembering the second one that well, I went in with no expectations, besides a fun ride through the undeniable iconic puppetry.
The truth is, this is not a very good movie. Even by the standards of the time, this seems too weird to think about for just a couple of minutes.First of all, something that goes on for the entire movie (to which you expect some kind of payoff, possibly in the way the titular creatures are disposed off by the end) is Billy's father's ""profession"". However, it amounts to absolutely nothing, even when he arrives at the store conveniently at the right time for the final confrontation, although with no purpose to the scene.
Maybe the point was to frame this whole story as his invention as well, with the start and end narrations, but it never seems like it beyond that.And while Kate's reason for not liking Christmas is unexpected and, for that, entertainingly tragic, not only does its expository delivery come at a weird time, as it is completely nonsensical in this history, changing nothing about the occurring events for her character. If anything, as she even puts it, there are more reasons for her to hate the season, so, what gives?Even weirder is the attempt at a message in the end, of our disdain for ""God's gits"", I guess as a poor excuse for the moral of the story, maybe aiming at the kids watching.That is not to say there aren't good parts. There are a couple of really fun moments, specially when Billy's mother disposes of several gremlins in the most hilariously gruesome ways possible, while stating ""Get out of my kitchen"". Or the death of Mrs. Deagle, that ripped a big laugh out of me.
And I like that Gizmo is really the character to have an arc in the story, primarily being scared of his spawn to, in the end, being the one that saves the day.Still, beyond maybe rewatching the second one for curiosity sake, I don't think I'll be revisiting this anytime soon.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Full Blown Visual Effects In Small Town Spectacular,"Gremlins is a movie that I saw in the early 1980's with my kids and saw again recently. The character played by Zak Galligan is a teen who receives a cute little pet from his dad. The small pet with cute ears and eyes is certainly unique and as innocent looking as a small kitten. The pet came with warnings which were largely ignored. Before long, the gremlin began to multiply and terrorize the town. There is a comforting setting in a small town in upstate New York with an assortment of characters, including the boy's father, an inventor whose gadgets usually don't measure up. Things go totally out of control with the gremlin producing numerous other gremlins who are definitely not meek and cute. The explosion of mishaps from these little monsters is very much in the style of executive producer Steven Spielberg. Phoebe Cates stars as the young friend to Zak, who is a hard-working and conscientious young man who eventually has to deal with the horror unleashed by his pet. The technical wizardry takes on a life of its own but becomes too much for the viewer and I found myself hoping it would all come to an end. While it is an amusing movie with a string of astonishing visual effects, it does wear itself out. The movie is a part of Spielberg's cinematic chronology but not a high point among his many great efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gremlins: 6/10,"Cute furry creatures who talk in nonsense language and never shut up. Furby? Nope, it's a Mogwai, a thing that a man, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), buys from a Chinese man to give his son Billy (Zach Galligan) for Christmas. Billy firstly enjoys it, after hearing the three rules of taking care of them: don't put them in bright light, don't let them get water on them, and don't feed them after midnight. Bright light kills them, water makes them reproduce, and feeding them after midnight makes them into monsters. So, of course, Zach breaks the rules and wrecks havoc on his small town.Cheesy but fun, Gremlins is a film that seems to just let go and play along. The gremlins were very well made and didn't seem that mechanical (and they do look like giant Furbies). People behind me were talking about how they wanted one. Of course, until they turn evil.This is definately not a thinker's movie. If you just put your mind on hold, it's a fun 100 minutes. If you over-analyze, it can get confusing. Since this is a perfect description of a popcorn movie, the characters leave something to be desired. Who is who? I don't know. But in movies like this, you shouldn't care.The main actors were all good, but it wasn't as funny as movies like this should be. These should be laugh-during-their-adventures, not a-few-laughs-let's-call-this-a-comedy. The stupidity of the characters made most of the laughs.Gremlins (and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) are the two movies that caused the PG-13 rating to come into play, since the MPAA decided that they were too violent for PG but not enough for R. I understand what they mean (although most of the blood in this movie is green and are the gremlins).Cheesy and fun, but not very funny, Gremlins is a good time waster.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for language, creature violence, and scary situations.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The zenith of puppet-based FX,"Written by Chris Columbus, executive produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by horror-comedy semi-master Joe Dante (Piranha, The Howling), and with groundbreaking special effects by Chris Walas (who had previously worked on E. T.) - Gremlins was more or less doomed for success in the crossover-segment of 1980s youth-culture where mainstreamers and the new geek generation could find middle ground. The frame narrative involves a couple of cute, kind-hearted youngsters, a struggling inventor and a xenophobic alcoholic, but none of that really matters, because this is all about the show put on by the ""mogwai"" Gizmo and his more mischievous relatives. The special effects are incredibly impressive considering the technical methods used; Gremlins is probably some sort of zenith in puppet-based FX. Just a few years later, this would have been done with CGI, but what would probably have been lost in the process is the organic, timeless feel this film has retained. Granted, the filmmakers seem to have been just a tad too enamoured with their creations, resulting in a film that is more adorable and silly than it is enjoyable, but then again, that may have been the entire point.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

With Mogwai Comes Great Responsibility,"This certainly isn't your typical Christmas movie. Obviously it's nowhere near as dark as ""Black Christmas,"" but it sure ain't ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" either. It's horror, it's comedy, it's Christmas, it's even philosophical at times. ""Gizmo"" is a mogwai - a cute and intelligent little pet of sorts, found by inventor Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) in a basement shop run by a little old Chinese man (Keye Luke). Randall buys (well, acquires really) Gizmo as a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan.) But there are rules that go along with having a mogwai: don't expose them to bright light, don't give them water, and don't ever feed them after midnight. Well, poor Gizmo gets water spilled on him, and the chaos begins. Water causes Gizmo to reproduce in some way, and Gizmo's offspring aren't the cute little creatures Gizmo is. They start out as more or less mischievous, then become destructive and ultimately violent. They pretty much take over the little town of Kingston Falls on Christmas Eve, wreaking havoc everywhere.It's hard to figure out who the intended audience is for this. It's too dark to be a kids movie, but the basic story isn't mature enough to be looked at as an adult comedy. And yet - in a strange sort of way - it works. It's a fun movie, with a great musical score and even as the town is wrecked and even as people die you find yourself laughing about it. How can you not laugh when Mrs. Deagle (Polly Holliday) goes flying out the upper floor window of her house!It pays tribute to a few other movies. There's a touch of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" here, and Mrs. Deagle was clearly patterned after Miss Gulch (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) from ""The Wizard Of Oz."" And in the midst of the laughs, the mayhem and the violence there's a philosophical basis to this: we should try to avoid messing with things we don't understand. Randall was told that he couldn't have the mogwai. But the Chinese man's grandson manages to secretly sell him to Randall anyway, apparently not really understanding the potential consequences, and Randall and Billy are clearly unprepared for dealing with this cute little creature.I thought the performances in this were average. Nobody was outstanding, but the story was certainly a creative fantasy, and watching this 30 years later I was struck by some of Randall's inventions. He invented a sort of Keurig machine. He invented a sort of cordless phone. He invented a sort of smokeless ash tray. None of them worked very well - but they all came to pass! Give writer Chris Columbus some points for predicting some of the future. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Home for the Holidays Gremlin-Style,"This movie made a big impact on me as a younger man for I really had not seen anything like it beforehand. Hoyt Axton plays a father who is an inventor cruising through Chinatown in search of just that special gift for his son. He is taken to a small, out-of-the-way ""junk"" shop where Axton sees this adorable creature who sings, smiles, and is just damned cute. The proprietor, an elderly Chinese man, tells Axton that this creature is not for sale, but the young boy who brought him there sells Axton the creature unbeknownst to Grandpa. Axton is given three rules that must be observed with the creature: 1). No bright light 2). no water 3). never feed the creature after midnight(okay, this rule is loopy). This takes place in the first five minutes or so of the film. The rest of the film is the son getting what he will call Gizmo and what happens when these rules are inevitably broken. The scenic backdrops to the small town are quaint, surrealistic, and nostalgic. Director Joe Dante always infuses his pictures with nostalgic qualities whether it is a scene we may have seen over and over again, character types, and my favorite are the actors of older films that older(or more rehearsed audience members) will quickly identify which will undoubtedly be lost on younger viewers and certainly viewers of today by large part. We get Key Luke as the Chinese shop owner. He was most famous for his roles as Number 1 Son in the old Charlie Chan films. How about Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman - a staple in Roger Corman films. Miller's costar in Little Shop of Horrors Jackie Joseph plays his wife in this. Edward Andrews - the old, reliable character actor - plays a bank manager. William Schallert plays a minister. You can also see Polly Holliday(Flo from Alice) play a devilishly wicked Mr. Potter-type. Kenneth Tobey has a cameo as does Chuck Jones and several others. The lead actors are young but entertaining. Zach Galligan was 19 when he made this - his first feature. He does a decent job. Phoebe Cates is also rather good and very lovely. The real star though is the puppet Gizmo and the gremlins themselves. Dante did all this in an old-school manner. No CGI here - thankfully. This is real filmmaking the way real filmmaking used be done. It was labor and time intensive and rather costly but Dante does a lot here with a spartan budget. Produced by Steven Spielberg Gremlins shows what some intelligent-minded people can put together with creativity and vision. There are so many scenes that stick out with me: the movie theater, the battle with the Christmas tree, the microwave scene, and many others including Mrs. Deagle's spiraling exit. All are outstanding. In the end, however; it is the little moments that I like best like the small character parts, Dick Miller going on about foreign products, and Gizmo playing a small piano-like instrument. Gremlins is now 20 years old - I saw it in the movie theater when it came out - and it has withstood the test of time rather well.

Chrismas Carnage With Small Critters,"When a father gives his son a Mogwai for Christmas, even after the store owner refuses to sell it, it seems like a good Christmas. However, the cute little critter, Gizmo, soon creates a problem as the three rules get broken, leading to a crazy Christmas that the town of Kingston Falls would never forget.Gremlins is a great 80's film, but it's not for everyone. As one of the two films that would lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating, it can be scary for younger children, and it does have some moments that indeed push it (like the infamous Gremlin in the microwave). But thankfully, nothing goes too far, as even the gory scenes are tame enough for a PG rating, and the movie does have some comedy to give balance. The movie also has some good characters, from Billy to mean old Mrs. Deagle (who wants to put Billy's dog down, but ends up falling victim to the gremlins), this film is a good watch for older kids and teenagers.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
My All-Time Favorite Movie!,"Everybody has that one movie that they never get tired of seeing.  It's usually the same movie that you can quote line for line.  For me, that movie is ""Gremlins"".

Joe Dante is a genius when it comes to directing and the sequel ""Gremlins 2:  The New Batch"" is a worthy followup and is also a mustsee.

Zonked-out Christmas confection with claws,"A furry, cooing mystical creature called a mogwai is adopted by a small town American family with the proviso it must not get wet...or eat after midnight. Turns out water causes the mogwai to multiply trouble-making little duplicates, while late night snacks turn the spawn into terrifying demons with an appetite for murder. Well-produced special-effects package in a Christmas setting was generally thought at the time to be director Joe Dante's wicked variation of E.T. (even with Steven Spielberg as its executive producer); but the film ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" had three-dimensional human characters as well as the adorable alien, while ""Gremlins"" writer Chris Columbus doesn't reach that far (in fact, he hardly reaches at all). Columbus sets up his cut-out characters to be targets, and then unleashes a barrage of nasty pranks on them (staged by Dante to get quick, cheap laughs). It's intended to be a black comedy, but some of the satire is too outrageous (such as with the break-dancing gremlin) and much of the mayhem is more mean-spirited than funny. There's OK work from Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates as the young couple at the center of the story (Cates once again working her cherubic, Lolita-like innocence to her advantage); yet the whole film has a sleepy, lethargic feel, as though it had been overworked at its earliest stages and arrived on the screen exhausted from all the effort.

A Cute Family Comedy-Horror Film,"I was about 12 years old when Gremlins first came out... I recall seeing it on the big screen and loved it! Back then, I wanted one like Gizmo - and I have a strong feeling other kids had a similar wish about the cute and cuddly little creature.I have recently re-watched this movie and I was quite entertained by it after all these years. What I found most humorous is idea that you should not feed them after midnight -- what about timezone? Are these little guys able to know the difference? LOL.Gremlins is a very fun movie.

Aged terribly,"This is one of those movies everyone sings praises of and everyone talks about it like a great movie not because it's actually a great movie but because they watched it as a child many years ago and now it reminds them of their childhood and they are feeling nostalgic towards it.Otherwise if you look at this objectively it's a pretty poor movie that aged pretty badly over the years. To be fair the movie was badly aged even in 1990s let alone right now.The story is beyond ridiculous, acting is poor, it drags on and on forever and there are too many logical errors. For example we are told that you can destroy a gremlin using bright light but the main character keeps forgetting it. He could have just gotten a bright light source like a projector and finish them off very easily but he kept forgetting about a basic fact we were already reminded of throughout the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greatest jokes ever played on an audience,"GREMLINS is one of the foulest, nastiest and most mean-spirited movies ever made.  It is a sick joke disguised as a kids movie, and one of my all-time favorite ""f*** you"" movies.  This movie is designed to get back at parents too stupid or lazy to bother checking out what they are taking their kids to see by giving their kids nightmares.The first half of the movie is a saccharine-laden cute-fest, with all the ear-marks of the usual Spielberg-produced kid fodder.  Cute little Gizmo wears a Santa Claus hat, sings pretty songs and plays under the Christmas tree.  Pretty soon, he spawns nastier and more mischievousMogwais, but even they are pretty cute.And then...The Mogwais turn into hideous reptilian creatures which viciously attack people with knives, chainsaws and crossbows.  They are dispatched by being blown up in the microwave or shredded in a food processor.I loved it.  I saw it when I was twelve, so I was old enough to take it. One of the best moments in my entire movie-going life has to be when almost every child in the theater screamed in terror when the Gremlin exploded in the microwave.  And, as an ultimate ""you brought this on yourself"" lesson to apathetic parents, the movie announces to the world that there is no Santa Claus.This is not a kids movie.  This is an anti-kid movie.

Ferbie's Gone Wild!,"It took me forever to finally watch this 1984 cult-classic comedy/horror. The only thing I knew before viewing this film was that it included these ""ferbie""-like creatures and that something happens to when you add water to them. Little did I know that these cuddly weird beasts can morph into something grotesque. - Well, not really - I believe they mention that ""these"" are the true GREMLINS.Now, the story begins with a father (Hoyt Axton; great performer), an inventor, comes across ""mogwai"", a little furry, two-legged creature with ears like a bat, and decides that it is the perfect Christmas gift for his (17+ year old) son, Billy (played by the very UNTALANTED, Zach Galligan).The situation takes a turn for the worst after Billy becomes more attached to his new PET-best friend who is now named Gizmo CREDITS by his father) who begins procreating more clones of himself after an accidental spill of water on Billy's desk. This is around the time when little Cory Feldman comes into the picture. // **As time progresses, we find out the true meaning behind these BRUTES and what purpose lies ahead of them.***I found the ACTING in this film a bit campy and childish (amateur), as if it actually were made for kids. The only good acting jobs I see are done by Hoyt Axton, who I have already mentioned, and our lead damsel in distress, Phoebe Cates (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, 1982), who plays Kate Beringer, Billy's love interest. Other then that, I was not impressed.***What did grab my attention was the SET DISGN!! Oh man! for an 80s (Holiday) flick, this project really created a sense of style. I mean, with all the X-Mas lights and the changing from cloudy-green grass to snow-weather, it is ALLURING. +++ PLUS, the animatronics they (must have) used to design the gremlins was, still for this time (2015), really well done.

Classic 80's Spielberg.,"I can't believe I've never watched this movie. I was an 80's movie kid but always steered away from the fantasy horror movies. I was more action and comedy. I wish I had watched this sooner, as it was pretty awesome.Classic Spielberg. The guy is a master at his craft and it shows here. His movies all have a similar awesome feel to them and you can sense it right away.What stood out most to me with this film was the animation. It was so good. There was some clay animation I think? Was it? But most of it was just good old puppetry and it worked.It was also hilarious. It didn't take itself too seriously and that was great. When the gremlins took over the town and chaos ensued I laughed out loud on a few occasions.I'm cautiously optimistic on the sequel! Hard to top this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Come on Die Young,"Nostalgia. It's not what it was. I watched ""Gremlins 2"" purely because I was stuck at my parent's house and it happened to start at the right time. Boyed by how much I enjoyed that madness, I thought I'd revisit the original. I was, I'm afraid, rather disappointed.When his father brings home an exotic pet for him, Billy (Zach Galligan) accidentally gets the loveable creature wet, causing it to multiply. From there, the mean-spirited duplicates trick him into breaking the key rule regarding eating after midnight and the cute Mogwai are transformed into murderous Gremlins. In one night, the town of Kingston Falls is nearly lost to the malevolent creatures.I really didn't enjoy this film as much as I used to. Like a lot of 80's films, I think it suffers somewhat because it's quite a slow film, especially at the start. The Gremlins don't really show up until the halfway point in the film with a lot of the early time spent with characters that ultimately don't pay off. Tonally it's quite a strange one, I think you can really see the fight between the desire to play up the horror elements, and the Spielbergian desire to tone things down. The puppet work generally isn't scary (at least not anymore, it had a big effect on me when I was a child) though there are some truly gross moments of them melting away. That fight, and the editing that followed, does leave some characters set up, but never paid off. Judge Reinhold plays a rival for Billy's girlfriend, Kate, played by Phoebe Cates, who disappears from the film having been established - as does Pete, a kid played by Corey Feldman.It's not a terrible film, by any means, but I do think that watching it today is a vastly different experience to what it was 30 years ago, and I can't see the need to come back to it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sometimes you should just stick with the memories.,"Revisiting childhood favourites can be perilous. Billy's father Randall (Hoyt Axton, great name), a luckless inventor, buys his son a new pet for Christmas. A cute furry little thing with big ears and big eyes, from a stereotypically offensive old Chinese man, with the warning not to get him wet, not to let him near sunlight and don't, I repeat don't feed him after midnight... ""with Mogwai comes much responsibility"". Billy (Zack Galligan) lives in small town idyllic America. Works at the bank with his sweetheart Kate (Phoebe Cates) and is generally a bit downtrodden with a crap car that won't start in the winter. There's not much weight to Gremlins it must be said. It takes a lot longer to get going than I recall too and there's a lot of saccharine schmaltz. When Gizmo the Mogwai gets wet though and multiples, well Randall thinks his fortunes might be changing, ""Everyone in America will want one of these"". Obviously he's very much mistaken. Billy is crap at sticking to the rules. We know sunlight kills them. Water makes them multiply... but the twist is the midnight snacks. From here on in, it adheres much more to a classic creature feature. With the evil little bastards running amok in what has to be said is a nonsensical plotless montage of puppet chaos. The kitchen scene is still great. Gremlin killed in the foodmixer, gremlin killed in the microwave. Gremlin's head sliced off with a sword and into the fire. But it wears thin fast and I'm afraid it does drag a little. It's not crap. The story line is a bit basic, but it does still work. The gremlins look fantastic, an undeniable charm to it all being shot for real before our screens became overrun with CGI. It's not as good as I remember as a kid though. Take out the puppetry and there's little to appreciate. Still, Gizmo is very cute, ""Bright light, bright light!""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's not a plot hole,"So first of all, let's address the elephant in the room: the ""no time is ever not after midnight"" thing is not a plot hole. Or at least, it's not one that should have ever caught on as one of the most well known in cinema history. It's not like it's something that is completely inexplicable within the film's universe or requires characters to be so unbelievably stupid for the story to continue. I'm not saying it wouldn't have been better if the kid at the beginning had said ""don't feed him between midnight and 7am"", but is it really so hard to believe that the characters just inferred ""don't feed him until morning"" from that, and that that was what the kid meant?Anyway, the film...yeah it's alright.I can't help but wonder if it's only really remembered for that *sigh* ""plot hole"", and the fact that it helped to create the PG-13 rating though, because it's entertaining enough, but I can't say I'm ever likely to watch, or even think about it again. There's some pretty funny moments, like the stair lift, the microwave, and the Santa in the chimney story, but there isn't any especially great direction or acting, and I couldn't care less about any of the characters.I'm assuming the mogwai and gremlins were all puppets, and if they were, the puppet work was really great and convincing for the most part, but that's really the only exceptional thing I can think of.Other than the sudden appearance of Mike from Breaking Bad, of course.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The more extreme end of 80s family films,"Gremlins is undoubtedly one of the most bizarre eighties films and appears to be quite polarizing amongst viewers. The concept of the film is imaginative and intriguing, and it arguably could have been a much bigger success with better writing and stronger characters. Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is very uneven and the story just doesn't flow very well. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are quite dull and Corey Feldman is criminally underutilised.The puppetry looks heavily dated now but for 1984 I guess its acceptable. Mogwai is very cute, bordering on sickly, and the Gremlins are a bit over-the-top but good fun to watch. Things get a bit gory towards the end, enough to make the film unsuitable for many children. And this is where the problem lies, because Gremlins is simply not interesting enough for adults either. It ends up as a kind of tongue-in-cheek indie film which I'm not sure was the intention.I remember enjoying it as a kid but looking back I'm not sure why. There are many better films from this era that are either just straight up horror movies or endearing fantasies.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun Holiday Horror.,"Review:
'Gremlins' is a comedy-horror film directed by Joe Dante.
remember watching this on video when I was a kid. I haven't seen it in a very long time. One of the sweetest, funniest and most original films ever made. Even the music is perfect.
The story follows a young man who receives a strange creature called a mogwai as a pet, which then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, evil monsters.
The acting isn't the best, but like I say with most of my review for movie of from the 80's, it's forgivable. It's not bad, and the actors do a good enough job to keep you mentally invested in the story.
This movie is greatness in every single way, with style, charm, and humor to spare. This film was among the top movies from the glorious '80's. It never gets overtly slapstick comical, but this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less
Overall, it's a great movie for adults to watch with kids for their first scary movie. I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot.

I still remembered a couple of scenes(like when the gremlins are at the cinema, the beginning in china town, that it was Christmas time etc...)but it lost the magic a little. I remember liking it more. If i were 10 again i would give it 9 points probably. I read on other people review that the music is so good. I don't really agree with that. One of the most important things from the 80s movies was the songs and melodies. For example ROCKY, INDIANA JONES, BEVERLY HILLS COP, KARATE KID etc...all had incredible soundtracks but this movie not and thats a shame. Still, i will watch this movie again in maybe 15 years to give my final opinion about it. Thanks for reading this and take care everybody.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Watch at any hour if you can't find something better.,"Festive demi-semi-horror for all the family (if you are happy with your kid sleeping with you until menarche but, hey, I don't judge).I feel a bit blue that this really could have been a classic of genuine horror if handled a but differently but if judged by its own standard is perfectly fine.Like a lot of '80s movies of this type (more so than earlier decades for some reason), it can feel very dated with a lot of slow pacing, filler and story elements that don't go anywhere (like the girl who doesn't like Christmas. She has a good reason but it has nothing to do with anything).The best thing about this movie is its practical effects making it a delightful exercise in cinematic cuteness (and grotesquerie) that one can well imagine being just what those '80s audiences in the winter were in the mood for.Not a bad christmas or halloween movie but there is better stuff.

One of the Best Modern Horror Comedy Classics,"In 1984, one of the most insane horror comedies was released by Steven Spielberg entitled Gremlins. Directed by cult filmmaker Joe Dante, the film was a huge hit with critics and audiences and is often regarded as one of the greatest horror comedies of the last 50 years. While it did gain infamy for its grotesque violence, which resulted in the PG-13 rating, it is still cherished to this day and spawned a sequel a few years later and a recent animated series on Max. As far as how the film holds up nowadays, it's probably one of the darkest comedies that works in what it set out to do thanks to its cartoony nature.The film follows a young man named Billy Peltzer who receives a strange creature from his father called a mogwai. When the mogwai spawns other creatures, they end up becoming small destructive monsters that all wreak havoc on Billy's town during Christmas Eve. At its core, Gremlins may seem like a cautionary allegory on consumerism, especially when the mogwai creatures are not to be handled by the ignorant American public. That being said, the film knows how to treat the mogwai as a proper pet in the form of Gizmo, who Billy looks after with certain restrictions like no bright lights or feeding after midnight. Once the other gremlins kick in however, that's when the film unleashes its cartoony slapstick and brutal violence on display. As gruesome and horrifying as the film may be, Dante knows to keep the balance between supernaturally scary and nonsensically humorous, so we are left laughing at the mayhem caused by the manic Gremlins as much as we are in horror of it all. There are very few films that have managed this blending of the genres as funnily as this one.In addition to Billy making for a charming lead in reacting to all the insanity, his girlfriend Kate Beringer is an added bonus to the film's sweet center. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates share cute chemistry with each other in lieu of all the frights, and it's easy to see them trying to make end's meet in a small town corrupted by the antagonistic miser Mrs. Deagle. While some characters don't leave as much of an impression as they could like Billy's condescending coworker Gerald Hopkins or Billy's inventor father, others like Billy's concerned mother, the cranky Murray Futterman, the experimenting science teacher Mr. Hanson or little Pete Fountaine all contribute some damage to the monsters or get the short end of the stick from them in different forms of comeuppance. Also, on top of a lot of crazy vocal effects for the gremlin creatures, Howie Mandel steals the show as Gizmo and can make even a small whistle or cry from the guy sound adorably heart wrenching. Add on a cunning performance from Frank Welker as the rebellious leader Stripe and you got one heck of a vocal cast.Now in regards to the phenomenal special effects work done on the gremlins, Chris Walas and team managed to blend cute and creepy in such a versatile manner. When one puts into consideration just how complicated the mechanics and puppetry was to pull off, it makes the film all the more spectacular just to see all the crazy stunts and pratfalls the gremlin creatures get to pull off. In many ways, the gremlins are more cartoony than any other depiction of the creatures in cartoons prior like Falling Hare or Russian Rhapsody, since the havoc wreaking chaos they ensue paints them as rambunctious teenagers going against society rather than merely strange creatures coming out of nowhere. Jerry Goldsmith's score conveys the dark humor and nonstop suspense flawlessly and John Hora's cinematography adds into the thrill of seeing strange creatures scramble from the shadows in lieu of the holiday season. Considering the influence of the Warner Bros cartoons at play, it's no wonder Dante and his crew took the chance to unleash their inner mania through the art of B-movie tributes.By blending horror and comedy with enough heart, frights and laughter all in 100 minutes, Gremlins holds up wonderfully as a modern Christmas classic. If you haven't seen this film before, you're curious about more of Dante's work or you're an overall sucker for wacky horror comedies, then this film is right up your alley. Now that the film is approaching its 40 year anniversary quite soon, there couldn't be a better time to check it out than this very moment. After all, you never know when something innocent could turn into something dangerous if one doesn't take their well being into consideration.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Comparing to it's peers, The Goolies, Critters etc seems a little unfair, the story is sharp, fast paced and is carried by all the actors.It has the distinct feel of a B movie but the dialouge at the end reminds us that we have seen a film which dares to be corny and comes out trumps. On top of all this it is the best peice of anti-CGI work since the Jason and the Argonauts Skellington fight. The models show real character from the unquestionably adorable mogwi puppet to the humerous yet somehow frightening gremlins. Had this film been made in the last 8 or 9 years the character of the film would have been lost and along with that half the fun. Take the scene where Spike is followed by thousands of Gremlins all stomping their tiny legs, to the audience this isn't perfect animation by any means but the movement gives them real character. When I read reviews that state this movie is predictable and one dimensional I remind myself that idiots that make comments like this must've forgotten that from start to finish the movie is presented as a ghost story. The essence of any good ghost story is telling you a moral. However predictable it is. When the moral is as well presented as this anyone who doesn't enjoy the film should check their pulse.",,Anonymous,Horror
Missed Opportunity,"I remember, when I was a child, we used to watch this movie quite often and were chilled by some scenes. Today, many years later, I gave it a go. I found the morphed gremlins really creepy. The visual effects are so fun for the time. However, the cast is terrible. They are all dull and uninteresting except the Chinese man who appears for only a few minutes. During the movie, I kept asking myself what the target audience was and I couldn't find an answer. Normally, it was supposed to be children or all audiences. For such a movie, a more talented and lively lead character like Michael J. Fox should have been chosen. He could have turned this into a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bizarre Horror Comedy,"When I was a child this was ""a children's movie."" I had a stuffed Mogwai, and story books with 45 rpm records from some fast food franchise based on the movie. What a surprise to return to this as an adult and realize this could not be marketed for kids as aggressively today.Gremlins is full of old ladies threatening to murder pet dogs, and assorted monsters that are miraculously as smart, mischievous and deadly to any human that stands in their way as a fully grown young adult chimpanzee within days of being born. Mom microwaves one, stabs another and mangles a third in the cake mixer.The end effect is kind of bizarre, with the cuteness and unrealistic fantasy of a kids' movie with a level violence which should probably not be encouraged around little kids under the age of eight.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Forgotten Christmas Movie,"The title to this review may be a little misleading. No one could forget Gremlins. The movie is wonderful, funny, and just the right amount of scary for a young child. However, a lot of people seem to forget that this movie falls into the category of Christmas movies. If you are one who thinks Die Hard is not a Christmas movie, then you may disagree. If you think Die Hard is a Christmas movie, then you cannot deny Gremlins is a Christmas movie as well. For Pete's sake, the Mogwi was a Christmas gift!Like most highly successful and enjoyable movies of the 80's, Steven Speilberg's fingerprints can be found all over this one. No, he did not direct. However, he was involved in the making of the film, which perhaps contributed to the enjoyability of this film. And even today, if I hear a strange noise or something seems to inexplicably be broken or not working, I can't help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, the root of the problem may be a gremlin.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great any time of the year!,"Gremlins is packed with sheer joy, from its art direction to character design and devotion to showing just how messy the gremlins can get.

It's a film worth watching any time of the year - in fact, it came out in the summertime despite its holiday setting.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Had some fun moments, but it hasn't aged well","Gremlins is considered a classic film from the 80s with fans from many generations and loved for its violence and humour and helped forced the creation of the PG-13 rating in America. But it a film that has not aged as well as some people think it has, having a jarring tone between the cutey humour to the dark humour and horror elements. For a film of the time it had great special effects, using animatronics and stop-motion animation and the sequence when we see the Gremlins get killed is gory fun (it was the best in the film). But Gremlins was not funny enough, either relying on slapstick and physical humour to misjudged dark comedy which made me more concerned about how many people died or were injured. The acting from everyone was perfectly fine and Joe Dante did direct at a brisk pace, Gizmo was a cute creation and there is certainly a message against exotic pet ownership, but I could not love it like some other people do.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Weird but Fun,"Gremlins comes from a time in film when, in order to accomplish desired effects, hard work was required instead of computers digitally performing all the magic.
The special effects in this movie are nothing short of fantastic. GIzmo is one of the most adorable creatures in all of film history, and his mechanics are second to none for the time. His evil Mogwai counterparts are surprisingly well performed technically. This isn't a film that went cheap on special effects and it really shows. It's extremely well dated.
The film itself, despite being an absolute classic, starts to drag somewhere in the middle, making the movie feel like it's just a little bit too long with a little too much going on. The first act was fantastic, with its introduction to Gizmo and multiple shots establishing that precious little creature, and the final act was exciting, but it really started to get tedious toward the middle.It's a brilliant concept with a unique kind of evil that can be, without convenient circumstances, practically impossible to stop. The writing and acting were great as well.
This movie really embodies what made the 80s such a fantastic time for film. It's a movie that's worth multiple rewatches and will undoubtedly be on my watchlist for both Halloween and Christmas.Also, young Corey Feldman. You can't get any more 80s than that.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Scared me when I was little,"When I first saw this movie ( I was in elementary school back then), I was expecting a nice kids films with nice cute furry creatures, and well, I got the creatures, but not the way I expected. Now anyways, this movies starts with a inventor, Rand Peltzer(Hoyt Axton)going to Chinatown, looking for a gift for his son, Billy(Zach Galligan) for Christmas. He goes into a shop and after a failed attempt to pitch one of his inventions, the bathroom buddy, he hears something in the back. There's a box, with a extremely adorable creature named a Mogwai, singing an equally as cute song. Although the owner(Keye Luke) refuses to sell Peltzer the Mogwai, his grandson(John Louie), says different. Before he sells the Mogwai, the boy tells Peltzer 3 rules to follow: 1;don't expose him to bright lights(especially sunlight, it kills him), 2;don't get him wet, and the most important one, NEVER feed him after midnight. While Peltzer isn't the one in this movie who winds up breaking the rules, his son does. After getting his new pet, now called Gizmo(and struggling not to break rule #1), he winds up breaking rules #2 & #3, which as a result forces poor Gizmo to... we'll just say, the title creatures are born and wreak havoc on Billy's hometown, Kingston Falls. While I was frightened with this movie back then, now I just shake it off. The scene in the bar is quite funny(I'm not giving anything away.), and I find Gizmo to be soooooooo cuuuuuute, I prefer the sequel overall. C.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's quite good fun this, at the start, but as it progresses the joke wears a bit thin and the mayhem just a little too slapstick for me.

Hi HO!,"Gremlins is a Christmas Horror comedy that follows the story of a young man named Billy. After his father buys a strange creature called a Mogwai name Gizmo. Soon the whole town's in trouble when Gizmo multiples several Mogwai which then turn into Gremlins Which soon wreak havoc on the whole town. Gremlins are by all means one of the most fun and creative Christmas movies to excite From the combined efforts of director Joe Dante and Producer Steven Spielberg. It adds the perfect amount of mischievous fun and dark humor and is not only a great Christmas movie but a family film. Its story is paced out well spending a considerable amount of time setting the characters and getting to know them. Seeing how these some of these people live. It doesn't just focus on the family with side roles from Dick miller and Young Corey Feldman adding some memorable roles. The parent is memorable from the mother to the father who is an inventor. Whose gadgets never work and you just see them fail one after another? It manages to keep that wholesomely family tone throughout the whole movie, as you get this emotional bond between Billy and Gizmo. All of it makes everything look so peaceful and normal. When the Gremlins show up it is entering more of the traditional monster movie, with people running and being attacked. It's done so comically entertaining. The film as a whole is great, but the Gremlins are the best part of the film that everybody remembers. On just how funny and wicked they are overall. Their just looking to party just at the cost of human lives. Iconic scenes are the Bar and Movie theater scenes that almost make ya wanna have a drink with them before they chew your face off. There's this old woman who's just a despicable person through the first half and when the Gremlins get her your just like yeah. Another scene that's one of the few that doesn't fit all that much involves Kate she is not a bad character, but when she gives her reason why she hates Christmas. She explains it and all you can say is where did come from. Even Billy like where the hell did that come from?",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brown Grogu vs Ugly Green Minions,"I wasn't interested in this movie at all, but I knew I would watch it one day. Yes I did and I didn't like it. Honestly it was better than I expected, but I don't think the horror-comedy genre is a good idea. I watched many 80's movies and enjoyed most of them. Unfortunately, this movie was not one of those movies. I think it's an overrated movie. There's a lot of bullsh*** in the movie. If you have a pet and there are things that are forbidden to it, you must first ASK WHY and then you have to SEARCH !!! Not asking these questions and doing things that were forbidden made me feel cold from the movie. Frankly, the movie isn't terrible, but it's not as good as it's exaggerated.

Good movie gone bad,"Like the little furry guys themselves, this is a movie with a very promising start that ends up nowhere fun.  Axton picks up meek creature, unaware of consequences if simple handling instructions are ignored.  End result is a bunch of little monsters that terrorize small town.

Revenge of the 80's: Gremlins!!  A Joe Dante Film.,"Gremlins (1984) was a strange fantasy film from Roger Corman protégé Joe Dante. He creates a film that pays homage to the science-fiction films of the fifties. The film was so successful, it spawned a line of merchandise, a couple of video games and a highly successful sequel.A middle aged inventor (Hoyt Axton) is searching for a perfect Christmas present for his son. One day he comes across an Asian curio shop. He falls for the store owner's unique pet. After an unsuccessful business deal with the shop's owner (Keye Luke) his young assistant sells the pet to him. Before parting he tells him the rules of the ""Mogwai"". Never get him wet, keep him out of light and NEVER feed him after midnight. Delighted, he takes the pet home. His kid (Zach Galligan) falls in love with his new pet. But being a stupid kid, following set rules is not as easy as it seems. Co-stars Phoebe Cates (wow) and Roger Corman stock player Dick Miller.A fun film for all ages. But keep the real young ones away. Several scenes will scare them silly.

Parents had to actually watch films with their children back when women had tails and men rode wholly mammoths.

One of the best Creature Features,Gremlins is a perfect horror movie for younger audiences! It can be scary and tense without being too horrifying. It can be fun and charming without being too cute. And it can be a simple story that's very effective and unique. The characters are all full of realistic charisma and interesting individual personalities. All of the practical effects and puppetry for the Gremlins still hold up even to this day.

Then by accident he feeds the new mowgwi food after midnight and they become GREMLINS!!!!! Its a cracking film filled with laughs and nasty parts galore that will have everyone either in stitches or behind the couch. The Gremlins are nasty critters that like mischief so the film got a high 15 rating here in the UK. However fear not this is a family film through and through with nothing but Gremliney pranks the whole way through. The acting ain't class buts its done to a decent level and Hoyt Axton makes a great Mr. Peltzer. The characters are cool Billy, Mrs Deagle but not just the human characters the cute mowgi Gizmo and evil Gremlin leader Stripe are acts of Genius.

The gremlins were very cool, and it was interesting how clever they were to wreck all that havoc (i.e. cutting off the power of a traffic light). Yes, the effects could have better, but this is just one of those movies you just wanna have fun with, and not really take seriously. The part where the gremlins were at the bar was very funny! I'll always remember the gremlins attacking the Santa Claus guy, or the gremlins watching Snow White. It was a kind of sci-fi/horror/comedy crossover.Don't listen to the Leonard Maltin review. He gave the sequel a good rating, and that sequel was just as volient as the first one(I'll bet he did that just because he himself had a cameo in the movie). Anyway, a 8.5/10.",,Anonymous,Horror

Still Love it,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it when it came out. What's so funny to me is my brother adopted 2 rescue kittens I had several years ago. He named them Gizmo and Gremlin. They definitely resemble the characters in the movie. Gizmo is sweet and wouldn't hurt anyone or another cat, but Gremlin has a temper at times and can be mean. I HAVE to watch this movie again this Christmas season 😊. Have watched it many times and it never gets old. Love the story and interaction between the characters and of course there are so many humorous moments too. Although we are all older now, it's become a family tradition.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't Miss Out On A Great Film! A Kid's Review,"SEE ""GREMLINS"". Everything about it is wonderful. I don't care if you stop reading this review. I won't be offended. Go to the video rental place, rent ""Gremlins"", and enjoy this instant classic.For those of you that will wait a bit before you leave to be entertained, here is what the movie is about. The movie ""Gremlins"" is about a boy named Billy Peltzer. For Christmas, he gets three unusual rules, (Don't get him wet, Don't expose him to light, and never, NEVER,feed him after midnight)and a cuter than cute as a button creature called a mogwai. The Peltzer family names the mogwai Gizmo, and instantly, and accidentally, for that matter, break the bright light rule. Gizmo is shocked for a moment, but recovers in seconds.They learn that bright light hurts Mogwais. The next 15-20 minutes are all just packed with extremely cute stuff that Gizmo and Billy do together. then, the water rule is broken, and Gizmo multiples. The new mogwais are nothing like Gizmo. They just seem meaner than Gizmo(and they all ARE meaner). The new mogwais have a leader mogwai named Stripe. (Stripe has a white puffy Mohawk on his head, so you can tell him apart from the other mogwai.) And finally, the new mogwais trick Billy into feeding them after midnight, and become (you guessed it) Gremlins. The Gremlins are as mean-spirited as they were when they were mogwai! They are still even lead by Stripe! And Stripe still has a puffy, white Mohawk! The only differences between the Gremlins and the evil Mogwais are: Gremlins are slimy and evil and can hurt you, and the mogwai are furry and evil and cannot hurt you (yet). The Gremlins reek havoc,(but worse, MUUUUUCH worse) on the town, which is very funny.The acting is tremendous and the puppetry is amazing and the movie itself is jaw dropping. See ""Gremlins"". one of the most unforgettable movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of my Favourite 'Family' Movies,","Gremlins is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a good cast. I always have fun watching this no matter how many times I've seen it and it normally makes for a great viewing with the family, just make sure they are older than eight at least as it is a dark film and though it isn't necessarily a horror, I wouldn't necessarily call it a family film either. I think the weakest point of the movie was its human characters, I liked Billy and Kate, but the rest of the human cast felt very underdeveloped and the majority were very two dimensional, I certainly would have liked to have seen the mother and especially the father develop more, he certainly had a story to tell that wasn't touched upon enough. The best part of the movie is, of course, the Gremlins themselves, particularly Gizmo, they can be lovable, terrifying, charming and outrageous, they're certainly one of the most memorable characters in film history. Not without its flaws, but Gremlins is a classic that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good horror or comedy, it's fun for the family as well depending on the ages.A man buys his son an usual creature for Christmas which comes with some important rules, when these rules aren't followed, catastrophe ensues.Best Performance: Zach Galligan Worst Performance: Polly Holiday",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love Gizmo,"I love this movie so much, i love seeing Gizmo, he dose cheer me up when I am in the blues.This movie is about Billy who get this creature from his dad from a antic store for Xmas present.Bily names the cute little Creature Gizmo, there 3 rules he need follow.1) He can't be in lights or sun light that would kill him. 2) Never get him wet. 3)Never feed him after Midnight.Then a friend of him comes over to seem him and then start playing with him and knocking of a glass with a bit of water in it that falls on Gizmo start shaking really badly and fur balls start jumping out of Gizmo back, which turn into more creatures and look a lot more Goofy then first Gizmo.Then billy falls a sleep for bit looking at clock (His unaware that creatures have chewing the wire on clock) and then he feed them after midnight.Turn in green big eggs, when they hatch that when the fun really start for the creatures and take over the town.This is great fun enjoyable movie for whole family to watch, the most of it is comedy that is bit of Drama in this movie with Billy Girlfriend who dose not like Xmas because something bad happened to family when she little girl on Xmas day, which is little sad.Yes it's A horror/comedy, I do think it's suitable for kids, my kids love this movie they both seen this movie 10 times by now. I seen it, well, I see it so many times I have lot count.Acting from the whole cast is great and creature effects were really outstanding.I going to give this a whooping 10 out of bloody 10 One reason I giving this movie 10 out of 10 is that Gizmo, why can't he be real!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Monster Christmas,"I've been seeking out some Christmas related films I'd not seen before and wondering why my wife to this day still utters ""Bright lights"" when ever a room is lit up suddenly and talks about ""Gizmo eyes"", I decided to follow her recommendation and watch it with her.I'm broadly aware of Joe Dante's reputation for spoof monster flicks and to be fair, I'll cut him some slack for mashing up a cutesy Christmas movie supposedly centring on a teenage boy's predilection for unusual and cuddly pets with a vintage monster movie with lots of outlandish and ghoulish deaths along the way. The film just about works by switching between the two modes at will, keeping the viewer on the hop all the time, indeed he serves notice of his intentions by interspersing classic film clips of quite different movies, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Them"" for instance.Although many of the attack scenes are plain silly, like when Billy's mother takes on four Gremlins in her kitchen and especially the demise of Mrs Deagle which must have set back the sales of chairlifts at the time, Dante generally gets away with mixing up the goofy with the gore, even if to me the Gremlins themselves looked no more dangerous than Animal from ""The Muppets"".A strange mixture then but perhaps not a movie to play for the very young on Christmas Eve.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A wonderfully subversive (yet still accessible) holiday classic.,"I remember loving this as a kid, liking it a little less when I watched it at about 18, and now going back to loving it again at 26. I can't explain how... maybe watching it on Christmas helped?Gremlins is an incredibly fun movie, with a satisfying buildup of a first half that explodes into extremely entertaining madness in its second half. Jumping around in tone from Spielberg sentimentality to horror to slapstick comedy to one character's weirdly tragic backstory shouldn't work, but it kind of does. The fact it's so all over the place might add to its charm.It's a well-written and constructed movie though, so while it can be gleefully messy, it's definitely not a mess. Also, the special effects are all fantastic, and have aged extremely well.I remember the sequel being almost as good, so I look forward to rewatching that sometime soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

A holiday movie favorite.,"My Take: A cult classic holiday comedy with wild knowing in-jokes and crazy special effects.I watched the sequel before watching this original. I like both films the same, one of the best horror/comedy films, and maybe one of the best film of all time. The story is memorable and director Joe Dante and Executive producer Steven Spielberg gives all their best to adapt Chris Colombus' offbeat and quirky script.Who would forget the early nights before Christmas, when young Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives the cute furball Gizmo as a present fro his dad (Hoyt Axton)? And who would also forget the bad results when the three very important rules (1. Don't Expose them to bright light 2. Don't get him wet 3. (Most importantly!!!) Don't feed them after midnight) are broken? And finally, who would forget the mischief and mayhem the night before Christmas, and the endless fun at every viewing?GREMLINS is that familiar movie that you couldn't help but love, even if some of its standards don't live up. Sure the special effects are long surpassed and so is the pacing, but GREMLINS is that classic in its own way that you'll just love it the way it is.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I first got it a few years ago and I was ashamed of myself after waiting all these years. Gizmo was cute and innocent but after those rules were broken , here come the mean and gricous Gremlins. No matter how vicious they were or playing tricks on people much less getting drunk in a bar , these were the bad guys and you had to expect anything.",,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins,"There are so many types of monsters around in the film industry. Godzilla and King Kong are the type of monsters that are massively big and known to cause terror to large cities. You can also say a monster is something like Dracula, Freddy Krueger or just a murdering villain. In my mind, you can't always put a type of monster into a certain genre and this is a type of discussion that could last for a while.Fitting into that long discussion should be the 1984 film Gremlins, a monster film in many ways. Inventor Randy Pultzer (Hoyt Axton) while in Chinatown gets an animal known as a mogwai as a early Christmas present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). A mogwai could be described as very small and fury creature who's owner must observe strict rules regarding their handling or negative consequences will occur. For example, they can't be fed after midnight, can't be exposed to bright lights nor can they come into contact with water. If these rules are not observed basically you get ""monster terror"".To say a mogwai is one certain type of creature would wrong. A mogwai is a type of creature that could appear in a Saturday morning cartoon or a family film but once those mogwai handling rules are broken, he turns into the exact opposite who could be something very R rated. It is then a type of creature wanting to cause harm to the town and also a very ugly looking thing. The actions scenes involving them interestingly combine horror and comedy. The scenes involving them are quite fun and also ahead of it's time with some great special effects.That said, there are some plot holes in these scenes. Being set at Christmas time, many of the action scenes are set in the snow. So how can the gremlins run through snow as they do when you know snow is filled with water which is against the mogwai rules? You can't feed a mogwai past a certain time but the film gives us no clue to what time zone we are in and if you think about it, anywhere in the world it's past midnight somewhere?As any good film should do, this film give the cast many things to do. Billy is our leader and main fighter for the town. Phoebe Cates playing Kate Beringer is the Billy's love interest. She is very likable and also very sexy as always. Randall Peltzer is the father who I'm sure feels some sort of blame towards the creatures creating havoc in his town and his character does have some funny moments with his strange and worthless inventions. Even Corey Feldman shows up as the character Pete who is like your little brother in that he is highly annoying and just seems to roam around without direction but you like him though.Gremlins apparently was one of the movies which introduced the PG-13 rating. It is a film that in some respects defines 1980's era films. It is a film that I enjoyed more when I was a little boy but the teenager in me still found something in it that I liked. Gremlins would surely work for a modern family audience today. This is a film that is as powerful then as it is now. Monster film joy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun little monster flick,"Gremlins is the fun little monster flick that spawned a slew of ripoffs {Ghoulies, Critters}, a sequel, and the PG-13 rating. Its fun, funny, and noisy all at the same time.The film centers around a postcard-ish little town, with all the usual characters: The nice kid, the pretty girl, the arrogant fool, the grouchy old woman, the stupid police officers, and the friendly neighbors. When Billy's dad, a struggling inventor, wanders off to Chinatown to get his son a gift, he has no idea what he's in for when he finds a box with a furry little creature named Gizmo. There are some rules surrounding Gizmo: Don't expose him to sunlight, don't feed him after midnight, and don't EVER get him wet. Of course, rules were meant to be broken...The madness that ensues is, sometimes frightening, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes gross. The violence was enough to help spawn the PG-13 rating. The performances are likable despite a clichéd and a bit silly script, and the film has a nice holiday feel to it that makes it fun to watch around Dec. 25. Its also not a bad children's horror movie, with plenty of funny scenes {carroling gremlins, drinking gremlins, Snow White gremlin fans}.Gremlins is by no means a flawless film, but its just what the doctor ordered. It gives you a nice, fun story, and some likable characters {and creatures}. It helped give a rebirth to the little green monster genre that fired up in the 80's, and continued to show Joe Dante's talent as a director who blended absurd horror and absurder comedy.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins,"Gremlins is a interesting little film about small little monsters terrorizing a small town. The movie starts with a man who buys a little mogwai pet named Gizmo from an older gentleman in Chinatown for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). There are three rules when it comes to Gizmo. You can't feed it after midnight, it can't be exposed to bright light/sunlight, and most importantly do not let it get wet. If Gizmo gets wet, many little ""gremlins"" will pop out of it's back. Of course Billy doesn't follow the rules at all. All hell breaks loose in the town right on Christmas Eve of all nights. Billy and his girlfriend Kate (Pheobe Cates) must stop the little creatures before they destroy everything and everyone.The movie is well done with it's effects. The little gremlins looks and seem like real live monsters. And Gizmo is the cutest thing on film I've ever seen. The scenes where the Gremlins are watching Snow White in the movie theatre is pure comedic gold! They even sing along to ""hi ho hi ho, it's off to work we go"". But, that's near the end of the film. There are many slow parts throughout. The police don't believe Billy when he tells them monsters are attacking the town. And it gets annoying watching him break all of the rules that must be followed with a pet mogwai.Zach Galligan and Pheobe Cates are two of my all time favourite ""80's"" younger actors. They both play the lead characters. I think that at times Gremlins takes itself way to serious and that's a difference from this one and the sequel. It's a movie about little monsters terrorizing a town. The second one pokes fun at the plot. I haven't seen 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch' in years, but I remember preferring that one to this.Still it's a must see movie for all.7/10",,Anonymous,Horror

I wish I had a Bathroom Buddy,"Possibly one of the greatest movies of the 80's, if not the last forty years.  Classic and influential, and what's best, it's still entertaining to watch even after all these years.The story concerns Billy (Zach Galligan), a young bank teller/free lance cartoonist whose father brings him home a rare creature as a Christmas present.  Gizmo, the creature in question, soon multiplies when he's splashed with water, and spawns a group of evil clones, led by Stripe. These creatures then transform into monsters and escape into town, causing all categories of chaos on Christmas Eve.Joe Dante successfully copies the same style he employed for his earlier film THE HOWLING and packs this movie with enough in-jokes for four movies. For all their grotesque physiques, the gremlins are somewhat cute, particularly when they watch SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS, easily the film's most famous scene.But the movie's finest moment concerns the fate of Ruby Deagle, the town's evil old landowner.  Much like Aunt Edna in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION, you'll laugh rather then be appalled when the old nag gets her just desserts.All in all, if you've never scene this movie, you're missing out on one of the greatest motion pictures of our time.  Alternately scary and funny, sometimes in the same minute, it stands alone among all the horror/comedies of it's time, second only to GHOSTBUSTERS.  So get up right now and root for Gizmo and Billy as the fight the forces of evil.  You won't be sorry, I'll promise you that.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

But ""Gremlins"" was my favorite of the bunch, and it still is today. One of the first films to come from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, this horror/comedy directed by Joe Dante and written by Chris Columbus is great fun.

Unmatched originality,""" So the next time your refrigerator goes on the fritz, don't call a repairman.  You just never know, there might be a gremlin in the house. ""These are the words to end Gremlins.  And after the rollercoaster ride that the film has just put us through, they are the perfect way to end the film. These creatures are perhaps the funniest and most entertaining little ghouls I have ever seen.  They act like spoiled rotten little rich kids.  These gremlins could be human characters in books by Steven King.  They are not just mischeivious, they are down right mean, hilarious, awful, cruel and carefree.  Their idea of a good time is to spit up nasty loogies, flash people, swing from light fixtures, play poker, drink to annebriation, bite, claw, scratch and kill.  If you haven't seen this film, you have no idea what you are missing.  I think this is one of the most original films, on par with Star Wars in terms of originality.  Neither film has been imitated. You just can't do it.Not only is this film entertaining and a little scary, but it is unbelievably funny.  And I think the hilarity stems from watching these varments act crazy.  They don't give a rat's ass about anything or anyone. They do what they please when they please and they are oblivious to the consequences of their actions.  There is one scene where they are attacking a Santa Clause and they are just hanging off him like he is a toy.  They are just terrorizing him.  They probably won't kill him, but they sure will scare the hell out of him.  They are also incredibly juvenile in their speech.  They seem to have a firm grasp of the English language but they speak like babies.  ""Deagle, YUM YUM!""  or when they see Gizmo at one point, they whisper, ""Gizmo, Caca""Gremlins has one of the most amazing production teams assembled.  It was directed by Joe Dante, produced by the Amblin people ( Kennedy, Marshall and Spielberg ) and written by Chris Columbus.  No wonder this is a top notch production.  With people like this that have the propensity for success, I'm sure great pains were taken to get everything right.  And it shows.Gremlins is a film that I don't think can be imitated and that is because any attempt to make a film like this again and you would be accused of duplicating it.  So this may actually go down in history as one of the only films out there that doesn't have a clone.9 out of 10 One of the best film to come out of the 80's.  Watch for a funny line in Goonies when Chunk is calling the cops to report the Fratelli's and the cop says to him, ""Sure, sure, just like the time you called and told us about the little green monsters that were attacking you.""

The comedy really works the way so many other movies have tried to work (and failed). Its squadron of knock-offs are entertaining but not as good, My favorite being Critters. Critters also works but still, it was not as good a movie. The others being: Ghoulies, Ghoulies II, Ghoulies III, Ghoulies IV, Munchies, and I guess Troll. Gremlins also had a sequel, which declined in quality. I think it could have a 3rd installment as long as it didn't go computer animation.

B-movie monster flick updated with a tongue-in-cheek 80s approach with great results: hack inventor Axton picks up a cute, fuzzy Mogwai as an exotic pet for his teenage son for Christmas with only three catches: don't expose it to bright light, don't get it wet with water, and never, ever, feed it after midnight with naturally no one paying attention to these, resulting in mayhem with reptillian Gremlins taking over the small town they inhabit. Great special effects by Chris Walas and pop culture-influenced screenplay by budding filmmaker Chris Columbus.  Neat blend of horror and comedy, and yes that is Howie Mandel as the voice of cuddly Gizmo (The Giz!)  Look quick for Steven Spielberg (in the inventors' convention sequence with sci-fi icon Robby the Robot) and Bugs Bunny animating genius Chuck Jones.  ***Trivia note: this was the first film to receive a PG-13 rating by the MPAA for its surprisingly effective cartoon violence.

It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is not a good movie if like to see a lot of blood. But if you are some who likes a great horror story you will like this movie. It got a 7.2 which is a good ratting. But this is such a great film the 7.2 is underrating it. I give it 10 out of 10 because it is a great movie. This is one of the best horror movie around. It is not c.h.e.e.s.e.y. If you like horror movie this is a must see. I need more lines and I am running out of things to say.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best.,"This is one of the best films ever made, in my option.  A must see film. Some of my favorite scenes: The movie theater, the toy shop,and the kid in the tree suit.  This is OK for the kiddies, though it is rather violent. Funny, check out the reference to Forbidden Planet!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Cheesy but Good Film,"Gremlins is a very solid Christmas horror comedy film. Maybe the writing can be cheesy with the first half of the movie. But the rest of the movie gets better with wacky antics of the monstrous Gremlins. The characters are strong. The effects are great, even with the neat movements from the Gremlins and how they make a town look chaotic. And it does have heart with the bonding of Billy and Gizmo. If you're in to see a movie that's mixed horror and Christmas, this can be a film for you. It may not be one of the best horror movies of the 80s, but it can be fun to watch. At least comparing to some knockoffs it has been getting.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hoyt Axton as inventor?,"Oh this one is funny, it has some great, key film moments and images of the 80's that you won't soon forget if you have seen it...the Gremlin in the Nuke, for example; Hoyt Axton farting around with his inventions in the background, including an egg-beater/fly swatter that you see whizzing about in the background, the Gremlins singing 'hi ho hi ho', one turning to the other and saying, basso profote voice-MILK DUDS!, the other saying 'YEAH!' and leaving right before the rest get nailed, etc. etc.This was so much fun back in the summer of '84; even Phoebe Cates traditional semi-nasty 80s chick was softened here; makes you wonder whatever happened to Zach Galligan here myself..A good flick, worth seeing of course.*** outta ****, fun.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good til Violence-as-Comedy ruins it,"Since I was past puberty the first time I saw this & am a LOT older now, maybe I just needed to be 10 yrs old to like this. I LOVE comedy. WACKY comedy. Verbal comedy. Physical comedy. This? Violence-as-Comedy??? I don't get it. It is just stupid & annoying. 4* for the Positives = up until the gremlins take over, it is quite cutesy nostalgic & the gremlins & mogwai are well done. But, the Violence-as-Comedy story??? Keep it.

Funny light horror film,"This is a light, funny chiller about an exotic pet gone bad - a Mogwai- that becomes evil on Christmas after very specific rules are broken.  There are good special effects and physical comedy - it makes the perfect dark Christmas movie.  Incidentally, this and Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom were the films that forced the MPAA to begin the PG-13 rating.  It does seem a bit dated, though, since its 1984 release.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Monster Christmas Party,"As much as like the cheerful kind of Christmas films, personally I'm more fascinated with those bizarre ones that really put the yang in the holiday. This film though is what started that trend for me, I've seen this film when I was 7, I loved it then and I love it now it's not just one of my favorite Chirstmas films but one of my favorite films of all time.I really love the story which I'll admit is a very unusual and really daring idea for a Christmas film but it really worked and I loved it because it was just a change of pace for me. For it's time mixing horror and Christmas was really unheard of (it's still rarely done to this day), but it turned out to be a great combo where it not just delivers some frights but also smiles and managed to still emit that warm Christmas feel if you can believe that.Production value is excellent done on a big budget but used correctly, The creature effects are fantastic because their all practical, there is no CGI bull crap. The designs of both the Mogwai and Gremlins are great, they look like animals they could exist in our modern world. And the animatronics and pupetering is perfect, from their facial expressions giving each of them a persona and their movements.The voice acting for the creatures is amazing. From comedian Howie Mandel for Gizmo which is just spot on because each sound just sprouts cuteness, of course he used some of those same tones for his voice acting role for Bobby in the animated show ""Booby's World"" (another cute little guy). And of course Frank Wekler as the Gremlin Stripe is just fantastic, Frank Wekler is my favorite voice actor this guy is just a chameleon of voices, let alone the fact that I'm a ""Transformers"" fan and on a side note Peter Culen another ""Transformers"" alumi also does voice work as one of the Gremlins so that's cool. But Frank's voice also fits like a glove for this character as it just emits menace, mischievousness, and nastiness.I really like the small town they use because it just has that sense of familiarity, I myself have lived and grew up in places like Kingston Falls. And the music is great as it's by one of my favorite movie composers Jerry Goldsmith, that theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time.The characters are great from the creatures like Gizmo whom is just cute both physically but mainly in personality, you just want to hug and keep the little guy close. His character is a bit mischievous but has just this unending innocence as he just wants to have fun. Really love how he is fascinated and slightly influence by pop culture which makes the creature relatable because that's like with any of us: as we see him watch some racing film staring Clark Gable that really gets Gizmo interested in driving a car of his own which he of course does near the end.Stripe and the Gremlins, their one of my favorite fictional villains and monsters. Their just fun villains because despite how much trouble and chaos they cause which is what they practically thrive on they just love to have fun. From scarfing down food and candy, playing video games, to watching Snow White. This sort of gives the Gremlins a bit of relatablity because these are the kind of things we love doing the most with our lives.However what also drives the movie are the human characters, their actually well rounded and a bit three dimensional which makes us care for them and feel like what they do and go though in this ordeal matters.Billy's dad is great, his character may have been a partial influence for Steve Urkel as he is an inventor but unfortunately not a very successful one because despite how creative his inventions are they don't work. But that never gets him down, he keeps trying because he passionate about his role it's one of the things he does best in life.Kate is also great, I'll admit I had a crush on actress Pheobe Cates when I was a kid. She's that girl next door kind of person, whom is sweet but also really sympathetic because she isn't having the easiest time as she is struggling both professionally and personally.But of course my favorite human character is Billy, I really like this protagonist because I can really relate to the guy. We see he's doesn't really have all the breaks but he has big dreams, as he is an artist he is constantly drawing and he's a fan of graphic novels/comic books, it's like with me I'm into comic books/graphic novels also and I constantly write. So he's hopping to be a comic book artist or in some profession where he can do one of the things he does best in life to be somebody, all he needs is a chance to find a way to step up. You can say the predicament he's in is that chance in one hell of a way, because we see him actually stepping up becoming somebody a hero.There are lots of great scenes, one favorite scene of mine which is Billy's mom confortation with the Gremlins which I thought was suspenseful fun and of course it had my favorite Gremlin kill which was death by Microwave, it was gross but cool seeing the Gremlin just explode like bad leftovers. That bar room scene which is hilarious because it plays out like a giant Mad Magazine or Where's Waldo comic illustration.So if your a horror fan and love Christmas then this is your party, and happy holidays.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the greats...,"Many great films have a half a dozen (or more) copy-cats.  This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures.  Gremlins, along with it's sequal are part of the ""Greats"", like ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"", ""Ghostbusters"", among many many others. Some people don't get this dark comedy, and that's understandable.  It is a mean spirited, fantasy film at times, but sometimes you laugh harder after you've been scared nearly to death.  It would be wrong to deny this film it's just do.  It showed, along with ""Jaws"", that thrillers can be fun and profitable, if you do it right. A loveable Creature named Gizmo, is brought home to Billy Peltzer, by his father, Rand.  The new gift came with 3 rules.  All of which Billy must abide by,and was forwarned.  Billy does his best, but fails as he brakes the most important rule and lets loose hundreds of green monsters, that love to break things, and hurt people.  It is a zany film, and if you haven't seen it, I don't want to give to much away.  Enjoy the film, and it's sequel, which is one of the few arguably worthy sequels in film history.  So check out ""Gremlins.""",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another Great Dante Flick,"Joe Dante seems to have some connection directly into my head, as his films never fail to entertain me.  Gremlins is no exception, as it basically parodies the old Universal horror flicks, monster movies in general, small town movies and plays like Our Town, and throws in a whole lot in-jokes and sight gags as well (see Trivia).  The Gremlins remain to this day the most grotesquely loveable ""monsters"" in screen history.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The ultimate feel-good family movie!,"This is the ONLY film I have come across in the IMDb that does not appear to have attracted a bad or negative comment. 98% of reviewers were obviously captivated by it. I am not about to change that, I believe GREMLINS was probably the most innovative and lovable fantasy ever conceived. Without doubt, Gizmo was the cutest and most lovable ""creature"" ever put up on the big screen and as one reviewer correctly pointed out, not a child on this planet in 1984 didn't want ""Gizmo"" for Christmas (I had to buy 3)There were those who saw ""Stripe"" as way over-the-top violent and this was an arguably justifiable complaint in some circles, but hey, this was predominantly a comedy and the gremlins played it for fun rather than horror. Gizmo of course retained his Disneyesque appeal throughout the movie watching as his compatriots tore the neighborhood apart. Yes, the cinema sequence was a classic and both this and the less-successful sequel worked at an adult level too - just listen to some of the black humor that would sail well over the heads of the younger viewer.A multi layered, almost unclassifiable masterpiece of entertainment and Phoebe Cates?  damn, that girl does something for me!

my notes,"Gremlins are awesome and funny. this movie is pretty bad tho. not in the sense that it is too goofy or over the top, i don't mind that. but it's riddled with old movie qualities. it has a bunch of extra story lines that have no effect on the main story, they are a huge waste of time and detract from the fun of the gremlins. the dad inventor story line and the mean old lady story line, smh. basically anything that didn't have to do with gremlins was completely useless. and while i love the main theme song, the rest of the music in this movie is so old and outdated. i think they did a good job on the actual gremlins for the pre-CGI era. they're so awesome and funny. gizmo is so damn cute lmao (about 3 viewings)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can't Believe It Took Me This Long To Watch!,"A perfect mix of everything I love in movies! 80's, Christmas, Animals, and horror.

84's E.T. but not as money grossing,"Just about the same time, there was a lot of Ghostbusting going around, out came this other cute little blockbuster, that holds it's own, if comparing it to Ghostbusters, where there would of been silent competition going with these two flicks. When salesman who sucks (Axton) buys a really unique present, Gizmo, a cute little gremlin, for his son (likeable Galligan) bedlam happens, when the three vital rules, to taking responsibility for it, are ignored thanks to the neighbor's son, Feldman, who gets kind of too enthused. Soon we have many other angry and vicious Gremlins, unlike the cute Gizmo, and the majority of the blame falls on Galligan's stopped clock, as you're not spose' to feed these suckers after midnight. The little buggers really cause so much strife, in such an original fun movie, where first seeing it at 14, I found the film a little scary and unnerving, where reading the film was too violent, whatever, where at the time it's PG rating was a bit of a worry. You really didn't know where these little buggers would take it. Standouts in the film are of course Polly Holiday as a real nasty pasty and little Feldman who always impresses, whether small role or big role. Corman favorite, Dick Miller was fun to watch too, where personally I felt Galligan wasn't strong enough here, to steer a lead role. Sadly this movie paved the way for some real stinkers, Ghoulies, Troll, and Critters, and there's more. Again Axton's character really ought to get a new line of work. Well formulated movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent childhood favourite,"The early 1980's were an furtive time for American genre cinema. Of course Steven Spielberg had his hand in most of those pies, with his name emblazoned above all the film titles. Whilst this is particularly annoying, the fact of the matter is, he did get some great projects made, such as Poltergeist (1982) and Back to the Future (1985) et al; plus a little gem of a horror-comedy written by then unknown, Chris Columbus and directed by Roger Corman luminary Joe Dante: Gremlins. As with many of the genre films made at the time, their influence of 1950's science fiction was obvious (and of course the film makers of the time would have grown up in the first decade of the popularisation of television). And Gremlins is no different, with a range of references, blinding obvious. In two scenes for example, we see on television screens, two iconic movies from the past, It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956): The former film is represented by the picture postcard image of wholesome Americana - a Norman Rockwell painting showing a quaint little ""village"" square. Kingston Falls is the setting, and the time of year is Christmas.The story is a simple tale of a father, Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) purchasing something ""different"" for his son, Billy (Zach Galligan). On his travels as an inventor and salesman, Rand stumbles across a small basement shop in Chinatown, where he buys an unknown species of animal, the overwhelmingly cute Mogwai. However, the ""pet"" comes with three very important rules: Never expose him to light, especially sunlight; never get him wet; and never feed him after midnight. Unfortunately, two of these rules are broken in a series of misdemeanours, and eventually unleash the anarchistic monsters of the films title. Of course the idea of a gremlin is no new thing, as is stated by Mr Futterman (played by Dante regular, and always brilliant, Dick Miller), the gremlin was a creature that had a fetish for interrupting the workings of technology during World War II. In fact the first recorded use of Gremlin was in a 1929 poem written for the men of the Royal Air Force stationed in Malta. But I digress.Needless to say, once the gremlins are unleashed - led by Stripe - the quiet town is turned into chaos, disrupted beyond belief of Christmas Eve. The scaly green monsters cause car accidents by tampering with traffic lights; the local property owner and general icon of evil, Mrs Deagle (Polly Holliday), the seasons Scrooge in female form, is sent flying out of her window on a chair lift. You get the idea. The job of thwarting the monstrous tykes is left to Billy, Gizmo (the Mogwai - as if you didn't know!), and Kate, Billy's new girlfriend (played by the stunning Phoebe Cates).Released on the same weekend as another '80's comedy classic, Ghostbusters, the film became a bit of an issue. Here was a Christmas film, like Ghostbusters, that mixed comedy with horror, but was packaged as a kids film. The massive campaign of merchandising was everywhere. From cuddly toys to Pez dispensers, every kid was able to participate in the ideas of the film. In America, the film was released in the equivalent PG rating, causing problems when young children saw it. This film eventually led to the MPAA (The Motion Picture Association of America) created the PG-13 rating. In the UK the film was released as a 15; therefore, I was unable to see the film at the cinema (you can't imagine how badly I wanted to see it, after all as an 8 year old, seeing the trailers on TV, there were little monsters in it!). And of course the BBFC (British Board of Film Certification) didn't act on this (despite a huge media frenzy), and would not create the 12 certificate until 1989's Batman.The film could be read as American fear of ""foreign"" technology. The Mogwai/Gremlin do originate form China (how ironic they are soon to be the worlds super power), but the duality of a cute creature manifesting itself as a anarchic monster, is representative of that view of the orient: A seemingly traditional continent complete with archaic practises, that also produce some of the most advance technology around. Maybe too hard a pill to swallow from the land that brought us Hollywood!I genuinely loved this film when I was a kid (I did manage to see it before the video release on a very bad VHS pirate video - shhh!), and I have to say that it has not lost any of it's charm, humour, and fun. The film holds so many iconic images probably for most of my generation. Well, we did collect the stickers to complete the Panini album. And the sweets; the dolls; the T-Shirts etc, etc etc.....

"After Midnight, We're Gonna Let It all Hang Down...","Director Joe Dante pulled off quite a juggling act with GREMLINS. It works, not only as a horror / comedy movie, but also as a Christmas classic. It starts out as a deceptively sweet kid's story, mutating into a fearful invasion / monster movie, ending in all-out mayhem! Dante balances the humor, both light and dark, perfectly.This film also manages to retain its endearing charm, in spite of its more sinister elements. Sort of a TWILIGHT ZONE version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, complete with creatures ranging from adorable (Gizmo) to downright wicked (Stripe).With fantastic practical effects, and a steady stream of standout scenes, GREMLINS is one of the best films of the 1980's...",,Anonymous,Horror

This movie doesn't bother with subplots and just show the quiet town of Kingston Falls being torn apart by the Gremlins. Gremlins started the little monster movie genre, spawning a bunch of inferior imatations. (Ghoulies anyone?)Most people remember Gremlins fondly and I'm one of those.

Cute Creatures Make the Movie,"Gremlins (1984)** 1/2 (out of 4)Cute Steven Spielberg-produced horror-comedy about a teen (Zach Galligan) whose given a ""creature"" for Christmas but there are three rules that you must follow. He breaks one of the rule by putting water on it, which makes more of the creatures pop up. He breaks the most important rule by feeding them after midnight and soon some ugly, green and slimy gremlins come to cause trouble. As with many of Joe Dante's early pictures, this one here is not only an homage to earlier monster movies but it's also quite clever in how it shows this affection towards older movies while at the same time trying to take the material to the next level. With a screenplay by Chris Columbus, direction by Dante and someone like Spielberg as a producer I must admit that I was expecting a lot more out of this blockbuster. There's no question that there are many good things going in this film but I thought that way too much detail was paid to the human characters and this meant that whenever the monsters weren't on the screen then things just slowed down to the point where the entire film crashes. There's no doubt that the main attraction are going to be the cute hairy creatures and the ugly monsters. You can tell that the screenplay really wanted to build up these creatures and especially when you consider how much screen time the furry guys get in the first half of the movie. The best moments of the movie happen early on as we're introduced to small town America and get to witness a part of their lives, which I'm sure most viewers can relate to. This includes the always suspicious neighbor (played by Dick Miller) and the rich old woman who hates everyone but herself. Some of the best moments happen early on when we see a few of the directions these two characters take. The problem is that our main guy, his girl (Phoebe Cates) and everyone are rather underwritten and don't come off nearly as charming as the creatures. The screenplay is also rather basic in terms of any type of story as we meet the creatures, they grow, they attack and then its over. The story mainly goes for silly jokes that really weren't that well-written and this includes a rather silly sequence where the gremlins take over a bar and go crazy. I'm still curious where the gremlins got their clothes and weapons but that's another story. I thought Galligan was pretty good in his role and there's no question that Cates can bring some energy to the screen. Seeing Miller is always fun and we also get other familiar faces like Corey Feldman, Harry Carey, Jr. and Keye Luke. GREMLINS is certainly cute enough for what it is but I'd stop a little short of calling it an actual good movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Horror comedy or didactic comedy?,"""Gremlins"" is a film that marked the imagination of the youth of the eighties and nineties. In this film, the young Billy (Zach Galligan) bought a strange creature, apparently Eastern and property of an old Chinese, who warned him to the grave danger that could come if the creature, Gizmo, was not treated properly. The young man didn't understand the message: unable to see that Gizmo wasn't a toy or a pet, he did everything he couldn't and eventually gave rise to a plague of wild monsters, the Gremlins, capable of causing chaos and destruction wherever they go.Directed by Joe Dante, the script was done by Chris Columbus, a producer who specializes himself in teen films ( ""The Goonies"" or the early films of ""Harry Potter"" franchise) or containing relevant and pedagogical messages (""Bicentennial Man"", ""Jingle All the Way"", ""the Help"" etc.) and with the participation of Steven Spielberg as executive producer, something who helped to sell the film. After all, at that time, he was the most famous among the film's producers.This film is usually classified as a horror comedy but I don't see it from that perspective. For me, it's an educational comedy, a film that uses comedy and soft-horror to teach an important message that we can consider almost ecological: certain things, in particular animals, should be treated with respect and care, because the consequences that can come from our negligence are rarely good. It's a family film, dedicated to young people but that will easily please the adult audience.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Family fun,"Gremlins is great family fun. Uniting creativity, excitement, humor and craft, it's a refined piece of 80s pop culture. First, the story is exactly what wide audiences desire. Gremlins has an original plot that merges enjoyable doses of comedy and suspense. The stakes balance audience investment with a lighthearted tone. Plus, the script nails a classic protagonist arc and touches on higher themes about irresponsible consumerism. Next, the designs of the gremlins are flawlessly executed. The mogwai are adorable, and their transformations are creepy yet believable. Undoubtedly, the creatures' looks are central to why Gremlins is so iconic.Gremlins is driven by its broad sentimental appeal, but it has key technical virtues as well. In particular, the effects, sound, and music contribute to the film's impact. Crucially, the use of puppets and animatronics gives the film a tangible feel that makes it timeless. Meanwhile, the sound drives home the cuteness of the mogwai and sinister gremlins, while also setting the cartoonish tone of the movie. Also, the score is dynamic and amplifies the emotional connection. Combined with a lack of clear weaknesses, Gremlins is an excellent mixture that highlights its strengths and lands as ideal entertainment.Writing: 8/10

Never feed them after midnight.,"Gremlins is a highly entertaining film from the eighties. It is one of a kind as far as comedy/horror films go.A boy named Billy receives a Mogwai(little furry big eared creature) for Christmas that he names Gizmo. There are three rules for Mogwai, don't feed them after midnight, don't expose to bright lights, and don't get them wet. Gizmo accidentally does get wet and this results in more Mogwai being created. When the new Mogwai eat after midnight they turn into a larger reptilian like state that goes on a rampage and start to wreck havoc.Overall this film has a great overall story. It flows somewhat as a family film, then becomes a sort of horror and comedy film. Very unique in that it has some many genres with it.The cast is pretty good. Phoebe Cates and Zack Galligan play great lead human protagonists. Both are characters that you cheer for and can relate to. Howie Mandel is great as the voice for Gizmo and legendary voice actor Frank Welker is outstanding as he provides for the voice of the villain Stripe.The Gremlins themselves are what makes the film. They are just troublesome creatures that want to have a good time. However I do feel that Stripe and Gizmo are the only mogwai that stand out. But those two are the two that make this film enjoyable. Stripe is one of the better non human villains from a film ever.Overall, a very good film. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gremlins is Funny, Scary, and Most Importantly...Entertaining!","1984's Gremlins is one messed up movie...and I am all down for it. The movie came out at a time where it was acceptable to blend the genres of horror and comedy. In fact, it came out the same weekend as the very popular Ghostbusters. Which did the same exact thing, but perhaps a little less scary than Gremlins. The film itself infuses a nice mixture of comedy and horror and it really is a fun movie. There are several grotesque moments, but this film is my childhood and it might be the one film to show your child when introducing the genre of horror.Can you believe that Joe Dante's film is rated PG? Creatures being blown up in a microwave, these gremlins looking like the monster from Alien, a really sad story about why Kate, one of the characters despises Christmas, and so forth. Along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, this movie inspired the PG-13 rating which we would see in a few months. There have been stories where parents walked out of the theater with their 4-year-old child because the film was marketed as a cute, cuddly movie in the vein of E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. Despite the involvement of Steven Spielberg in both projects (he executive-produced this film), this movie is NO E.T.I was very surprised to see the movie get a June release date considering the film is set at Christmas. It could have been a factor in the film's success, but it ultimately was the fourth-highest film of 1984. This movie was widely accepted by the audiences, and Joe Dante did a great job combining different genres. I laughed often, but I was also terrified at times. The movie is really scary in certain parts. The creatures themselves added to the scariness. Gizmo himself is a mixture of Yoda and a kitten and is super cuddly, but Stripes and his gang make the creature from Alien seem like a super cute puppy. The creature designs are excellent. Practical effects are good modern-day films, huh?Inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is in New York and he wanted to buy a gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) before he leaves. He stops is a mysterious Chinatown shop where he encounters a Mogwai, that very cute creature. He is told of three rules: avoid bright light, do not give him water, and never, ever feed him after midnight no matter how much he begs. Billy falls in love with his new pet, named Gizmo. Over time, Billy breaks these rules, which causes the birth of the mean-spirited Stripes. Stripes and his mischievous, evil gremlin pals are ready to show the Norman Rockwell lookalike town some very crazy moments.I wouldn't say the acting is the best part of the film, but the performances are good enough. Zach Galligan, who was unknown at the time, had some good chemistry with Phoebe Cates who plays his girlfriend, Kate. Spielberg wasn't sure about Cates because she was known for playing risqué roles such as that in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but she was impressive. The supporting cast were well-known veteran actors all who gave respectful performances; Dick Miller, Polly Holliday, Hoyt Axton, and Judge Reinhold. Then there is young Corey Feldman. Feldman mainly acted in commercials at the time, so this role boosted his child star status and he did a great job.Gremlin's music was composed by Jerry Goldsmith who is familiar with the world of horror/sci-fi. The music is instantly recognizable, especially the Gremlins March. His music sounded so playful, but at the same time sounded tense. The film has the looks of a Norman Rockwell painting. The beautiful small-town look...that was destroyed by the gremlins. John Hora did a good job giving us the looks of the town before and after the destruction. Dante did a great job directing the film. He preferred the film's sequel, but I think he still did a great job. Spielberg was originally going to direct the script, which was written by Chris Columbus, but he ultimately gave the directing duties to Dante.Keep in mind that there are some really dark scenes. The Christmas explanation by Kate was based on an urban legend and was quite controversial. Warner Brothers actually wanted that scene cut, but Dante wanted to keep that scene in. Of course, the second half of the film is based on the destruction by the Gremlins and there is A LOT of it. Also, children, please do not microwave your pets. While not the greatest horror-comedy, the film is a minor classic. I think this is a Christmas film despite its June release date, so give this film a watch...if you dare!My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Mogwai is for life - not just for Christmas!!!,"I can imagine every kid who ever saw this film begged, and I mean BEGGED their parents for a Mogwai for Xmas!!! I probably did, I can't remember. And even if I did, I wouldn't admit to it!!!This film is great. Spielberg had a hand in this film somewhere, you can feel it. Yep, this one appeals to both kids and adults.A nice plot, some great SFX and animatronics, and some good acting make this a film for nearly everyone.The initial story, about a boy who gets a cute, fluffy pet for Christmas, is known to everyone. The Mogwai itself is sooooooo cute, and the way it speaks and sings furthers it's cute appeal. So it comes as a shock when the boy who owns him ends up breaking the three important rules that he must abide by, and all hell breaks loose!!!Don't feed them after midnight. Don't get water on them. Don't ever expose them to sunlight!All of these rules are broken, and what ensues is comic/horror chaos.The Gremlins themselves are nasty little things. Grrrrrr!!! They can either be out-and-out menacing, funny and stupid, or both at the same time. It was nice to see the mixture of comedy and horror in this film, and it works all the better for it.The music plays a pivotal role in letting us know when we should be scared or when we should laugh. It's a weird kinda sound that is made and works well enough to suit the mood of the film.The one-on-one between Billy and the Stripe, is actually very tense, and violent. I mean Chainsaw's, razor sharp blades? Phew!My review has so far been a mixture of comments in no particular order, so without more time being wasted, go and watch this film.9/10Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Anytime something goes wrong I blame Gremlins,"As a child of the 80's I am obviously going to not hate on Gremlins. First off back in the 80's when I watched this it frightened me they scared me but as an adult now watching I can now appreciate the comedy. They don't make them like this anymore. All those people who tear it to pieces it's just a crazy fun film to just enjoy and read into every detail. If I ever have kids be sure I'll be happy to show them the films I loved as a kid.

Funny and delightfully twisted,"Despite the cute exterior and fuzzy main character (Gizmo), this film is surprisingly subversive given that it was advertised as family fare. Sadistic mayhem ensues on Christmas eve:  the little green monsters kill hapless denziens gleefully, the hero's mother splatters a few gremlins before being attacked brutally, the hero's girlfriend tells us how her father died-- falling down the chimney, breaking his neck while pretending to be santa (my god!)-- and finally a melting scene that would make any dracula envious.  This is not a kids movie.  There are corny moments but are instantly undercut by something sinister.  Dante does well in the execution of the kinetic action, treating it like a live cartoon.

Best Response To Christmas Movies of its Era,This movie is amazing. It was made around the time when there was an oversaturation of sappy Christmas movies being made (not that those movies aren't also fun).

monsters after midnight,"One of the funniest and scariest movies of all times. It was an enjoyable classic to say the least.

Billy also has a crush on his co-worker Kate(Phoebe Cates). Billy is excited when he receives the mogwai. He then names it Gizmo. He is then told that he must follow three rules.

Quite scary for a children's horror movie,"Randall Peltzer is a traveling salesman for his poorly-conceived gadgets looking for a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). While in Chinatown, he finds an adorable creature called mogwai. The old man refuses to sell but the little boy said they need the money. There are 3 rules to owning a mogwai. There can be no bright light, no water and no feeding after midnight. They live in the small town of Kingston Falls. Pete Fountaine (Corey Feldman) is a neighborhood kid. Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) is the nice girl. Gerald Hopkins (Judge Reinhold) is the ambitious climber. There's a wicked rich old Mrs. Deagle looking to put Billy's dog down. When Pete spills water on mogwai, he multiplies and five more pop out.This starts as a great children's horror at an idyllic small town with a cuddly teddy bear. The movie builds tension as Billy cluelessly break the rules. It builds to a fun ride that is actually very scary. For the younger kids, this is probably a little too much. People do die and the Gremlins get killed in splattery ways. The tension gets very high at times while at other times, it is very comedic.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Joe Dante's magnificently manic monster movie.,"Director Joe Dante proudly wears his influences on his sleeve in this excellent Spielberg-produced demented comedy/horror about mischievous creatures that run riot in the sleepy town of Kingston Falls.Referencing all of his favourite films and cartoons, including The Wizard of Oz (the film's villain is Oz's Mrs. Gulch in all but name), Looney Tunes (check out the sound effects Dante uses), Disney (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs features heavily in the story), and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Joe has a blast allowing his toothy critters to (very amusingly) wreak havoc in typically Spielbergian small-town America.Hoyt Axton plays Rand Peltzer, a less than successful inventor who buys his son Billy (Zach Galligan) a most unusual Christmas gift: a creature called a mogwai (which he names Gizmo). This impossibly cute bundle of fur comes with a strict set of rules which are inevitably broken. The result is a horde of vicious foot high monsters that set out to cause trouble wherever they can.With the help of Gizmo, and gorgeous workmate Kate (the always stunning Phoebe Cates), Billy sets out to destroy the gremlins.Although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters (the kitchen attack scene, in particular is quite frightening), Gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages. My kidsaged four and sixlove this film (although I admit that I have been gradually conditioning them: one of the toys they have had from birth is a bendy Gremlin!). It really is hard to resist the movie's non-stop manic and zany comedy (the Gremlins are a hoot as they break-dance, get drunk, play poker, and sing Christmas carols!).Sure, some moments are perhaps a little too daft (personally, I don't understand that rule about not feeding a mogwai after midnight, and I can't fully accept the scene where Gizmo drives a fully functioning Barbie car) but excellent animatronics courtesy of Chris Walas, a nifty script from Chris Columbus, loads of in-jokes for fans of fantasy films (look out for blink-and-you'll-miss-them appearances from Gremlins producer Steven Spielberg and animator Chuck Jones, an appearance from Forbidden Planet's Robbie the Robot, a stuffed ET toy sat between a cuddly Sylvester and Bugs Bunny, and the Time Machine from the 60s George Pal movie) all go to make Gremlins an unmissable treat.And its got Phoebe Cates in it too! Which means it gets the full 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
You do with Mogwai what your society has done with nature's gifts.,"A mysterious looking creature is purchased from Chinatown and taken home as a pet, the Mogwai comes with three rules that must be observed at all times; Keep him out of light, especially sunlight as it will kill him Never get him wet...Never ever feed him after midnight...Naturally things go belly up and what happens next amounts to a riotous invasion of Gremlins causing no end of destruction to the small town of Kingston Falls. What strikes me the most about Gremlins is the blend of tones, the comedy mixes brilliantly with the cute factor, and then all the serenity is destroyed by the carnage unleashed. With some scenes fit to grace any horror movie. Playing heavily on the old urban legends of little Gremlins messing with machines to unsurp humans, director Joe Dante creates a ""Spielbergian"" (the beard on producing duty here) parody that delivers royally on the entertainment front. There's fun to be had with some of the in jokes and the social references that the writers throw in at frequent moments. Nods to films like The Wizard of Oz, It's A Wonderful Life and Invasion of the Body Snatchers are well placed, while the pre CGI creatures themselves are brilliant in their reactions to things around them. Be it a gremlin attacking something or Gizmo watching the television aghast, these sprites are a delight.Some of the humour is very pitch black, so much so it would have gone over many a child's head back when the film was first released. You can imagine many an adult parent sitting there with the children cringing as they laugh to moments like flasher and mugger gremlin, while metaphors and wry side-swipes at small town Americana are bountiful for the observant. Is it, as some critics called it on release, mean spirited? No, not at all, yes it's a complete flip-flop from the homely comforts provided by ET era Spielberg or Disney on full tilt family friendly fodder mode, but director Joe Dante and writer Chris Columbus aren't fly pitching in that particular market. This is a wonderful horror comedy with dark narrative tints around the jagged edges, the cast may well be standing up purely as extras to the gremlins and the carnage they create, but it's devilishly funny all the same. Besides, if you can't go Aww at the sight of Gizmo, or laugh heartily as a theatre full of gremlins rejoice in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then clearly, before delving into the thematics of it, it's not the movie for you anyway. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
great horror/comedy blend,"i liked ""Gremlins"" a lot.i thought it was well acted and funny.it also had some black humour,which i liked.i liked the look of the gremlins.they would probably be scary for some children.they are quite freaky looking.i thought the puppetry was amazing.for the most part it really looked like these creatures were doing what the movie showed them doing.the gremlins were hysterical at times in what they said and how they acted.this is my idea of a good horror/comedy.it balances both elements well.it think the potential was there for the movie to be really awful,but good writing makes all the difference.the only real complaint i have about the movie,is you could really tell it was all a set,which looked suspiciously like many movie sets of the time.i'm sure they used that particular set for several movies.anyway,this is just a small complaint.and i'm probably being petty.otherwise,i really enjoyed the movie.for me,""Gremlins"" is an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There's a ton of nostalgia you get every time you watch this movie,"Gremlins (1984) is a movie we watched as a family on Christmas Eve from my personal DVD collection. The storyline focuses on a traveling salesman who brings an Asian ""Mogwai"" pet home to his family that has rules that need to be followed while they take care of their new pet. Unfortunately the family breaks every rules and have to deal with the repercussions. This movie is directed by Joe Dante (The Howling and Innerspace) from Morristown, New Jersey. Gremlins stars Zach Galligan (Waxwork), Phoebe Cates (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), Corey Feldman (Stand by Me, Lost Boys and Goonies), Hoyt Axton (Easy Rider and Forest Gump) and Dick Miller (The Terminator). The storyline for this picture is amazing, magical and so much fun. The special effects are remarkable for 1984 and you find yourself loving both the good and bad guys. There's a ton of nostalgia you get every time you watch this movie - whether it is the subplots of the characters, the hilarious scenes executed by the gremlins, or the triumphs of victory by your favorite characters throughout the film in what seems like impossible odds.

Gremlins,"Joe Dante (Piranha, The Howling) directed this fun mix of horror and humor. It's kinda like what I would picture a live action version of Looney Tunes.

His new pet ""Gizmo"" comes with a set of special care instructions. He hates bright light. Keep him out of sunlight it will kill him. Don't get him wet. Never feed him after midnight.Of course Gizmo accidentally gets wet, resulting in six new creatures similar to Gizmo. The lead of the new pack has a mohawk, so they call him Stripe. Stripe and his group are different from Gizmo. They're more mischievous.The rule about being feed after midnight also gets broken. This results in the new creatures going into cocoons and emerging in a new form. One that more mischievous. The new creatures, Gremlins get out and wreck havoc all over Kingston Falls. It's up to Billy and his crush Kate (Phoebe Cates), along with Gizmo to try and stop Stripe and the other Gremlins.The supporting cast includes: Hoyt Axton, Judge Reinhold (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Beverly Hills Cop), Dick Miller (The Howling, The Terminator), and Jackie Joseph (Little Shop of Horrors).Did you know that Gizmo was originally supposed to turn into a Gremlin?

Never Get Him Wet,"This movie really struck a nerve with my son. He watched it numerous times and did impressions of little Gizmo for years. This is really a sendoff of all kinds of horror movies, but with a real sense of humor. The little guy is so darned cute. He is cuddly and actually kind of pretty. Of course, we know from the beginning that things will go haywire. What is neat about this film is that what happens is so darned much fun. Gizmo's offspring are pure evil. They relish every kind of anti-social behavior. They are like a bunch of drunk teenagers who have lost any sense of order, willing to provide hurt to anyone who gets in their way. They have the appearance of bats or mosquitoes or some sort of hybrid. They are Gizmo gone bad. There are lot of pretty good character actors in this film who find themselves bewildered by what happens. I was surprised to see a country singer, Hoyt Axton, playing the father. I just remember a song called ""Bony Fingers."" This works delightfully, but not until incredible mayhem is launched.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"One of the most original, fun, imaginary, chaotic but most of all charming films ever.","From the opening sequence to the end credits, Gremlins has a certain charm to it. Perhaps it was the directing style of Joe Dante, or the screenplay by Chris Columbus. Whichever, it is a fun, entertaining and imaginative film.Gizmo (voiced by a young Howie Mandel) is a true creature effect, as are the Gremlins. This is one film that would have lost its charm if it were made today. The fact that we barely ever see Gizmo's feet when he runs, or the Gremlins lower bodies is wonderful. It is part of the charm that this film carries. I wouldn't want to see Gizmo looking like Yoda from the newest Star Wars films, cheap and unrealistic. It's great to have little creature creations, with real, fake fur (I know that sounds dumb but think about it).The cast is not extra ordinary, which makes it also feel so fun to watch, but nevertheless, the cast is still great, though the character of Billy wasn't the best they could have chosen, but like I said, that's part of the fun of it all.Gremlins has to be one of the most chaotic, entertaining, mesmerizing, adventurous, revolutionary, charming, fun-filled films of the past twenty years. 4/4 stars-John",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Amazing and fun...but it loses a point for the Phoebe Cates speech about Christmas!,"""Gremlins"" has one big thing going for it and it helped the movie to be the fourth largest box office draw of the year...it was FUN. Too many times, movies can depress you or make you uncomfortable...but sometimes it just is nice to have some fun and see something mindless (in a good way).Billy's father brings him a most unusual present...a creature called a Mogwai. Billy names it Gizmo and the creature is almost too cute. Unfortunately, if it gets wet or eats after midnight...very bad things happen. Those bad things make up about 75% of the movie.The film is cute but has an amazing sense of humor. I loved the ""Seven Dwarves"" scene and there were many other wonderful scenes throughout the movie. The only bad thing, and this prevents it from receiving a 10, is the god-awful speech by Phoebe Cates' character when she talks about Christmas and dead Santa. How did this make it into the movie?!

Memorable 80's product still packs a mean punch.,"I would consider this my favourite Christmas movie of all time. And if your tastes tend towards the dark, twisted, and subversive, and you enjoy a healthy amount of humour with your horror, I'm sure you consider this essential Christmas viewing as well.It was the brainchild of Chris Columbus, whose screenplay caught the attention of Steven Spielberg who then suggested Joe Dante as director. Spielberg had enjoyed both Dantes' ""Jaws"" send-up ""Piranha"", as well as ""The Howling"", and the two had also directed segments of the previous years' notorious ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". The story centres around bank teller and aspiring artist Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), whose travelling salesman / inventor father Rand (singer / songwriter / actor Hoyt Axton) picked up an unusual Christmas present for Billy during a visit to Chinatown: a cute little fuzzy animal identified as a Mogwai, whom Rand christens Gizmo. Gizmo comes with a set of insane rules, which of course must be followed and which, naturally, are meant to be broken soon enough: he must not be exposed to bright light, *especially* sunlight, he must not come into contact with water, and he must not eat after midnight. Rule # 2 is broken, and Gizmo spawns a quintet of new Mogwai that prove to be absolutely incorrigible. When rule # 3 is broken (unknowingly), the new Mogwai become Gremlins (the name coming from WWII, when any machinery experiencing problems would be said to have 'gremlins' in it), little reptilian monsters that proceed to tear an idyllic small town to pieces.This continues to hold up on repeat viewings. Even if there are firmly dated aspects to the presentation at times (Mega madness!), it's still as fun as it ever was, with an endearing human cast in addition to the diminutive ""stars"". Galligan and sexy Phoebe Cates are an appealing lead couple, Axton and Frances Lee McCain are a delight as the parents, Polly Holliday is just a riot as the crabby, greedy local busybody Mrs. Deagle (a perfect '80s stand in for Mr. Potter from ""It's a Wonderful Life""), and Judge Reinhold a hoot as smarmy and ambitious bank vice-president Gerald. Superb supporting players include the *always* welcome Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman (who's reunited with his co-star from ""The Little Shop of Horrors"", Jackie Joseph), Scott Brady, Edward Andrews, Glynn Turman, Keye Luke, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks, Harry Carey, Jr., Belinda Balaski, and The Real Don Steele, the real life D.J. who will be familiar to fans of New World productions from the '70s. Appearing uncredited are veterans Kenneth Tobey and William Schallert. Spielberg and composer Jerry Goldsmith make fleeting appearances which the viewer will want to watch for. The voice artists are all fun, including Howie Mandel as Gizmo, and ultra ubiquitous Frank Welker as Stripe; ""Police Academy"" series sound effects guy Michael Winslow is also among this bunch.Excellent and highly enjoyable effects by Chris Walas and his team, Goldsmiths' irresistible score including that ""Gremlin Rag"" main theme, and numerous in-jokes and visual gags add to the fun. The title characters are never less than entertaining - sometimes frightening, sometimes extremely funny - and one can't help but like these guys - after all, they can't be *all* bad when they like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" so much. They kind of have the personalities of children, albeit children whose pranks have a decidedly sadistic nature. And when they raise Hell in a tavern, they're just as obnoxious and destructive as any human drunks. The scene with McCain dispatching three of the monsters in her kitchen justifiably gave the movie its reputation. It's show stopping stuff, although the business with the microwave (not to mention Cates' priceless story of why she dislikes the Christmas season) did rub a fair amount of people the wrong way. And when all is said and done with this movie, there is a very blatant yet effective message about learning to be responsible.Followed by a sequel six years later, ""Gremlins"" would prove to be so successful - and merchandise friendly, no doubt - that it would get a theatrical re-release, and lead to a number of other imitative comedy / horror movies about little monsters - ""Critters"", ""Troll"", ""Ghoulies"", ""Hobgoblins"", and their sequels - but leads the pack by far.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
My favorite Christmas movie of all time.,"Usually, when we think of Christmas movies, we think of flicks like ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Well, here's a new kind: ""Gremlins"". This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made. Joe Dante - always a director with some neat ideas - couldn't have pulled it off better.It all begins when inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) buys a furry little creature called ""mogwai"" from a Chinese salesman (Keye Luke). There are three rules about mogwai: 1) Never expose him to bright light (the sun could kill him). 2) Never expose him to water (certainly don't give him a bath). 3) The most important rule of all is never, ever, EVER, under any circumstances, feed him after midnight. So, Rand gives mogwai to his son Billy (Zach Galligan). But, as you might have guessed, the rules get broken, and before long, the little town of Kingston Falls is overrun by mean, green gremlins.Everything that you love about movies, you're likely to find in ""Gremlins"". Whether it's the inside jokes (a cinema is showing ""A Boy's Life"" and ""Watch the Skies"", the working titles for ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", respectively), the indictment of vicious landlady Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday), Lynn Peltzer's (Frances Lee McCain) battles with the gremlins, or the overall jab at a ""wholesome American small town"", this is a top-notch thriller/comedy. I'm sure that Phoebe Cates is proud to have gotten an early role in this (she plays Billy's girlfriend Kate Beringer). And since this is a Joe Dante movie, B-movie actor Dick Miller of course gets a role: he plays sour neighbor Murray Futterman.Maybe this is just me, but I've noticed some similarities between ""Gremlins"" and ""Ghostbusters"". The obvious one is that they're both about things that nobody wants around town, but there's more. They're both plural nouns beginning with ""G"". ""Gremlins"" has 8 letters, ""Ghostbusters"" has 12; 8 and 12 are both divisible by 4. Both movies were released on 8 June 1984 (a year ending with 4, a day divisible by 4).Oh well, maybe I'm the only one who would even notice that. The point is that this is one great movie, and everyone should see it. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Never Gets Old!,"Gremlins (1984, Dir. Joe Dante)When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter.

The Mogwai must be kept away from bright light, never made wet and never, ever be fed after midnight.

A fun little horror movie!,"Young banker Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is given a pet creature by his father, inventor Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), for Christmas. However, after inadvertently breaking the rules concerning the creature of no light, no water and no food after midnight, the creature multiplies into mischievous, threatening and dangerous little monsters.This movie has a good mixture of comedic and scary moments, from the creatures attacking the people and the small town to Randall's funny, malfunctioning inventions. The acting was pretty good and seem genuine - not overly done or overzealous - just right. The plot was fast-paced and to-the-point and the story was just full of surprising moments; you'll never know where one of those Gremlins will jump out at you. And, Jerry Goldsmith's music score had just the right touch for this movie - it's catchy, creepy, jumpy and crafty-sounding - perfect for the gremlins.I wished the story showed more aftermath and some sort of an emergency response after the gremlins started attacking, rather than resorting to the tactics of the two useless sheriffs. Overall, though, this is a fun little horror movie and that is great laugh-out-loud and creepy entertainment.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic,"Christmas is in the air and Billy (Zach Galligan) gets an early gift from his father. He finds a tiny, cuddly Mogwai, a creature that is mysterious yet cute, which he names Gizmo (voiced by Howie Mandel) and the two bond. Billy is told a certain set of rules the Mogwai must follow: don't expose them to light, don't let them get wet, and above all else, don't feed them after midnight. When Billy inadvertently breaks one of the rules, the Mogwai transform into sinister creatures that multiply and wreak havoc across the quiet town. With the help of Kate (Phoebe Cates), Billy and Gizmo must control the problem before the Gremlins take over.On a massive scale, Joe Dante was given the task of bringing tiny, animatronic creatures to life, and he succeeds on a massive level. The creation of these creatures, from design to execution, lands this film as one of the most memorable creatures in cinema history. Placing this film in a tight-knit community that has Christmas plastered all over it, is the perfect place to set hundreds of creatures.All of the acting in this film lets the audience become one of the townspeople. Everyone is inviting, and this helps the film succeed by letting the viewer attach themselves to the characters. Even Gizmo and the evil gremlin Spike (voiced by Frank Welker) have a story arc that could have carried this film. To me, being invested in the characters leaves a bigger impression than the plot of a story. This is a major reason the film has lasted generations.Gremlins is billed as a family film, which it is at heart and partially in execution. This film was created before the PG-13 rating, so it is not for children under a certain age. This is, however, a perfect gateway horror film for young audiences to test the waters. It says a lot about a film when the biggest problem is a rating system that hasn't been put in place yet.This is, and forever will be, a Christmas and horror classic. I have fond memories of the Gremlins franchise and it had a major impact on the way I watch movies and the types of movies that have molded me. I, and others, look forward to passing this film down for generations, showing them how practical effects stand the test of time and letting them think that glitch in the TV could be a little gremlin toying with the controls.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I am not a Movie ! I am a Cartoon !!

Then, it turns into an horror movie (the symbolic fight of the desperate housewife in her kitchen), and when it could have been a bloody nightmare, the monsters suffer from ""gremlins madness"" and it becomes a hilarious, funny horror movie: I think that with ""Ghostbusters"" (seen both in theaters for Christmas 84 at 10 years old), it was the first ones of this kind.In addition to the nostalgia, the enjoyment comes from a lot of merit (the name of Spielberg as producer may not be fortuitous): - Christmas time.

Good Movie!,"I liked Gremlins. I was not expecting much because I thought that this film was one of those ridiculous 80's horror films. But, when I saw the names of Steven Spielberg and Joe Dante, I decided to give this movie a try. I was pleased at the result.This film starts with an inventor buying an unusual gift for his son, a Mogwai. They are cute creatures, but there are three important rules they must follow. When all these rules are broken, the Mogwai transforms into nastier creatures. They decide to wreak some havoc.The acting is good. I liked Zach Galligan, Pheobe Cates, Corey Feldman, and Judge Reinhold. They set the tone of the film.The special effects are great. I liked the creatures and in today movies, they would still look real.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is another beauty of a score.There is a great mixture of comedy and horror. I was either laughing or cowering. This is not the best film ever, but it's still pretty good. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Film,"""What superior popular moviemaking is all about"" (Richard Corliss, Time).Gremlins is a great film. Directed and designed beautifully this film utilizes practical effects, horror and comedy to create a classic Christmas film for the whole family. The production design, props, and special effects are all done so well. I love the use of practical effects and I wish movies today used them more, we know if this was made today the Gremlins would have been CGI and the fact that they are practical makes it 10x better. The story is pretty simple and the film is really good at showing as opposed to telling. With its use of the rules and showing us what happens when the Mogwai get wet or eat after midnight.Overall, Gremlins is a great film. It's well made and well executed. The story isn't complex, it is simple and easy to follow and the practical effects are amazing. I also really liked the soundtrack, there are a few really good songs in there. I think Gremlins is a good time for the whole family, doesn't require much attention, is easy to enjoy, and is a very well made and well directed film. I recommend everyone watches Gremlins in their lifetime.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
35 years later still a classic,"When this movie came out, it competed against not only Ghostbusters, but Top Secret, a box office farce that was more of a failure during the second weekend of June 1984, a few months before the 1984 Summer Olympics brought box office down a bit in the states. It was also the first movie to feature the return of the WB Shield, which would remain in that form for 14 years until a CGI version debuted to celebrate Warner Bros' 75th anniversary and has remained unchanged ever since. As for the movie, it was this movie, as well as temple of doom, that forced the MPAA to create a new rating: PG-13, which nowadays kids can go see anyways unlike the R rating. The first movie to be released with the rating was Red Dawn, which became a cult hit and spawned a bad remake, but the first movie made was The Flamingo Kid, which failed at the box office. six years later, gremlins would make a comeback in Gremlins 2: The New Batch, which didn't do well at first but has become a cult classic on its own and makes fun of pop culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

It's full of the 80s teenage adventure cheesiness, cute cuddly creatures, and creepy monsters. Gremlins radiates the same classic spirit and tone as other films of the time, like The Goonies or E. T., but Gremlins adds a little horror flavor. Admittedly, the film isn't particularly scary as it seeks to poke fun at more serious alien critter movies of the time. Still, its creepy atmosphere and twisted little monsters, mixed with the holiday cheer and quaintness of the quiet small town of Kingston Falls, set it apart from other 80s creature features. For many, sitting around the Christmas tree, sipping hot chocolate, and watching Gremlins is a yearly tradition.

Parents should read more about movies before taking their kids.,"This is the movie that caused PG-13, because all the parents didn't pay attention to the reviews or the trailers and just saw a cutesy movie. They took their kids to it to find it's a monster movie where people drop like flies. So, they threw a **** storm to end all **** storms and PG-13 was born. Of course this didn't happened in Japan when Gremlins was just another movie. This is the kind of ""violence"" they should to five year old on Sailor Moon, they don't hide death from children, it's stupid. We're ""protecting"" our children to death in this country and I say it's enough.

Another one of the 80's finest,"Throughout the 80's cinema goers experienced some incredible movies and were treated to some very special moments and Gremlins firmly cements itself into the top draw of the era.While Gremlins is a ""Very"" black comedy it still appeals to most people. Whether it's the scary side, or the cute side (provided by Gizmo) the film delights and scares people still to this day.After viewing both of the films again very recently with my girlfriend, who has never seen either before, it was great to see the reaction of a new viewer watching 25 years after its release.Very well directed, shame about some of the acting and some of the music pieces are haunting.Now what makes it so special?

There are just three rules...,"1) Buy GREMLINS. 2) Watch GREMLINS 3) Repeat #2 several times Every time I surf the t.v. and I come across GREMLINS, I will put down the remote and watch it til the end. GREMLINS, for its time, was truly groundbreaking. It was E.T., except with really rotten friends and relatives. Well-paced and directed Joe Dante, with unique performances by Zach Galligan and the gorgeous Phoebe Cates, GREMLINS deftly treads in and out of suspense/horror and comedy. (Phoebe Cates' explication of how her father died is still outrageous.) And there are plenty of pitched battles between the good guys and the unruly gremlins to keep the plot moving. Just don't show this movie to young kids around Christmastime. This special edition has a lot of goodies that true GREMLINS fans will enjoy, and the quality is top-notch. Just don't get it wet. I've loved Gremlins since I was a wee girl of only about 5 or 6, and previously my only copy of the film was a tattered VHS, worn out and almost grainy from repeated viewings. I purchased Gremlins on DVD and was astonished at how beautiful the transfer from film to DVD was. The details are crystal clear and the sound is impeccable. Certain small visual details of the movie were totally lost on my old VHS, but stand out gorgeously on this DVD. The movie itself doesn't need further praise from me - it's fun and funny, gory and touching at the same time. My personal favorite scene is when all of the Gremlins are in the movie theater, singing ""Hi Ho"" right along with the dwarfs in Snow White. The special effects are amazing for the time, the score was perfect, and Gizmo never ceases to be adorable. A must-buy.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Of The 80's Best Movies!,"This was one of my favorite movies since I saw it as a little kid. I'm pretty sure if my Dad had actually seen what happened in the movie, he would have taken it away from me, but it was safely hidden behind a PG rating, so he didn't mind me watching it (my Mom was much cooler and we would always watch it together). Anyway, I thought it was great then, and I think it's great now. I just re-watched it yesterday, and it's still amazing. What's great is how well director Joe Dante combines all sorts of elements; horror, comedy, romance, etc. Really, I'd call this the most twisted Christmas film ever, even worse than Bad Santa. Yes, they're different, and yes, that movie was one of the sickest films ever (but hilarious), but what makes Gremlins so sick is how it starts of so harmless and cutesy. Bad Santa made no denial that it wasn't for children, but Gremlins tricks you. As it starts, the last thing you expect to be is scared. A peaceful, snowy hometown, kind citizens, a loving dad who brings home a REALLY cute little creature named Gizmo. What's scary about that? Then, after you've safely settled in and are comfortable, Dante pulls the carpet out under you feet and the story turns into one about ugly monsters blowing up in microwaves or being killed in a blender. Dante actually did horror/comedy well. It seems like most movies that claim to be horror/comedies are actually just silly comedies with lots of blood and guts which aren't in the least bit scary. Here, the movie is blood-chillingly scary in scenes, and gut bustingly funny in others. For instance, the scene with the Gremlins wreaking havoc at Dorry's tavern is just plain silly and funny, but the scene with Frances Lee McCain searching the house and finding the creatures in her kitchen is just REALLY scary and creepy. Plus, the acting's great and the special effects are amazing. It makes me sad to think that if any other movie like this was made, they'd use bad CGI that's not at all realistic. People mtalk about how much more advanced movies are today, but I disagree. Which is easier to believe is real: the Gremlins in this movie or Yoda in Star Wars Episode Two? This movie was follwed by a terrific sequel that threw the horror out the window and made no denial to being a flat out comedy, and one of the smartest and most entertaining ever. Don't miss that one, either.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Billy does what he can but accidentally gets Gizmo wet which makes it multiply other Mogwais and also accidentally fed the other Mogwaii except Gizmo after midnight.

It should have been released at cinemas in December same year. But it doesn't matter anyway.It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic.

Who are we supposed to root for?,"The late 70s and 80s have blessed us with bogeymen beyond count: Pinhead, Freddy, Jason, Mike Myers, Candyman... all speaking to a collective subconscious desire to watch a hapless protagonist - more often than not squeaky-clean, young, white and female - bite the dust.Gremlins is a cinematic anomaly of their weirdest variety. Part slasher film, part parody, part Christmas movie, it turns all three of these sub-genres on their heads and manages to give us the very best they can deliver. It follows Billy Peltzer and his brand new pet Mogwai, Gizmo. Gizmo is an instantly lovable creature, semi-legally imported from China, but he comes with his very strict set of rules: do not expose him to sunlight, do not get him wet, and never, ever feed him after midnight. It doesn't take a genius to imagine where things go from here, but it did take geniuses of a kind to created what we end up witnessing.The Gremlins themselves are wonderfully inventive, nasty little bastards, and watching them pillage their way through mid-80s suburban America is an unmitigated joy. Whether it's wreaking havoc at a local movie theater or hot-wiring traffic lights, their mischievousness makes them lovable and relatable in a sick, twisted way. As such, bar the core relationship between Gizmo and Billy, the human characters are efficiently but economically set up, enough so that we care when evil strikes, but never at the expense of the film's warped idea of fun.It's a cult movie, but one of the highest order, made very skillfully by people who were clearly in love with every iota of the concept.

"Devilishly dark and fiendishly funny, Gremlins with its unique mixture of horror and comedy makes for an entertaining watch.","Set in the town of Kingston Falls, a young man named Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) works as a bank teller supporting his parents Lynn (Frances Lee McCain) and Rand (Hoyt Axton) during a Christmas season where many are feeling financial pressure from the town's cruel landlord Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday). When Rand comes home from trying to sell his inventions yet again, he gives Billy a gift of a creature he acquired in Chinatown called a mogwai whom he named Gizmo (Howie Mandel). Rand tells Billy of three rules in owning the Mogwai 1) he hates bright lights especially sunlight which will kill him 2) don't let him near water and 3) don't feed him after midnight. However when Billy inadvertently allows lapses of the second and third rules a horde of deformed mogwai known as ""gremlins"" are unleashed upon the town wreaking havoc.Gremlins began as a spec script by writer Chris Columbus inspired by the noises rodents would make in a loft he once lived in. Columbus had written the script with no intention of it actually being filmed and only to showcase his writing skills until Steven Spielberg took an interest in the script having come upon it. Spielberg enlisted Joe Dante due to the director's experience in horror-comedy with Spielberg having praised Dante's Piranha as the best of the wave of Jaws knock-offs and also for his work on The Howling. The script went through a few drafts toning down some darker aspects of the film though some aspects such as Kate's Santa Claus story made it in despite Spielberg not liking the scene. Upon release the film opened at number two behind Ghostbusters and both films were runaway successes with Gremlins becoming the fourth highest grossing film of 1984 making $219 million against an $11 million budget. Gremlins has maintained a presence in the pop culture zeitgeist thanks to its unique mixture of over the top dark humor mixed with horror elements, and the movie spawned large numbers of imitators too numerous to mention. Despite repeated attempts to recapture Gremlins success, Gremlins remains the definitive film about diminutive hellraising maniacs.As typical of Spielberg produced films of the era, Gremlins has the same focus on ""small town America"" that was used to solid effect in noted Spielberg genre fare such as E. T. The Extraterrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind but taking a more fantastical approach with the premise in comparison to the sci-fi approach. Despite working with a larger budget than Piranha and The Howling, Joe Dante very much approaches the material in the same vein as a fifties monster movie with references in movie to sic-fi classics such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers while also indulging in the various b-movie drive-in tropes popularized in fifties films such as The Blob complete with quirky eccentric small town's people, disbelieving sheriffs, and eccentric old timers who no one believes until it's too late. The movie does a good job of giving us fully fleshed out characters who we care about and derives humor from the various eccentricities and personalities, and the buildup to the chaos brought about by the swarm of gremlins overrunning the town is filled with memorable character moments as well as visual moments that are still remembered and quoted today.Gremlins ranks along with Ghostbusters in establishing that unique mixture of horror and comedy that came about in the 80s and has influenced the approaches of several others that followed in its wake. Both disturbing and darkly amusing, Gremlins remains a unique pop cultural milestone that many have attempted to copy with varying degrees of success.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

The definitive Christmas horror film,"I don't know possible it is to watch Gremlins and not immediately get on board. From its very beginning, it's a movie that pulls you in and really never lets go. It envelopes you with a warm, comforting Christmas vibe but underneath the surface, there's a tinge of the ever present darkness, frustration, and sadness associated with the holiday too.Gremlins strikes an essentially perfect tone; it's funny, it's manic, it's heart warming and cute. It's just dark enough that you take what happens seriously, but not too dark that it'd put off people during the season.It also has some genuinely fun and interesting characters; little details like Billy's Dad being a crackpot inventor or Phoebe Cates' character having a truly devastating reason she hates Christmas give the film life and energy. It's not a bunch of boring, paper thin people we meet; even though they aren't the focus, you don't HATE whenever normal people are on screen.But let's be real. The Gremlins are the star of the show here.I can go on about the creature effects and animatronics here; the 1980s were a golden age of puppetry and practical effects, and Gremlins stands tall as some of the most impressive and enduring I've ever seen. It's remarkable how it holds up and also kind of surprising no one's ruined it with a totally CG remake yet (although, I'm sure that's coming - eventually).They have so much personality and an infectious mischievous energy; almost like that guy you know who's tons of fun to party with, but also doesn't know when the party ends. They're also legitimately scary at times and a real threat; the movie has stakes and it's now hard to see why their Chinese name, ""mogwai"", directly translates to ""devil"" or ""demon.""They almost personify the negative elements of Christmas, contrasted with the sweet innocence of Gismo. The rapacious consumption and entitlement we can't pretend doesn't exist with the holiday. (There's also a not-so-subtle message about the West not understanding and respecting cultural norms and guardrails of the East that I found pretty interesting for what is otherwise a pretty straightforward creature feature)But yeah, at the end of the day, if you haven't seen this movie yet...what are you waiting for.

A bundle of joy perfect to unwrap around the holidays,"The film isn't an ordinary Christmas movie, as it cleverly mixes horror and comedy into the holiday season. After a recent rewatch, I can gladly say it is a rollercoaster of a time, which can surprisingly provide some hard hitting moments.Each Gremlin possesses their own unique personality, with the little creatures arguably being the minions of their time. It's so entertaining watching them tumble into self-induced sticky situations, and how (if) they manage to get themselves out of it. Through scenes like these, Dante does very well to make them seem like intelligent creatures who were (literally) born yesterday.The music in the film adds a goofy touch to the film, preparing the audience for the silly scenarios which will come later. I particularly enjoyed Mrs Deagle's theme song - however, the instruments used made me take the character less seriously (which may've been the artists intention).On the topic of Mrs Deagle, each smaller character is equally as interesting as the main. This is due to how well written their few lines are. This also includes Mr Futterman, whose introduction to the idea of Gremlins adds irony to the upcoming events.I was left in awe of the cinematography in the film, especially the many long ones which capture the whole atmosphere of the town.Overall, Gremlins is an incredible film which is perfect to watch around the holidays (or not, if you don't think it's a Christmas film) and I'd 100% recommend it if anyone who hasn't seen it is looking for a fun, classic film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What ensures is stabbings, decapitations, deaths by blender, and my favorite, death by being blown up in the microwave. The other most non-child friendly scene is one where Phoebe Cates tells her boyfriend Galligan a story of how ""The worst thing that ever happened to me was on Christmas"" which involves a missing father, rotting corpses stuck in a chimney, and learning that Santa isn't real. How's that for family fun humor? The studio wanted that part removed because they felt it was too ambiguous as to whether it was supposed to be funny or sad. Director Joe Dante refused to take the scene out, saying it represented this movie as a whole, which had a combination of horrific and comedic elements. Executive producer Steven Spielberg did not like the scene either, but despite his creative control, he viewed this movie as Dante's project and allowed him to leave it in. Dante's cheeky snark permeates this film, as well as his usual film-buff inside jokes (Robbie the Robot from FORBIDDEN PLANET and the time machine from THE TIME MACHINE are in the background in one scene, the smiley face sticker from THE HOWLING can be seen in another, and casting Hollywood Golden Age character actors Keye Luke, Harry Carey Jr., Edward Andrews, Edward Arnold, Dante stock company actor Dick Miller, and quite a few more. There's even a cameo by Looney Tunes director Chuck Jones). Overall, Gremlins is terrific nasty fun, but don't go into it expecting a family-friendly experience. This one is more of a gateway horror film for kids to help get them into the harder stuff. FUN FACT! The town square set for Kingston Falls is very clearly the same town square used for clock tower town scenes in BACK TO THE FUTURE, both filmed on the Universal Studios backlot.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The quintessential Christmas horror movie,"Like, I imagine, many who grew up with it, I both loved and was terrified by Gremlins as a kid. As an adult, it is still a ton of fun. It plays out like a classic monster movie, if slightly more kid friendly. The titular creatures didn't appear in full until fifty minutes in, a classic trope of the genre. Everything before that is spent introducing the characters and setting, establishing the rules involving the creatures, and building up to their inevitable reveal. The buildup is perfectly paced and does a solid job of building suspense. But of course, as you'd expect, once the Gremlins do appear, that's when the real fun begins. The antics they get up to, the chaos they wreck and the different ways they are dispatched are both hilarious and terrifying. The only exceptions to this are the bar scene and when they sing along to Snow White, which are just hilarious, and Kate's backstory and Stripe's death, which are just terrifying. Helping matters is the top notch puppetry done on both Gizmo and the Gremlins, Joe Dante's direction, and Jerry Goldsmith's score, which off-sets classic Christmas tunes with a creepy theme for the Gremlins. We do have to deal with the annoying scene where the hero goes to the police, like they'd ever believe his story, but thankfully it doesn't last long.As far as protagonists go, Billy and Kate are a little bland, but they're likeable enough and have decent chemistry. Billy has even better chemistry with Gizmo, who comes out as the real star of the film. He's adorable, charming, and very smart, and his design and puppetry are some of the best in the film. I love this character so much I once named my cat after him. Billy's parents are great too; his dad's inventions are funny, as are the ways he pitches them, and the mom shows how tough she is by taking out several Gremlins. The rest of the cast is solid too. The only characters I didn't like are the ones played by Judge Reinhold and Polly Holiday, and I'm not supposed to like them.Overall, Gremlins is a true classic, for me and for many who grew up with it. It can be really intense, so I wouldn't recommend it for really little kids. But, for older kids, they're sure to have a fun time. Same with the sequel, which is really underrated.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

These Little Devils Keep Us Entertained,"Gremlins just want to have fun, and it's fun watching them do so. These creepy little monsters are mischievous and hilarious. They have a dark sense of humor and love nothing more than a good laugh. You won't be able to not laugh along with them. If you're looking for a Christmas movie that's a little bit different, this is a great option.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good,"This Christmas, I decided to rewatch Gremlins since I barely remembered anything from the first time I saw it as a kid. Now, I completely understand why it's so beloved. Directed by Joe Dante, the film strikes a perfect balance between horror and comedy, making it a unique and memorable experience that's accessible to any audience without ever compromising its tone.While there are elements of horror, they never cross the line. There are no graphic or overly disturbing scenes, and it's not particularly scary. Yes, there are deaths, but most are hilarious and add to the chaotic and fun nature of the Gremlins. It's rare to find a film that blends light horror and laughs so effectively.The creatures, of course, are the stars of the show. The Gremlins have such distinct personalities-they're charismatic and captivating, even as they wreak havoc. Then there's Gizmo, the adorable little Mogwai. It's impossible not to fall in love with him; he's one of the cutest creatures in cinema and truly the heart of the movie.The human characters also deserve praise. There's great chemistry between the actors, which makes the relationships feel authentic amidst all the chaos. The cast manages to balance seriousness and humor naturally, which is crucial for the film's dynamic.For me, Gremlins is perfect for the holiday season. It's the kind of film that blends festive spirit with plenty of adventure and fun. Without a doubt, it has become one of my favorite movies from the 1980s. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something different yet equally magical to enjoy at this time of year.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Chaotic Christmas Classic!,"'Gremlins' is such a high quality classic! I cannot praise it enough and I can see why I loved it so much as a youngster.The puppetry and special effects on the Gizmo and the other Mogwai was beyond exceptional! You can see so much character in their facial expressions and movements. Plus, Gizmo is just so remarkably cute. I do not know how anyone can resist his adorable design.Furthermore, the music is so memorable. The main theme for Gizmo completely captures his calm and adorable nature. While, the manic gremlins rag theme emphasises the absolute chaos on screen.I loved revisiting this film as an adult and being able to understand the symbolism on display. The themes of otherness and foreign culture are so well integrated. It does have to use certain stereotypes to achieve this thematic effect, but I do not believe it is in bad spirit. This is a must-see Christmas watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Origins Of PG-13!!!,"Everything about this film rules.It blends the lighthearted magic of Spielberg, with the iconic horror touch of Joe Dante, to create what is arguably the best Christmas themed horror film ever made.Certainly the most iconic, anyways.With the Gremlins being among the most lovably mischievous villains ever created.If only to market the film around a merchandising campaign.And it's also the first ever PG-13 rated movie.As Spielberg lobbied the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), to create a new classification, which would allow teenagers to view the film in cinemas (when it would have otherwise been given an R rating, that would have prevented them from seeing it.Thankfully, this film was made in the 80's, with entirely practical effects, from puppeteering, to stop motion...whereas, if it were made today...the whole thing would no doubt, be reliant upon overworked and exploited CGI animators...which would inevitably have rendered it a far inferior production.Which makes you wonder how 2023's Gremlins 3 is going to turn out...It tells the coming of age story of a boy named Jack, who is gifted a living creature- called a Mogwai- by his failed inventor father, for Christmas.The gift comes with 3 rules: keep it away from bright light (sunlight will kill it); don't get it wet (as water will cause it to multiply); and don't feed it after midnight (less it metamorphose into it's demonic Gremlin form).And, of course, our anti-hero protagonist breaks all 3- if only accidentally- to set off Kingston Falls' own isolated apocalypse.When it comes to the creatures, it's not only their lifelike features that are so alluring, but also their intelligence.Which really allows you to empathize with- and even love- these mischievous little devils.Especially Gizmo, who is not only cute and cuddly, but has the loveable features we became endeared with (as kids) through ET.Though, even in their Gremlin form, their rebellious nature resonated with us as youths growing up and getting into trouble before the digital age had fully come to fruition, and become omnipresent.Plus, with the horror elements being darkly comical in nature, it really is the perfect film to harken in the era of PG-13.Not being scary enough to warrant an R rating, while being to untame to be classified as PG (not to mention, it contains a few swears).It snuggles itself right into that middle ground between the two, while speaking to the rebellious nature of us kids growing up as misspent youths, where it fits right in.The only real surprising thing here, is that it never spawned more sequels!Having ended off as a canonical duology...only spawning an animated tv series almost 40 years later (in 2022), and a third film in the trilogy (slated for 2023).Because there are so many gremlins, it really allowed them to run the gamut of representation...and thus connect with practically everyone, no matter what societal niche you fit into.Perhaps, it is because their origins are slightly xenophobic...though, even then...they are fighting back, and getting their comeuppance.Either way...you just can't help but love this film...because it really is one of those films that ""they just don't make anymore"".So let's all hope that Gremlins 3 can live up to the iconic legacy that this film (and it's sequel) have established.Because if they stray too far into CGI territory...it really will be a travesty worth rebelling against.An absolute classic, that just gets better with age.8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Silly but infectious fun,"I will admit some of it is very silly, but all the same it is infectious fun from start to finish. Directed by Joe Dante, produced by Steven Spielburg and written by Chris Columbus, Gremlins has quickly established itself in my opinion as a comedy horror classic. The direction is rock solid throughout, and is super efficient. The script is funny and inventive, and the story growing from a very simple idea is engaging and delightful. Plus all the characters are credible. And I have to say Jerry Goldsmith's music is a treat, that man knows how to compose a good music score I can tell you. Haunting, shocking and exciting are three ways to describe the score here. The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite. But the acting from the human actors is just as good. Zach Galligan is bland at first, but as the film gets going and you know more of his character you warm to him. Hoyt Axton is indeed a hoot as the inept inventor, and Keye Luke is great as the Grandfather(Mr Wing). Also watch out for a young Corey Feldman as Pete Fountaine. Plus the Christmas speech makes it essential Christmas viewing. All in all, silly it is, but it is clever and consistently engaging. Not only that, it succeeds at both comedy and horror, and that isn't easy to do.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Demented twisted movie into light nature of Stellio,The movie is very conservatively rated to say the least as any mind twisted movie in such demented form in reflection of the light nature of the Stellio proves should be rated R. The director and executive producers in this mind twisted trip of a film are actually Stellio light natures while this movie proves a direct reflection of what look like bi-pedal or mutated lizards of which their light nature the Stellio can be viewed symbolic of. The plot of the movie revolves around a very dark twist of nature's fate from an unknown creature they label in the movie as Mogwai but of which has very dangerous implications. The movie can be viewed as a very political film for prevention in reflective observance where the present POTUS with his light nature the Stellio can prove into being the leader of the pack so to speak since he is elder than all previous POTUS in historical context while his light nature a direct reflection of the ever escaping mentality that uses time as a measure from everyone else's understanding. Meaning that in overly reflecting ancient years living as their own it is beyond the measure of common sense time frames where biblical consequence can take a hold since the biblical was before standards of societal constructs and its standards. The movie can be viewed as a warning of fates towards a society in this contextual understanding.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An iconic 80's festive horror comedy,"While looking for an ideal Christmas present for his teenage son in Chinatown Billy, Randall Peltetzer comes across a furry Creature called a Mogwai which he thinks will make the ideal pet. There are however strict rules that come with it. Don't expose it to bright light as it will kill him, don't expose it to water and never feed it after midnight. When two of the three rules are contravened, Billy's hometown of Kingston Falls is plunged into chaos as it is overrun by hordes of nasty, malicious little monsters. Now It's up to Billy to put a stop to the Gremlin menace.The brainchild of Chris Columbus (with Steven Spielberg acting as Executive Producer), the inspiration behind this 1984 Horror comedy which celebrates It's 40 year anniversary came from the 1920's when mechanical failures in RAF aircraft were jokingly blamed on the small monsters. The term ""gremlins"" became a part of pop culture, with Roald Dahl himself publishing a children's book called The Gremlins in 1943. Director Joe Dante read the book, stating that it was of some influence on the movie 1984, was most definitely a good year for Hollywood blockbusters with Ghostbusters and Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom hitting theatre's across the globe. And Gremlins was one of them. The character of Gizmo, the lovable, adorable furry little creature becoming a merchandisers dream, with toys of the little guy selling like hot cakes. And who else can't forget the computer game that followed? It was a festive, Christmas movie which was something of a contrast to your typical fare of the same ilk.Its iconography is undeniable. Fairly dark with some black humour thrown into the mix, and some cutesy moments from the endearing fur ball. The movie' went through several drafts before the final one that made it to the screen was finalized. The first one being considerably even darker than what we got. Scene's included Billy's dog being eaten, his mother being killed by the savage little monstrosities and them descending on a McDonald's restaurant where they eat all the customers. This proved darker than what the filmmakers wanted and therefore it was toned down.The end result is still fairly grim, involving some deliciously macabre moments. With some lighter ones thrown in to to the mix to offer some respite from the nastiness that abounds. One memorable scenario features Billy's mother having to fend off several of the pesky beasts, and involving some novel methods in which she chooses to dispatch them. Which include the use of a blender and a microwave.Dante wisely has his cast playing it straight without playfully winking to the audience. Zach Galligan, in what would be the highlight of a career, having eventually dwindled into obscurity makes for a personable, mild mannered hero. Perpetually perturbed by the mayhem that he has found himself and the local townspeople have been thrown into. Hoyt Axton is wonderfully eccentric and affable as his Dad, Randall. And who can forget Polly Holliday as the mean-spirited, battleaxe from hell Mrs. Deagle. Who gets more than a well deserved case of gold old fashioned comeuppance. Waiting stage right is Joe Dante regular Dick Miller on hand as Billy's neighbour Mr. Futterman. Indeliable still is Phoebe Cates's haunting monologue on how she learned that there was no Santa Claus, which more than leaves by it's mark. Also look out for appearances from Jonathan Banks of Breaking Bad fame, Judge Reinhold and Corey Feldman.The movie delights in some little nods to 80's pop culture, with references to Flashdance, replete with break dancing Gremlins. It also subverts the age old tropes of the traditional Christmas cinematic tradition. It would prove so influential that it would spawn a series of cheap knock offs which include Critters, Ghoulies, Troll and Munchies. None of which could hold a candle to it. Topped off by Jerry Goldsmith's sublime score which captures the right note of manic absurdity. Gremlins is a festive treat with some added bite.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best 80's classics,I have seen this movie in de 90's almost every Christmas on TV. And many more time on vhs/dvd/digital. I also have shown my friends this movie who haven't seen it yet and most mof them really liked it. I still love it and will watch it many more time. This is a puppeteer movie and not a CGI movie. And I have a lot of respect for Chris Walas creating all the Gremlins and Gizmo. And a big thumbs up for all the puppeteers. You should watch the documentary Gremlins the puppet story (2020) you can find it on YouTube. This might give you a better view about the movie.

Excellent,"Gremlins (1984) is a masterful blend of horror, comedy, and heartwarming sentimentality that has cemented its place as a holiday classic. The film masterfully walks the line between terrifying and charming, crafting a unique cinematic experience that continues to resonate with audiences today.At its core, Gremlins is a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the importance of following rules. Billy receives a seemingly innocent Mogwai named Gizmo as a Christmas gift, but his disregard for the three simple rules - no bright lights, no water, and no feeding after midnight - unleashes a horde of mischievous and destructive creatures upon the peaceful town of Kingston Falls.The film masterfully utilizes practical effects, creating truly iconic and unsettling creatures. The Gremlins, with their grotesque features, mischievous grins, and penchant for chaos, are both hilarious and horrifying. The transformation of the adorable Gizmo into a monstrous Gremlin is particularly disturbing, highlighting the film's ability to tap into primal fears of childhood innocence being corrupted.However, amidst the chaos and terror, Gremlins also possesses a surprisingly tender heart. The bond between Billy and Gizmo is genuinely touching, showcasing the importance of love and responsibility. Billy's unwavering loyalty to his creature, even in the face of immense danger, adds a layer of emotional depth to the film.Furthermore, Gremlins offers a satirical commentary on consumerism and the dangers of unchecked ambition. The film critiques the relentless pursuit of wealth and the disregard for the consequences of one's actions, highlighting the importance of ethical behavior and respect for nature.The film's blend of horror, comedy, and heart makes it a truly unique and enduring cinematic experience. It's a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults, offering thrills, chills, and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. Gremlins serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of responsibility, the dangers of unchecked greed, and the enduring power of friendship.In conclusion, Gremlins (1984) is a masterful and enduring piece of cinema that continues to captivate audiences with its blend of horror, comedy, and heartfelt moments. Its iconic creatures, sharp social commentary, and enduring themes make it a timeless classic that remains relevant even today.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins is a little bit different to your ordinary movie!,"I was young when I hired this movie classic and admit I was scared out of my wits! But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget!The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.It's now time to talk about the real stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this?Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins.To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun with value-added,"I've just scanned some of the reviews, but don't yet see a few things that should be of interest to some in seeing this movie. Forgive me if I repeat something I don't have time to find in this longish listing. The movie's a keeper. This is wink-wink nudge-nudge juice of the first water. I see great comments on the cast here, and it's amazing to see Hoyt Axton -- the guy who wrote ""Joy To The World"", ""Never Been To Spain"", etc. -- acting so credibly in this comic role. His mama helped Carl Perkins write ""Blue Suede Shoes"" for Pete's sake, and he just shines here. Gone too soon. And did you get a load of Spielberg peddling past the payphone on his 3-wheeled whatchamacallit when Hoyt is calling home at the last minute? He's a producer who participates, as with the double-bill playing on the movie theater marquee, his personal working titles for what later became ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""... The movie is laden with little nuggets, and it's a fun story with an ending that lets you walk away satisfied -- a movie that continues to be fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Balance of Comedy and Horror,"A hugely entertaining and creatively dark and hilarious satire on the monster movie and Christmas genres with some solid pacing/foreshadowing, impressive practical effects, and a great horror comedy classic with some adorable Gizmo moments to lighten everything up. It has some dumb headscratcher moments (or that jarringly bleak infamous Santa Claus monologue scene), but the movie's tone is so ridiculous that you just roll with it. The gremlins filling the movie theater singing along to Snow White is probably my favorite scene, but there easily too many to count. I wouldn't exactly say it's for kids (hell, its existence alone created the PG-13 rating), but it's certainly a great gateway movie to show your older kids into the world of horror with a lot more thoughtful creative filmmaking that will certainly take them on a wild ride they won't forget.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The little Mogwai was so cute, i wish i had one because they are very very cute. I give this movie an excellent score 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Horror
Cheesy uninteresting film,"I never understood why people loved these crappy 80s movies so much. This film I enjoyed a little as a child, but looking back on it, the comedy is terribly crude. (i.e. Elderly woman flying out of a window by a gremlin attack.) The racial subtext to it is also something that no one here has discussed yet. You have a perfect, white suburban American family celebrating Christmas, and suddenly, from the depths of Chinatown comes a mysterious creature that brings havoc and destruction to the perfect world. This ""otherness,"" rather than being reasoned or communicated with, is eventually exterminated. Can we say ""xenophobia?"" The depictions of the gremlins, as they stand in stark contrast to those whom they terrorize, are comical, asexual, childish creatures, much like the depictions of blacks in ""Birth of a Nation.""Besides that, the acting and plot were mediocre, and the film was overall cheesy. Nonetheless, I see a little merit in it as some of it is cute and entertaining. I don't seek to criticize those who may enjoy it and ruin their fun, but I hardly see films like this ever having a chance of being made in this time as the 80s were rather reactionary compared to films of the 70s in terms of diversity and representation. Besides that, though, the film is pretty bland and not one that I would opt to watch, even in my dullest hour.",,Anonymous,Horror
They are cute & funny as long as you don't feed them after midnight.,"I don't know how the creator of those little monsters came up with the idea of making small devils in a teddybear-suite but after all, HE REALLY DID IT!!! If you have not seen this movie, you have missed a lifetime experience. If you can buy it at any price at all, do it you wont have any regrets.",,Anonymous,Horror
Juvenile fun,"Re-watching Gremlins after many years, I found myself a little bored with the opening of the picture. The first 30 minutes range from good to bad, I found the characters boring. But once the Gremlins come into play, things get much better, infact, I couldn't stop laughing at the juvenile jokes and stupidity. The Gremlins are the stars of the show, I didn't particulary care for main human characters...they seemed so poorly written, or lacked good direction.The photography is servicable, but the directing seemed a little uninspired to me.The Gremlins are excellent puppets, you do believe that they exist. Technically, the film is fine, but I wish more thought was put into the characters, and the first 20 minutes were condensed into something more interesting than the usual introductions.",,Anonymous,Horror
Xenophobia,"The hidden subtext of the Gremlins being a nuisance from World War Two and now being in everything shipped into America is both a true statement of US xenophobia and typical right-wing baloney (coming from a battle-scarred WW2 vet no less).  This is most likely a Spielberg influence rubbing off into the script.Joe Dante is an underachiever.  He never has made anything better and has only made things worse for himself by repeating the formula of this movie over and over.  Character depth is nonexistant, leaving us with either stereotypes or cardboard prop-ups.  You can tell she's an evil old lady because she has wrinkles and talks in a grim voice all the time.  No Hannibal Lecter subtly here.Jerry Goldsmith does kiddy music here and, while it is different to hear him go from Patton and The Omen to this, it still leaves a nagging feeling that he'd been smoking too many joints with Danny Elfman.  The first half of the film suffers from poor editing, but the second half marginally makes up for it.Overall, required viewing for children of the 80s.  It's amazing how something so horrifically gruesome could be passed off as a PG movie back then.  Yes, I count decapitations and microwave explosions to be gruesome. You laugh, but you don't know why other than that it's different.  3 out of 5 stars.  You could do worse and see Small Soldiers.",,Anonymous,Horror
Don't feed them after midnight?,"When is ""after midnight""? They should have said between midnight and 1am or something like that. Because it's always after midnight.Another problem is: where is the gremlin from the lab? Maybe he rejoined his pals at some point.Beyond the logic problems, this is a fun flick. Only in the 80s would a studio movie have the balls to say there is no Santa in a movie kids would watch!And Joe Dante regular Dick Miller will always make a good monster movie better!",,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favorite Christmas movies.,"This movie is awesome it is just too funny everything from Gremlins attacking Citizens to Gremlins Breakdancing is outrageous. These critters are really a HUGE pimple in the rear. I really like this movie and everyone seems like they had fun doing it the movie is very underrated for dumb reasons like parents thinking it's too dark for their children. Well I saw this and MANY (Including the Freddy and Michael Myers films) movies as a kid and I turned out fine it is all about how you explain the film to them and then they will understand besides it isn't even as bad in tone as the previous films I mentioned. Anyway Phoebe Cates was one of my first crushes mainly because of this film and is pretty good in it I also like Mr. Anderson who was hilarious in the scenes were he fights off the Gremlins. And I will never ever Forget the Gremlins getting drunk in a Bar or singing along to ""Hi, Ho"" at a late night screening of Disney's ""Snow White & The Seven Dwarves"" it is simply just too funny.",,Anonymous,Horror
A great throwback thrillomedy,This movie was one of the most thought out movies that was a comedy yet was a horror movie too. I had a Gizmo doll when I was a kid. This brings up a funny freaky story. When I received the gift as a kid I wrote on the tush tag my initials DAC.We are talking maybe 17 years ago. 5 years later I got too old to have it so I sold it at a yard sale my family ran. It was sold for 10 cents. I completely forgot about it until about a year ago I went into this store that carried classic toys. I went in there to look for some old Beanie Babies. I was browsing the persons showcases and I come across a gizmo doll. I asked him if I could see it he takes it out and I am looking over the doll and something caught my attention on his tush tag in Magic Marker which I used to write DAC was those initials. I just fell out in tears and shock saying this was mine I received 16 years ago and I wrote those initials on it so I bought him back for 5 dollars. So now that doll and movie is my favorite thing I own.,,Anonymous,Horror
Don't miss the message...,"Yes, the Mogwai are cute.  Yes, the gremlins are funny.  But, we're missing the message...Gremlins is great because it is one of the most biting anti-consumerism movies in history.  This film is loaded with little statements about American lives being over gadgetized and how this love for ""Gizmos"" could eventually lead to our downfall.  Just ask Mr. Futterman...There are also tons of little jabs at man's attempt to control nature and failing (even Billy's attempts to wrangle his dog are unsuccessful).Look for some of the great skewed camera angles when something weird is about to happen.  Also, the many shots where Red, White, and Blue are prominent in the frame.  Not artistry, think again!",,Anonymous,Horror
not bad but not for everyone,"An eccentric inventor is on a business trip in New York City and stops in Chinatown to try and find the perfect Christmas gift for his son. He comes across a unique, furry little species known as a mogwai and is warned of the possible danger involved if he doesn't follow the explicit rules of ownership. He gives it to his son as a pet, but the rules are broken and it spawns hordes of little green monsters that thrive on carnage and wreak havoc on the once idyllic little town of Kingston Falls. Well-crafted film has a creative premise, dazzling special effects, and laugh-out loud humor, but goes way overboard on violence and destruction. Not bad, just not entirely necessary in terms of its content. **½",,Anonymous,Horror
Gremlins isn't a comedy,"This film contains graphics that are not supposed to be seen by children of any age no matter what age you are. When I first saw the film, I was repulsed. A gremlin choking the mother with Christmas lights, a dog hung up in Christmas lights ( surprised the ASPCA didn't get involved ). A gremlin firing an arrow into the hero's arm. Gremlins eating a Santa Claus, Gremlins sending Flo from the show Alice out of a window, no matter how mean she was in the film,  she didn't deserve killing, no matter how she was killed.Yes,I can see that the film shows to follow the rules but still there is a limit of how much torture you can see on screen. I also spotted something else about the film. Don't you think that with all the killing they do in the film, that film also shows them having a caring, warm, gentleness of them when they are watching Snow White. I think that was a big mistake. First have them kill the citizens of the town then have them sing Hi Ho from Snow White, that's ridiculous.",,Anonymous,Horror
Its a Wonderful Life meets Batman Returns,"**1/2     out of      ****Being someone who was scared witless by this film at the age of six I still think it's amazing that Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante got away with releasing what I believe to be the most violent, gruesome, mean-spirited(and entertaining)kids movie you're ever likely to see; its beaten only by its nutso sequel THE NEW BATCH. I'd say it was ahead of its time but I was only just born when it was released so I can only imagine what it would be like in a cinema full of littlies and their parents and their subsequent reactions to certain scenes. Take the sequence where the mother is fending off the little mutants by throwing them in a microwave and a blender only to have another one jump on her and start brutally choking her with christmas lights. What about Phoebe Cates' monologue explaining why she hates Christmas... ""and that's how I found out there was no Santa Claus."" Now THAT'S gutsy film making.",,Anonymous,Horror
Perfectionist Style over Slightly Above Average Substance,"How have I never watched Gremlins before?Gremlins was such an interesting film, because having never watched it before, I was expecting a very cute movie about a furry creature that interacts with humans. I was expecting a really amazing family film, especially because Stephen Spielberg's name was attached to this as a producer. However (but not unfortunately), Gremlins was actually a really goofy and oddly acted film that has elements of comedy, family, romance, and even horror.I would compare my experience watching this film to watching From Dusk Till Dawn, because the first half (or first quarter in Gremlins) is so radically different than the rest of the film. We have cute little Gizmo (a mogwai) getting introduced to the family in the first part of the film, and it was so adorable, sweet, and amazing. But then, gremlins (evil version of mogwai's) come about, and the film because straight up horror comedy. For example, there was literally a shocking (but hilarious) sequence where the mother uses the father's inventions to radically murder the evil gremlins in her kitchen. The audience was dying of laughter, and so was I.But while the first part of the film is heavily involved with the sweet interactions between Gizmo and his family, the rest of the movie is dedicated to showing the gremlins and their absolute destruction of the city. Given, it is really well done and I laughed a ton, but I found that it was more or less lacking in story, and was more focused on giving the audience tons of spectacle. And sure, the spectacle is fantastic. The visuals of the creatures are all either stop motion or hand crafted via animatronics, and it looked amazing. Watching this makes me think that CGI is absolutely awful in most cases, and the practical effects here really added to my experience.Nonetheless, the visuals were a little too praised in some cases, and I was slightly annoyed. What I mean is that the film tried to be a little too style over substance with their practical effects, that there were two direct sequences with the gremlins that just showed them screwing around for over five minutes at a time. Think of their segment in the bar, where they were imitating gangsters; it was funny, but it went on a little too long.Also, I have a little bit more issues. The glaring issue was that everybody accepted these creatures. Nobody questions these things or even gets scared at all, and I am just thinking about films like ET or Ghostbusters, which had people in the film be genuinely terrified of the alien/ghosts. I just wish people would act a little more scared, to add some element of realism, which the film obviously wasn't going for. But even if Gremlins isn't going for realism and is trying to be more goofy, you can still have the audience express real reactions yet still have comedy, like in Killer Klowns from Outer Space.The other glaring issue was the bad acting from our main lead, Zach Galligan. He was just terrible, I am sorry. He wasn't in the film much, because the film is really about the creatures, but when he occupied the screen with his girlfriend, I was kind of cringing a little bit. Just a little bit though.Finally, what makes this film so great is that fact that I thought little Gizmo was so adorable and sweet at the beginning of the film, but when his alter ego came out by way of the gremlins, I was grossed out. It makes me think of humans; sweet on the outside, but cruel jerks once you get to know most of them. But hey, Gizmo is such a cutie. I want a poster of him.Will be watching the film again with my brother (who hasn't seen it) before school starts again. Perhaps it will be a 4/5 by then.",,Anonymous,Horror
best film ever,"i completely agree with nerveboy, it has to be one of the best films around. i enjoyed it so much that for the past months I've been looking for the film on video which is rather hard to find when you consider the film came out 17 years ago.the story starts as a man telling a story. it goes that the mogwai (known as gizmo) was brought for a present for his son (william, or billy for short) the man is told by the sellers grandson that there are three important rules never to be broken. a)he doesnt like bright lights and sunlight will kill him. b)keep him away from water, dont get him wet. and c) probably the most important rule never to forget, no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs, never, never feed him after midnight. As it goes these rules are accidentally broken and the result is the funniest group of evil monsters you can imagine(gremlins), my favourite three scenes are the cinema scene(same as nerveboy), dary's pub scene where there getting drunk and playing poker doing keep-fit, (its really funny), and the snowplow( i really like the music)So if theres any film you're going to rent from yur local video shop, this is the one-'gremlins'As it goes though i feel the follow up movie 'gremlins2-the new batch' left much to be desired forSo remember, next time something breaks down in yur house ""before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights, check every cupboard and under every bed, cos who knows there may be a gremlin in your house""- quote taken from the film said by Rand Peltzer",,Anonymous,Horror
"""They're watching Snow White... and they love it.""","When a traveling gizmo maker picks up a cute, furry little creature - who is later named Gizmo - to give to his son for Christmas, he inadvertently unleashes Hell on Earth when a bunch more of the furry little bastards start showing up and trick the son into feeding them after midnight (one of the big no-no's in having these creatures, in addition to keeping them out of the sunlight and keeping them away from water) which causes them to mutate into horrific monsters who embark on a black comic rampage that results in the death of a few cops, one local Santa, and an evil, bitchy old woman that nobody liked. Getting them wet only makes it worse because they multiply from water. Sunlight, actually any extreme light, causes pain and eventual death. So with a little help from Gizmo and his girlfriend, the son sets out to right this horrendous wrong and eventually the Chinese owner of Gizmo comes by to reclaim him.Too intense for little kids, more for teenagers, young adults and adults. Who would have guessed that this would be the springboard of Chris Columbus's career? Surprisingly entertaining but not for all.",,Anonymous,Horror
A Christmas creature feature classic,"I'd forgotten that Joe Dante's Gremlins balances creature feature, slapstick comedy, charming holiday movie and outright horror flick so expertly, but it's a delicious mix that makes for one of the most timeless fantasy films out there. Director Dante is an expert on all things 80', gooey and larger than life, this being his flagship film of sorts, the one gemstone in a career full of mischievous monsters and supernatural moonshines. Gremlins is an 'inmates running the asylum' formula, distilled into the simple premise of little renegade monsters loose about a small town during Christmas. After a wacky inventor (Hoyt Axton, like John Goodman by way of John Candy) buys an adorable Furby looking thing from the back end of Chinatown, things get nuts when he gives it to his son (Zach Galligan). The rules are don't get the little tyke wet or feed him after midnight, which of course are promptly disobeyed, causing a full on invasion of little green scaly caffeinated crackhead monsters. It's funny because as playful and charming as most of the film's vibe is, these creatures are actually straight up down to kill people and cause maximum destruction, a violent atmosphere that hilariously clashes with the benign, Fisher Price motifs also on display. The special effects are gloriously 80's, tactile and practical to their bones, every grisly gremlin death a symphony of slime and projectile ooze to be savoured, if that's your thing. The Yuletide setting is perfect for such mayhem, the increasingly dastardly antics of these little fuckers acting as a sly metaphor for the feverish, stressful hoops and hangups we all deal with over the Christmas season, whether it be bustling through a crowded mall last minute or shredding a midget goblin in a whirring magic bullet blender, anyone would be hard pressed to decide which would be more intense. The score from Jerry Goldsmith is cheeky, catchy and has an off kilter Danny Elfman vibe, perfect for the madcap, demented story onscreen. A holiday classic and then some, fuel for anyone who gets a few drinks in them over Christmas and gets bitten by the rowdy big until they're swinging from the chandeliers throwing plates at people. The sequel, also helmed by Dante, is a lot of fun in it's own high tech way, but nothing beats the first high flying outing, and plus it's a Christmas movie to.",,Anonymous,Horror
overrun by the mogawis,"In this daft movie, a teenage American boy gets an unusual creature for his birthday, a cute, furry little creature called a Mogwai.  There are just certain rules you need to follow like don't leave him in the sun, don't get him wet ... the fun starts as soon as the boy starts forgetting the rules.When the Mogwais become Gremlins and you realise they really are horrible little killers rather than the little cuties you thought they were, the movie gets really funny.  There's a scene where the Gremlins are singing 'Heigh Ho' which is hilarious.  The film also had a fabulous theme with all the little voices squeaking away together.  The creatures are far more memorable than the humans who appear (notably Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates).",,Anonymous,Horror
Puts You In The Christmas Spirit!,"'Gremlins' seemed to be marketed as a fun family comedy about little muppet - type creatures that invade a small town. I'm sure the parents who brought their kids to see this thought it would be a fun family night out. That's when angry parents started walking out of test screenings... 'Gremlins' features Gremlin blending, Gremlin microwaving, blood, guts, dog hanging by tree lights, weird bubbles on the Gremlin's backs with baby Gremlins hatching in them, fathers getting stuck in the family chimney and dying, a few somewhat grizzly human deaths and, oh, of course, the cutest creature on the Earth... being tortured. Yes, 'Gremlins' is not your average Christmas movie but for the sickest of minds, it's a must see! Mr. Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is a scientist who creates less than perfect inventions. When away from home, he gets his son Billy (Zach Galligan) an early Christmas present: A cute furry creature named Gizmo (Voice of Howie Mandel) who seems to be the perfect pet but he has three important rules not to break: Don't expose him to bright light or sunlight which would kill him, don't get him wet in which case he would multiply and, most importantly, don't let him eat after midnight or else all hell will break loose. Yes, before we know it, slimy green creatures are invading the cosy town of Kingston Falls with their eyes set on Billy and Gizmo. It's up to Billy to stop the creatures, save the town and get the girl he loves (Phoebe Cates). I remember my sister subjected me to watching Gremlins when I was about 5 and I had nightmares all night but now it's high on my list of favorite films. It has a cast at it's best including Dick Miller and Judge Reinhold, a very dark humoured and mean yet hilarious script by Chris Columbus and expert fantasy directing by Joe Dante which sets you right in the mood from the opening credits then about 30 minutes into the film he throws it all in your film. Yes, 'Gremlins' is an almost flawless film let down by only a few over long sequences (The Gremlin Bar scene starts out great but descends into boredom) but that's all made up for with the hilariously dark Christmas Story from Phoebe Cates about her father's Christmas Eve surprise that didn't turn out as planned. The scene really caused a lot of controversy as did the now infamous kitchen scene which features Gremlins meeting their demise by butcher's knife, blender and, of course, microwave. Ladies and Gentleman, if this happened in 'Wonderful Life', the suicide would have been inevitable. Get ready for a different kind of Christmas movie!!!",,Anonymous,Horror
Gizmo ka ka,I remember when I saw this in the cinema for the first time.  There was a queue a mile long!  We actually had to sit in the aisle to watch this movie! I really enjoyed this.  You feel like you're on an adventure to find Stripe and the other mutated Gremlins.  The scene in the swimming pool in the YMCA where there are hundreds of pods waiting to hatch.  That sent a chill up my spine I can tell you.  Well I was only 7 at the time.  Gremlins is a good mixture of horror and comedy.  Another good scene is the one where Gizmo is driving around in the toy store in a toy car.  A good laugh for everyone. Stay away from Gremlins 2 though....  it's is not half as good as this one. Rent Gremlins today!,,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat dark for the target audience, but still fun.","The plot: Rand Peltzer, a traveling salesman, is searching for a Christmas gift for his son, Billy, and discovers a cute fuzzy creature named a Mogwai in an antique shop. He purchases it, but is told three rules by the grandson of the Chinese shop owner: Rule #1: Keep it(him) away from bright light, especially sunlight, which kills him.Rule #2: Don't get him wet...or he multiplies.Rule #3: Don't ever feed him after midnight.Unfortunately, he does get wet, his copies turn out to be less than well-behaved(particularly one with a stripe), and they trick Billy into feeding them(except for Gizmo, the original)... which results in hundreds of scaly, ugly reptilian monsters dubbed Gremlins who destroy the town he lives in, along with a few residents.If Joe Dante meant it to be aimed at kids, it wasn't the best idea, but for everyone else, it's a fast-paced, nifty little ride(if you miss the theater sequence, you've missed the best scene), which managed to become a big hit. I enjoyed it for the most part.4 out of 5.Rated PG for comic violence and gore.",,Anonymous,Horror
Party with little green monsters!,"Who'd of thought mayhem would be so much fun?  A ridiculous plot line with an almost laughable premises presents itself, and despite the far-fetched idea I found myself surrendering to the film's incredibly charm, kicking back and enjoying the onscreen mayhem.  Joe Dante brings an oddball twist of horror and loony toons-inspired comedy by making little demonic creatures have interestingly violent, yet quirky, personalities.  The gremlins hold a place as my favorite movie monsters of all time.The real stars of the movie are Gizmo and the Gremlins (sorry Zack, Phoebe) compliments of Chris Wallas and his creature effects crew who did a spectacular job bringing the puppets to life especially in the pre-CGI age. Watching Gremlins for the first time in years, now in the middle of the CGI age, I can honestly say I miss the days of puppets.  CGI is great for a lot of things, and CGI makes many tasks easier . . . but characters entirely done with CGI lacks the concreteness of the Gremlins puppets.  Sometimes the work is much more difficult, but I think it's worth it.I love it when the Gremlins mimic the human characters around them in speech and actions, when they perform some act of cruelty and top it off with their silly and over-the-top maniacal laughter, somehow these little demons, while terrible and viscous, take on a lovable quality to them.  They have a nice satirical edge to their personality that makes the Gremlins surpass so many creatures born into the horror genre and quickly forgotten.  And who can forget the bouncy Gremlins theme music compliments of the immensely talented Jerry Goldsmith.Another thing I love about Gremlins is the surreal nature to everything. The characters never quite seem real, the sets never quite look like a real place, the narration, the whole atmosphere of the town has a weird goofball fairy tale quality to it . . . but in no way is that a complaint or criticism.  Gremlins never really sets out to take place in your home town and happen to the guy next door to you, and I'm glad it doesn't.  Joe Dante set the tone and pacing for the film just perfectly and our little destructive friends' feel right at home at this nicely painted surreal world.And everyone on the cast fits well into this surreal world, from more believable `realistic' characters to over-the-top caricatures - somehow they all seem right in their places.",,Anonymous,Horror
