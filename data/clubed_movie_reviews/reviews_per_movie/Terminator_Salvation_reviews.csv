Stop expecting the greatness of T2......Better then T3 and Genisys,"Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.Not only is it a serious terminator movie.....its more faithful to the first 2, yes it has plot holes and not die hard terminator violence but what do you expect when companies are trying to make everything PG13 for money.This is the Terminator movie you get, to throwbacks to Guns n Rose you could be mine to a CGI arnie wreaking havoc, yes it could of been done better but some of it is actually really good, just accept and stop expecting the greatness of T2, that was cameron and this is MCG two different directors.The acting is good, don't know what everyone is going on about with Bale being a weak connor when he is perfect for the role, yelchin plays a fantastic kyle reese and sam worthington is great as marcus.Relax, watch and enjoy a good summer action movie with no expectations, the opening helicopter scene is a work of art.TS - 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Undoubtedly better than any Terminator movie that came afterwards,"Undoubtedly better than any Terminator movie that came afterwards.This movie may not be perfect and not as good as the first two Terminator films,, but it is a fun watch (maybe as a guilty pleasure).The acting ist good. Christian Bale as John Connor is as best as it gets. Sam Worthington does, as always, a decent Job as the lead character.I liked the production desing. One could wish that it should have gone in that or this direction, but overall they did a good job.The cameo of Arnie as a CGI-character and a fresh T800 was enjoable and fun.People gave it a lot of flaming back in the days - but, hey - it's at least as good as the 3rd movie and it's definitely better than anything that came afterwards, at least regarding story and characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film I am sure will be referred to as underrated in the future,"Wow, this is a decent film- I was thoroughly entertained and this despite going in with low expectations. McG manages a great color palette and the action sequences are awesome. Sure, this isn't as great as The Terminator or Terminator 2 but it is surely better than T3 and a lot better than the other works in the cannon. Both Bale and Worthington are fantastic. Go watch Terminator salvation now.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The movie might not be great but still watchable and will entertain,"Terminator Salvation is a Sci-fi action movie directed by McG and stars Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Late Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jadagrace Berry and Helena Bonham Carter.The fourth instalment of Terminator brings you the continued fight between humans and the machines. This time the fight is against the new model T-800 that can wipe out humanity from earth.If you have to enjoy this movie you have to watch the movie with a fresh perspective and without any comparison from it's previously made parts. If you do so you will surely enjoy this movie.There is nothing new in the plot and the plot is predictable and bit mash up but the execution of the movie is decent, the movie is filled with action scenes, gun fights, chases and some emotion.Acting is superb and I have to admit that Christian Bale has infused a new life in the character of John Connor, he looks macho, strong and is perfectly effective. Sam Worthington was great and gives a superb support to Christian Bale, he impresses whenever he comes to the screen, rest all of the characters had limited screen space but they will impress.Screenplay is fast paced and intense and will keep you on the edge of the seat, action scenes are superb and must be appreciated, us of CGI is also effective. Few viewers might complaint that nothing new is been offered and CGI is been used excessively and I also agree to some extent, but still the movie is an all round decent action thriller movie which misses sometimes and sometimes got hit and we can't deny that it's a fun ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't understand why people dislike this so much,"This movie has a...um...different ending? Yeah, it's different but despite all that I really don't get all the hate. It's an enjoyable action flick that builds on the Terminator franchise in a satisfying way. I dig it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The 80's and the 90's aren't coming back.,"I have seen a lot of reviews on here, more than I usually read. And it is way too many 1's. This movie is no where near a one rating. I've been watching a lot of movies since I was a little kid. From cheesy 80's flicks, to straight to TV. This is no where near a 1. This movie sits at a 7 for me. Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.This movie by now is 9 years old so nothing would be giving it away. But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.But I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique.But they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes ""come with me if you want to live"", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained.If people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done.Once again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie. And its great to have all the Terminators. Cause I do.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Salvation takes itself seriously. Is this so much to ask from future sequels?,"This would be the third best Terminator film and the closest we have gotten to a realistic take on the future war from the original Terminator films.What I love about this film is the post apocalyptic setting and the grittiness of it all. No out of character jokes like T3 and the silliness of Genysis.There are some amazing scenes, this film trades big budget emotionless action scenes for more personal intense realistic altercations between earlier terminator designs.The film is not quite a classic but thoroughly enjoyable serious about what it wants to achieve. This is a story arc and setting I would love to see another sequel to.Hopefully after the bombs of Genysis and Dark Fate we can get back to a story which concentrates on the script and character development. Give us a future war.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some nice action but where's the tone?  Where's the mood?  Where's the atmosphere?,"The atmosphere that James Cameron and Stan Winston had created for the first 2 films in the franchise is what really hit me and still does to this day. I think that was the key component along with consistency and approach that gave the Terminator film it's unique style and attractiveness. It's metallic-blue overlay, infused with creepy whines of music and heart pounding edge of your seat suspense was what really created this secondary reality if not for only an hour long. It made us have a connection to these characters. A sense of believability in what was really going on. But it was those elements that were able to harness the inner workings of this dark dreamland. In essence the first two Terminators were projected nightmares in a sense, as if you were running and running, but no how fast you ran, the shadowy figure on your toes just keeps closing in. THAT is what made those films so captivating.Now these elements in one way or another were tried in this newest installment of the franchise. I see it as I've heard before as a ""hit and miss"" movie in which it got some key features to play out in the film, but lacked that essential tone T1 and T2 romantically portrayed.I have talked in lengths with individuals on why this film didn't quite hit all of it's projected(we hope) targets and I haven't really heard a clear and analyzed answer. Some say it was the amount of sub-plots that were involved, the lack of plot, the empty character development, the slight cheesy factor, and or the overall weak story and unnecessary additions to the Terminator franchise. Although these all valid arguments to say the least and I would agree on them full heartily, I don't see it as the culprit of the problem here of why this film did not life up to it's expectations.I think, like I said above in the first paragraph, that it was the direction the film was taken in perspective to it's overall tone and mood. God bless his soul, Stan Winston. For if he were alive I think we would have seen a more polished version of what we have now witnessed. I also think it was a bad part on McG for giving the O.K on the revised Terminator theme by veteran composer Danny Elfman. I don't know why in the hell the screened audiences gave the thumbs up on that one. Another issue of course is that most of the scenes were in broad day-light. I understand that McG wanted to get a different take on the war, but I don't think this was pulled off in any respects to what James Cameron had in mind for the war.(Shouldn't the sky be filled with pollution and dark particle manner from the nuclear explosions creating an ever-dark wasteland?) This was CRUCIAL and they blew it. I don't see why they didn't go with more night scenes. It is one of the strongest representative thematic elements portrayed in the Terminator 1 & 2.(I am not even going to mention T3 because of the ridiculous amount of mistakes made)The Rating: A main point that needs to be addressed for sure is the film's PG-13 rating. Of course they did this to appeal to a larger demographic of movie-goers, but they did it in expense of the true grit and bones that T1 and T2 had. I don't see why a Terminator film should be even considered for a PG-13 rating. Anything lower than an ""R"" rating does not do the title justice. The series is called Terminator for a reason...They are killing machines. THAT'S IT. I think that this is one of the biggest insults to the die-hard community of Terminator fans everywhere.There is no room for Mediocrity in trying to follow up after T2: Judgment Day. Lets hope and pray that us as an online community hold the next bunch of crazies accountable for their creative actions for the next installment of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Under-rated!!,"This movie is incredible, and I don't say that very often. The story was interesting and had a surprising twist. The post-apocalyptic world was well portrayed. The Terminators were frightening (the T-600s). The CGI was well done and purposeful (not just special effects to carry a movie with a weak plot). DONT watch the trailor because it spoils the movie. And don't listen to the critics. Go watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A dark and gritty view of the future,"I had doubts about this film when it was released but despite all the negative feedback that it has received, I really liked it.John Connor, for once, is portrayed as a strong albeit reluctant hero and leader instead of a whiny kid afraid of his future and Christian Bale portrays him very well, capturing the desperation and tortured emotions of a man who has to fulfil a destiny that he is starting to doubt. However, the main focus of this film is given to Marcus Wright, a mystery man portrayed by Sam Worthington who awakens in a post apocalyptic future and tries to figure out how he ended up there. The emotions that the character goes through as he discovers startling revelations about himself are all shown convincingly by Worthington, who brings a tough but also remorseful and vulnerable appeal to Marcus's plight.The third important character in the movie is Kyle Reese, the paradoxical father of John Connor who at this point is only a teenager and portrayed by Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the recent Star Trek movie. Reese is shown to be a hero worshipper of the resistance, especially Connor and is compelled to join him, showing traits that would be associated with the character when played by Michael Biehn back in 1984.The story of the film mostly revolves around Connor trying to find Reese but also about Marcus figuring out how he arrived in the wartorn future, and the story works pretty well. The camera style is mostly hand held, which adds a more natural and first hand look to the film and makes it feel more like the audience is in a warzone. Instead of the shiny Terminators from James Cameron's movies, the machines in Salvation are dark, sinister and have a more industrial look to them and there aren't any laser rifles, the only energy weapons in existence are employed by the huge Skynet machines so generally, bullets and missiles are still the favoured artillery of the resistance.Salvation does have its flaws, but for the first Terminator movie to be set entirely in the future, it does a good job of continuing the franchise and making it distinct from the Schwarzenegger-dominated past. While 'Ar-Nulhd' made this franchise a household name, it is refreshing to see new blood taking it in a different direction and the one thing I didn't like about the earlier films was how there was always an epic fight at the beginning of the film before they turned into a long and drawn out chase before another fight at the end. Salvation isn't a chase movie, it's a war movie and it's not ashamed to be different from its predecessors.It could have been better but it is still a good movie, ideal for sci-fi and action fans and on a personal note, it's also fun to guess which scene Christian Bale was doing when he exploded in the now infamous rant against the lighting technician.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"Arnold Schwarzenegger became the governor of California in 2003, the same year that Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. This is relevant because of course a fourth Terminator film was made and released in 2009 while he was still in office so he was unable to be in the film. Terminator Salvation had a troubled production but was eventually released. This is notably the first PG-13 Terminator film but there is supposedly an R-rated Director's Cut of which I have not seen. The film was directed by McG (known for directing a lot of music videos and Charlie's Angel: Full Throttle). The film stars Christian Bale (Batman movies), Sam Worthington (Avatar), and Anton Yelchin (Star Trek reboot movies). The film was a box office bomb even though it made back over $300 million (it's budget was $200 million) and was not a critical success and plans for sequels were cancelled.It is the future in 2018 and the resistance is battling the machines. John Connor is the leader (kind of) and he has to find Kyle Reese so he can send him back to 1984. But Connor may need the help from a mysterious stranger.Let me set the scene of my very first experience with this film. I was about 7 or 8 years old. This movie came in the mail via Netflix's mail service. I was pretty excited because I liked the previous two Terminator films (had not seen the first film yet) and was hoping for a good film. I was majorly disappointed with the film and found it to be really boring and forgettable. Fast forward to the year 2021 and I rewatched the film for the very first time since my first viewing. I had low expectations and was later surprised at how underrated this film ends up being. Terminator Salvation is an interesting film. Not great, but interesting enough to keep my interest. Terminator Salvation is something different and I enjoy that. I was tired of seeing the same old time travel story over and over again. This time we get a really dirty and gritty war story without all of the time travel and more of a Transformer vibe in a sense. But, the film still has it's problems but not enough to make it a bad film. It is one of those films that if you turn off your brain and forget about the other films, you will most likely find some value within. I will just get the negatives out of the way. First, is the big ""twist"". While it is not really much of a twist as it is revealed in the opening scene, it is played up as a twist later in the film and it is not very surprising. Though on the flipside, the idea is rather interesting and it makes the character even more interesting. Next, is the characters. Now, the majority of the characters are not that exciting save for maybe two characters. John Connor in this film is not that interesting but the film makes up for that with the other main character. Next complaint is the callbacks to the previous films. Some of these callbacks do not feel earned and some do. Hit or miss. Next, is the portrayal of the future. Now, in previous Terminator films, the future was always in the year 2029. This time around it is 2018. I am sure this is a prequel to the events that occur in 2029 but there is also evidence to say otherwise. Also, it is really gritty and dirty. What ever happened to the dark and cold future of the previous three films? Now it is not a huge complaint as I think that this future is portrayed fine but I do have a preference here. Those are all of my negatives for this film. My positives of the film include the acting which is surprisingly good. Anton Yelchin has a believeable performance as Reese. The use of mostly practical effects is really fun to see especially with the Terminators which look great. That is the bipedal Terminators...... There are some good action scenes but nothing that really compares to the first three films.Terminator Salvation is something different. Perhaps people wanted the same story over and over again. It may not have the same charm that the first two films had, but it is definitely better than Terminator 3 in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable ride, not quite there but lots of fun...","I was actually rather surprised that this film was as enjoyable as it was. After reading several scathing reviews I was very worried going into this film. Overall I had a good time watching it.Now I should preface this with the fact that I am a huge fan of the Terminator films/franchise. I think that overall the look was amazing, the action and CG were great and the acting was mostly good. I think the film suffered from not enough character development and I think that McG was on the right track, but needed a tighter script and story to work with. You can tell in the film that he is a fan of the first films... I definitely got a kick out of all the throw backs to the films. Not just the obvious ones like the music choices or one liners, but also subtle things like single handed shotgun cocking or single handed pipe blows, or the choice of settings and shots.I have to say that Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese did a fantastic job. He was probably my biggest worry in the film as Michael Biehn's, Kyle Reese is probably my favorite character in anything ever, so basically he had big shoes to fill. Well I didn't think it possible, but he actually made me love that character even more. So mad props to him. Again I think this was a very valiant effort by McG, he needs to work out a couple kinks for the next films, which I really he gets the green light on.Basically there are a few of loopholes and inconsistencies which could bring you down if you linger too long on them, but if you are able to get past that it is definitely worth watching. But those are in all the films, even the second has some. (I'm not saying it's better than, so don't stone me!) In short I had a lot of fun at Terminator Salvation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This was actually a decent film!,"Enough with the copycat comments! Everybody is so keen to criticize this film, while completely ignoring its good parts. Was there some plot weirdness? Well, yeah, we are talking humans winning versus machines here. But most of it was decent.In this film you get to see more machine types, more character ambivalence (do you even remember the first Terminator? it was machine fascism!), more hints to the previous movies and, most of all, hints of the direction of the Terminator concept. I don't want to spoil it for you, but you must be blind not to see it is a good thing.Other good things in this movie: Moon Bloodgood, the Oh-girl; Michael Ironside, just as fun as ever, even if having some scenes. And there is Sam Worthington, who is actually the main character and more like Help from BSG, but twice as cool, NOT Christian Bale aka John Connor.I am surprised to see that both Terminator the series and the new Terminator are bringing some modernism to the old age concept of machine war. They are obviously not without flaw, but considering the alternatives and, even more, my expectations, I would say that saying this film was bad must be just some fashionable thing to say right now.Bottom line: I liked it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Fantastic action and effects, but check your disbelief at the door...","TS is a film that will wow your eyes and ears. It will be a standard for demonstrating the latest high-end home theater systems for several years. Do not, however, go to this film to stimulate the imagination. The plot has many holes patched with barely-there plot devices. I'm reminded of the film Thank You For Smoking when the character Jeff Mengall spoke of Hollywood plot holes getting filled with lines like ""Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device."" In previous Terminator films, you could always assume that sending anything back in time took a lot of energy and resources - that's why you could accept that there was only one Terminator instead of 2+ working together. In this film, we are made to believe that fighting Skynet is like out-maneuvering a herd of angry elephants with laser beams on their heads.In all, I gave this film a 7 because it does what a good futuristic action film should do: wows the eyes and ears. Just don't forget to check your disbelief at the door.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator Salvation is a visual treat with thrilling action.,"Too bad I didn't see this film in a theater when it was released back in 2009. For me this is the most enjoyable Terminator film since James Cameron's last effort in 1991. The reason for this is the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation. In addition, the filmmakers dared to try new things, resulting in an interesting, entertaining and gritty film. Schwarzenegger, a great presence in the first two Terminator films, should have left the role of the T-800 when he became old. This is my opinion. This would have resulted in better sequels or reboots after James Cameron stopped making Terminator films. Schwarzenegger's presence requires screenwriters to construct a plot revolving around his T-800, and this has resulted in two repetitive and average cash-grabs titled Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003) and Terminator Genisys (2015). This problem is especially clear in Genisys, for which, instead of trying something new, the screenwriters (Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier) delivered a poorly-written and confusing screenplay because Schwarzenegger, who's 68 years old now, agreed to return. As a result, we got an ""old but not obsolete"" good Terminator, yet another attempt to prevent Judgment Day, an evil John Connor (something that I really didn't like), and an overstuffed plot with unimaginative details and possible plot holes. Well, Genisys was just another uninspired attempt to make money, however, I still enjoyed the film despite its faults, and I recommend seeing it. Schwarzenegger is no longer the box office draw that he used to be in the 1980s and 1990s, but Emilia Clarke is definitely a good screen presence. And so, Terminator Salvation doesn't have this 'Arnold problem.' It introduces new characters, and further develops established characters like John Connor. On second thought, Connor has little or no character development in this film, but it's still good to see him. We also get to see the future in 2018, after Judgment Day. For the most part, the designers and special-effects technicians did an excellent job creating the robots, vehicles and buildings. Though there are some missteps when we get to see Skynet headquarters. The action scenes that one expects from a film like this are mostly exciting and even original. The images are memorable as well, be it a nuclear explosion, a ruined city, a big deadly Terminator, or an apocalyptic wasteland. Because of all this, Terminator Salvation really deserves to be called a science fiction action film. On the downside, the screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris is unfocused and rather simple. One can say that there are two main characters, but neither one gets enough development. The exploration of human nature that was present in James Cameron's films is absent. But at least the dialogue is fine, for the most part. Director McG can be applauded because he knew what he wanted this film to be like, and he followed through with his vision, resulting in a film that's epic, enjoyable and a bit disturbing. So, I definitely recommend Terminator Salvation. It has its faults, but it does not, as Arnold said, s*ck. It rules.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
SkyNet war movie more complicated than it needs to be,"In 2003 Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is on death row, and donates his body to research. Years later after Skynet has taken over, John Connor (Christian Bale) is just one of the fighters against the machines. When he attacks a Skynet facility, he finds that Skynet is developing the powerful new model T-800. He seems to be the sole survivor, but unbeknownst to him, a naked Marcus emerges.This is the war movie that everybody expected after the first Terminator movie came out. We all thought about the apocalyptic world of battling Skynet. The movies have always been pre-Judgement day. This is the first movie post-Judgement day.The CG has finally caught up to the vision. The action is dark, and big as it should be. The story is too complicated for it's own good. The Marcus character is too complicated when a simple underdog character is all that's required.

The possibility was there but they just couldn't do it!,"Terminator Salvation is on papers an excellent idea, the back story of how the resistance manage to send Kyle Reese back in time in order for the events of the first film to take place.And to be honest the effects and battle scenes are very well made and compared with Terminator 3 and Genisys, it is a far better film from both in both characters and action. But there is the elephant in the room which is that the action scenes are few and far between, most of the characters are paper-thin and the story is quit jangled.In all honesty the film could have been really enjoyable, if they focused more in the current (before time travel) movie environment, we might had something like Rogue One, but history is not written with ifs and the huge issues of production and studio intervention dammed the project. Christian Bale reputation might suffered the worst due to a break down he had in the set, but let's be real we all faced a disappointing project ,which is stress-full, exhausting and irritating and few of us in some point we screamed and cursed our lungs out because of that, so Mr. Bale is not here to blame for that mess!!In the end Salvation is for me the point where everyone must understand that the Terminator franchise has no stem anymore and any idea for a sequel, prequel , etc. must be deleted and try something else that works.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Redefining the Future of the Franchise""","""Terminator Salvation"" marks a bold departure from its predecessors, diving headfirst into the post-apocalyptic world dominated by Skynet and its relentless machines. Christian Bale's portrayal of John Connor adds a new layer of complexity to the character, showcasing his struggles as a leader torn between duty and personal demons. The film's action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, with jaw-dropping visual effects that bring the brutal battles between man and machine to life in thrilling detail.Director McG's vision for the film is evident in every frame, as he creates a dark and gritty atmosphere that underscores the desperation of humanity's fight for survival. The introduction of new characters, such as Sam Worthington's enigmatic Marcus Wright, adds depth to the narrative and challenges audiences to question the nature of humanity in a world ravaged by war.""Terminator Salvation"" doesn't just rely on spectacle, however. The film delves into themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds. As John Connor rallies the scattered remnants of humanity against Skynet's forces, the movie explores the power of hope and determination in the darkest of times.Overall, ""Terminator Salvation"" is a gripping and visually stunning entry in the Terminator franchise that breathes new life into the series. With its compelling characters, pulse-pounding action, and thought-provoking themes, the film sets a new standard for futuristic sci-fi adventures and cements its place as a standout in the iconic franchise's history.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It was a loud action film with no substance.,"Christian Bale has proved that he is a fantastic actor. For me, this was just a paycheck movie for him. A very mechanical performance, in some scenes it seemed he never lets go of his Batman character. The movie itself was entertaining for the most part, but lacked the suspense that the first two Terminator films had. A quality that James Cameron possesses as a director that has been lost in the last two films. The screenwriters for Salvation can't decide who the main character is and what the main plot of the film is.

Resurrected from the grave.,"Now, not everyone will agree with me with this statement.

So they now have to complete the time line... After that excuse of a movie. I was wondering what on earth is this one gonna be like? Pleasantly surprised. I think Bale did a good job as Connor and brought the film back from the grave. Was he the star of the show? Not in my opinion, Worthington was brilliant as part man, part machine.

Not great but massively entertaining.,"I have watched the terminator series, the movies are quite good. Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the series. One thing that disappoints is that there is no main terminator that goes killing humans like in Terminator 2. MCG, the director, did a great job especially creating the gritty and tough world. MCG proves that he can go from comedic action with stunts to loud whizz-bang and gritty action. But his story pretty much stays the same. His movies have always been a mindless thrill ride. That is Terminator Salvation.The story: It is the year 2018. John Connor has grown up to a bat-man-like with tough voice. He is serious and leads a team to destroy terminators and Skynet. There is one mysterious guy named Marcus who does not know why he is in the year 2018. Can Connor trust him? There will be some mild twists. The action starts with a bang. Explosions, chase scenes and one-to-one fights scenes with terminators. They are intense. There were times that made my heart pounded like scenes where MCG aimlessly put loud music in almost silent parts. The music is good but not as epic as the past movies like Terminator 2.Overall: It is a mindless action movie where almost all of the characters have only one goal in mind. Action is good and intense with explosions. Terminators' fans will definitely flock the cinema to see whether it is worthy to be in the name of terminator. MCG's fans will be proud that he has done a good job. Whether it is not like a terminator film, it will still be included in the terminator series. There may be a sequel or not...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Liked it more than than Part 3  and a toss up with 1 and 2,"McG did an outstanding job of bringing a unique vision to the Terminator franchise. As a major fan of the Terminator saga I didn't expect much since I wasn't familiar with any of the previous work of McG and I had read little of the plot--though I was happy to know Christian Bale was playing John Connor.I'm so glad I saw it on the big screen! The sound and visuals were amazing from start to finish. The story was refreshingly layered and the dialogue was sharp. Don't expect any cheesy scenes or unconvincing acting to ruin the mood--something I felt happened too often in Part 3. Bale and Yelchin were believable as Connor and Reese. Worthington's performance was perfectly executed and perhaps worthy of top billing.After Part 3, regardless of its shortcomings, I hoped for a part 4. Certainly, with what we are told and what is shown in flashbacks in the first 3 films, a film centered on a world post Judgment Day could be action packed. Yet action and special effects should serve the story and not the other way around. In Terminator Salvation there is no lack of story, no lack of action, and certainly no lack of brilliant direction.

A Victim of the Previous Film,"I do not understand the bad reviews for this film. I too agree that it's not T1 or T2. Nor do I think it's fair to expect it to be. James Cameron, before he became stuck up and pretentious, was a great artist and made these films classics.But it's hard to be 'original' in Part 4; so it's an un-fair cop out to judge this move poorly in regards to 'lack of originality.' At this stage in the franchise, I think what needs to be looked at most is staying true to the story and doing something within the ball-park of what the film should be.This takes place before much of what we've been told about the Terminator movies does. But it still fits the bill for what T1 and T2 describe about the future. I hear people complaining about giant robots. I'm sorry, did they somehow miss the giant roving tanks and air-craft in the first two films? And what are these complaints about there not being full war scenes? I like the idea of there being specific scenes of action. At this point the humans don't really have an attack plan and are mostly hiding out and trying to re-group after judgment day. The scenes we see in T1 and T2 are long after the events here. Is this really so hard for fans to understand? I think these scenes are more suspenseful than just a giant full-war scenes movie.And what is funny is to read all the complaints about chase scenes being gone in T3 and 'too many' in T4. Are you people never happy? T4 takes on the concept of humans and machines being blended to a point where it's hard to tell the two apart. Something that would have been more amazing in say 1995. This movie suffers more, than perhaps anything else, from the fact that there isn't too much left to say about sci-fi and robots that hasn't already been covered in the gap from 1991 to 2009. The Terminator movies themselves just took to long to come back and say anything meaningful after T2. And thus by the time they did, it is no longer 'original' because it's been said by ten thousand other sci-fi films. But there is nothing else original really left to be said.The acting is stiff. Well, excuse me, but this is a war and isn't war stiff? I think the hero shows as much emotion as we are likely to see from a war movie in today's world. Mostly, people are sick of the war. The most a soldier can do is cry, say he wants to go home, and realize that he's already screwed himself. In T1 Kyle was also shown as suppressing his emotions after witnessing the horrors of the future war. The movie was largely about him learning to be human again instead of the 'machine' that he was in the future.So, we see a humanity that is mostly devoid of emotions, huddling and hiding out, trying to find at a single weakness to attack. We see giant robots a little different than the ones we're used to (as those haven't been built yet) and we see an interesting story that re-connects Kyle into the story.I see this film as being true both to war and to T1 and T2. While it may not be as overtly dark in tone, it is a solid entry into the franchise that did do its homework (even though it seems many of the fans did not) and tried to do something good.The only fault I see in this film is not in this film but in the fact that the fans were so disappointed and ticked off by the previous film that they were angry and looking to pick apart any little thing they could in this film that wasn't 'perfect' by their own half-baked standards.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A sad casualty of what's mistakenly deemed bankable today.,"Yikes. This is definitely not the future my mother warned me about. This future is populated by cute kids, blood-free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot. It is set in a sun-kissed Michael Bay desert landscape with high-tech military equipment and not the dirty sewers we saw in T1. Either Kyle Reese was laying it on real thick to get in Sarah Connor's pants, or McG et al were simply incapable of delivering the dark, post-apocalyptic future setting that they kept harping on about honoring before release.This is no doubt a casualty of the scarlet letter that is the PG-13 rating, oft denied by the production while they dropped subtle hints along the way such as toy deals, Pizza Hut endorsements and McG noting how the PG-13 The Dark Knight was ""made without compromise"". In reality the rating was a fait accompli the moment they green-lit a $200M production. The implications of the rating are not just sacrifices to language, blood & gore or in the inclusion of a sidekick kid to instill the family friend image. It's worse. Now the Transformers audience is a major demographic for TS, and it translates in the light-hearted, gadgety nature of the movie, and obviously in its Harvester design (who deploys mototerminators from its kneecaps).But quite honestly, massive mythology discrepancies aside, there is simply far too many wrist-slashingly bad/expository lines and heavy-handed metaphors in the script for this to even work as a standalone movie (thanks, Haggis). To its credit, much of the action is kinetically captured in a timely shaky-cam fashion. Lord knows I'm no McG fan (he's a snake-oil salesman) but I feel the major culprit truly is the script which spells everything out for the viewer with voiceovers and facepalm exposition. I'm sorry the writers were not able to give McG, at the very least, the kind of mindless action flick he was surely able to direct in a competent if forgettable manner.Whereas acting is concerned Christian Bale shows up for 35-40 minutes looking real angry at the world and at being involved in this project, it is in fact Sam Worthington who is a breakout star, and such an effortless tough guy that you can feel the bass reverberate in your body when he throws a punch. Think of how hardass he could be in the right R-rated setting. I'm getting chills just thinking about it. Everything else reeks of an empty cash-in sequel with neither knowledge nor respect for the source material, vaguely ""justified"" by tagging on ""this isn't the future my mother warned me about"". No, McG, it most certainly is not.Whatever. Pages could be spent arriving at the conclusion that this movie is, quite simply, abysmal. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10 based on Yelchin, Worthington and effort on the action side of things.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than other fans seem to have been.","Wow, where do we start with a franchise film so rich in history...and so riddled with continuity errors? The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3. why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4? Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.And then there was the highly publicized expletive-filled Bale rant broadcast over and over and over ad nauseum. Upon seeing the film, I can better understand why that happened...this is a GRITTY film, full of angst and dancing testosterone. As ""worked up"" as Bale must have had to have been in order to pull off these angst-filled scenes (one after the other after the next), he exhibited amazing control in not HITTING the guy who blew the scene for him. I'm no longer upset or offended by his diatribe.That brings us to the movie. Well, yes, there are problems with it, and many state that this film brings little to the franchise history and instead contributes to the growing list of errors and problems with the franchise, but I have to disagree.This work, for me, demonstrates an intent to give us millions of machines marching en masse on human survivors in the attempt to quell a birthrate upsurge of the pestilence which has somehow managed to take control of its world...Mankind. The promise for something better is not only present due to how little this movie actually contributes, but by the actions and deeds therein.There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than I was with the Star Trek reboot.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"By no means the best, but very impressive","To the filmmaker's credit, for a franchise initially conceived as a standalone film, things have been kept fairly fresh over the decades. Terminator 2, widely considered to be the best of the series, managed to expand and improve almost every aspect of the original Terminator. The third, the least creative of the bunch, still explored the ominous back-story further and switched around the sex of the robotic antagonist with mixed success. Now, fully emerged in the post-judgment day world, fresh faces and astounding production values makes Terminator Salvation a unique and overall very impressive entry in the sci-fi saga.Now, from director McG, we get a wildly different Terminator film; dark, gritty and nightmarish. Gone are the days of the lone hunter, replaced with a post-apocalyptic hell rank with death, desperation and viscous, cold machines. I love dystopian visions and to have such a world infused with terminators is fairly awesome to be blunt. Shot is drained, almost monochromatic colours the planet Earth after the bombs fell at the end of T3 is fully realized, even if other areas are not quite as flushed out. Gone along with most of humanity is the consistent dry humour (mostly) as is a good portion of the character driven plot of Terminator 1 and 2; yet as I alluded to before, the departure from the originals is bold and exciting.4 movies, 4 John Connor's; keeping with tradition, forever rising star Christian Bale takes over the iconic role, but this is less Connor's film this time round. Instead the story is broken up amongst the future heroic leader of the resistance, John's future (or past, it's always confusing) father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mysterious stranger named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). This is perhaps Salvation's largest flaw, that the plot, divided between three main characters, along with the requisite action leaves fewer fully rounded characters. I understand that the set-up must be established and I hope that is something the already planned sequel can improve upon.The story is simple, but with complex veins running throughout as well. It is 2018, still not yet the true leader of the resistance but more what the powers call a 'false profit', Connor leads the resistance in spirit, not in rank. Thinking they may be able to turn the war having discovered a signal that could destroy Skynet once and for all, Connor and his team seek to test the weapon and to find Reese in the process. But the machines have other plans as they attempt to capture Kyle Reese and end the future for good. Living in a decimated L.A., Reese saves the mysterious Marcus from a T-600 and the two unite to locate the legendary Connor and join the resistance. Intersected along the way however and taken by the machines, Reese now must hope Wright will return the favour and reach Connor in time to save him, and possibly the human race.The best news for the crudely broken narrative is that all three plot line are all impeccably acted. Bale is solid as always as Connor, putting forth a more tortured sole vibe that started brewing in T3. Yelchin is nothing short of astounding in his ability to channel Reese from the original, played by Micheal Biehn, both in his line delivery and presence on screen. Worthington is perhaps the best thing about this film; another rising star and a formidable, charismatic and charming screen presence. Infuse that with spectacular effects, some gripping and well shot action sequences and you have a summer movie that while not as good as the earlier entries manages to infuse new life into a classic franchise.Read all my reviews at www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should have been titled Mad Max Salvation,"I was expecting a Terminator movie, but all I got was a rehash of Mad Max cliches. Not much about this movie is good - the acting in some scenes is laughable, the dialogue is copy-paste from various movies, the story is predictable and has been repeated in other movies many times, Christian Bale is trying to sound ""macho"" but ends up sounding like he's got tonsillitis, the only surprise about the ""fighter pilot takes off her helmet and turns out to be a sexy female surprise scene"" was that someone thought it was a good idea to include it...I could go on and on, but the gist of it is that this entire movie is a cliché of various Mad Max and ""terminator-ish"" movies.

"Good summer action flick - some things will blow you away, others....",Definitely see this one on the big screen! The sounds and visual effects at times are almost overwhelming! Great CGI and visually the future world and war are very believable. The story for me was just OK - I felt that some emotions and character development seemed to happen too fast and there were a few cheesy parts I had to roll my eyes at. Without giving too much - one little character in particular I found quite tiresome. One of my favorite movies growing up was Terminator 2 and this one falls far short. I'd say its about on par with the original Terminator (without a doubt better than T3).

It's not All there but Worth Seeing,"I wanna start with the positives, Bale as usual is very intense and gives us the John Connor you would expect, MCG delivers in the special FX department along with a few bits of humor and a smidge of suspense, Anton Yelchin is an Actor people should be keeping an eye on he is a blossoming Talent. Now the bad little to no character development, a script that while it pays homage to the previous films has little else to offer many scenes that should have had exciting suspenseful build up just splash across the screen in Grand Big Budget Spectacle and that is the films weakness. All the films relied on good storytelling, sadly when I came home I rewatched the previous films, While the original Terminator was a low budget film Cameron incorporated suspense, character, and connected with the audience you cared about Kyle & Sarah. T2 expanded in both directions with solid character development, explosive visual FX, innovative approaches, and progressed the storyline moving it forward, with intensity, drama,even humor. T3 while weaker than the two movies before it still managed to deliver in style, suspense, yes Nick Stahl was a wimpy John Connor with that aside, Claire Danes was great and Arnold older now still managed to deliver, Christiana Loekane was awesome, with a weak script Jonathan Mostow still managed to delivery a satisfactory movie and this is my where things get weird can u believe I liked this one better than Salvation. I remember not really thinking that much of T3 but now it stands above the latest release. I sure hope Jane Alexander has more to do in the next installment what a waste of talent, and thats what I think of Terminator Salvation what a missed opportunity for true greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Terminator franchise continues to stumble with Terminator Salvation,"The first two Terminator films are fantastic films and both are among the best of the action genre. The third film, Rise of the Machines signalled the franchise's decline, but while flawed (mainly down to being unbalanced and too more-of-the-same) is not that bad a film. While Terminator Salvation is better than Terminator Genysis, instead of improving on the problems of Rise of the Machines it continues the stumbling block, not a terrible film, but a disappointing and not too great one, both in comparison to the first two and on its own.Starting with the good points, Terminator Salvation is a good-looking film, with strikingly atmospheric post-apocalyptic scenery, stylish photography and slick editing that is neither too hurried or static. The special effects are of typically solid quality, some of them even excellent with the exception of some shabby-looking Terminators. Some of the action is very exciting and compellingly choreographed, without causing a headache or inducing a seizure, and the music is haunting and rousing. There are some fun references also to the older films without feeling forced at all, and a couple of performances are good. Coming off best is Anton Yelchin in a fantastically intense but also subtle performance, and while he does have his bland moments Sam Worthington does show some charisma and is not as bland as feared.On the other hand, while some of the action is pulsating excitement, other action sequences are very loud but also very soulless, and it comes at the expense of any character development, which is skimpy at best, Marcus is the only one that really gets an arc that maintains some interest but even that's not completely attention-grabbing. The script is often awkward in flow, is overly reliant on sloppily written exposition and is too often too heavy-handed, and the story, apart from a reasonably smart twist half an hour before the end, can be convoluted, is more desperate than inventive (doing little with the post-apocalyptic atmosphere) and lacks the dark mystery, suspense and thrills of the first two. Credit is due for it not being more of the same and trying to be different, but one can't help thinking that it was rather too different, other than the characters' names it is basically unrecognisable from before and that might not be a good thing for some, and unfortunately the huge pile of clichés that the film has disallow it from having its own personality or doing anything new.McG's direction is muddled and unfocused, the pacing generally could have done with more tightness and most of the acting is not that great. Bryce Dallas Howard fares the best of the ladies and does dependably but her limited material is beneath her, while Helena Bonham Carter is forgettable and out of place and Moon Bloodgood is vapid and could easily have been cut from the film and nobody would have noticed. Most disappointing is Christian Bale, he is an actor with a lot of talent but he phones it in and is incredibly stiff in a role that has very little to it other than talking/shouting into speakers and walkie-talkies, it's not just that it's not a good performance and a shameful waste of talent but also because of how badly written the character is. The CGI-ed Arnold Schwarzenegger is nice to see, but is a little clumsily incorporated and unnecessary at the same time.In conclusion, not a terrible film but instead of being improving on the previous film, despite some good things, the Terminator franchise continues to stumble. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun War Movie WIth Good Action But Little Terminator,Obviously it's a shell of the first and second terminator films but this movie kind of plays like a mediocre Mad Max. The action and CGI is a lot better in this film then in the third so it at least has that going for it. The acting is quite wooden though which is a shame considering it has Christian Bale. They play around with some cool new Terminator designs but ultimately this movie just doesn't feel like a Terminator movie. Without trying to give too much away the Terminator doesn't appear in the conventional fashion but I can't tell if the audience wasn't supposed to pick up on the terribly obvious foreshadowing? This movie does focus on the war against the machines atleast though which is the part I've been looking forward to.It's a nice looking action movie but as a Terminator movie it's lacklustre.

"aesthetically pleasing, good yet intermittent action, terrible plot and script","This movie's problem was its reliance on Sam Worthington, and his character/plot device. Or twist, if you will. In the same year, Avatar was being released, also helmed by Worthington. That's my accusation for why his role was front and center here; I have nothing against Worthington and actually like him, but the focus on his character was unnecessary. Essentially pushing aside Christian Bale as John Connor, a portrayal that fervent Terminator fans deserved. But that was ruined by the writers' decision to pursue the whole ""I don't know I'm a robot"" routine as old as time itself. Halfway through we get a random pilot with a male voice and generic Caucasian name that turns out to be an attractive Korean woman, cue unnecessary love interest. That's right; ""a robot that loves,"" too. The script reeks of clichés, and outside of the great, gritty action and atmosphere, even Bale can't save it. Then there's the whole CGI Arnold bit that I try to forget ever happened. What this movie had going for it even before release was an incredible trailer and an even better song. Superior marketing for an inferior film. Such a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator Lacks Soul,"Aside from some jaw-dropping visual effects and production design (sound, robots), T4 felt like it lacked any real significance, meandering from one action sequence to the next in-between lines of clichéd dialogue. Regardless, the acting was quite good, with Bale coming off as the only real disappointment. Usually an outstanding character actor, his character here really didn't have any development beyond being John Connor, leader of the resistance. As such, he was in 'Batman' mode throughout the the entire film, with dialogue mainly consisting of screaming, often incoherently. On the other hand, Sam Worthington was a real surprise, delivering an incredible performance as Marcus Wright. He saved the film, adding the only real touch of depth and emotion to an otherwise hollow, unengaging plot. Overall, while I can't fault McG's direction, if T4 had spent some more time in the scripting department, maybe we would have gotten something beyond a drearier version of The Matrix Reloaded. Disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I can't be the only person that enjoys this movie? Well worth a look.,"We can talk about what's wrong or we can cover what's right about Salvation. It's copped too much heat for being a forgettable entry into the franchise but it's still miles better that Dark Fate or T3: Rise of the Machines or the absolute abortion that was Gynasis or whatever it was called. I really wish with Salvation, they had of leaned more into the battles between the resistance and the Terminators and made it more a war film. Seeing both a resistance/John Connor in its/his prime talking down T600's and HK's in vast spanning battlefields and urban combat scenarios would have been awesome but this movie does get the time right. The characters are enjoyable and Skynet at its menacing prime is an ever present nasty throughout the movie. Some awesome visuals (the grim reaper terminator is one of my favorite scenes towards the end there) and the scope and scale is well done with very decent visual effects.Definitely worthy of a watch and is just a good old action movie that I believe will be recognized as an underrated gem in years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Others maybe think other way, but you cant go to see a title like T4 with intentions of criticism, cause the movie is a total new classic, you like it or not.

The movie that Hollywood (not the franchise) needed,"Decent enough and enjoyable.Some brilliant new characters and surprisingly ones that the viewer actually gives a hoot about!

I thought that there may be an ultimate incredible twist but alas McG just isn't that clever and probably didn't want the bother of thinking that deep for the next 2 instalments.Enjoyed the cg elements and the introduction of the first set of terminators seemed well developed but I just wish that they didn't feel the need to include Arnie, just to stave off any elements of appearing to rely too much on the previous films and tick every single box.Kyle Reese was very well done and congratulations to Anton Yelchin for nailing what I thought was a very credible performance and including of Michael Biehn's characteristics.Could have been a lot worse but should have been better",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

critics don't have a clue........,OK i just watched the movie and i seriously liked it.after i walked out of theater i was thinking why movie was so much critically panned.lets face it every movie cannot be great but from a common moviegoer perspective and a follower of terminator film franchise this one was quite good and i say good enough to be mentioned in same breath with other two movies of the series discarding the third one. Plot of the movie was simple and intriguing.it was easy to follow and some might say thats predictability of storyline but i say thats where the screenwriters and director have got their act right.one of my apprehension about the movie was plot may be too convoluted that might have triggered such a backlash from the critics but that certainly wasn't the case. Much of the criticism have been directed towards Christian bale for giving a ranting loud angry performance but common guys think straight.This guy is playing the sole hope of human race.everything depends upon him and he needs to get his act right.he has to mean business and here business is quite a serious one of protecting his people and bringing down the sky net.of course he cannot crack jokes wink at others pretending its just another fine day.he has to look like a guy on mission having unwavering determination towards his goal n Bale succeeds in doing that.anyways bale has to be one of the finest actor of his generation and he shows his class here. Sam Worthington was truly worthy of the role because he played it with almost genius .truly a character with whom audiences can relate as both are thrust into a unknown world post judgement day.he carries the mantle of a protector/terminator as good as Arnold did in other movies.he certainly grabbed attention and sometimes overshadowing other in his presence. Anton yelchin did justice with his role of young kyle Reese.his vulnerability and still the determination to earn a place in coveted resistance should have won hearts over. Action is the high point of the movie with truly remarkable special effects and giant robots.action was properly paced neither too mind numbing no too less.MCG direction was cool and some of the shots n cinematography was breathtaking. at last i don't know which movie critics watched but i know for me the movie that i watched was worth my money n worth my wait.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Please cast Moon Bloodgood in more movies!,"The year is 2018. Judgment day has come and gone leaving humanity in the hands of a few, scattered resistance fighters. Various terminator models roam the post-apocalyptic wasteland either killing or harvesting humans all under the direction of a faceless, computer enemy known as Skynet. And the salvation of the human race rests in the hands of one man ... John Connor.Unfortunately, this plays out more as a guilty pleasure movie than a canonical extension of the James Cameron Terminator series. If the first movie was about saving Sarah Connor, and the second movie was about saving John Connor, this installment seems to be about saving Kyle Reese. This is where the holes in the story begin with me. How does Skynet know about the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Connor? I can understand that they know about John Connor from his FDR style fireside chats over the radio as the leader of the resistance. But how would they know about his relationship with Kyle Reese? Kyle Reese and the T-800 are sent back in time in the year 2029 and yet this is only 2018.In the first Terminator movie Kyle Reese assesses the conflict between man and machine in the following quote, ""That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" That context helps build the tension in the first 2 movies. Whereas the conflict in this installment is full of less tension because it seems Skynet is content to leave the resistance to its own devices while it's busy in the lab working on schemes. There are no scenes like in the first movie where we see terminators infiltrating resistance camps. That would have been cool. Interesting side note, Arnold's workout buddy Franco Columbo plays the terminator infiltrator that shoots up the resistance camp in Kyle Reese's flash back sequence in the first terminator movie.Influences and flaws: MCG cites such movies as Black Hawk Down, Children of Men, and Road Warrior as influences for this movie. In reality, this movie plays out more like a thinly veiled rip off of those movies while managing to never come close to catching the authenticity or originality of any of those movies.That's probably my biggest complaint about this movie is that there's nothing original about it at all. It's just a rehash of old clichés. Why there's even the cliché post-apocalyptic child, same archetype child as found in the Road Warrior, old Star Trek reruns (Bop!), or Aliens. I half expected her to say ... ""The Terminators mostly come out at night, mostly."" The 60 foot tall harvesters are right out of the movie War of the Worlds. Even the sounds they make are exactly the same as Spielberg's alien harvesters in War of the Worlds. The air battles in the canyons are played out. The terminator motorcycles are straight out of Road Warrior and in fact the entire high way sequence is straight out of Road warrior. The acceptance of Terminators as allies and even mentors for young would be resistance leaders (in this case, Kyle Reese) and not just enemies was already introduced in T2. The final sequences take place at an industrial plant and plays out exactly like the ending of T2. cough, cough, HACK! All the call backs to the original material in the form of ""i'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"" felt cheesy instead of inciting nerd nirvana like the call backs did in the recent Star Trek movie.Maybe my problem is that I've seen too many movies and my expectations are set a little high. Or maybe MCG is a hack and this movie should have been held to a higher standard. Nevertheless it feels like they're just cashing in on the Terminator name.Other franchises have been successfully rebooted such as Hulk, Batman and James Bond. I think in those cases, the source material needed a bit of freshness to appeal to modern audiences. This attempt at rebooting falls flat and lacks the fresh approach necessary to over shadow the source material. James Cameron casts a giant shadow. This movie plays out more like a made for TV sci-fi channel attempt at capitalizing on the franchise name instead of a true reboot of the franchise. Being a fan of the series, it was fun to see the T-600 walking around like zombies ineptly attempting to kill humans. But beyond serving up more endoskeleton murder machines walking around with ""crush, kill, destroy"" on their little tiny robot brains, this movie doesn't offer much.Characters: A bright spot among the acting was new comer Sam Worthington who plays Marcus Wright. We find out that Marcus Wright is a prototype cyborg used by Cyberdyne systems to infiltrate the human resistance. That is something I would have preferred to find out in the middle of the movie when it's revealed rather than in the TRAILER!!!!!!! Because really that's the only twist in this movie. Other bright spots are Moon Bloodgood who plays a fighter in the resistance and Anton Yelchin who plays Kyle Reese. All the other performances, including Christian Bale who seems to be phoning this one in with his Batman voice, fall flat.""Are you not entertained?"" A very qualified yes. It's not so much that I dislike this movie as I think it's forgettable. Really, once you've seen this movie, there won't be any scenes that you'll be talking about with your friends afterwards.If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...

Nice try,The movie isn't perfect. There are many flaws related to the plot or secondary characters development but the visuals and action are breathtaking. Very good CG and acting. This movie is far better than its reputation. Stands as a worthy sequel to me if you can accept what happened in rise of the machines. I had a very good time watching it. By far the best terminator film since judgement day.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I doubt they will be back........,"Not as bad as I was expecting it to be but certainly the worst TERMINATOR movie (yet). SALVATION has got the action, the chases and the explosions but one really couldn't care less about the characters with the women being the very worst (what was the point of bringing Jane Alexander out of retirement for a bland two minute role?). It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor, grab his shirt, throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators are too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon. No wonder the sense of excitement has pretty much gone from this series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator Salvation looks much more confident than 3 part,"Terminator Salvation has a good cast. And most importantly, he has a fresh look at the franchise. Personally, I liked the film, but it does not go into any comparison with the first 2 films of the franchise. But against the background of the last parts, Terminator Salvation looks much more confident.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Salvation for a franchise that didn't even know it needed it,"The terminator is back again! again. As the fourth entry in the franchise this film really packs a punch with it, albeit, in a completely different ways than previous entries.Whereas the first three films were small cast action films, Salvation is strictly a war movie. Aside from the same story as the it's predecessors TS shares almost no similarities to them. The largest of the differences would be the lack of Arny.The lack of Governator has actually been one of the main complaints about this movie, many feel it's not the same without him.Here's where I think many viewers are completely missing the point, keywords: the same. Being the same as the previous films was obviously completely beside the point, get with the program people. We had enough of Arny in T3, adding him in for a fourth time would be flogging a completely decomposed horse.Actually, I felt that TS really was the saving grace for this franchise. Another movie with the same layout as the first three would simply be a drop on the ""been there, done that"" bucket. Salvation really brought a series that was dangling over the edge back to firm ground.Of course, every film has it's not so great bits, this one really has all of them canned in one specific scene, the (already) infamous ""campfire scene"". For the sake of not spoiling anything I'm not going to say what happens, but as soon as you see something that remotely resembles a campfire just make a run for a bathroom break. Trust me, there's nothing there you didn't want to miss.Among a few other issues is the fact that this is not the same judgment day as depicted in the first three films. Whether this is a flaw will depend on the viewers connection to the previous films in the series.Whereas the opening of T2 painted a striking visual of the post-apocalyptic future, nightmarish and always battle-oriented. McG ops for a more realistic, dirty, gritty depiction of the future where it is not always nighttime and they are not consistently battling hordes of killer robots.In a surprising move for McG he actually does go deeper into the ruined future-world, where the sides are not nearly as black-and-white as would be thought. For a fourth film in a series and especially for the director of ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Salvation"" actually does carry much originality and depth to it, for this I give McG credit. I personally loved the interpretation and felt it had more ground than the haunting, yet non-practical version that James Cameron dreamed up (no offense to Cameron whatsoever).Unfortunately, much of the films bad press has come without a legitimate reason. Almost every detractor of this film that I have seen has essentially said ""It isn't the same as T2, this is a bad Terminator movie, it's more like Transformers"". To be honest, this is all crap. Terminator Salvation isn't a bad Terminator movie, it's simply different, and it most certainly is not like Transformers.Many people don't seem to understand this however, they think ""if it's not the same, it has to be bad"". This evaluation, however, fails to state how the film is actually bad. Instead I suggest going with a basis that respects this film as it's own without outside opinion from over-zealous fans.7/10 stars. If you haven't seen ""Star Trek"", watch that first, but make sure to give this a look if your a Terminator fan or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very well done....,"I was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie. I didn't want it to be too dark and bleak and depressing. I mean, it was somewhat dark, but there was hope at the end. It's not a mindless action movie. It's definitely an action movie - but a good story I thought. Very entertaining! The story was well done. The characters were great - especially Marcus. You felt what he felt. I think this movie deserves higher than a 6.9 - it's current rating (as of 12-9-09). If you're a fan of Terminator and T-2 - then see this. I did see T3 but was not impressed w/ it and cannot remember much about it (when something doesn't leave an impression, it's usually not that good) - in my humble opinion. I dunno - maybe I need to see it again. I really like Marcus in this movie. I won't give anything away - no spoiler here. Just watch this - you should like it. :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If Cameron were dead he would be spinning in his grave.,"Phenomenal special effects. CGI second to none. Good score. Great sound.If these are the reasons for you giving up your 10 bucks, then this is the movie for you.If, however, you enjoy those small luxuries, like a plot; solid performances; character to care about; and a point to it all, you may want to redirect your $10 to something else....anything else.Don't get me wrong...I am a major fan of the Terminator films. I know them inside and out. I genuinely love these movies (3 was tolerable), but this one is a travesty.The actors, (particularly Christian Bale) seem to be much more interested in appearing super-cool (very ""Matix-esque"") and striking a pose for the camera, than actually getting down and delivering convincing performances as people caught up in this future war. (No Oscar Schindler/Liam Neeson performances here.) The result is very card-board-cut-out characters that the audience can not connect with on any appreciable emotional level, which is a shame, considering how well Christian Bale can perform in other films.Also, the editing pace is way too frenetic at times. I's the new generation of film makers that believe if you can not keep the audience involved in the story or characters, throw a lot of images and sound at such an intense rate, essentially bombard them, that the audience will be convinced they got their dollar's worth.The film suffers on another level. There was so much anticipation for it's release, and figuring a good cast and the stamp of approval from Cameron's group that this should have turned out fairly decent. This could have been good Science-Fiction. Instead, we get a loud,obnoxious, mindless made-for-MTV video for the masses!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

so bad I had to register and comment,"Well were do I start. I have used IMDb as a reference for years but have never felt compelled to comment or vote on a film until now, I have just this minute registered to make this.How this movie at one point tipped the scales at 8.9 on IMDb is just... well... daft. It is now at 7.2 at the time of writing (As I am sure sane people like myself are beginning to vote, to pull this ridiculous score down).Even Terminator 3 which was fairly average takes a giant steaming turd on Terminator Salvations head in terms of quality / story / Characters... the list goes on. The ONLY thing this movie has going for it is the special effects which are very well done.The acting was just terrible... Christian Bale a major coupe? give me a break. His acting was just so wooden and laboured.The film started OK and actually looked like it was going to pull it off but then went rapidly downhill. The story just ignored the other films completely and quite frankly doesn't deserve to have the name Terminator anywhere near it.Future war? what future war? were are the armies of terminators firing pulse rifles and machines rolling over piles of human skulls? What we get instead are what look like Terminators but in actual fact they act like zombies chasing their targets. What happens when they catch the human they are after? I hear you ask... well instead of doing their job which is actually terminate them (excuse the pun) they decide to rough them up a bit by throwing them very hard off a metal post or across the floor then throw their guns away... then walk after them very slowly again, just giving them enough time to get up and run away again for another Benny Hill style chase.In the other movies the terminators were stone cold killers. You actually thought that if they caught John, Sarah or whoever then it was bam, dead instantly... quick snap of the neck, bullet to the head whatever. The T1000 didn't mess about, you got in his way you got a knife rammed through your torso without so much as a word uttered.Ill not be going anywhere near the cinema for the next films.

"Great special effects, good story and a conclusion to the series:  nice!","Given the harsh reviews that this film received from critics, I tried to keep an open mind. After the movie started, I began to think - hey, this is pretty good. It must really tank towards the end ... well, it didn't. It turned out to be a pretty good sci-fi flick from start to finish.One interesting thing about this movie is that there were two plots going on: one for the main character John Conner (Bale) and one for the Kyle Reese (Yelchin) - Conner's 'future' father in the earlier Terminator movies. That worked out fine. I enjoyed both story lines.The special effects were really great. There was a huge robot, superfast motorcycle bots as well as bizarre flying and underwater robot creatures. They were well conceived of and a lot of fun to watch. We even got to see Arnold Schwarzenegger again - even though it was all CGI. That was nostalgically cool.For all the negative critical sentiments there seem to be, I think this movie is a fine way to spend 2 hours. It has great effects, a good story and a conclusion to the Terminator movies. Who'd want to miss that? I recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
McTerminator,"OK, I've questioned some ratings before, but for the most part I usually just let it go very easily. But I'm curious, how in the world, no, universe, does Terminator Salvation get a rating above 7.0? This was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and I should've known better when I saw a director who's name is ""McG"" on the screen, James Cameron must be shuddering. This film had so much incredible potential but ended up turning into Action Film 101, I don't even think the title of the movie should have been Salvation, it should have been Terminator: Let's Blow *bleep* Up! The story was so beyond stupid, the effects are way over the top, they also were trying so hard to be liked by the fans that they stole every cool line from the first two terminator films, and what the F was up with Christian Bale bringing his Batman voice back into this movie?! Despite the confusing movie, I'll try to give you a clear enough summary.In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright to sign his body over for medical research following his execution by lethal injection. In 2018, John Connor leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted ""kill list"" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in four days' time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following Kyle Reese. Nobody realizes why they must keep Kyle safe but Conor knows that he must send Kyle back to save the future.Never have I ever wanted so badly to hurt a director before, I just couldn't believe this movie. Who was the main character? Who was I supposed to root for? Now I was 7 years old when I discovered the Terminator films, can't tell you how they changed my life, they were the reason I adore action movies to this day. But they were also more then action movies, they told incredible stories and were displayed on film in such an excellent way, I just can't tell you how wonderful the experience was. This was just agonizing, I mean, a retarded jellyfish could make a better movie then this. They kept going with a confusing story line to explain everything at the end and by that time I just didn't care. The actors, the story, the effects and setting of the film was just horrible, Terminator Salvation is a shameful movie and if was a person, should be shot.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good follow-up,"When I heard that the new Terminator movie was rated PG-13 in stead of R like the rest of them, I lost faith in it (changing the rating for a sequel never works...remember the Whole Ten Yards? Or the Fantastic Four sequel?). Then I remembered how corrupt the MPAA is, especially when it comes to big budget action movies, so my hopes rose. The truth is that Terminator Salvation is really no more violent than the last two films (once again calling into question the dubious practices of the MPAA. If you're worried about the sequel being ""neutered"" to allow the teenage audience to see it, fear not. You'll get what you paid for.That being said, ""Terminator Salvation"" is a good film despite the lower rating. There are moments of sheer suspense and a good few jump moments. That, and the story is actually pretty engaging. And, the acting is solid across the board as well.Unlike the previous features in the ""Terminator"" franchise, ""Terminator Salvation"" takes place strictly in the future, after Judgement Day. The world has plunged into darkness and humanity is losing the war against the machines. John Connor (Christian Bale) is the head of the resistance, as the previous films foreshadowed. But there is another character that comes into play. That is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), an amnesiac who carries a dark secret that could change everything.As promised, ""Terminator Salvation"" is darker and grittier than any of the previous installments. However, this is no ""Saving Private Ryan."" Director McG's goal is to create excitement in the audience, and the tone exists only to give the story an extra visceral punch. The visuals are desaturated to the point where everything is almost gray, yet again, ""depressing"" is not a word that anyone would use to describe the film.The acting is solid across the board. Christian Bale gives a terrific intensity to John Connor, and while unlike either Edward Furlong or Nick Stahl, his performance works (I suppose anyone would act different in a post-apocalyptic war as opposed to the early 90's or 2000's). Newcomer Sam Worthington is clearly a hopeful A-lister to producers (he's already in James Cameron's upcoming sci-fi epic ""Avatar""), and if he keeps up the work that he does here, I'll be willing to bet that the producers' gamble will pay off. He very nearly steals the movie from Bale (though his character is more central to the story than Bale's). Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard (even though her talents are wasted here), Anton Yelchin, Michael Ironside, and, in what could charitably be called a cameo, Helena Bonham Carter, are solid as well.The film's structure is similar to the previous films, but there are a few noticeable differences. Primarily, the film tells two stories at the same time: John Connor's and Marcus Wright's. Marcus's story is more compelling, and at least for the first hour, that's who the focus is on (Bale doesn't appear much during this time). These stories converge and intersect from time to time. They also shift focus between characters as the story requires. In another movie, this may seem like a flaw, but at least here, it works.Despite the perceived limitations, I enjoyed this film, and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Start.For A New Trilogy,"Yet again we see one more movie from the Terminator Franchise. Ever since the first Teaser Trailer for Salvation was launched, I had been excited for this movie. Recently there had been very big speculation with this particular Movie, especially by the Critics World. I was surprised to see this movie getting whacked so much by the critics at www.rottentomatoes.com I have seen this movie at last and I can say this Movie deserved much more than what it received at Rotten Tomatoes. There is no doubt Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the best among the series. But this movie was better than T3: Rise of Machines.When McG signed up for this movie I had been apprehensive because honestly, I hated Charlie's Angels. Terminator Salvation is a new beginning, so we should not compare with its predecessor. There is no time travel and of course no mission for hunting down the members of the Connors. High point of this movie is its action; it has been a long time since I had seen action like this. Special Effects incorporated are top notch. As far as character development is concerned there are some places where certain elements are missing. Considering this as the start of the trilogy this can be forgiven. I hope this will be dealt with other upcoming series. Columnists have complained that Christian Bale was cold as John Connor. I can say that when the central character has been subjected to so many years of war, we can always expect to hope for less sentiment as that happens in today's reality. Terminator Salvation gyrates round the Character of Marcus Wright (Very well portrayed by Sam Worthington) & Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). This movie was meant to be action oriented so as to show us the apocalyptic world post judgment day. Apart from the stunning cinematography Danny Elfman's music gives us an edgy metallic score.Since so many reviews have already given out the plot details of 'Salvation' I will not be writing it as it ruins the anticipation. Finished with that, closing notes will be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby'Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD. Expectantly it might give us some more details.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Salvation... not quite, but near.","Terminator and T 2 are really great iconic films, with a cult status and rightly so. Just brilliant. T 3, as most people agree, missed the spot. So a new dawn has arose, and with it comes Terminator Salvation. If you ask most people what they most remember from the films, it's going to be Arnie as the Terminating Cyborg. He had that role (as his ""acting"" style) down to a T as a cold robotic machine who was trying to understand human beings - and we related to him, we actually felt something for his character. We cared. There's nothing like that in T4. The plot is nonsensical and if you analyse it, you'll find lots of plot holes. HOWEVER - this isn't the kind of film you go to analyse right? It's a big budget, all out, action sci-fi flick, with lots of big bangs, explosions and great big evil machines. Great special effects and cool robots. That's the point, right? Not as good as Terminator 1 and 2 but better than 3. So grab some popcorn and enjoy!",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't understand the hate,"Genuinely, I don't understand the hate directed to this movie. On re-watching years later, it still stands up. Yes there are some clunky moments (e.g. Worthington screams too much, recycled Alien3 idea, Bloodgood turning the sexpot etc.), but overall, the story slots into the Terminator universe perfectly. It's actually the best attempt to restore the grittiness of the first movie. The new Terminator forms are interestingly creative. Bale is perfect as John Connor and portrays a leader you can believe in. I thought Bonham-Carter, in a small part, was standout. I think part of the problem is the unconventional narrative structure that follows Marcus's awakening for while before the threads are brought together - but the plot works. It's a sci-fi action film, with emphasis on the action.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast Food,"I have to agree with user ""siderite"", who states this as a ""decent"" film. Especially considering my concerns when I heard that McG would be at the helm. I know that there are quite a few people who liked his take on Charlies Angels, but I thought the movies were ... bad and not in a good sense!But he himself said, that he evolved, plus Christian Bale was set to star in this movie. Apart from the fact, that the real main ""man"" here is Sam Worthington (he is really great and you almost wish he played the John Connor part), Christian Bale lacks any kind of charisma. His John Connor only really is gripping, when he talks over a radio/communication thing. Other than that, you would be forgiven for doubting the whole Connor ""myth"" (see previous movies, if you haven't) that revolves around his person.Other characters that stay in your memory, is Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin (who also had a role in the J.J. Abrams reinvention of Star Trek. He really holds his own and he has too, considering the role he's playing ...Back to Bale, who had a real bad issue with the camera man (you can find an audio sample of that on the internet, maybe even here on IMDb?), where he kept swearing. If he only brought the energy he used when ""assaulting"" (verbally) the DP, it would have helped the movie. But with his rough dark voice, he almost seems like a caricature of his Batman role. It's a shame, but if this and Public Enemies are the movies you see him first, you might get the impression, this isn't really a good actor. But he has proved, that he can act. 2009 just wasn't his year.The movie itself is a nice fun ride, fans should be pleased (more or less).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Terminator: The Scooby Dooby DOO version!,"The Terminator series, from T3, the TV show and this new one, would be best described as a ""loosely based alternate reality where different things take place than what the director and writer intended years ago, and would make no sense if you pieced them together using your sisters doll house for props"". Quotes my own.This I figured out within minutes of seeing T3. The John Connor we saw was not the same John from the 2nd. And this new Connor isn't the same from ANY of them, not that we saw much of him from the future in the first place. After T3, I stopped thinking and instead did what a lot of people should do... shut up and enjoy the big pretty flashes of light and the BOOM! Crash! sounds.This new Terminator takes place in the future rather then the present. Christian Bale, who plays Connor, was originally slated for Marcus, a much better role. Bale wanted to play Connor, and in the end, gets a less exciting part to play. Bryce Dallas Howard has little to do here. Her part could have been omitted and no one would have noticed. Everyone else is OK.There's nothing really unpredictable about what is going to happen. Good guys go after bad guys, bad guys look like they are winning, good guys make a better plan. Oh, I can also go into the bad loopholes and tell you that these supposedly hard-to-kill terminators don't know how to kill humans very well, or how security at Skynet is a joke. I laughed at the FM radios used for communication. Yeah. Like Skynet isn't going to catch us on THAT. OH, and the time travel thing. It's not in the movie, so we have to assume it hasn't been invented yet, so HOW can Skynet know the significance of one Kyle Reese? But I won't go into that. Most any sci-fi is going to have these, and sequels have them plenty. None of that compares than placing McG in charge here, director of such fine award-winning pieces like Charlie's Angels 1 and 2. When the fight broke out between Bale and the cinematographer during a scene, McG said he didn't see it. Where was he? Was he clicking through his Scooby-Doo Viewfinder? And the writers? They wrote Catwoman. And just like that, 1000 people decided not to watch Terminator Salvation after checking that fact.But seriously, forget all that. I'm making it sound like it's a bad movie or something. Nah. It's exactly what I want to see in a summer blockbuster. New types of terminators, a few good fights, a great helicopter scene in the beginning, and even Ah-Nuld. It won't even get you in trouble with your mom, it's PG-13ized!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't listen to the false critics,"Terminator Salvation delivers an exhilarating post-apocalyptic experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With impressive visual effects and intense action sequences, this installment in the Terminator franchise offers a thrilling ride from start to finish. Christian Bale delivers a commanding performance as John Connor, showcasing his resilience and determination in the face of an AI-controlled world. The film successfully captures the gritty and desperate atmosphere of a war-torn future, immersing viewers in a visually stunning and immersive landscape. The addition of Sam Worthington's character, Marcus Wright, brings an intriguing and complex dynamic to the story, adding depth to the narrative. The action scenes are skillfully executed, providing a satisfying blend of high-octane moments and strategic battles against the menacing machines. Terminator Salvation is a worthy continuation of the franchise, appealing to fans of the series and action enthusiasts alike. It's an enjoyable experience that keeps the adrenaline pumping and leaves you eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Terminator saga.The critics obviously shat on this movie with many people taking their word at face value and to be objectively true and I have a theory for it

Low expectations = a better film,"I can't believe the press about this film, it's really not that bad at all. Obviously it's not going to be as good as the first two films - they were two of the most spectacular and best sci-fi/action movies of all time - but by the time you get to the forth film in a franchise what do you expect? One thing all the bad press has done is lowered our expectations so much this actually comes out as a good movie. I guess it's to do with all the hype surrounding the making of it. People have been really hard on Christian Bale and he really isn't that bad at all here, and like another reviewer said; his on-set out burst is understandable when you see the character he was playing.It's a dirty gritty film. It tries to give us what Terminator 2 only showed us for a few seconds - the war between humans and the machines they created - and it does an okay job. Personally I think it could have been a bit darker but it wasn't at all bad and certainly a lot better than the comicesque sunshine of Terminator 3 (this film should have been T3). It gives us a wide variety of terminators and even a digitalised Arnie that was so life-like I had to check the cast listing - small terminators, huge Titan like terminators, flying terminator aeroplanes, motorbike terminators, terminators with massive chins, and even terminator fish!! The only thing this film doesn't give us, which is what I personally wanted to see, was thousands of terminators all together marching en masse.Yeah the plot-line has holes. It had me pondering on the point of it for a while (what so J Conner has to save Reese who has to go back in time to save J Conner who when he grows up has to save Reese who has to go back in time to... so what would happen if we just removed these two people... ahh... OK I understand...) but f**k it... it's an action film, and it's good solid science fiction.Surely the best film by a pretentious and ridiculously named director ever.. I just hope he either stops making films after this or starts using a proper name... Thanks.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great re-launch of the series,"I cannot understand the bad press at all, after watching this twice its hard to see any truly major flaws in what is a brilliant story driven action movie featuring all the hallmarks of the original two but adding its own great flavor the series.I won't go into spoilers but generally thee is a great cast at work here, Christian Bale didn't convince me in the trailers but in the film itself he's a competent John Connor, well rounded and flawed but showing the side of him that inspires people. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese here, another recurring character and really sells himself in the role, reminding the audience much of Michael Biehn. However Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a new character to the series, almost steals the show providing a real hero for the film whom like Bale is well rounded and drives the plot with enough humanity that we understand what separates us from the machines.This is the underlying theme of all the Terminator films and it really gains ground here with the destructive war showing the real horror of the Terminators in all their various forms and a shocking surprise at the end providing a great insight into how intricately a killer mastermind Skynet really is, as well as providing a real highlight for long term fans. The style serves all this well, with thrilling and well realized action scenes orchestrated beautifully by Mcg and the design of the machines themselves often being quite creepy, with an unsettling side to their metal skulls and glowing eyes, they really are portrayed well, giving a sense of how cold and calculating they are. Some really intense scenes early on set the tone for the entire movie and provide my favorite movie of the summer.For long term fans of the series, the next two films in this planned trilogy will likely decide how worth the wait this installment was but ultimately it has set the stage for what could be a brilliant close to the series and finally showing us the war we've been waiting for. McG deserves the chance to make the next two because here he has managed to re-launch a once great series on the verge of decay. Now its alive and stronger than ever, with the story we all really wanted since we saw the first film. Go see it now, its worth your time.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie is underrated,"I know a lot of people say this movie is bad. Just because it had a cgi schwarzenegger in it for like- 30 seconds DOES NOT make it bad!!! I personally wish they would have started a new trilogy after this one. It would have been a PERFECT move for the franchise. It starts a little slow, but other than that i think its a great movie! It's something i'd watch on multiple occasions (that's if i haven't seen it in a few months or so or when i'm bored) and i've seen it twice already and i enjoyed it both times.

A stale action film that happens to involve characters from The Terminator series,"This sorry excuse of a film does nothing to add to the Terminator franchise. The editing is choppy, the story is diluted and the characters are about as wooden as Howdy Doody (except less entertaining) This film is simply another cash cow to lure happy consumers to something familiar rather than banking on original ideas. They should have used the budget to focus more on story, mood and character development rather than fancy special effects and Christian Bale's salary. The tone of the terminators used in this movie do no illicit any type of horror or suspense but are used merely for props so Christian Bale can yell at everyone for not getting his way.

A Good Film For A Rainy Day,"The year is 2018.Judgment Day has come and gone, leveling modern civilization. An army of Terminators roams the post-apocalyptic landscape, killing or collecting humans where they hide in the desolate cities and deserts. But small groups of survivors have organized into a Resistance, hiding in underground bunkers and striking when they can against an enemy force that vastly outnumbers them.Controlling the Terminators is the artificial intelligence network Skynet, which became self-aware 14 years earlier and, in the blink of an eye, turned on its creators, unleashing nuclear annihilation on an unsuspecting world.Only one man saw Judgment Day coming. One man, whose destiny has always been intertwined with the fate of human existence: John Connor (Christian Bale).Now the world is on the brink of the future that Connor has been warned about all his life. But something totally new has shaken his belief that humanity stands a chance of winning this war: the appearance of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a stranger from the past whose last memory is of being on death row before awakening in this strange, new world.Connor must decide whether Marcus can be trusted. But as Skynet adapts new strategies to end the Resistance forever, Connor and Marcus must find common ground to take a stand against the onslaught—to infiltrate Skynet and meet the enemy head-on.

"If T3 let you down TS can help - If T2's your standard, well.....","Spoiler Free ReviewSome would wonder why I gave Terminator Salvation 9 stars if I'm already suggesting it's ""No T2"". The answer is simple: I judge franchise sequels not just as stand-alone films, but more importantly how they fit into the franchise, and how they affect it going forward. On these two fronts Terminator Salvation excels.I have always loved the original Terminator. I really loved T2 as well, but the fact is T2 is Sci-Fi/Action/Adventure/Drama. There were even plenty of humorous parts.The Terminator, the original, was Sci-Fi/Action, bordering on Sci-Fi/Horror. The idea of machines that never tire and never stop pursuing you, that can kill 50 people to get to you, where ever you are..... that's just plain scary, and in my opinion doesn't leave a lot of room to laugh. My best nightmares feature pursuers like that. Much more thrilling than anything this life has offered so far.Salvation removes most of the humor and makes the future, and these bad-ass killing machines a little more gritty and unrelenting. Not much time to laugh when death is always approaching. I for one like it better that way.Many will say this installment doesn't live up to the 1st and 2nd. (forget the 3rd, who's only good scene came at the end - at least the writers had the balls to let Judgement Day happen) I would agree, in some respects. This doesn't have the ""almost-whole family appeal"" of T2, or this human-core of Sarah Connor running for her life in the original. As a matter of fact, other than a few touching moments you could definitely say this one's colder, but again - I would expect nothing but cold and pain, fear and desperation in a future that has humans at war with sentient machines. Even the sound of it. War with Machines. Too awesome.Bring on the Apocalypse!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great visuals, some casting and script issues, but the themes are expanded","I am a terminator fan. I expected T3 to be worth something but it wasn't. TS looked alright form the previews, but the first watch disappointed me.HOWEVER, I had a chance to see it again, and I was amazed. TS visually captured the symbiotic relationship between john conner and the machines. If you think about T1 and T2, the question of whether or not the machines would exist if it hadn't been for the leftover chip and arm from one comes up. It becomes chicken/egg debate.Where TS shines is illuminating the fact that the machines and the resistance/john conner, cannot exist without each other. Blurring the lines of where humanity ends and the machine begins.If you a Cameron fan, then McG will fall short. He uses too much dialogue to develop characters, where Cameron would have kept it lean, and used visuals to illuminate his.So, if you can get past Common, Yelchin, and some stupid lines, then the movie becomes a moderately good. It touches on canon, while looking to expand it.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Effects driven sequel destroying originality,"John Connor (Bale) attempts to bring Skynet down through a hidden signal whilst Marcus Wright (Worthington) causes their foundation trouble.6 years since the release of the critically slammed Terminator 3 and the story was in jeopardy and although the Sarah Connor chronicles regenerated interest the offing of a fourth was always inevitable, but as a franchise maker or a story reboot. From the evidence, it seems, certainly released in the summer and starring big Hollywood names, made for complete profit and once again, the brilliance of Cameron's original ideas sadly comes crashing down.Not that it seems that way when the film opens. Sam Worthington's character is sat in a prison cell with a brilliantly miserable Helena Bonham Carter and as the film moves forward there is anticipation to what Marcus is going in for.As the film shifts to present day warfare between man and machines, year 2018, we get out first glimpse of the new John Connor. Adopting a Cameron technique the camera pans from feet to head as Connor gets off a plane and mounts a carefully manned scheme to investigate their surroundings with humans stored underground. The shaky camera style adds some wonderful realism, giving that edge of excitement and unknowing to proceedings and it seemed McG had hit the nail on the head, and yet after this first initial stage, all becomes irrelevant as the film cascades into mediocre popcorn triviality.Such as when this particular scene ends you will notice there is nothing but high stakes action junkie sequences along with a plot that, come the end, has not moved anything forward at all. Honestly if you have not watched this film yet you will hardly believe that practically 80% of this 2009 release has action orientation. There are big robots that shoot bikes out of their legs (no that's not a joke) there are squid monsters (why would humans build them?) there is slight continuity in the flying ship things and the treadmill style robots from T3 but, why? The first film blossomed on its usage of simple T101 models and whilst there was an explanation in the second film it didn't feel the need to glorify itself on special effects to demonstrate the size of its gigabyte hard-drive.There is little meaning in the plot aside from the action as the resistance continue to find a solution to the finale of the war but all the dialogue seems to build towards something and as it turns out there is a consequence and it all blows into a ridiculous conclusion that given all the action and scientific futuristic elements, comes down all humane and dramatic on us, expecting us to shed tears and sympathise with a Connor who is more Dark Knight than human's war leader and a trivial inevitable love fling that is inevitable and somehow ridiculous.Through all its, albeit impressive, visuals there is an underlining story of attempted survival that feels inadequate and repetitive.Personally, I feel the Terminator should have ended in 1991 but as long as we have computers and machines, there will be many more.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Real fans of the franchise will find this installment exhilarating.,"Excellent performances by Bale and Worthington, as well as excellent sound design, and visual effects. The narrative, like all great narratives, is simple and to the point. Terminator Salvation expands the Terminator mythology, asks interesting questions about the machine/human dichotomy, and gives us an entertaining picture of a post-apocalyptic world ruled by robots. As for those critics who have said this movie isn't ""fun enough,"" or that it is ""too dark,"" I can only guess that they were not real fans of the original. After all, it is not like 1984's The Terminator was a comedy!! Anyways, highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator in the future,"When they announced this sequel, I was so excited! I loved Terminator 1 and 2. I even liked 3, but it was nowhere near the level of the others. Still fun, moved the story along, a great ending with judgment day finally happening.My excitement grew even more learning that it was set in the future with people like Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Conrad Buff, Shane Hurlbut, and others helping out. McG was an interesting choice, wasn't too confident about him. Watching the behind the scenes, gave me a little more confidence in him because of his huge passion for the movie.I finally got to watch the movie and I was conflicted. I loved that it was set in 2018 because it was the future but not the one we were used to. T600s were more popular. There were a few new Terminators in this one that really increased the threat for the remaining humans: hydrobots, aerostats, mototerminators, harvesters. The look and design of this movie was fantastic. I loved the silver tint, the sets, the terminators, the costumes. The action was pretty wild! Connor and co invading the Skynet base in the beginning and the Harvester/mototerminators sequence rocked.The acting ranged from really good to decent. Anton Yelchin was a fantastic Kyle Reese! I really believed that he was a younger version of Michael Biehn's famous character. Sam Worthington was mysterious, tough, sympathetic, awesome! Wished we knew more about him. Christian Bale was a hardcore John Connor. Definitely a different version than the past few but I liked him. The scene where he sees the prisoners and the speech about his mother (Director's cut) showed his humanity. I also cared when he got tossed around by the Terminator at the end. His voice was similar to Batman's but that didn't bother me that much. Bryce did a pretty good job as Kate but her role wasn't big enough. Her pregnancy was also never addressed, not a good idea. Moon Bloodgood was a tough gal but her acting wasn't really that amazing and her romance with Marcus was silly. There were some sweet nods to the older films that I liked, including a cameo by a cgi/body double Arnold that was pretty neat. Surprise, Helen Bonham Carter was in this and no Tim Burton! She is always wonderful.Now, this movie was set during the brink, but I never really got a feel for how desperate things were. Not enough suffering and death, especially in the camps. The way Kyle described it was way more intense and scary. There also wasn't enough Resistance vs. Skynet battles. I wished they provided more info on Marcus, addressed Kate's pregnancy, explained how Skynet knew about Kyle Reese, better writing/acting. The score wasn't so bad I thought, considering Danny Elfman scored it. That's not a dig at Danny, just never thought his style would have worked for this kind of movie. Interesting ending, though not the one they originally planned.I liked Terminator Salvation, the idea/concept, and most of the execution. Some things weren't that great, could have been better, more explanation, maybe some scenes bringing us up to speed from when Judgment day happened and all these years later, but this was a welcome addition for me as it changed up the formula and the setting. I hope the next two planned sequels can improve on this one. Bring on the future war but don't forget about the characters!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More Baseless Then A Video Game And Less Involving Then One,"Terminator Salvation was actually a movie I was looking forward to see. Then I read who the director was, McG and I dropped any idea of this movie being spectacular on any level. Still that left me hope of some mediocrity and a clichéd but yet for the most part fun ride. Well trust me you will get all of that except the fun or even the ride, and that was me in the movie theatres.The film was hardly ever engaging, yet they were some great elements to the film. Such as the visual and sound effects along with the music, that is probably about it. Then came all the problems, and the most glaring one was Christian Bale. Not only was he a disappointment but he wasn't did not even give the best performance in the film nor even the second best. His performance was incredibly dry in a way that you would have never thought the character he was playing, John Connor, had made his first appearance in a film. Of course this is not true with the first three Terminator films but Bale in no way makes you think the latter instead. With Bale setting the bar so low it was a surprise to actually see Sam Worthington, a virtual unknown to most, have a some what fascinating performance as well as that of Anton Yelchin. Even with these characters do we ever get the feeling of caring about them? That answer is an easy not. There was an opportunity to possibly do so but as the movie winded down, more screen time was given to the ""star"" in Christian Bale and the film was at the point were wouldn't careless about what really happens to him.If you have seen any of McG's movies you will know from the opening minutes this film follows along the same sort of line as his past films. During moments of his movies you wonder if you're even watching the same movie you started out with and that is by no means a good thing. Its as if scenes are stolen straight out of other movies that have been successful and rolled together to make a movie that barely surpasses that of cable TV movie that would premiere at 3 am. Even with that his movies usually have some sort of a point, no matter how corny or clichéd the ride was to take us there.So who is to blame then? That only leaves the screenwriters left who I bare no compassion for, mind you these are the same pair of writers that brought us Catwoman. Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato are their names and considering their extended history of mostly co-screen writing movies this shouldn't come as much as a surprise. If there is anyone looking for salvation, it is not the humans of John Connor's world but the screenwriters of our world that helped create this.Obviously I would not recommend this debacle of a film. Nevertheless there is still something to take out of this film; before ever watching a film, don't look at the cast, not even the director (which if you remember was the mistake I made), at least not at first. Make sure you take a peak at who the writer is even if it is an action film. This is assuming you are interested in seeing a movie that has something which is at least on the verge of containing a real plot or on the realm being a credible film.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

To be Determined-ated,"It gives you the fight you expect to see i.e. humans versus machines and throws in a decent premise too. I also like Christian Bale and Sam Worthington which helps it all go down nice and smooth. In this movie, the machines go all out on using their intelligence to serve themselves and survive but you know how unpredictable humans can be. The machine find this out the hard way and the story continues. It is interesting to note that there is a sort of stalemate in general between us and the machines which helps to make the time travel plan of attack make sense. Get them before they are born rather than go mano de mano is the machines thinking. Of course humans realize this and we get the series as their ongoing response to this. I was captured to the plot, followed it and it led to a decent conclusion one comes to expect from this series. Recommend a tasty drink and snack while watching and certainly the popcorn is a nice use of hands and fingers instead of biting them and fidgeting around.

Fan of T1 and T2 and LOVED this one!!,"This goes closer to the original Terminator than any of the others do which is only a good thing. It has a kind of darker Mad Max feel to it by showing how pockets of people around the world survived judgement day and are now facing the struggle of survival against nature and most importantly SkyNet.The contemporary sharp cinematography is in the direction of Transformers and War of The Worlds with a bit of matrix in there for boot. Christian Bale brings a lot of credibility to the role of John Conner but surprisingly isn't the main focal point of the film. I would've liked to have seen him more in it. The rest of casting was pretty good with some good performances.It contains a lot of nods to the other Terminator films (except perhaps T3 but the less said about that the better), but keeps it's own individual identity as a brilliant Action Film following in great footsteps.

"Just watched it on Bluray, and I have to say... it isn't so bad after all","The only reason why this film did not earn the extra 3 stars, in my opinion, is solely because of the screenplay and the leaked ending. When the dialogue was in play, it wasn't cheesy- which is hard to do. But there just WASN'T ENOUGH! Everybody was/is criticizing McG on his work. And I should admit that I did too. But watching the Director's cut, I really do have to admit that McG did a tremendous job with what he was working with. The visuals of TS are just phenomenal-- he successfully captures a world destroyed by nuclear war and on the brink of losing its humanity. However, he could only do so much with the script he is handed. I say: give him a script penned by, say, James Cameron, Chris/Jon Nolan, Michael Mann, or whoever else that isn't B-class and McG could create an outstanding film.Additionally, the ending. Yes it was corny only because people ruined it for the writers and director. I, as a hardcore Terminator fan, would have loved it for its irony. The leaked ending was that Marcus wore dead John Connor's skin, and the Resistance went on thinking it was Marcus who died and not John. Marcus- unaware of Kyle being John's father- would have raised Kyle like his younger brother, grooming him to be a good fighter. Kyle would have admired him as his role model. Hence, Marcus/John's skin sends his right hand man back through time to save John Connor's mother. This would have been perfect, yet the leaker ruined it for us fans. I also truly believe that McG and better writers could have SUCCESSFULLY turned this story from John Connor's prophecized leadership to Marcus' true role in the war against the machines. But when it comes down do it, his bosses (producers) hired mediocre writers and were not keen enough on securing information. It is really evident that McG does have a passion for the Terminator franchise.Sound- superb. Plot- like I said, kind of slow with lack of dialogue, and some parts in the story heavily relied on coincidence and chance.Blame the producers and writers, not the visual artist. Rehire McG but hire somebody who will give him something worth his salt.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good Movie but  not a Terminator sequel...,"I'm a big fan of Terminator and have watched all the T1 to T3 and also have them on my DVD collection. I think the essence of the Terminator series is how some inferior creature (and robot) being chased and hunted by a very superior indestructible killing machine(s) and survived. Along this plot, there are some mind-blowing action, explosion, sacrifice, drama, heroes, moral values, etc which push the audience stays in their seat till end of the film.The T3 was weaker than the T1 and T2 but still follow this plot. However, the T4 has a new plot : it's an open war, not a chase/hunting scenes. A war in the future between two races. If we replace all the character's name in this film, then it's hard to link this film to previous 'T' series.However, I didn't say it's a a bad movie. I think McG has tried his best, but the script is not powerful enough to fuel this film. Some scenes like John listening to his mom's tape or the ""I'll be back"" scene does not make me feel that this is a sequel.So, I give 7/10 since it's a nice action movie. That's all.

It was as bad as we expected,"It was a piece of trash. Bad directing, bad editing and bland story. Acting was like a stage play, and scenes were cut and faded at the wrong times.

Overall it was a weak attempt by a horrible director at making another installment in what is now a dead franchise. Its just being milked and milked. The Terminator franchise has been Terminated. There was no character development and by far Sam Worthington gave the best performance. All the CGI in the world couldn't save this pre-destined failure. The theme, ""This isn't the future my mother warned me about"" is painfully true, as the events of this film have drastically changed the future you know about. Overall 2 out of 4 Stars.

This movie is a 12 episode series stuffed into one movie. You should never stuff 12 pounds of story into a 3 pound bag!,"So, I want to apologize because I hated this movie so hard when it came out. Today I am more accepting of it.On the other hand, the story is so confusing, everything is so stuffed and no breathing time.I think the writers found a discarded Terminator series from a good writer or stolen from them and said: we can't make 12 great episode, we are going to stuff it all into one movie.The robots convey fear but it does so right in your face with words instead of actions.The terminators should not speak human language. They should only use it when speaking with humans and it should only be in the most mechanical way possible, no emotions, no feelings.This movie tries so desperately to set up sequels before it even introduced its characters.It didn't Bomb because Arnold was not in it. It bombed because the writing room was full of beginner writers. No one to take the lead, no one to tell them: this isn't fanfiction or Terminator 2. You all have to see Terminator 1 AND ONLY comics about terminator 1.Once you hit lightning in a bottle, then you can say: let's write sequels...The story is nice but everyone is stupid. John Connor is so stupid in this movie. He makes the worst decisions and this guy is meant to lead humanity against a war with machines made for war?!You had the legendary, veteran acting of Christopher Bale and this is what you make of it?!People tell me that this movie had potential. I say that that potential ended the moment it came to real writing.I would say: if you have never seen a Terminator movie then you can enjoy this movie. As a fan of Terminator movies this movie is: too crowded, too talkative, too complicated, too fast. It's a whole Netflix series in one movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not great,"At last we have the long anticipated fourth installment of the ""Terminator"" franchise. Has it been worth the wait? The answer to that question is one part ""yes"", and one part ""well..maybe"". This one is set after the nuclear war at the end of T3, in the year 2018 to be exact, and the war between humans and the Skynet computer system is going at full-tilt.There are several different plot lines that don't really come together until the film's third act. The first centers on resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale), who is involved in planning a major offensive against the machines but is also confronted by the dilemma of how to save the humans held prisoner at the Skynet facility that is to be his target. The second plot line centers on the mysterious Marcus Wright (Sam Robinson) and his journey from the ruins of Los Angeles to the HQ where Connor is based. The third plot introduces us to the teenage Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn's character from the first film) and his adventures with and without Wright. Finally, there is a half-developed love story between Wright and a pilot for the resistance played by Moon Bloodgood.It is no surprise that the action scenes are what consistently work best in this film, particularly in the first hour and in the climactic battle. Some of the chase scenes are simply breathtakingly exciting and the various machines that the characters have to battle are just awesome. The bleak post-nuclear landscape is strikingly depicted also. The middle part of the film sags quite badly however and the love story between Wright and Bloodgood seems forced and an obstacle to the progress of the bigger plot (which is pretty good otherwise). Another problem is that both Bale and Robinson bring a curious lack of charisma to their characters. It's hard to care about them and they both lack some of the humanity and vulnerability that made the previous films so exciting. All in all, this is a great popcorn movie and well worth seeing on the big screen. However it does not capture quite the same oomph that characterized it's predecessors.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good enjoyable movie,"Terminator Salvation is the 4th episode of the Terminator Franchise. It starts where Rise of the Machines ended and continues the story a couple of years later.The story is just like the last part kind of obvious and in no way original.

The main reason why i liked this movie was out of curiosity, i wanted to see what the robots from the future looked like and how they operated, the movie does a great job at doing this.I can recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in seeing an enjoyable action movie with good special effects.

Sam Worthington's dark portrayal of Marcus Wright draws very deep and unsettling questions about humanity as a whole, and in the end I feel that many people couldn't appreciate the emotional plot depth of the film.The atmosphere - standard post-apoc washed out grey - is very nice, even if it's a bit overdone; though I can understand how a future where humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction and is mercilessly hunted by machine overlords wouldn't be all that vibrant.While I felt that the plot of the film was its strongest suit - as it should be - the action in the film left absolutely nothing to be desired. It was tense, pulse-pounding, and virtually bled masculine military procedure, which I'm a huge fan of.All in all, I saw the film before it received all of this negative press, and I'm completely dumbfounded at why this excellent film, worthy of being a sequel to the Terminator franchise, has been snubbed on such a ridiculous level. I hope the poor critical reception doesn't completely kill the possibility of McG producing another sequel some time in the future!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
i was prepared to hate it,"this movie was better than i'd hoped or expected.but it's not really a Terminator movie.it's bleak vision of the future,interspersed with explosions and action sequences.i will admit that they really did a convincing job of showing a future with little to no hope.and the action sequences are not bad,although there's one sequence which belongs in a transformers movie,and was really out of place.it was close to unintentional comedy.and it's the only thing approaching comedy in the movie.there are no humorous moments at all,which drag the movie down.i also found it too long and there were a bit too many loud bombastic moments for my taste.as well there are two scenes which were so obviously on a sound stage,which took me right out of the movie.Christian Bale also seems to be channeling his gravel in the mouth batman persona from The Dark Knight.that was annoying to no end.but despite all this,i still liked the movie.the acting was good,and i liked the story.plus,i was prepared to hate it and didn't.anyway,somehow,the rating that comes to mind is 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is time travel possible to wipe this movie from existence?,"In continuing the Hollywood trend of destroying once highly regarded film franchises (Aliens, Predator, the Star Wars films), Terminator: Salvation is a muddled, incoherent, illogical disaster of a movie. Besides actually negating plot points established in the previous films, T:S goes even a step further by draining all that was original in them, like a creative siphon. While the film's flaws are too many to list in such a limited space, the plot holes and ill-conceived story devices alone warrant the rating:How do the machines know Kyle Reese is John's father?Why do machines of such advanced intelligence have a headquarters? Wouldn't they exist without a central physical presence in the world, like the internet? Why do they need key pads on their doors?What's the point of 9 foot tall Terminators? The entire idea of a human looking cyborg is for an undetectable killing machine.In the first Terminator films, humanity is presented as surviving like rats, since machines have the surface of the world conquered. Yet here we see military bases in broad daylight....why can't the machines hit these bases with everything they have?Again, if these machines are so advanced, why can't they detect simple radio waves like John Connor uses to send messages?There are far more holes than this, but upon reflection, these were the most glaring. The only positive aspect of the film were the solid visual effects, by the consistently strong ILM. This a film that never should have been made in the first place, and definitely not by such a hack director as McG.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the train wreck the critics would have you believe but not without its fair share of faults.,"Terminator Salvation is not a bad movie. Our nations top critics would have you believe so but having seen the film for myself I'm glad to report otherwise. On the other hand, Terminator Salvation is not a great movie either. In other words, it occupies a gray middle ground between the two. it is a film that certainly has its very fine moments as well as some faults.Let's start with the good. Regardless of what you think of the film's director McG, you cannot deny the man's ability to depict on screen action. The action scenes and special effects are some of the best I've seen, as he really knows what he's doing behind the camera when the time comes to thrill the audience. This alone warrants enough reason to see this movie in theaters. You'll know what I'm talking about once you see it. Anton Yelchin steals the show as Kyle Reese. He delivers the best performance in the film by far. This kid is the real deal and barring some unforeseen tragedy, he will be a big, big star in the near future. The film's pace is brisk, as McG keeps the plot moving at a nice clip. This, though, acts both as a gift and a curse. More on the pace in a minute.Unfortunately, my praise for this film pretty much ends there. Bale is not half bad as the hero John Connor. At times his performance feels somewhat flat but I think that this may have been a premeditated choice on his part to depict Connor as war weary. He's not bad in this role as critics would have you believe. The other film's characters unfortunately lack depth. They were very thinly written and one dimensional. And this is where the film's main problems lie. The script feels half baked. The story presented here isn't half bad, it's just that it seems rushed. A revision or two would have probably helped to flesh out the story and characters more. And lastly, there's the pace. As I mentioned earlier, the film moves along at a nice clip. You'll never be bored. The fault I find with this is that is that the filmmakers never stop to smell the roses. They'll never let the points their trying to make resonate for a minute because before you know it there's another chase or another Terminator will present itself and try to kill everyone. And as a result the film lacks the emotional depth that was ever so present in T2 and even a bit in T3. Some will say that I'm nitpicking here but I'd rather watch a movie that depicts great action AND makes me think rather than a movie that just has great action scenes. The last five minutes of the film are lacking as well. Simply a weak ending.All in all though, I enjoyed this movie. I had a good time and was able to live with the film's faults because the action scenes were that good. If only McG had demanded a better script from the film's writers we could have had a truly epic Terminator film. Instead we've only been presented with a somewhat good Terminator movie. Fun to watch but about as deep as a puddle. Here's hoping McG gets to take another crack at this franchise because he shows some real promise here. Next time though, I hope he has the good sense to demand a better screenplay.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The action sequences are great, even if the film isn't","Most seem to have found this a disappointment, but personally, among the big three action flicks that have been released so far this summer (the other ones being Wolverine and Star Trek), it is the one I enjoyed most. Okay, obviously it's better than Wolverine. Anything would be. I can't really argue that Terminator Salvation is a better movie than Star Trek. It's enormously flawed in its writing, and the lead actor, Christian Bale, is every bit as terrible as Chris Pine was in Star Trek. Yeah, I hate Bale. I have since Batman Begins, and he is definitely a hindrance to my enjoyment of any movie he's in. But the highs in TS are far higher than the test-marketed-to-death Star Trek. First off, I should say that I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic sci-fi. This film takes place in the future, after Judgement Day but before John Connor has become the great leader he is destined to become. He is now a lieutenant. After a battle, from an underground base Connor has attacked arises a disoriented man named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). The last thing he remembers is being executed for murder in 2003. He doesn't know why he's alive (though it's pretty obvious, especially if you've seen the commercials). Wright wanders into the destroyed city of Los Angeles and meets up with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, who was also Chekov in Star Trek and will definitely be a huge star). Reese, of course, is the man Connor will send back in time to protect his mother from the terminator in the original film. He has not yet met up with Connor, who is himself looking for Kyle (remember the tape that Sarah Connor was making at the end of the first movie). That's the set-up anyway. Not that there're many surprises as the film goes on, but it's not a bad story for the most part. It does get bad in its logic, though, sometimes. The final sequences are just stupid. However, the action sequences are generally fantastic. I loved the scene with the gigantic, laser-wielding bot. This is certainly not a must-see, but it's not the embarrassment that many are making it out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Bad .. But Badly miss Arnie,"Let me start by telling you that this is a well directed film , sadly it deserves much more than what critics rate ! This film is below par compared to T1 & T2 but far better than T3 .. What's most disappointing is that this film had a lot of potential and Mcg had everything needed to recreate the magic , he had the right cast and a huge budget to work with , yet he messed up ! He's no James Cameroon but i'll tell you , the reason why he failed is because he tried too hard !Background scores were a let down , the legendary spine chilling music is limited to the credits of the film ! The robots look weaker than they ought to be and the Resistance seemed dumber than they should be ! Christian Bale's talent was wasted , and he had almost no scope to perform , but seriously dude what's with the Batman voice , snap out of it ! The plot is simple enough to understand , you'd always know what'll happen next!Well coming to the film , the first half drags and the second half is much better ! What this film really misses is good old Arnie chasing the bad guys ! My favourite part is the short 3 minute appearance of the animated Arnie(T-800) ,it lit the whole theater on fire ! If you are in mood for watching huge robots kicking ass , then u'd love it! My verdict is its Worth watching once !!! 7/10 !",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is Sam Worthington's movie,"This is an enjoyable movie. Go see it -- give them your 15 bucks so that they make more big blockbusters. Seriously, it's very entertaining.This film is very well done: the ensemble cast does a great job, and the action, tone and pacing are flawless.Be forewarned, however. Some of the dialogue made me wince, and the plot was weak in ways it really shouldn't have been. Anyone who saw Star Trek the week before will probably be disappointed at how juvenile the dialogue is in such a serious movie.Of course, This is Sam Worthington's movie. I want to see him in everything now.As far as terminator movies go, this is a good entry. I liked The first three, and this was a satisfying installment.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator Salvation never had a chance with some critics.....,"When i heard they would make yet another Terminator i thought Oh God Please No! Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, wasn't actually a bad film in my opinion, its a good film. The problem T3 has, is how amazing the original two were. Terminator: Salvation, did i expect it would deliver when going into the cinema? Not hugely, i expected nothing close to Terminator 1 or 2, and lets face it, why should we, they are two among the best Sci-Fi films ever to be made. Did it deliver? Yes, of course it did. It is an extremely well made movie. I believe this film was doomed by some critics before it was released. First off, Terminator Salvation does what we want, plot development. John Connor being the weakest of all of them, with Kyle Reese being excellent. The audience meeting Kyle when he was younger, its great how much alike this actor is too the Kyle of the first film. Very well casted. The action is great, its fast moving, it never leaves you feeling bored, so its an all round great film, and doesn't get lost in CGI and become a big exploding mess. Also the references to the original Terminator is great i love the little traits. What i do have a problem with in a respect is how little the actual story is documented. The first two films done this extremely well, especially the second. i do feel maybe John Connor is a bit weak at times, but the other characters more than make up for it! maybe also the chase scenes are not as great as the other 3 films, but a film as a whole, its pulse racing. Being introduced to the T-600 as well was really great, nice to see the younger models. It isn't the same as the first 3 films in the fact its a different kettle of fish, it barely documents an actual terminator like the previous 3 done so well... yes you may argue there were loads of Terminators, but even Marcus didn't have the scale that Arnie's T-800 was given in the first two films. (I don't mean screen time) I think this is a brilliant film though, and it doesn't deserve any bad press at all, if this didn't have Terminator attached people would be saying it was one of the greatest films in a long while, people just want to pick at something. So its better than T3, its nearly as good as Terminator 2 and i personally think on a level with Terminator. What is there to complain about? They could have made a god awful film and churned it out too make money like they have with many franchises, we should be thankful a film of this excellence was released.

"""Terminator Salvation""","McG's ""Terminator Salvation"" is full of paradoxes, and not just the brain bending, time traveling, series continuity kind, but also the stilted decision-making, lapses in logic, flawed design kind. The director, most well known for the two ""Charlie's Angels"" films, trades estrogen for an excess in testosterone, treating the ""Terminator"" franchise as an exercise in antithesis.In fact, there's only about four women in the entire movie, none of whom are particularly flattering characters. The most likable by default is Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, resistance soldier and maybe-savior John Connor's pregnant wife, as she's given almost nothing to do. Then there's Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), the face of Skynet, so she's bad. Third and worst, though through no fault of her own, is Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams, whose arbitrary and apparently passionate attraction to a half-man/half- terminator turns her against her allies. Last is Jadagrace (?) as the young Star, a shy (or mute) little girl whose sole purpose seems to be projecting a lone beacon of cute onto the wasteland of washed-out deserts and deserted, leveled cities.Okay, there may be a couple more women here and there, but they're few and far between in this future dominated by grunting, screaming men. The story begins in 2003, with death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) being offered a second chance at life through cybernetics. Though he knows he should embrace death for the crimes he's committed, he agrees to sell the good doctor his body for a price--one kiss. He's then carted off and his sentence carried out via lethal injection in a scene ripped straight from ""Dead Man Walking.""Enter the future. 2018. Wright appears naked and conveniently near a man with just what he needs. Clothed, he begins his trek toward the nearest city, where he encounters Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and the ever-adorable Star. Since Wright has the technical knowhow to fix the duo's busted radio, they intercept one of Connor's transmissions and set out to find him.Meanwhile, the resistance is testing its latest weapon, a signal that powers down any terminators within its wavelength. The higher-ups are ready to launch a coordinated strike on Skynet when Connor learns from Wright that Reese (Connor's father, long story) has been taken prisoner and is being held at one of the targeted facilities.It's no wonder Bale freaked out at that Director of Photography in the infamous leaked clip a few months back, as nearly every one of his scenes necessitates one of maybe six permutations of anger. The character of Connor lacks depth on the page, but Bale's performance is bludgeoningly one-note, and in that way, perfectly matched with Worthington; the two speak almost identically. One particular shot of them nose to nose in interrogation makes this amusingly apparent as they volley gruff monosyllabic responses and spittle-projecting barks back and forth.The film also suffers from an antagonist identity crisis. Are we rooting for Wright, as he tries to escape from Connor? Are we rooting for Connor, who testifies to the worth of every human life, only to watch the generals with whom he disagrees decimated in battle? Or is it just the infinite waves of machines?McG clearly has a vision for the future of the Terminator franchise (Army recruitment video by way of the apocalypse), but ""Salvation"" is blisteringly melodramatic and above all, commits the cardinal sin of summer action films--it bores. Things explode, and if the audience can keep track of who's fighting who or why, they certainly won't care on any intimate level. It's the equivalent of a two-plus-hour fireworks show, except the fireworks are only two colors, black and bleached-white.It's obvious every moment is designed to positively drip masculine coolness, but it often comes off like the kid in school who just wants to fit in and tries a little bit too hard. The film is terrified of letting itself be mindless fun, even for a moment, and so packs on the doomsday pretension. The work may be a step toward credibility for the auspiciously named director, but as a standalone piece, ""Terminator Salvation"" is an indulgent, groaningly operatic mess that chokes on its own testosterone.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"The visuals are stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy ...","Set in 2018 after the bombs have dropped, the machines have risen and humanity is on the brink and John Connor (Christian Bale) is our only hope. Or is he? Terminator Salvation follows the horrendous Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) with McG (Charlie's Angels) at the helm. But unlike the previous instalment a concentrated effort has been made by McG to take care of the core audience by respecting and acknowledging the source material/ mythology that series creator James Cameron created in the first two films.Gone are the inflatable breasts, the soft-porn lighting, the cheesy one-liners and the cringe-worthy humour that buried Terminator 3. In fact it's almost like that T3 never happened - almost. ""Judgement Day happened"", explains a young Kyle Reese in Salvation and that is all that matters.As for the story, it's simple. The original was about saving Sarah Connor, the second was about saving John Connor and Salvation is about saving a young Kyle Reese. Christian Bale is John Connor, the man fated to lead humanity to victory against Skynet and its army of machines. He plays the part with a lot of grunt, reminiscent of Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and while critics loathe the performance citing he lacked charisma, I enjoyed it. This is how Connor should be portrayed, a no holds barred soldier, rising the ranks with the weight of the world on his shoulders. But surprisingly its the addition of Sam Worthington and his portrayal of Marcus Wright - a prisoner on death row who donates his body to science only to awaken 15 years later as frankenstein so to speak is the most compelling part of Salvations plot, striking a petite emotional chord between the explosions.The other minor characters serve their purpose but Anton Yelchin absolutely nails it as a young Kyle Reese - and obviously did his homework replicating Michael Biehn's mannerisms in the original film. One of many nice touches in Salvation.With all these positives, thats not to say the film didn't have its share of problems. The editing was choppy in parts and felt incomplete, or rushed. The score by Danny Elfman was adequate but not what I'd call memorable one like Brad Fidel's and the character development was again adequate but there just could've been more of those quiet moments to pull us in. That's the difference between a good movie and a great one.Salvation is indeed a slice Salvation for this franchise, and although it doesn't quite pack the same emotional punch as Cameron's work - the world is gritty, the visuals stunning, the action breath-taking, and the drama heavy setting it back in the right direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stay out of the cinema if you want your fond memories to live,"This is not only good or bad. There are numerous problems with accepting this as part of the series, which is not to say that it is an impossible feat. One might expect this to be a big, dumb, loud action flick, and to an extent, that is accurate. What's noteworthy is that it isn't only that, and actually contains some rather interesting material. In several ways, this is genuinely an original plot for the franchise, and that hasn't particularly been seen since the first one. There are a few twists that are incredible, and very well thought out. It does have a couple of clichés and extremely predictable occurrences, too. The writing varies a lot, and sense is thrown out the window so many times that they must have hired workers to periodically tow it away, so there'd be room to keep doing so. The dialog ranges, and a bunch of lines feel like they came up with them to put them in the trailers. One thing that added to this was the credible and different personalities seen in the humans. This is sadly not all that emotionally involving, most of the time, but hey, there being any, and there is, is a humongous improvement on McG's directing. It is, at times, quite exciting and entertaining. The characters are a mixed bag. Anton Yelchin... I'm not sure what I think about how he did. The acting has excellent moments, definitely, they're just seldom. The yelling was as excessive as the utterly ridiculous amount and size of the explosions, and someone needs to sit down with Bale, look him straight in the eyes and explain to him to stop doing the gruff voice. It's neither Connor nor Batman. The whole thing is well-shot, and the special effects are, of course, impeccable. Quality of designs are nice. The future war is, of course, much too easily fought at times in this, and the unforgettable and nearly overpowering tension of those scenes in the 1984 film is not present in this for a single second. While this does try to establish a bleak and dark atmosphere and mood, it gets nowhere near the Terminator 1 and 2. There is language, moderate in tone and infrequent. The violence is not graphic or strong. I recommend this mainly to those looking for sci-fi fighting with a script that is occasionally pretty smart. Fans may want to consider if they really want to risk it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I went into the cinema not knowing anything about what the film may contain and I did not read any reviews before seeing it.

Terminator Salvation?? Patience Saturation!,"As a regular movie goer one would expect some story, good screenplay that would engage the audience. I expected some gripping sequences, and entertaining plot when I entered the theater. Guess what? This is a pathetic movie with lazy direction, awful story and poor execution. Come on! Hollywood has great amount of resources -- money, technology, technicians, actors and last but not least damn good writers and directors. When a movie like Terminator (sequel) is being made there should be commitment from the makers, at least. What does this movie have? Nothing new at all. Normal sequences are replaced with ""great"" video game graphics, predictable plot which even a kid would be able to guess which makes the audience leave theater with utter disappointment. Same SanDisk USB available now in market is being shown as used in 2018. The watchman robot behaves pretty much same as a normal human watchman which we have seen umpteen times in old movies. Robots' technology has so improved that they do not trace down Connor's communication -- which is Radio with some sh*t frequency!! Does this sound like an EFFORT from makers? Sloppy, negligent and careless work. This movie doesn't deserve the current rating of 7+. For it's sheer crap it deserves nothing more than a zero which we don't have as an option.

Misguided film,"McG wasn't the right guy for this film. Simple. The short comings of the storyline and script are just from a lack of experience, or arrogance. The film looks amazing, that's the DP work, and it looks like the end of the world. The film is too safe. The original film focus on Marcus sounded more interesting, that would ensure the prophet and legend of John Connor stayed in the background. There's a lot of well staged action, but it's surrounded by dull story beats. A writer and director like Cameron is a tough act to follow, so I'm amazed all these filmmakers attempt to recreate the series, it should've ended with Judgement Day, or Cameron should've done number 3. This failed to connect and as a fan it's easy to see why. I disliked it more on release, but I think it's not as horrible as I remembered. It's just not a Terminator film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It has some problems, but it's not bad.","I enjoy the Terminator franchise. I like T1. I really like T2. To a lesser degree, I like T3 and TS, but I still like them. Before anyone asks, I haven't actually watched a full episode of the Sarah Conner Chronicles, so I don't have an opinion.I don't fully understand why this movie got the negative press that it did. I was entertained.First, let me discuss what didn't quite add up. The biggest problem for me is actually one that I haven't heard very much. A plot point of the story is that Kyle Reese has been targeted by Skynet, which of course spells trouble for John Conner since he has to send Kyle back in time or he won't exist. The problem: no explanation is given for Skynet to want Kyle terminated. In fact, the story would have worked better if he just happened to be captured by Skynet and John set out to rescue him because it would answer why Skynet doesn't actually kill him.The movie has no real focus until the third act. There are several story lines going on, but none of them emerges as the main conflict until the final part when they all unify. This is more of a minor thing, but it annoyed me nonetheless.This adds very little to the story arc of the franchise. Again, I haven't heard this one very often. Think about it. How much is actually accomplished in this story that affects the rest of the series? John meets Kyle (but not until the end), John gets more pull in the Resistance (which wasn't even a concept until this movie, so it just created its own problem for John to overcome), and John's attitude towards machines lightens up (admittedly, this is cool because it sets up for his reprogramming of the T-800 from his youth). That's it. That's not enough for a movie of this length.A better situation would have been for the base at the end be the mainframe that John destroyed in the future which was so pivotal in the war and caused Skynet to want to terminate him. By simply doing this, the entire story is building up to that and thus has purpose in the overall series.Huh. Anyway, this actually wasn't a bad movie. The acting was good, the story (beyond the weak points I noted) was good, and the special effects were good (though I really don't care). I would recommend that you check it out for yourself if you haven't seen it and don't listen to the naysayers.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Life After Judgement Day,MTV acolyte McG helms this outing in the Terminator franchise.

"''Hi, we have just met, but you are a very good person, you just don't know it yet, but I do, uh-huh''","When it comes to science fiction, one can find many technical plot holes, especially if time travel is involved. Because the very definition of time travel introduces a paradox, due to something called Butterfly Effect. Because of that, the single act of going back in time may alter the chain of events that would easily lead to the travelers deletion from existence, provided they go far back enough before their conception. I'll give an example of my take and understanding of this effect, If we had the chance to observe this in real life, we could have seen an entire silhouette of a city change dramatically, just as a result of going back in time fifty years or so and stopping someone in the street and asking them where the nearest post office is and coming back. As Sarah Connor put in the first Terminator film ''...a person can go crazy thinking about all this...'' That's why I don't nitpick Sci-Fi movies on those issues, as long as it's a well made movie otherwise. Because of those reasons, I didn't nitpick this one on technical plot holes as well. I just wanted to make it clear that that's not my problem with the film. My first problem with the film is its existence in the first place. I am not always against remakes and sequels, but there are some films that need to be left alone. Terminator films(the original 2) didn't need any sequels, but we keep getting them. And even James Cameron himself is still trying to cash in on it and he is ruining his own legacy. Kudos to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who own the right to Back to the Future franchise and they refuse to authorize any reboot or remake during either one's lifetime. It's called artistic integrity. I cringed every time they made a reference to the originals, like ''come with me if you want to live'' or ''I'll be back''. My second big problem with the film was the characters' behavior. Blair just meets a random dude and she immediately decides that he's a good person, and I'm not talking about the first impressions that people feel when they first meet, she literally tells him that he is a good person as if she has known him for years. Ridiculous dialogue always makes me angry and wonder if the movie has been made by aliens or an A.I, which would be ironic.If you can ignore those, it's a well made film, technically speaking. Visual effects and action are pretty cool, actors are charming. You will probably not remember a thing about it a year after, but it'll entertain you while you are watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why was this movie made?,"I'm back. And I'm upset. I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the first Terminator films. The first two few told the story and the third was just plain fun. This however, was an unnecessary mess. The minute the movie started, I could tell something wasn't right. This installment takes place after Judgement Day. First of all, they brought in an entire new cast. They could have easily brought back Nick Stahl for John Conner and Claire Danes as Kate Brewster but they replaced both. Christian Bale is an ideal John Conner, I suppose, but I his performance was so emotionless that I didn't care about him at all. And Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate chose not to continue the the feisty personality that made so fun to watch. She feels like a completely different person here. The script is poorly written and so instead, the movie is filled with scene after scene of meaningless war and battle sequences. It is very average, cliché, mainstream, Hollywood entertainment (I wouldn't even go so far to say it's entertainment) I don't know how any fan of the originals could enjoy this movie. We learned and saw all we needed to know of the future and Judgement Day from the flash forwards in the first three films. The scenes that worked the best were with Helena Bonham Carter and Arnold Schwarzenegger but, unfortunately for us, those were few. I highly recommend to skip this ""Terminator"" film if you are a fan, as it adds nothing important to the series. I hope the new reboot will be better.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
surprisingly  good!,"The most recent update on the Terminator film series. Some might say it's not worth seeing, die-hard fans would give it high praise, there's no real big response to the film yet whether or not it will be a summer blockbuster.Basically, it picks up where we left off from number three when Skynet began the attack on the humans. There is a bit of backtracking with the new and updated terminator machine and the history behind this model and how only one was manufactured much like Peter Weller's character in Robocop in the use of a human body.The new machine sets out from Skynet to essentially eliminate John Connor and Kyle Reese. With more smarts than the rest, what's left of the human body tries to fight back against the orders and ends up playing out the role originally intended for Arnold if he was still acting. However it doesn't exclude his brief cameo he has toward the end of the film.I'm not much one to list spoilers, however once you see the way this film ends, it makes me want to start right back at the beginning again.The grading of the imagery should get high praise. It is very much earthly and worn on both the land and the machinery seen. It is very much in the same tone as Camp Crystal Lake in the recent remake of Friday The 13th. The acting is not that much different from the other three films which makes it realistic and firm.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not bad, but not a memorable classic.","Upon seeing the trailer of Terminator Salvation, I wasn't expecting too much of this movie. When I checked out Terminator Salvation, I was right. Terminator Salvation has been reduced to a popcorn movie thanks to director McG (Charlie's Angels). Though there are various homages and references to the previous Terminator movies and we finally get a look at what the world is like post-Judgement day, it still lacks the heart and soul of its predecessors.Terminator Salvation takes place in a post-apocalyptic 2018. Christian Bale takes over from Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl as John Connor, now a soldier who is living up to the expectations set by his deceased mother. He still carries tapes of his deceased mother Sarah Connor (an uncredited Linda Hamilton) and the future of mankind weighs heavily on his shoulders. At the same time, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who was a prisoner on death row who was executed in 2003 but has since been resurrected as a cyborg sent to infiltrate the human resistance. Before Marcus was executed, he agrees to donate his body for a secret project led by an ex-Cyberdyne Systems scientist Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter). Along the way, Marcus is assisted by a young survivor Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin who is channeling a young Michael Biehn from the 1984 Terminator) and a mute girl Star (Jadagrace Berry). When Skynet prepares a final attack to wipe out mankind, John Connor rallies the remaining survivors to unite and launch an all out assault on Skynet. John Connor must also contend with General Ashdown (Michael Ironside ), the current leader of the Resistance.It was great to see a cameo of a CGI-Arnold Schwarzenegger as the original Terminator. There were plenty of great homages and references to The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) which saves the movie from being a total disappointment. It's clear that McG was not the right choice for the Terminator franchise as he has reduced Terminator Salvation to a popcorn movie. While I acknowledge that James Cameron is an unbeatable act to follow, surely a better director could have been picked. Perhaps McG should have studied James Cameron's methods as to what made the Terminator movies so successful. Another pet hate of mine is watering down the violence to attract a wider audience. The Terminator movies have a reputation for being violent. Full stop. Don't water the subject matter down just to attract a wider audience, otherwise you risk alienating a lot of loyal fans. The fear factor that was present through Terminator and Terminator 2 is gone. Instead, you have kids fighting in the war.Terminator Salvation was also (in)famous for a controversial incident involving Christian Bale profanity-laden spray directed at cinematographer Shane Hurlbut which was recorded and leaked onto the internet. Christian Bale has since apologised to Shane Hurlbut and also made a public apology for his inexcusable behaviour.That aside, though Terminator Salvation wasn't the best of the Terminator franchise. It wasn't that bad of a movie compared to other sequels that are considered the worst, however it wasn't that memorable. It's enough to pass the time.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Connor gets to do what he was born to do,"Finally, a Terminator film came along that features John Connor dispatching our robot nemesis in batches.

Fails to stand on the shoulders of giants: good but not great.,"I saw T:S last night and was saddened to find it as I anticipated: it was good, it was always going to be GOOD, but it wasn't great.Define irony: The original Terminator film introduced a terrific new idea to sci-fi films and, under Cameron, did them brilliantly. The film The Matrix and TV series (the new one, not the original!) of Battlestar Gallatica took those ideas and developed them into new directions, expertly done with sometimes spectacular and thought-provoking story lines.Then you have Terminator:Salvation, which treads the same path (particularly as B. S.) but doesn't do it quite as well. It has the mythology (as it were) of the original, but the result is, on a now well-trodden path, disappointing.Why so? The casting was OK: Christian Bale maybe a little disappointing performing the kind of role he's now so familiar with, but Sam Worthington taking the plaudits with a brilliant emphatic and emotion-provoking performance (side note though - Helena Bonham Carter was dreadful and mis-cast - ol' forehead is a poor actress at the best of times, and Michael Ironside just too old to pull off a role which, again, is very familiar to him).The problem I felt was in a clunky script ('I'll be back' indeed!) and a storyline the attempted to stand on the shoulders of those that post-dated the original film without ever accomplishing a new and/or compelling direction. That said, I did enjoy the frequent references to the preceding Terminator movies (of which there are many), perhaps despite myself.Is the failure of this film (well, 'failure' is putting it a little high) ironic: have others taken the ideas of the original film and done them better than a film made after them all? I think so, which is a shame, albeit a predictable one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Action Supported By a Great Storyline,"Terminator: Salvation was not what I expected at all. I thought it would be a great action movie with no real storyline, but I was wrong. The story was well thought in just about every way.The main focus of the movie's storyline was the Terminators' attacks on the humans. They would have to resist against the machines for mankind's very survival. Unfortunately for the resisters, the machines were stronger, faster, and more durable making them a difficult if not impossible enemy to fight. That part was pretty straight forward, but what was impressive was the movie had also personal struggles for Jon Connor and Marcus Right. This sometimes would start to get confusing, but it made the characters seem more interesting than just some randomly created idiots carrying guns.So the story is pretty impressive, but what's better yet was the action and pace of Terminator: Salvation. Of course with the name Terminator, automatically you'd know this would be an action movie. It's mot that of the ""typical action"" movie though. There are a lot of surprises or sudden sequences that will throw you into no thoughts but of the movie. Better yet, it's not lame or stupid where there are unrealistic scenes flashing. Terminator: Salvation focused on a strong pace of action, and thoughts carried out to scenes of the movie of ""what would we do if real terminators really tried exterminating us?"" The answer to those questions would be in the scenes.Overall, the acting is pretty good, though I do have some issues with it. Christian Bale would sometimes overact, especially in the beginning. A theory for that is either Jon Connor is a hot headed exaggerated character, or Christian simply messed up. Marcus Right was well acted though. His confusion and rage was well acted throughout the whole movie which was fairly impressive.Concluding, Terminator: Salvation was a well acted and well polished action movie topped with a dramatic story. I strongly recommend that people who haven't yet seen Terminator: Salvation go do so.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a good Terminator Film,"First watching this in a long time and I must say, this is not a bad movie at all, it is quite good.It took the saga forward.

"Entertaining, but no point in this sequel","Well the movie It's not that bad, in fact It's entertaining, but even thought you can find good actors (not necessarily good performance) and art direction I didn't feel the plot fill what you think the mythology has to achieve, in the end too predictable.I believe they thought about getting back the franchise and make more sequels, so they said ""Let's not do something that good in this one so that we can produce three more and make more money""And on the other hand having watched the unfortunately cancelled The Sarah Connor chronicles, You see the difference between an interesting and well developed story arc and a poor one, it's really a shame this show wasn't renewed, and had a short life because it really was taking the story to a direction worth to see it, and not just any action movie repeating it self over and over.Anyway if you are fan you got to see this one and make your own conclusions, I guess It could be worst, but I don't feel like seeing more, only if they take back The Sarah Connor chronicles someday.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun with strong performances from Bale and Worthington.,"Terminator Salvation - The year is 2018. The machines rule, and the humans are on the losing side. John Conner (Christian Bale) battles on, but he needs the help of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a half-human half machine experiment of Skynet to save Kyle Reese.McG seems to have a chip on his shoulder that stems no doubt from his nickname. He and this film are twin souls - each trying to prove their existence in the world of cinema. T3 left the world bombed to hell and added a few carelessly thought out plot elements that hurt the attitude of the series in general (nuclear cores? robots pre-designed to not kill?), but the underlying problem with the series has always been the characters struggling to undo the future that has already had it's shape on the past. Now we have characters trying to secure the past that has already happened. Confusing? Kind of. Does it need to be here? Questionable. Is it fun? Quite often actually.Christian Bale adds weight and seriousness to the film. He's still not freakin' leader of the resistance, but we see elements of why this will be so. Sam Worthington is very watchable as Marcus Cole. His battle for humanity is (literally) the film's beating heart. If nothing else from this movie stays with you afterwards (and hopefully more than a few elements will, as it's a decently put together film) his performance should. Bale and Worthington's scenes together are some of the best in the film, and it's a pity there aren't more.There are lots of cool robots. Robots that swim, drive motorcycles, shoot the series' iconic miniguns, and giant ones with cannons and grabbers. All of these make for good bangs and summer entertainment. The lack of laser weapons and fields of skulls ripe for crunching might disappoint series diehards, but overall the action is quite good. The T-800 has never been so formidable.Terminator Salvation, like John Conner for mankind, was hoped to be the tentpole for future movies. It's hard to see happen, unless Direct to DVD is your thing. This was a good film, but it's hard to see them taking the series any further.Terminator Salvation gets a B-",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The future isn't what it used to be...,"It's been a few weeks since I've seen this film, but I remember it being a good 'popcorn' type of movie. In some ways the world it creates is in line with what the re-imagined Star Trek movie did (also released in 2009). So, if you hate what has been done in this movie, it's possible to rationalise and to hope for a better attempt at a sequel-reimagination. If you love this movie, then the world which this movie creates will be your preferred Terminator world.For me, this is by no means a great movie. It's entertaining but that's about it. Not sure that it has any repeat viewing value. Like I said, the world which this movie creates doesn't seem to gel with what we came to expect based on the earlier movies. Not into the mythology of this series enough to know whether paradoxes or contradictions are created.By far the most interesting character in this movie is Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington. He's a mystery character whom John Connor (played by Christian Bale) does not know whether to trust or not...is Wright a man or a machine? Friend or foe?For the second time in the last few years, Bale has been upstaged by an Australian co-star...the last time was with Heath Ledger's immortal characterisation of The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" Batman movie. It looks to me as if Bale is going down the route of trying to make a lot of money in movies...he's betting that there will be a Terminator series of sequels starring him, and that he'll make a fortune from them. Unfortunately, like Batman, John Connor is rather dull and a blank canvas. The parts which actors would jump at, like The Joker and Marcus Wright, are infinitely more interesting than the box office heroes Bale is playing...perhaps this truth galls Bale so much that he would be inclined to verbally abuse crew members making Terminator: Salvation?Anyway, lots of action in this movie, which is well done, and I did find the twists that this movie brought up to be interesting. Maybe other fans of this series will find those twists to be more of a problem for them than I did. Can't say that I am locking in viewing any subsequent movies in this series. The Transformers sequel has killed my desire to see any more movies in that franchise. Whilst having more action than this movie, Transformers is a whole lot less interesting and entertaining...but you would never guess that going on its extraordinary box office success.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It has some good ideas,Terminator Salvation (2009) ReviewIt's a prequel/reboot of the Terminator franchise starring Christian Bale as John Connor. Bale is great in the role and gives more commitment than the previous actor who played him in T3. Anton Yelchin is a perfect casting choice for the young Kyle Reese and the film would have been a lot better if it focused on his story. Sam Worthington plays a hybrid human/cyborg and he does his best to carry the film but his character isn't really that interesting.It is a good technical achievement in terms of visual and practical effects. The cinematography has a bleak post-apocalyptic look it. It takes the franchise into exciting new directions but it's squandered by dull one dimensional characters and often lazy writing. The ending feels rushed with a poorly rendered CGI cameo of Arnold that looks like it was taken straight out of PlayStation 2 video game. It isn't terrible it's actually quite enjoyable throughout and has some nice ideas but it's just full of flaws and a few too many plot-holes.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wanted to Hate it...couldn't. Pleasantly surprised.,"After a lot of negative feedback from the online ""geek"" community, my worst fears nearly ruined my going to see this flick. I have loved the TERMINATOR series since I was a kid; I watched every episode of the ill-fated but great TV series, and though I knew Terminator 3 would be a misstep, I was there on opening night anyway.From having a director called 'McG' to the early buzz about some rather clunky plot devices and dialog in SALVATION, I was afraid the newest and best chance to again realize the great potential of this cross-time saga would fail. I entered the cinema with slumped shoulders and horribly low expectations, ready to hate and come home to write a scathing review on IMDb.And then a funny thing happened. From the opening credits onward, I found myself enjoying the film and trying hard not to.First, Bale owns this picture. I liked Worthington, but he doesn't steal the picture from Christian Bale as some have been saying. The title character was an engrossing presence on-screen and it's a shame we don't get more time with him. But I guess wanting more is always a good sign in showbiz.The action, of course, is great. The ""mushroom cloud"" scene, ""Harvester"" scene and the climactic battle at the end are all very memorable and well-executed. What's more, they further the plot.Which brings me to my next point. The story moves along at a well-developed clip, cleverly (but not brilliantly) handling dueling plot lines and, for the most part, managing to hold the viewer's attention and keep him or her guessing what might happen next.Yes, there could have been more character development. But a few of the performances are absolutely just knocked out of the park. The real hero of this film is Anton Yelchin, embodying the intense but noble Kyle Reese (as portrayed by Michael Beihn) in the first film. He succeeds in creating a convincingly tough but sympathetic young hero-to-be. His performance, in fact, is one of the hallmarks of the film.The film's weakest attributes are, as mentioned, some amateur dialog, a feel-good and tacked-on ending, and last (but certainly not least), the ""Star"" character, a mute little girl played by ""Jadagrace."" It feels like I've seen this character a million times, and a cutesy cliché such as this has no business in a serious movie where the human race is being exterminated in a global war against machines.Another unfortunate side of this film is the editing and runtime. It feels as if whole chunks of plot are missing; moving lines that you might hear in the exciting movie trailers and TV spots promoting the film are not here. If I didn't know as much about the movie as I did going in, I imagine I would be quite confused. The editing itself is also choppy and in places disjointed. Personally, I'm getting tired of the ""Aw heck, we'll just put it on the DVD"" mindset. The best film should always be put forward during its debut. Herein lies one of the problems with TERMINATOR SALVATION.With that said, I couldn't help but like the film, and felt QUITE relieved that this wasn't the cinematic cataclysm I was afraid would ruin a franchise. As flawed as it is, it's not a bad start. And you know what? I was entertained and thinking about it the next day.How bad can that be?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If all you want is a noisy popcorn blockbuster, it's right up your street, but it won't do for anything else...","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWe're living in the times of recessionary Hollywood, where the studios aren't willing to take a gamble and old ideas are being trotted out in new format in favour of new ideas. Aside from the collosally pointless part three, the great thing about The Terminator franchise is that however many years were spanned out between the last film, there's always been a point to each new film, so a new Terminator movie is hardly the best example of this. It is, however, an established franchise and as such can hold it's own against the torrent of other commercially driven blockbusters on the cinema screens in the summer.The story here is set in the future where John Connor has survived as leader of the resistance in the battle against the machines. However, the boy who will grow to be his father, Kyle Reese, is eeking out an existence of his own, hiding in the ruins of modern civilization and running into contact with a mysterious man who it's hard to tell is a member of the resistance or the machines. It's something fans of the franchise will have been looking forward to for years, with a bright new cast (namely, Christian Bale in the lead role) and a glossy new look. Unfortunately, it is a complete case of style over substance.With the director of the Charlie's Angels films at the helm, this fun but dark franchise had it's fate in uncertain hands to start with. While McG's style might have been ideally suited to the under appreciated (in my opinion) CA films, it might not be as good with a Terminator film. He does get it wrong, but not for the reasons you might have thought, though. A more silly, jolly tone might have been preferable to the onslaught of trite dialogue, thin characterization, weak plotting and wavey story on display here. If all you want is a noisy, effects driven popcorn film with some impressive special effects and CGI, this'll serve you well but as something Terminator fans have been looking forward to for years it's a bit of a let down.No one expects anything to match the first two, but just something with some genuine affection for the series would be nice.

Eh...it was OK I guess,"I went to see Terminator Salvation last night and before seeing it, I didn't expect much. I just expected it to be an action/war flick and I thought that I would be mildly entertained, and I was. However, I still had problems with this movie.First of all, this movie was too short. It didn't have as many memorable scenes as the first three(maybe two)had. It just simply wasn't long enough.Another problem was Christen Bale. Not that I dislike him, but I just don't think he did too well in this movie. At least he was believable but I still felt that he could've done better as the role of John Connor Lastly, to me it just didn't have the humor and fun that the first three had. In the first movie, the humor was Arnold saying ""F*** you asshole"". There was a lot of humor in the second movie mostly revolving around young John Connor, and the Terminator(the good one). And in the third movie, the fun was probably all the scenes of destruction and the car chase scenes. However, in this movie, there just wasn't any fun and any humor. Probably the reason being is because its a post-apocalyptic setting, so everything's destroyed.Now, if you wanted to see this movie and had high hopes for it but now feel bummed out after reading my review, don't worry. The movie does have its problems, but if you don't look over it too much then its not all bad. The action sequences were great and you get to see all the different terminators, which is pretty cool.All in all, I'd would actually recommend seeing it. It's a good movie if you don't look too deep into it.I give it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator Salvation was entertaining but fails to carry on the story behind the action,"It's been twenty-five years since Arnold Schwarzenegger first donned a leather jacket and spoke the iconic words ""I'll be back."" And he certainly was. A lot can happen in twenty-five years. Sequels to the groundbreaking The Terminator sprang up, some good (T2) and some disappointing (T3), and then came the TV show. Somewhere in between Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines is Terminator Salvation. While it transcends the latter by miles, the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise does not come near to touching the original or, subsequently, T2, which I think has been the best Terminator film of, well, probably ever.Terminator Salvation depicts the war of the machines and the struggle of the human survivors of Judgment Day. Roughly three interconnected story lines spring up over the course of the movie: John Connor (Christian Bale) as he helps the resistance against SkyNet; Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted criminal who was executed in 2003 only to wake up in post-Judgment Day 2018; and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who is currently a teenager but, of course, later becomes father to John Connor. Though one would think that John Connor would dominate the film as the possible savior of humanity, the most compelling of the three stories is, in fact, that of Marcus Wright. While he does not upstage Christian Bale as many critics say, Sam Worthington provides the emotional heart of the film, however small that heart might be, and displays all the signs of a future star. His performance here is a solid basis for the endless hype and praise he has received from James Cameron, who so-called ""discovered"" Worthington and will direct him in the upcoming and much-anticipated Avatar. The rest of the cast is solid. No one particularly stands out but they all are satisfactory in their roles.When people heard that McG, whose most renowned work thus far is the Charlie's Angels films, the general reaction was negative. I was inclined to give McG a chance, even though it was difficult to imagine anyone besides James Cameron successfully directing a Terminator movie, particularly after the third one (the first one not directed by Cameron) failed miserably. In the end, while T4 was quite a bit better than T3, I have to admit that perhaps my doubts were correct. The editing was mediocre, especially when compared to the other special effects that occupied the film. Also, while there was definitely enough substance to support a full-length movie, the story was made secondary to the action. The film-makers began to develop some of the characters, yet by the end, the majority of them ended up being rather flat. None of them were given clear backstories (except for, of course, John Connor, who was in two of the previous films) or definite motivations. Marcus was the most intriguing and I was hoping that they would provide more information on his background, about his life prior to being sent to jail, but I was disappointed. Fortunately, though the tone of the movie is decidedly grim, the occasional references to iconic aspects of previous films - T3 not included - might elicit smiles from fans of the original and its sequel.Predictably, though, the most impressive aspect of the film is the ear-busting but dazzling action and visual effects. I say ""visual"" because, while there is a lot of CGI and computer wizardry involved, many of the most eye-popping explosions were actual explosions; for one particularly spectacular blow-up scene, McG and the crew detonated a real gas station. The trailer for Terminator Salvation promises a blood-pumping, action-filled summer blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less, and the movie delivers, in that aspect at any rate. The gritty, dark atmosphere and cinematography made the landscape truly feel as though Earth has endured an apocalyptic disaster, heightening the sense of gravity and immersing the audience in this bleak world.In the end, that's all it comes down to. For those expecting an original, dramatic story with a well-developed plot and characters, perhaps this is not the best place to look. However, anyone hoping for an entertaining, visually appealing spectacle, then Terminator Salvation is just the thing for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Plot: down 2 points, Audio: up 10","I was lucky enough to screen this in a newer AMC theater. McG's audio department has, in my opinion, raised the bar on soundtrack and audio effects quality.

The first scene where Marcus and Kyle are hunted by a large terminator is now my primary track for benchmarking home theater systems.I also agree with the comments about ""Rooster""; it was a clever way of tying in the world of Terminators with our own society.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed. Christian, Sam, and Anton give exceptional performances, and Michael Ironside is a classic touch. The story wasn't as impressive as Terminator 2: Judgement Day or the original Matrix, but sequels rarely can rival their genre originals.

Boom Boom Pow,"One word to describe this movie: kablooey. I can't remember seeing this much action in a film in a long time.

I mean, I can only be impressed and startled by so many explosions until I'm just exhausted from it.The movie seemed to adapt many sequences from Cloverfield. The camera is shaky and may not cut for a solid 2 minutes. This I liked. It really showed some director skill. But the screenplay is poor and the acting is sub-par. Christian Bale uses his Batman voice for the entire movie. It gets a little annoying. Arnold's cameo is mediocre but it was fun to see him appear. I recommend going to the theaters to see TS, because I don't see how the DVD version can be nearly as effective. TS is better than T3 but far from T2. If you enjoyed Transformers and Cloverfield, this film is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Adequate,"Terminator Salvation is a movie with a lot of potential. The story is sufficiently solid, the cast is good, and the special effects are mostly impressive, especially in scenes that mix modern day technology with Skynet technology.However, there are parts of the movie that fail to live up to their full potential. Character development is lacking in places and various scenes are lacking sufficient dramatic effect. By dramatic effect, I'm talking about the kind of tension and feeling you get from, as an example, the scene in the preview where Conner unhooks the chain from around the other guys head. If you have seen this scene in the preview, or in the movie itself, this is what I am talking about. You could feel the tension, and it seemed almost real. Unfortunately, this is missing from many other scenes in the movie, and this shortfall is what keeps the movie from being truly exceptional.Despite it's shortfalls, if you are a fan of the Terminator series, or just a fan of action and/or sci-fi in general, you will probably find this movie to be reasonably entertaining and worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Salvation"" makes T3 look like a masterpiece","I had never walked out on a movie before Terminator Salvation. There is simply nothing positive to say about the latest installment, least of which the casting, acting and plot in general. Certainly Christian Bale's worst performance to date. He seemed to have difficulty controlling the volume of his voice. The most frustrating thing about this flick is that there was so much potential to revitalize the franchise after the train wreck that was the third Terminator film. It's a shame that production companies are too preoccupied with raking in box office dollars then actually producing a good film. But I suppose that is the standard these days. Salvation had its moments (albeit only a couple action sequences that were far too short), but the scenes jumped around within themselves far too much with little explanation to the goings-on. The self proclaimed ""McG"" should stick to developing horrible teenage dramas like the OC, because he certainly did a fine job tearing apart what could have been an amazing story. I can't imagine James Cameron is impressed, and neither should the movie-going public. To those on this forum praising Salvation, you must have watched a different film. I certainly wish I did.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ignore the negative reviews,"This movie is plan out spectacular!!! I don't know why people are saying there isn't a plot because there is, a well written one that is clearly seen throughout this film and people failed to recognize it. The acting was good, i was able to see every character's personality the first ten seconds they were on camera. People are saying the actors were pretty much just posing for the camera when that wasn't true at all, you can clearly tell Christan Bale and Sam Worthington were acting their asses off the whole time.I would highly suggest seeing this movie, it deserves way better reviews than what its getting.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I found it OK, not much story line, but my kids enjoyed it","Just been to see this movie this evening. While the special effects and action are as stunning as ever, the story line seems weak to non-existent in this flick. The production is well managed but the screenplay is simply very lacking. If you're looking for a replay of action demonstrated in the first few movies then you will not be too disappointed, but if you are hoping to see any kind of real plot to go along with it then you will probably left wondering whether the movie really made any statements at all. To me it seemed like a predicable set play with no real build up in the storyline. Still my kids enjoyed it at 13 and almost 12, so if that's anything to go by then maybe it's really aimed at their age group rather than attempting to address the wishes of a more adult viewer who may perhaps have expected more? Not a complete waste of 2 hours, but I doubt I'll remember the experience much after the end of today. My thirteen year old son was the reason we went to see this movie and even he was questioning the plot as we were driving back home. I would class this as a mediocre Hollywood presentation at best...",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent sequel with a very good cast and several twists and turns,"Stirring and nail-biting followup with unstoppble action, thills, and state-of-art special effects. It is set in 2018, when Skynet has destroyed most of cities and a few survivors have been underground against a big army of machines, they are the Terminators, including the feared T 800, T 1000. there John Connor, Christian Bale, is a tough resistence member and on the other hand shows up Marcus Eright who only remembers being on Death Row and then appearing on a deserted place, he meets Kyle Reese : Anton Yelchin, and it is thought by Connor that he was sent from the future to kill him . Both join forces to defeat the killer machines and to enter at Skynet facility. But not all is at it seems to be and success is far from guaranteed. The end begins. We fight back.Enjoyable sequel but inferior to Terminator 1 and 2, here concerning Christian Bale as resistance leader, the key fighter againts the machines and the powerful Skynet that have taken over the earth.

They Baled on some Arnold-relief,"I simply love the terminator franchise including The Sarah Connor Chronicles. That being said....I'm no fan of Arnold. He is great when he is serious but (aside from the 1984 film, his character is goofy. I like the serious tone of these movies. The comedy should stay minimal. All Arnold is from T2 onward is comic relief. Salvation shows a world without him and it is great. Kyle reese is the comic relief and it's just enough to keep the pace. Christian Bale wasnt particularly outstanding in anything here really (a bit 1 dimensional if you ask me) but his supporting characters were great. Arnold's cg (and without dialogue) is all we needed from him. Tossing people like rag dolls. Bending steel. Not standing on one foot or terrifying bullying teenagers. I admit the bond between him and john in T2 was touching. But I could go for pages of the stupid and corny lines and directions they gave this man that were just too much.
The franchise would be better without him at this point. I was extremely disappointed in the follow up entitled Genisys. They should have continued Salvations storyline as promised.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lacking in emotion.,"In a near-future ravaged by robots, resistance fighter John Connor (Christian Bale) searches the post-apocalyptic wasteland for teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), the key to mankind's survival. Meanwhile, executed prisoner Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) inexplicably finds himself both free and alive, caught in the battle against the machines.There is no doubt that Terminator Salvation is sorely missing Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence, lacking the humour and personality that the Austrian action-star brings to the series. An impressive cast has been assembled to take his place, but they are no match for the man who has defined the franchise. Simply put, Arnold IS The Terminator!Of course, a decent plot wouldn't have hurt either, but the fourth film fails fans in that department too, with a bland story that involves an executed criminal brought back from the dead for a chance at redemption, a narrative that lacks the efficient simplicity of the first film, nor the mind-bending complexity of the second, falling squarely in mediocre territory, with an over reliance on big-budget CGI set-pieces to drive things forward.Director McG undeniably handles the action with technical prowess pulling off some stunning visual trickery, and if all you're after is an endless tirade of explosive eye-candy then you'll be more than satisfied, but as a whole the film lacks the emotional charge necessary to successfully reboot the franchise. I sat, I watched, but like a robot, I felt nothing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst Terminator,"People give Genisys a bad rep, but Salvation is a lot worst. Terminator is Arnold's movie, and when you force a plot into a movie to try to continue the story, but you also try to bring the old stories and mix them with the new ones, you get a huge mess of a film. This movie wants to be a new movie from the original 2 movies, but they keeping bringing up dialogue of similar cool stuff from the originals into this movie.The action is just ok for the most part, but the highlight is the final 30 minutes where you get to see what happens inside a Terminator factory. Bale is doing his best, but he looks bored and probably only did this movie for the big bucks.The worst thing about this movie is the story. If you have great action, then a story wouldn't matter. Unfortunately the original Terminator films were usually very high on story and had deep themes about human survival, and yet still delivered on great action. This movie has none of that.Honestly, I think Genisys is a way better film because it doesn't try to continue the story of the Terminator films, it creates an alternate timeline and a great ""what if"" scenario.4/10 (Only worth watching for the CGI Arnold cameo at the end of the movie)",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining, without novelty","I heard there was a 'revealing' scene with Moon Bloodgood that got cut to ensure a PG13 rating. Perhaps they should have left that in. The Terminator I remember from my teen years was pure R-rated fun. This movie doesn't touch the first Terminator. I learned a new word from a fellow viewer during the trailers...'Technophobia.' This seems to be a growing (or at least persevering) trend in movie-making. Lots of scary robots of all shapes and sizes trying to kill people. It seems like I've seen this plot unfold over and over again. Quest/Overcoming the Monster Plot leads to climax leads to denouement. Fun, but I think the movie could have used less action and more story. Maybe it's my age talking. Fellow viewers clearly enjoyed it, and some even (and this is weird) applauded. I didn't think it was anything special, but it was nevertheless, fun mindless entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Boooo!,"I for one, was absolutely appalled by this movie - the sheer and utter audacity of the writers/director to create such a piece of crap is just wrong. Not just to any original fan of the terminator, but to any film fan in general. First Christian bale - the so-called ""master of accents"" as he is formerly known, should be shunned from any reprisal of the role and from any other future film roles. Not at all a far-cry from what he did in batman (Put on a voice that no-one can understand and shout and scream) i found myself trying to hard to hear what he was saying rather than the plot of the film - to be honest i don't know which was worse. The story however had a OKish plot, even though there were more plot holes than i care to remember. The biggest thing that stood out was the the way the film could have been so amazing but ended up making rise of the machines look more than half decent. Overall i am extremely disappointed, for entertainment purposes its watchable. But if you are a fan who have waited for this since rise of the machines then for your sakes and all the memories you have of the terminator, go and see mean girls instead.

A solid blockbuster but no more than that,"I wasn't too fussed about seeing this film when it came out initially. It just struck me as yet another big noisy action movie and, while that kind of comes with the time of year, I just wasn't really in the mood for it and the average reviews didn't help. A cheap matinée changed my mind in regards watching it but what I found was more or less what I had been led to expect. The film offers much, this is the first time in the franchise that the action occurs during the reign of Skynet – previously we have only had clips of the future. Like most people this is one thing that I was looking forward to seeing and it is one of the ways that I think the film first sort of fudges things.Instead of the depressing bleak survival that we knew of from the first film, here the future seems a lot more organised and, well, militarised. I'm not really going to get into the logic or lack of logic in the plot but it doesn't feel like mankind is on the ropes or is on the run – indeed at times you wonder how Skynet can miss this much activity going on. Anyway this isn't really much of a problem because it does allow for more in the way of action and explosions. In this regard the film does deliver to a point, because it is noisy, have good pace and has plenty going on. This is not enough though because I rarely cared about the characters or felt an urgency to the events on screen. It is hard to describe but the film didn't get my pulse going or thrill me – instead it was just distracting for what it was but nothing more than that.This is caused by the characters being lost in the middle of all this plot and action. We have some good actors in there but nobody manages to do much. Some have complained that the film lacks the fun of some of the other films but I can understand this given the setting for the fourth film and the substance of the film being about the nature of being human etc. However, if this is the excuse then the film should have been much more engaging than it was but what it actually does is wear the seriousness like a cloak without really doing much with it. Bale uses his deep voice and troubled look but he has nothing of interest to do with his very interesting character other than look troubled and be gruff. Worthington is better because he has a more interesting character, again the material could have done more with him but he does well with what he has. Bloodgood is cute, Yelchin looks like who he is meant to be, Carter distracts by being overly famous for her role, Ironside is solid, Common fails to make up for Universal Mind Control with his film and Jadagrace is just the unwelcome ""cute kid"" even if she does it well. The effects are the biggest part of the film and generally it does all look very good and move very well, again adding to the film being ""solid"".And that is what it is – solid. Not spectacular, not thrilling, not engaging, not a great film and not a particularly good addition to the franchise. It is not a bad film by any means and it worked reasonably well as a noisy blockbuster but generally it has too little going on behind the noise and doesn't justify the serious tone that it has. Take a look but don't expect too much.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great fun but mcg is a liar,"great mindless explosive fun for post apocalyptic war film heads, but as a terminator film it lacks character (which is sort of understandable because we already know about john conner and kyle Reese.)it feels like about half an hour of story has been ripped out to make it one big long action sequence. which makes it better than terminator 3 (which had nothing going for it except the last 15 minutes) but its not a patch on t1 or 2.the only truly annoying thing about the film is mcg, leading up to the release he wouldn't shut up about how the film was not being put together with a rating in mind then when it comes out he changes direction and says he cut out a couple of bits to make it a pg13.mcg your a lier and a tw*t, but you make pretty good action films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Satisfying enough entry into the canon,"Starts off horribly, with ham-fisted references to the older, better entries in the series (nothing ever comes across less natural than ""What day is it? WHAT YEAR!?""). Eventually, however, becomes a solid thriller worthy to stand along T3 at least, then ends in another bit of a trainwreck.Overall, there's more good than bad. The more subtle references (GnR, the shotgun strap, even the necessary ""I'll be back"") work wonderfully even if the obvious ones are cringe-worthy. The action can be very good at times. New character Marcus is actually very interesting, if only they didn't spoil his arc in the trailers. Bale is a good choice as Connor, truly coming into the role in the second hour. Even Yelchin as young Kyle Reese evolves over the movie to become reminiscent of Michael Biehn. Plus it has possibly the best quasi-cameo of all time, which even with prior knowledge still knocked me off my feet.Ergo, T4 gets a cautious recommendation, but it shouldn't upset fans too horribly much. It could've been done much better, but its still good popcorn fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
smallvilles everywhere,"Most of the characters in the movie did not form a sentence more than once. They just kept nodding, smiling and winking the whole movie! Either writers blew it or I missed a scene where someone explained individuals don't need to talk in 2018. Also, I must say Christian Bale was not his best here. In fact, I think his worst acting performance in 00s. He did not seem to believe in his character. In fact, no one seemed to believe in the story.Note to McG, director: Dude, no one will take you serious with a nickname. I know how you feel. Its cool to have a nickname, you get to become a gangsta. But imagine yourself meeting with Steven Spielberg or James Cameron as, ""Hi, I am McG. M & G uppercase.""

Sequel...Prequel....Reboot...Whatever,"The problem with this film is the same problem that the recent Wolverine film had, it just doesn't connect with the original material. Now, there could be many reasons for this, non of which the film acknowledges. In fact, the film doesn't seem to care about a lot of stuff other then blowing things up and making it look cool. This entry into the series is vastly different from the previous ones. This time around the story takes place in 'present time' I would say, since every film before that was about traveling back in time to save/kill whomever. So right off the bat the film feels like it doesn't belong.Terminator Salvation is better then Rise of the Machines and weaker then the first two. There, I just told you something you probably already knew. Christian Bale is the 4th actor to portray John Conner (that's right 4th, look it up) and his performance consists of a lot of yelling and shooting. He doesn't have any scenes of emotional depth and the character loses that connectivity with the earlier films. He's a different John Connor, he's not the punk kid or the hiding from everything bum, he's finally becoming what his mother said he would be. Although, he is not the leader of the resistance yet, so this film is NOT the battles we've been preluded to in the original films, it's what happens before it. This film takes place in 2018, everything we've seen or been told came from 2029.The rest of the cast, with the exception of the saving grace that is Sam Worthington, is pretty much useless. Common fades into the background and serves no purpose whatsoever, he could have been just another faceless soldier. Moon Bloodgood seems to have gotten all her scenes left on the cutting room floor. She has a romance with Worthington that comes out of nowhere because prior scenes were obviously deleted. This makes her actions seem unrealistic. Bryce Dallas Howard takes over the Claire Danes role and surprise surprise is giving nothing to do as well. Anton Yelchin surprised me as Kyle Reese, and seemed like a believable 'young' Biehn. The man who steals the show is Sam Worthington, who is actually given some emotions to play with. I found myself interested in his character and his scenes the most in this film.McG has an eye for visuals, yet all his films lack substance. This is no different. Although I will say this is his best film, but when looking at his resume, that doesn't amount to much. Whatever substance this film has, it was given to by previous films. The script is basic go to point A to get plot point B. The only worthy addition to this story is the role of Marcus (Worthington) who actually brings a new dimension to this story, which in my opinion, we already know how it will turn out. I'm not totally sure on how this film stands on the whole timeline issue, but in my opinion, none of the key characters were ever at risk to me. Kyle Reese we know will go back in time, so he must live to do so. We know John Conner lives till 2029 to send Reese back in time, so we have no sense of danger in their scenes. Of course it could all be different and they could indeed die, I'm saying this based on the one line of him saying 'This is not the future my mother warned me about"".It will satisfy the action junkies, but leave those who want to see a continuance of the story empty. The barren wastelands are nice to see and gives them free roam for many neat things, such as car chases, motorcycle chases, air jet chases, etc. It had a bit more Mad Max then Terminator feel. You'll see a surprise cameo, which means only one thing when someone says that about this franchise, but when you see it you might laugh. We haven't perfected this yet and it looks fake and cheesy.Terminator Salvation is a popcorn flick that takes the series in a new direction. No more time traveling to save people, now it's the fight to stay alive. This new direction might not sit well with some, but for those just looking to enjoy themselves for a solid action film, this delivers. The scenes are exciting and Worthington delivers what others should have. The ending is a bit ridiculous, but it's better then the rumoured ending with the skin swapping. On a final note, Connor mentions that he's never seen anything like Marcus before, a machine covered in human skin with organs. Yet, he HAS seen this before, maybe not the organs, but he acts like this is brand new to him. Just one plot hole in my mind, in a field of many.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should have been Epic,"This film is rife with cheesy b-movie schtick and implausibilities. It starts out OK, with minimal character development and some perfunctory action, but eventually fizzles out in the third act. As far as I can remember, nothing truly interesting happens. Yes, there's action galore, but it's ham-fisted and uninspired. I nodded off a half dozen times in the last 20 minutes and left the theater in a sleepy haze with not much of a memory of what I had just seen.Bale is just OK as John Connor, utilizing the same vocal affect he used in The Dark Knight, while the other guy, having what seemed like more screen presence, still just wasn't given much material to work with. The characters are essentially cartoons and not very interesting ones at that. As such I felt very little if any empathy for any of the characters.I expect 9 to 16 years olds might like this movie but then, that's probably the target audience based in part on the PG-13 rating.In the end, this is a forgettable action film that will be Christian Bale's ""Catwoman"".",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good guys in a truck, baddies on motorbikes...it's all gone wrong.","The short scenes showcasing the 'future' in the first two Terminator films were some of the most captivating of the series. While I personally thought that what we saw in the first two films was enough to set the scene for those two movies and I never really wanted to see any more of the future world; it's clear that there is enough opportunity for a movie there, and it was inevitable that we'd get a Terminator movie set in the future eventually. It would have been nice if it were a better than this one, however. The film begins in 2003 and we see a man executed, before donating his body to some kind of cybernetic research project. The film then fast forwards to 2018, and the main plot, of course, focuses on John Connor; a soldier that has grown up to fulfil the destiny prophesised in the earlier films. Connor has discovered that Skynet are working on a new Terminator model, the T-800; just around the same time that the executed prisoner from 2003 has woken up in the future. The resistance has discovered an 'off switch' for Skynet's systems and hopes to win the war with it; but soon after Connor learns that his father, Kyle Reese, is number one on Skynet's most wanted list and sets out to find him.The plot sounds complicated but it really isn't; very little thought went into the storyline and it's clear that director ""McG"" felt he could wing it on action scenes alone. The most disappointing thing in this respect is the character of John Connor. They went to the trouble of hiring one of the best movie stars of the moment in Christian Bale; and then completely wasted him by making his character an absolute non-entity. We learn barely anything about him other than the fact that he doesn't like the machines; but he just comes across as a paranoid technophobe. This is even more unbelievable considering that we're supposed to believe this is the same character that cried at the end of Terminator 2 when Arnie descended into the melting pot. The only character that really provides any interest is Marcus Wright; the convict killed at the start of the film and later resurrected. His story is much more interesting and I think he even has more screen time than Christian Bale; making me think that producers were just scared to have an unknown actor at the top of the bill. Which is a shame because Sam Worthington is the only person involved in this film to come out with any credit.The disappointment of the characters is matched by the incompetent writing with regards to the story. The plot features a great many coincidences and much of it doesn't make sense. There's no real imagination on display either and the film really fails to inspire the viewer. Thankfully, the saving grace comes in the form of the action sequences - which are loud, brash and well orchestrated. There are plenty of them too, which helps to ensure that the film is at least mostly entertaining. Of course, the special effects are impressive...but I can't say too much about that since good effects are simply the norm for big budget action films these days. The actor they brought in to play Kyle Reese is a bit of a disappointment. Of course, the character is much younger than he was in The Terminator; but are we really supposed to believe that weedy Anton Yelchin would grow up to be Michael Biehn? It also has to be said that the vision of the future presented in this film is far too clean and not enough like the hopeless and dirty scenes shown in the original Terminator films. There are a few nods to the older and superior movies in the form of quotes and music; but it really just feels like a young kid mimicking his big brother. All the disappointment is eventually capped off by the ending...which is just mind-bogglingly stupid. Overall, this film is a very disappointing mess. An entertaining mess for sure...but the Terminator series ended in 1991 for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Watch it as it's own,"Before viewing the film ""Terminator:Salvation"", there are a few things that you need to take into consideration(especially big fans).

decent entry,"This was a decent entry in the Terminator franchise. It was the first not to feature time travel, as well as the first one not to star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Earl Boen!

Of course, they couldn't resist throwing in the famous lines, ""Come with me if you want to live"" and ""I'll be back!""

Much better than expected. I watched it twice!,"I just got back from watching Terminator Salvation twice. Yes, it was actually good enough that I was willing to watch it again almost straight away.I read a lot of the reviews and saw all the trailers before it came out, but the film still managed to surprise me a little bit. It did start a bit slow, but by the second half it really started to get good. I knew the special cameo was coming, but I enjoyed seeing exactly how they were going to work it in.On the second viewing, I took the time to notice much more of the little nods towards the previous three films. There's just so many though - the vehicles used, the choreography of the fight scenes, the music, settings and dialogue. I think I'm going to have to see it a good few times more to catch them all. I think I'll be able to - watch it again, I mean. Lot of people don't seem too keen, but it was so much better than T3 and so much better than expected. Not as good as T1 or T2, but then, it was never going to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but could have been better,"Salvation was extremely entertaining, but fell a bit short.The characters of Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese were well done. Cristian Bale was a bit mediocre as John Connor, and some of the characters(connors wife for one) were not really explored at all.The special effects were good and I thought the scene with the Gargantuan sized Hunter killer robot was amazing.The plot is pretty good, but it does suffer from some glaring plot holes.I felt the first half of the movie was better than the second half, and that it got a bit stale near the end.Overall good, but slightly bland at times.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great action film and a worthy successor to the series,"The almost 2 hour long Terminator Salvation flew by while I was watching it. I couldn't believe 2 hours had just gone by. You know what that means? I was royally entertained. It's not the perfect summer blockbuster (and isn't as good as Star Trek), but it's a well made action film with plenty of eye candy to behold.Terminator Salvation is a different type of movie than its predecessors. While those were also action films, they also had humor and had a much lighter tone than the one present in Salvation. This is Terminator at its darkest yet. It is a war movie after all. Some might miss the humor of the earlier films, but I didn't really mind. Plus there are plenty of easter eggs for series fans to catch and laugh at along the way. It's kind of weird that this is the first Terminator to not have an R rating though. Just proves that violence isn't nearly as bad as sex and foul language according to the MPAA.I can't really get into story specifics because it will make my head spin with all this time travel stuff, but Salvation does a good job of setting up everything that was hinted at in the other movies. There's nothing there that hasn't been told to us already though, which means little to no surprises. Its purpose is basically just to show everything that was told rather than expand the story. That's for the sequels. I will say though, that Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington) is the best character in the movie and Worthington gives a good performance as someone who is trying to figure out what the difference between man and machine is. Christian Bale is a decent John Connor. Nothing extraordinary but he gets the job done. The character isn't nearly as developed as Marcus though, which is a shame since John is so integral to the story. Anton Yelchin does a solid job as the young Kyle Reese as well. Everyone else has little to no screen time and isn't worth mentioning (though a certain cameo will have series vets smiling).Terminator Salvation is basically nothing but action and special effects and it's all done beautifully. McG might have struggled with some things, but action was not one of them. Some people might even feel a little Transformers in this movie (I certainly did), which I don't consider a bad thing. While the earlier films were basically one big chase sequence, Salvation is huge set piece after huge set piece and you can clearly see that huge budget.Ultimately, in terms of summer blockbusters this year, Salvation is a couple notches ahead of Wolverine and a notch below Star Trek. Action junkies will love it and I'm sure most Terminator fans will welcome it with welcome arms after the hate that Terminator 3 got. It's a solid new beginning for a franchise that has huge potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
OMG! Why you not understand...?,"OMG! Why you not understand its absolutely new film? Its Fallout! FALLOUT! Not T1 or T2... Duhh... I hate people who put too low rating for this film. I'm sorry Are You DumbAss?Great action,great playing(I mean Sam Warrington not Christian Bale). Yeah story line is not good, but it no so bad to hate it! I'm not even a Terminator fan. I think its great start of new Termintor trilogy. In short, I had a fantastic time watching it, and definitely would be going back to see it again when it opens. Most of the Terminator fans would definitely NOT be disappointed with this installment, as it is chock-full of action, heavy on heroics, and breathtaking in scope. It will definitely have a long run at the movies, and will give Michael Bay a run for his money. Visual Effect 9/10 Story Line 8/10 Action 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great attempt, but a flawed result","Well, you should give them kudos for trying something different. T3 was basically a rehash of T2. And for this film, the fourth in a long overdue franchise, they took us to that often mentioned and dreary future. The film looks stunning. But the problem is that the big plot revolving Worrington's character is dumb and should have been ditched (as well as horrible actor Worrington himself). Bale is always a good actor but here they portray Conner as a super man (hello skydiving into an ocean to board a submarine). It doesn't fit the character and theme of the great first two films where everyday humans fought an impossible fight against these machines. So bottom line: film looks great and had some strong potential but the bad plot makes it a weak Terminator film and only a mediocre action flick.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good addition to the Terminator franchise,"... and it made me forget all about T3.My new ranking:1.) Terminator 2: Judgement Day 2.) The Terminator 3.) Terminator Salvation 4.) Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (this is about a mile from 3, though)I went to see this film with limited expectations, and it met them. Well, actually, exceeded them just a bit. Unfortunately I let the anti-hype of some critics and ""fans"" of the Terminator franchise sway me to believe this film isn't going to be all it could be.This is a good summer action film. It's nowhere near what T1 and T2 are character-wise, but remember those are also two of the best sci-fi films ever made.See this movie with an open mind and remember this isn't trying to be a carbon copy plot of the first two films with cheap gags like T3 was. This film is taking the Terminator story into a place it hasn't been on the silver screen: the war between man and machine.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun Action Flick,"I have to admit, the first 20 minutes of this I was thinking ""uh oh. This is not looking good."" But after that, the film really worked for me.The good: 1) action scenes were incredible. There were quite a lot of jaw dropping moments for me. The huge car and robot were awesome! 2) I REALLY liked Marcus as a character and Worthington as an actor. I felt this film was really about him, and not connor.3) Set pieces were impressive What could have been improved: Actually only 2 things. 1) Christian Bale seemed to take away from the main story and the focus on Worthington's character. I just got the impression that there were close ups of him because he is a bigger star than Worthington. The film would have been a little tighter and more focused if Connor's character would have been put in the background (which is what rumor said the original script had).2) There was absolutely no explanation about Kyle's character and how it fit into the story. Sorry - I saw T1 and T2 eons ago and couldn't for the life of remember why this character was so critical to the plot.I really enjoyed this - a lot more than I thought I would.That being said, this is a VERY different Terminator film - it stands out in many ways different than the 'franchise.' Some may find that irritating.. I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
ignore the critics and see this- you'll get more bang for your buck!,"Yet again, the critics are extremely wrong. They say it doesn't have a plot: but yet the story is strong enough to sustain throughout the movie and keeping interest. The set-up for this movie may seem dour, but it is effective with smarter ideas than transformers ever came up with. Christian Bale and Sam Worthington were a partnership only imagined in heaven- but in this, they are so focused and convincingly dedicated. Even though they have few scenes together, this can stop each other outperforming each other, a fault made in the Dark Knight and the Devi Wears Prada. The special effects are amazing, with Anton Yelchin giving another great performance since Star Trek. I enjoyed this film by walking in with an optimistic view and with the expectation to only be entertained. I was not expecting 'James Cameron' masterpiece. The soundtrack must be mentioned and praised- clearly one of the best soundtracks of the year. It's main competition being the okay Transformers sequel- so I say see Terminator Salvation if you just want to enjoy yourself and have a good time. People will enjoy this movie- what more can you ask? Similar to the reviews Australia earned- watch the movie for what it is, not what it should've been. So ignore the critics and see this- you'll get more bang for your buck!

3rd Best Film in the Franchise,"Terminator Salvation does what none of the other films did. It gave us an entire movie based on what happens in the ""future"" when the machines have taken over instead of having them travel ""back in time"" to present day. It does a great job of showing what it would be like if machines did take over the world and how man can try their best to survive in that kind of world. Think Mad Max but with much more advanced vehicles and weapons. The story was engaging and the action scenes were incredible. I've seen every Terminator movie, including the new ""Dark Fate"", and out of all of them, this one I enjoyed the 3rd most, after T2 and the original The Terminator. I know a lot of people either loved or hated this movie, personally, I really enjoyed it and if you've been avoiding it, give it a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The intelligent action and awesome fights of the first 2 movies are replaced by explosions.,"Even worse than Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. Terminator Salvation is a stupid science fiction action movie. The first 2 movies were clever science fiction movies. Explosions go off and the directors want you to be excited, but your not because it's just Bruce Wayne meets the guy from Avatar and sh*t hits the fan. There are some scenes which will please old school Terminator fans and people just looking for mindless action. But there all about 30 minutes apart and are too infrequent to redeem the rest of the film. Terminator Salvation is a stupid science fiction movie with NO MEMORABLE LINES WHATSOEVER which is the exact opposite to the first two movies and overall it reminded me of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen drunk.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could have been so good,"Ever since Kyle Reece explained to Sarah Connor what the future would look like when the machines ruled the Earth, Terminator fans have been desperate to see more of those dark, gritty, laser-filled scenes that James Cameron dropped into the first two movies. Now, we finally get to see a whole movie showing us what the future world would look like. And it basically looks about as much as James Cameron's original vision as Christian Bale looks like Edward Furlong, not bothering to retain either the look or feel of what has gone before.'Terminator: Salvation' is the film that fans asked for, but didn't ask for the way they got it. While it was made, the Terminator himself was busy running the state of California, so couldn't really reprise his role (and don't get me started on any CGI work used to correct this – it really isn't up to the 'Rogue One' standards we're now used to). However, that's not so bad, as the story isn't just about the indestructible machine of metal, but also the Connor family, so most people were relieved that a decent actor like Christian Bale was going to be playing John Connor. Unfortunately, the film takes the weird route not to follow him, instead choosing to be mainly about Sam Worthington's character – a death-row inmate who somehow wakes up in the future and also helps trash a cyborg or two. I won't spoil too much of Worthington's character, especially as the trailer basically did that for me. However, I will say that this film would have been a damn sight better if it simply omitted his character completely. I'm not having a go at the actor. He did all he could with what he was given. It's just people weren't going to watch this film based on ANY new character – they wanted to see more of the old ones (even if they had been recast!).I could pick out various personal annoyances that I had with this film – the helicopter pilot who wears sunglasses at night, the silent child who's used as a plot device to show how caring our central characters are, or the fact that the end battle completely rips off T2 beat for beat. All of these I could have overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that 'Salvation' completely ignores various plot points that have been clearly stated in previous films. Maybe those not so 'up# on Terminator lore won't notice, but for me I found myself asking too many questions as to why things were happening this way. I know you could say that timelines got changed here and there so things are now different in the future, but, in my opinion, that's just lazy writing and a cop out.There were at least a couple of stand-outs, namely Ashton Yelchen's excellent take on how Michael Biehn portrayed Reece, Skynet City looking pretty cool and the nod to T"" by playing Guns and Roses again. However, this film was almost damned before it was released as much of the publicity surrounding it was directed at Christian Bale's bizarre outburst on set at a fellow crew member.I guess that 'Terminator: Salvation' isn't as bad as I'm making out. It's an okay sci-fi/action film. However, because it has the Terminator name attached we – the fans – are just hoping for more than we got. And, if you're interested, you may want to Google it's alternate ending, as it is much darker and interesting than what we got.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Killer,"It is very simple: the action is a killer! An absolutely kick ass mind blowing roller-coaster action ride! 7 points for that. besides that, t4 has nothing more to offer. But what's the point in claiming this movie is bad? it has no plot (humans fight against machines, end of story), and unfortunately Bale didn't get rid of his Batman-voice which in some moments seems a little ridiculous. But never mind that, his screening time gets beaten by most of the supporting actors like Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin anyway. Just switch off your brains and enjoy the action of the decade!

Rise of the Forgotten Protagonist.,"For someone who's not much into the manic action type films, I enjoyed Terminator Salvation. Am not a great fan of the franchise and neither did I remember much from the previous 2 versions - but TS entertained me nonstop for the 120 odd minutes I sat through the paid premiere.Fast paced and never letting go, the movie was an absolute thriller, often reminding you of references to last year's action giant - The Dark Knight.This movie has perhaps also given birth to a new breed of on screen role play - the forgotten protagonist - and there are few better at it than Christian Bale. In the Dark Knight, the movie was supposed to be about Batman (C.Bale) but ended up being about The Joker (H. Ledger). In TS again, John Connor plays but a mere shadow of Marcus Wright. I mean, it doesn't take the lead protagonist to lay a few C4 charges and get beaten up by Arnie!All in all, worth a watch. Great sequences - esp the Kyle Reese pick up set piece.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A flawed yet worthy entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise","When the news first broke that a fourth ""Terminator"" movie was in the works and that none other than ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG would be at the helm, the fan-boy world let out a collective groan. It helped matters that Christian Bale signed on to play the savior of the human race, John Connor, but for the most part, ""Terminator Salvation"" had an up-hill battle to fight. Here we are with the fourth installment in a franchise that many doubt should have gone past James Cameron's masterpiece, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" in the first place. This is the third director to tackle the material, with a script penned by the same guys who delivered the poorly received ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (not to mention ""Catwoman."" Yikes!). To make matters even more complicated, the script has been re-heated and doctored by Jonathan Nolan (""The Dark Knight"") to make the role of John Connor bigger than in the original script. All of this, while being made within the constraints of a PG-13 rating (a first for the series) and a toy-company to pacify. With so many cooks in the kitchen, so many expectations to meet and so many watching and judging, it's quite amazing, then, that is turned out as well as it did.""Terminator Salvation"" begins with Marcus (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for killing his brother, among others. Coerced by a cancer-ridden lover, Serena (Helena Bonham-Carter), he signs off on letting his soon-to-be-dead body be used for scientific experiments and advancements. We watch him receive only the best capital punishment that Texas can afford, only to find himself resurrected in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, circa 2018. The Judgment Day that Sarah Connor warned about has devastated mankind, as they fight for survival against Skynet and the machines who see them as the enemy and seek to eliminate them. The self-fulfilling prophet, John Connor (Bale) has yet to take his rightful place, though. There are those who believe in him, and those in power (Michael Ironside) who don't. When his future (or his past) is put into question – his future father, a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), is captured and on his way to termination – he must work together with a man – or a machine – whom he was raised not to trust.If the story sounds incomplete, or that it's missing something, then you aren't alone. The biggest problem facing this film is its script. Maybe it worked better in its original form, but by making more room for the character of John Connor, it starts to bloat and loses its impact. It doesn't help that the film is short, clocking in at well under two hours, and doesn't allow enough time to flesh out its plot-points. For example, you'll notice Connor's wife (Bryce Dallas-Howard, replacing Claire Danes) is visibly pregnant, and yet, nothing is ever mentioned about it in the film. The character of Marcus Wright is an intriguing and original addition to the ""Terminator"" mythos, played perfectly and convincingly by Worthington. While this part of the story is fleshed out well-enough, it's often put on the sidelines to make screen-time for Bale/John Connor. While you couldn't ask for a better adult John Connor than Christian Bale, there's simply not enough for him to do in this film, other than to give inspiring speeches to his comrades or go hand-to-hand combat with the machines. He makes an imposing and impressive Connor, giving the expected intensity and presence, but the character is barely expanded upon what was already given to us in the first two films. In short, if you're a newcomer watching this flick, you're not likely to be convinced that this man is all that important to the future of mankind and maybe – just maybe – he's got an overblown ego, and a temper to boot.On the upside of things, director McG deserves a round of applause. Not only did he take fan-boy criticisms in stride throughout the creation of the film, but on his end – the direction – he succeeds on virtually all fronts. While the story is weak and flawed, the visual aspect of the film is stunning. Full-on, from the moment we are re-introduced to the John Connor character, you believe that what you are seeing is a post-Judgment day world. One key moment early in the film finds Connor's allies annihilated by a bomb, covering the area in a sea of smoke and a rain-storm of ash. It's a far-cry from the brief war scenes we were given in the previous ""Terminator"" films, and in this particular scene, inspiration seems to have been drawn from Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Obviously, this is a fictional war, and not as dense as the real-life tragedy Spielberg portrayed in his film, but visually, McG nails it. Another spot where the film shines are in its special effects. True to the late-Stan Winston's method, most of the effects are achieved practically, rather than relying too heavily on CGI. The Terminators in the film look not only mean and heartless, but real. Heck, we even get Arnold Schwarzenegger's face rendered to Roland Kickinger's body, to re-create the famous T-800, and it's hard to tell the difference between real and fake. All of this, of course, on top of one outrageous action sequence after another and nods to previous films galore. You'll see motorcycles chasing tractor-trailer trucks in an interesting role reversal, and you'll watch as John Connor sets traps to the tune of Guns N' Roses ""You Could Be Mine."" All of these elements help seal the deal, making it feel like an authentic ""Terminator"" sequel and less of a cash-in (which, for the most part, it is). In the end, despite being light on plot and character development, ""Terminator: Salvation"" packs enough of a punch to be considered a worthy entry in the franchise and a brilliant summer blockbuster to boot.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He was actually kind of a secondary character. I enjoyed Marcus's storyline and Sam Worthington's portrayal of him. He doesn't know what he is but come on, this is meant to be a big twist but not really, its more the anti-twist. What did he think happened to him on death row after he signed his body over to Skynet and woke up in the future? Blah.Enjoyed seeing Sarah Conner on tapes.

"Not terrible, but imperfectly balanced by lots of good and bad","Unlike the previous three films, Terminator Salvation takes place in the future well after Judgment Day has ravaged the earth. John Connor (Christian Bale) is only a member of the resistance against the machines yet, but is on the lookout for his future father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).While it is not as good as The Terminator and can barely even be mentioned in the same sentence as the legendary Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator Salvation is really not a bad movie. But it is not a great movie either.The film does what it can to salvage the pieces of Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and for the most part, it does so valiantly. Wiping the camp and the ridiculousness of its predecessor away, Terminator Salvation settles post opening credits right into the gritty and dystopic nature of the first two films, only amped up considerably. The purely visual McG and his crew make it crystal clear that the future is bleak and depressing. Barren wastelands of deserts, dank sewer living spaces, and huge industrial spaces let the audience know they are not in for anything on the lines of escapism. While many of the set designs and features sample from more notable films (such as Mad Max and Blade Runner), there is enough desolation and despair sprinkled throughout that it manages to not feel like it is as clearly ripping off others as it is. Adding little homages to the original films was also a very nice touch.The special effects and makeup are done one better. The action borders on the lunacy of Michael Bay, but manages to stay in check and at a driven pace. Watching the hundreds of explosions, and the fights between humans and terminators is something that was never really done at this level before, but the film handles it excellently. The makeup is even more astounding, and has never looked more realistic. Never once was there a question of how fake anything looked (unlike the recent X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and each effect seems to one-up the next. Some of the set pieces are eye-poppingly well done, and while nothing will ever stun the way the T-1000 still does today, some of the effects here come pretty close.But these successes, in making a bombastic summer blockbuster, can only go so far.The story, quite simply, is a mess. Leaving aside the continuity errors (as they have always plagued the series incessantly), the film just never gets out of the mindset of wanting to be the beginning of a franchise. Never once does it want to be its own unique work. It manages to not rely so much on the previous three films rather miraculously, but this does not work in its favour. Characters are introduced at incredible speed, but none of them (outside of Connor, whose motivations practically write themselves at this point) are given any backstory or motivation for their actions. We know they hate the machines, and we know they have all continue to persevere through horror and tragedy since Judgment Day. But that is it. We are merely given strict, one-dimensional character outlines for this crew of fighters (and at least one notable villain), but it feels like stuff was either chopped out during editing or just was not even bothered to be added in.I realize that starting a franchise off is not an easy task. But if you are going to make it obvious that you plan to milk at least another two films out of this, you need to at least make an effort for people to latch onto characters that stick. If there is zero development here, then what hope is there for development in the future? It all feels so arbitrary and silly after awhile (and not helped by the cheat of an ending), that you begin to wonder why they even bothered making the film in the first place.With as little as they are given, it is a little unfair to pick on the supporting cast. Bryce Dallas Howard and Common are given little else than the ability to move the plot from moment to moment. Michael Ironside, Moon Bloodgood and especially Helena Bonham Carter are interesting characters, but are never given anything really meaningful to do. Yelchin seems uneasy as Reese, and frequently appears way too immature in the integral role.Bale on the other hand, is a bit underhanded. We can see that he is putting in the same intensity here that he has in every role he has ever done, but it just does not pay off the same way it did for Batman and Pat Bateman. He just never gets out of the mindset of wanting the character to be something he is not. This character was never written or intended to be at the level Bale's performance demands of it. It is always undercut, and it always feels lacking. This character may eventually fulfill a prophecy, but Bale's hokey monologues and forceful delivery of some lines is too good for what this character should have been.That leaves me with Sam Worthington. I have tried to stay as far away from talking about him as I can, because he is the lifeblood of this film. The little known Worthington is an absolute marvel from start to finish. Marcus Wright is the most interesting new character, and is the best thing about the film. Worthington breathes a vivid life into every scene he is in, and is clearly where the most effort went when the script was written. He is just impossible to take your eyes off of. It is truly a shame that his key trait was spoiled by the marketing team.While there is a lot to like about Terminator Salvation, there is a lot to not like as well. It is imperfectly balanced, but at least it was not terrible.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It doesn't demean the rest of the franchise, and there are many nods/references throughout to keep even the biggest fan happy.Christian Bale is the man of the moment and plays the lead character well.

too dumb to live,"This movie is pitched so low it insults the intelligence of all mankind. How stupid do the makers of this movie think we are. I get pitching a movie like a graphic novel, but why would you pitch a movie like a cartoon unless your audience was kids, and lets face it this movie series is about machines that kill humans, its given away in the title. Why would you do this to such an important and well represented franchise. once again there is a clue in the director. He made some adverts and charlies angels. The people who put their money behind this piece of very expensive garbage deserve to lose it. the dialogue is something else though. 3 people in a speeding truck being chase, The driver shouts ""hang on"", not once but 3 times over the course of the chase. Gee, that's a good idea i wouldn't have thought of if it was me clutching to the vehicle. I would have been scratching my nose or something. insulting wasteful and shameful.Skynet is computers and robots yet they have a sophisticated laboratory with tables? Skynet develop sophisticated flying machines yet they also build motorbikes utilising the combustion engine?A guy who has been a sleeper for 20 years who was a simple murderer before comes back to life and is a skilled fighter, who proceeds to treat a seasoned female rebel like she is some sissy amateur (are you OK,get down, do as I say etc)The resistance made up of survivors all talk in American military speak in one scene and in the next are huddled round a fire being unskilled.The resistance seems to have limitless access to ammunition, fuel, arms etc, yet they have no factories to produce them?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Damn Good Effects, Awesome Action and Acting...But where's that DAMN TERMINATOR FEEL","I was waiting for this movie, the fourth installment of the Terminator series for a long like any other terminator fan.While watching the movie in the theater, I still remember all we friends were in the edges of our seats most of the time...damn good action really. And must mentionable visual effect and also a decent acting by all the characters. I found a few changes in the storytelling. Like the good terminator ""Marcus"" here have feelings like no other previous terminators we've seen in the previous movies. This movies shows how not to lose belief upon us. I was never expecting Arnold to appear. We all know without his appearance a terminator movie is all incomplete. Just when all of us were thinking that we're missing him badly, even after all damn action sequences; just then he appeared for a minute or more. But at least we got him....but remember this not our real hero Arnold, he's all animated in 3D. Anyways I liked this movie, enjoy totally...and all you terminator lover should take a look.But after all these good stuffs, somewhere in the heart of a true fan there will be a question that isn't something missing? Yes, the missing thing is The Arnold Feel and the Terminator Feel. But whatever...This was good movie...Waiting for the next installment.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Terminator"" is not the franchise with the brilliant sequels anymore","Somewhere in the back of my mind I had this idea that because ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" was not only one of the best sequels, but one of the best movies ever, that this would apply for the whole franchise. Well, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" pretty much put an end to that thought, but then filmmakers didn't really try to enter new territory with that movie. All they did was to remake ""Terminator 2"" (badly) and tack on a different ending. Now, ""Terminator Salvation"" is where the story could really have moved forward and the quality of the franchise might have picked up again.Learning that McG of all people would direct this movie, my hopes were pretty much destroyed before I ever saw the trailer for this movie. I mean, who thought that any fan would be happy with that decision? Who saw ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and decided this was the guy to direct a ""Terminator""-movie? Hollywood-politics I guess. Then Christian Bale was attached to this project, and at least he's an A-list actor, probably the biggest A-list actor around these days, but then he already is Batman, so why does he have to be John Connor, too?The foreshadowing wasn't all that promising. I didn't really look for scoop or anything from then on, but went into the cinema unprepared - well, as unprepared as you can be. Of course, some plot points and ""cameo"" surprises had already been revealed to me. What can you do. Anyway, I went into the movie without prejudices and with high hopes. Truth be told, it could have been worse, but it SHOULD have been a much better movie.""Terminator Salvation"" actually is a new chapter. A completely different movie to its predecessors that took place in our time. Those movies were road movies, edge-of-your-seat-hunts and fights between two opponents. This movie is a futuristic war movie. Suspense had to be replaced by action and explosions, and that premise could only mean that the fourth chapter in the saga would be very, very different.The most disappointing thing about ""Terminator Salvation"" (what has the title got to do with anything, BTW?) is that it screws around too much. The PG-13 rating harms the movie a lot. These Terminators aren't brutal death machines. They merely push people around and capture them. They're not as focused and threatening as the T-800 and the T-1000 were in parts 1 and 2. The timeline has been f_cked up completely by now. Some plot points lead nowhere, some characters aren't fleshed out (John Connor's wife, Marcus' love interest), others have only vague backstories (what exactly did Marcus do to deserve the death sentence? Who is Helena Bonham Carters character and what are her intentions?) And what's with all these characters anyway? Marcus, Star, the submarine captain? What have these people got to do with the ""Terminator"" canon?Not everything has been done wrong, though. You can see that scriptwriters really tried to satisfy fans and put in references to previous parts, but it just doesn't work most of the time. These references aren't made with style. They are shoved down our throats, like when the classic theme is used to introduce the T-800. It's almost like a parody bit. ""You Could Be Mine"" by Guns N' Roses is used, too, but instead of putting it to a kickas§-moment, it's just kind of random, as if McG wanted it to be somewhere in the movie, but couldn't be bothered to find a good place for it.The ending, however, is the biggest problem with ""Terminator Salvation"". Apparently it's the result of numerous last-minute-re-writes. As a viewer you'll be completely confused about what's going on. What was Skynets's plan? What was anybody's plan for that matter? Then there's a fight with a single Terminator (in a factory of Terminators) and a silly climax involving the near death of one character, which feels tacked on and not thought through.In the end, ""Terminator Salvation"" isn't much better or worse than part 3, but the lukewarm, box office result has shown that this isn't the movie fans have been waiting for. Making two more movies like this one seems pointless. TS may as well be the end of a franchise that once stood out for its one unbelievably great sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Thrilling action and ho-hum storytelling; a bit of a disappointment,"At this time of writing, I don't know what the critics are saying about Terminator Salvation, so I'm just going to relay my thoughts about the fourth installment of the Terminator series.In a departure from previous films, Terminator Salvation is set in the future, after Skynet, an artificial intelligence, wipes out much of humanity. The remaining humans (represented in a very brief montage partway through the movie) are mostly stuck as resistance fighters. John Conner ends up being a bit of a prophet figure (having all his experience with terminators and passed down knowledge about the future from his mother). Along the way, a (and this should be no spoiler) man who was possibly turned into a machine shows up and has to kick some ass as well.The story really feels by the numbers. It still has a little of that man-machine consideration in the character of Marcus Wright (the inmate turned cyborg), but its very little indeed. Everything moves along just as you'd expect it would. There are no surprises here (unless you're quite oblivious). In some ways, Terminator Salvation is a huge letdown, because there is so much potential in exploring the tensions of being a prophet (instead we get Christian Bale brooding) as well as another look at what makes humanity human (but that conflict seems entirely absent in Marcus and largely absent in anyone but briefly in John Conner). The story also works hard to make sure people don't notice its contrivances, by ratcheting up tension, especially around the characters of Kyle Reese and John Conner (from Terminator), both of whom Skynet had plenty of opportunities to wipe out, but somehow failed to do so. As such, believability was lost in the film for me about halfway through.There are some cute references in the script to past Terminators, which almost overstay their welcome, and the action and effects were nice, for what they were. But all of it felt a little ho-hum in the end to me. When it was all done, I felt like I'd watched a high-budget but less than average episode of a serialized television series. In some ways, Terminator has taken the opposite approach of the Aliens franchise. Aliens started out a simple and effective space-horror/action (primarily in the first two) and progressively added larger themes and ideas, becoming a big mess along the way. Terminator, on the other hand, had a lot of interesting science fiction ruminations (time-travel, destiny, the nature of humanity) under its gaunt and effective story (primarily in the first two) and then progressively loses all that for increasing action/special effects bluster. Technically, the movie is fine, but I feel that it's lacking the scope that embedded in its potential.It just doesn't seem to live up to what it could be and fumbles more than a few times to observant viewers. However, in terms of muscular action sequences and special effects, the film delivers and so it does stand as an effective summer blockbuster, great for audiences looking to escape the heat and get a couple thrills. But it's still a notable let down in terms of the legacy and cinematic storytelling. You can pass on this, but it does make for a decent distraction, if that's what you're looking for. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What is the problem ?,"1st Terminator will always be my favorite. It was the 80', I grew up....was maybe 12 years old when my mother brought this film home to watch together on VHS. I loved my Mom for being so cool to let me watch it and it completely hammered me away. Today, so many years later, I can hear my self sometimes humming the theme when ironing or doing dishes or something else which leaves to much space in my brain available. So it became part of my ""brain-screen-savers"", if you understand my meaning. The Terminator franchise is something important to me as I had bound so strong to the 1st.
Judgement Day then was again something which overwhelmed me. Now the 90', me still in school but this time it was Cinema with friends. Holy moly, they did it again. That was well spent time and money at that time. A real action block bluster and a worthy nr 2.
The 3rd was the first big disappointment. Typical 3rd.....nothing big anymore, mediocre in its acting and overall making. Only scenes still stuck a bit in my mind was the Truck-chase in the streets and Mrs Terminator who could inflate her boobies if needed. That was, I have to admit, an somewhat intreaging idea.
But Terminator was dead for me. They killed it.But they reanimated it as well! With Terminator Salvation !Sweet cast and absolutely fine crafted. It is an entertaining action movie with nasty robots, dooms-day feeling and heroes fighting in resistance. Good story, good action, good acting, and many little flash backs like Guns'n'Roses music and "" I'll be back"". Can you really expect more from something which was dead ? How can people here rate this film so badly? And if you know that anything which came and will come afterwards will be rubbish again, then this one earned its 8 stars from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Entertaining and acceptable, but ironically lacking a strong human element","The best thing to say about ""Terminator Salvation"" is at least they tried. Between the homage paid to the original films, the non-stop action and a myriad of different writers brought in to make the script as strong as possible, the producers really aspired to reinvigorate the Terminator franchise. ""Salvation"" was not meant to be a cheap attempt to capitalize on the Terminator brand. But not everyone will see it that way because the results stop at ""entertaining."" Despite the thematic cries of why humans will always be better than machines, there isn't heart written into the characters. The new vision is uninspired and flat.""Salvation"" takes place in the future -- those scenes we only got brief glimpses of during ""Terminator"" and ""T2: Judgement Day."" John Connor (Bale) is the leader of the human resistance living in the post-apocalyptic desert of the Death Valley area. He knows from his mother's tapes that he is to at some point send his father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) back in time to protect his mother (and ensure his birth and the survival of humanity), but we're far from that. Reese is a teenager at the moment and he's just met Marcus (Sam Worthington) who was sentenced to death in 2003 and is mysteriously alive. They're hoping to meet up with Connor and the resistance, who have just discovered a signal that shuts down the machines and they're hoping to use it on the SkyNet HQ.This information is enough to generate good action sequences, but it clearly lacks a singular focal character as well as an identifiable antagonist. In the first film it was Arnold and in the second it was T-1000 -- in ""Salvation"" it's just the machines in general. The dynamic of cat and mouse is gone and replaced with mostly mice running from the idea of a cat.Then there's the fact that this is the first film taking place in the future. Not a bad idea, per se, but McG's strengths lie in action film-making, not envisioning the world Cameron gave us just a taste of in the original films. That world was dark, lonely and no one could be trusted. This film toys around with trust and brings it up only when convenient for suspense purposes. It just throws all the characters in the desert because it looks like a wasteland. It just takes for granted the fact that so many films before it have established what the end of the world might look like (""Mad Max"" the prime example) that it doesn't establish its own rules.McG's ""Terminator"" is action-packed and constantly moving toward a fairly redeemable climax. The references to the previous films will please die-hard fans of the Terminator universe. The punch is simply not there -- the reason to care about any of the characters other than you knew them once when they were played by different actors and under the direction of a sci-fi genius. It is not an offensive robot-crunching atrocity, but it could use a bit more depth and heart.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simply awful,"This was simply one of the worst conceived movies in the Terminator series. This will very likely be thrown out and another made in its place, much like the recent ""Incredible Hulk"" remake.There were so many points in the movie where you just ask yourself, ""What the hell was the director, writer, UNDERWRITER, whoever thinking?"" The movie was very reminiscent of the first Terminator movie in terms of being a ""B"" movie, yet it had a huge budget for terribly misplaced CGI.There was no mention of HOW Kyle was sent back to the past. There was NO mention of sending him back other than to say ""If Kyle dies, the resistance is finished"". At one point, just before the siege on Skynet, it would have been more interesting (and plausible) if Bale had just dressed up as Batman or a Gramaton Cleric and gone in to destroy the place. I like Christian Bale. I really do. I feel for him. He did a fantastic job of acting this part out. He actually, probably, carried the film for most people. But the writing was amateurish at BEST.Just the worst writing for a big-budget movie in years!",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't understand the bad reviews at all...,"I'm not going to talk about the movie in detail (there are plenty of reviews about that). Instead, enough to say that it's an action-packed, enjoyable ride in the Terminator universe, with an OK plot and average actor performances. Since I knew McG was behind the camera, it was obvious the movie would not turn out as shiny as we wanted, but I enjoyed my time through the two-hour length of the film. Not an academy award best motion picture winner, but really enjoyable in the end. Great photography, jaw-dropping special effects with a balanced mixture between real and CGI elements, eye-candy believable terminator machines (don't know what bashers were expecting) and some enjoyable characters which lead the movie with such small effort.It gets to my nerves that lately everybody is waiting for the GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE every time they go to the theatres. You may think I am being too indulgent with McG, Christian ""tantrum"" Bale and the whole crew, but I had a good time enjoying this piece of visual entertainment which is Terminator Salvation. So if you are planning to have a nice time at your local theatre, give it a try. If you are ticking your Academy Awards' nominees list, just draw a cross in this one and move along. Otherwise, buckle up and enjoy the ride! :) 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This was an entertaining action film that still didn't live up to the first two pictures but is worth a viewing,"Terminator Salvation (2009) is a movie that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline focuses on John Connor post Dooms Day. He is sent on a mission to take down a base; meanwhile, in a parallel story a man who doesn't remember D-Day runs into a young Kyle Reese. Kyle tries to update the man on what is going on while trying to get him to John Connor. Kyle thinks the man can be helpful to John and the resistance.This movie is directed by McG (We Are Marshall) and stars Christian Bale (Dark Knight), Sam Worthington (Avatar), Anton Yelchin (Star Trek), Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd), Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World), Moon Bloodgood (Faster), Michael Ironside (Total Recall) and Common (Wanted).The story for this had a lot of potential and did a good job of tying in old sub plots and characters into the futuristic storyline. The action scenes for this are intense and very well done. The special effects were solid and modernized even if the terminators were more retro. The shootouts were very intense and well done also. The cast is pretty good but I was surprised how little Bale was in this. The final sequences and discoveries were solid, but I did think they could have skipped the CGI Arnold.Overall this was an entertaining action film that still didn't live up to the first two pictures but is worth a viewing. I would score this a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Piece of crap waste of money and time,"Sucks is too nice of a word for this crap-fest. I knew from the opening sequence this was going to be an enormous waste of my time, not to mention the 1 dollar it cost me.John Connor is not really in this movie very much, so I don't know why Bale is pushed as the star. He sucks anyway. He really is terrible. It took another over-hyped film The Dark Knight to make people even notice he existed.Lots of the stupid nonsense in this movie is, of course, listed in other reviews here but I've got to mention them anyway.This movie temporarily turned into Transformers when the giant robot came out of nowhere and began stomping things. Why are they collecting people? Why do Terminators struggle to get a hold of someone, TOSS THEM AWAY and then try to get them again? Does that make sense? Why do they have robot/motorcycles that crash all the time and have HUMAN CONTROLS? Bale gets on one and rides it away, so it must have steering and a shifter for humans. Now that's just gay.Why, at the very beginning of the movie, does a handgun shot to the head kill a Terminator who is on the ground, but later on not even machine gun fire to the head can stop them? HOW STUPID!!Just how did John Connor get into Skynet in the first place? This was HEADQUARTERS for Skynet. He plugged something in and doors opened. Hmm. Why have an army when one dufus can just infiltrate Skynet. And only one Terminator was guarding the door!Then, for no reason whatsoever and with no explanation, Arnold Schwarzenneger appears, naked, popping out of some cell where Kyle Reese is supposed to be (why they kept him alive is beyond reason.) Stupid.My favorite part, which made me leave the theater before Bale finished his stupid voice-over during the final minutes, was when the human/robot guy offers his heart to save John Connor. Here, take my heart! I know they just pop right in! You can do a heart transplant, right, pregnant lady? You can do that right here in this TENT! Look, there's a heart-lung machine and a team of 20 and a lifetime supply of anti-rejection drugs sitting right over there! Oh, and forget about compatibility. This will work because this movie is a steaming pile! Thanks for the money, SUCKER!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Welcome return for a classic franchise,"""T1"" (1984) and ""T2"" (1991) were terrific, but then both were written and directed by James Cameron. ""T3"" (2003) - directed by Jonathan Mostow - was not in the same class, but still thoroughly entertaining. Even as ""T3"" was released, we knew that Arnold Schwarzenegger was embarked on a political career that was likely to mean that (in spite of his catch phrase) he would not be back in the iconic role.Six years later, we are back - but with a different director and no Arnie and, in contrast with the largely contemporary settings of the first three movies, a story set in a post-apocalyptic 2018. At the helm on this occasion is McG (real name Joseph McGinty Nichol) - best-known for directing the two ""Charlie's Angels"" films - but some gravitas comes from the overly-intense Christian Bale as resistance leader John Connor and the Australian Sam Worthington as a cyborg with identity problems.The narrative can be summarised in just six words: one explosion after another after another. In the middle of all these conflagrations, there are no less than ten types of machine seeking to eradicate the remaining humans. So there's plenty of exciting action and impressive visuals, but it's a classic case of a triumph of style over substance with minimal characterisation, a plot that is implausible when it is not confusing, and an ending that is surprisingly and disappointingly weak. Nevertheless there's certainly enough to enjoy here to encourage the plan that ""Salvation"" will be the first of a new ""Terminator"" trilogy.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Extraordinary,but too fast...","I saw the movie yesterday and i can say the movie was awesome. From the beginning to the end.The only mistake for me is that they could put some more story,more explanations and stuff.Everything was moving pretty fast and that's only thing i didn't like about this movie,but i can live with it.Honestly i am a fan more to the second terminator than the first.Every time i see the end of T2 a tear falls.The direction,the story-telling,the action sequences--> everything was absolutely perfect.So,i was very excited hearing about this TS(after the disappointing,but not that awful T3). And then suddenly it's almost like a thunder ball hit me when i saw McG. Why the f**k McG?!!?! Who self-respected director would go by such a name..?!?!?! Charlie's Angels??!!? And now a $200 million dollars budget..??!?!?! Come on...Then i read some of his interviews in which he states that he is working with John Nolan,Christian Bale,Paul Haggis,Anthony Zuiker and i was a little relieved.Then i read that McG was a huge terminator fan and he wants to escape his awful reputation and i decided to give him the chance to impress me.And hell yeah .. he did.I really can't understand all the bad press.Really. Yeah McG is not Cameron.Anton Yelchin is not Michael Biehn and so on and so on.Now i thought the direction was very very impressive.I also prefer to see McG by the name Joseph Niccol,but in the end this is just a name.Don't hate him just because of it.He had his bad moments in TS,but most of the shots were absolutely perfect.Especially the one when i guy shouts""you brought it here"" and camera rounds around Kyle and Marcus and focuses on the Harvester.The opening scene,the ending scene,the fight between Marcus and the T-800 and many many more.Extraordinary. McG fully redeems himself with TS.The only thing i didn't like about this movie is that it doesn't have the balance between the action sequences and the story-telling like The Dark Knight for example.It moves fast,really fast.Something i don't like to see in a movie,but after all this is McG's first attempt of a big movie,so i forgive him for everything he messed up.I think that he will do a lot better if given the chance to direct T5(i don't know what more they can't think of though).TS brought us fun,pure fun.It showed us something that the great Cameron didn't want to do,because he thought it was a bad idea ""never do the same thing twice"".Well,McG took a big risk and i don't think he messed it up.He made a fine bridge between the next T-movies and the end of the war.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Acceptable sequel lacking emotional impact,"Finally, we get a Terminator movie that explores what happens during the actual war between the machines and the humans, a movie taking place during the apocalyptic glimpses seen in previous films. Was it properly exploited? Read on to find out.The action scenes were decent but were sometimes difficult to follow being victims of shaky camera-itis. Maybe it's just me but I didn't find them very thrilling either except for a few. Props to the helicopter crash scene from the pilot's perspective though. The visual effects were of high quality and the terminators never looked so good with a bigger variety than ever before although I'm still not sure about the moto terminator concept. For what might seem like more primitive terminators (in Los Angeles), please consider that the terminators seen in other films were from farther into the future. The sound effects were quite good especially the thuds from the bigger machines. Storywise, I found the plot had a few great ideas that weren't satisfactorily explored or explained, particularly Marcus' past and why the terminators started taking human prisoners instead of continuing to exterminate them. They didn't show us what actually happened and it felt like a missed opportunity. Certain plot elements didn't seem to make sense at the time and it bugged me throughout. I thought I was being difficult but after reading a few of the lower-rated reviews, I do indeed see there are major plot holes (especially involving Kyle Reese).More importantly, certain moments lacked the dramatic or emotional impact they should have had. In particular, there's a cool moment near the end I cannot specifically mention where you think to yourself ""holy crap! did they actually do this!"" only to be drastically minimized just afterwards (you thinking, ""how lame"") and then brought back later in a different location when the dramatic impact was already defused. The finale, which should have been heart-wrenching, simply flat-lined on an emotional level. The dialogs were mostly lackluster and seemed to like stating the obvious (Evasive maneuvers!). I liked the characters of Kyle Reese and Marcus and thought they were played well but although Christian Bale was his usual intense self, he didn't portray the quieter moments convincingly. He seemed one-dimensional.Visually, the colors seemed bleached out making everything look grittier and gloomier. I understand the reason why but I didn't particularly care for it. The production design and settings were OK but weren't particularly original or memorable (nowhere near the skull-covered grounds of previous films). I was also disappointed at the lack of full-scale military engagements between machine and human. The actual ""war"" you might have expected from trailers was not really shown, it was mostly skirmishes or duels. Overall though, it's a good sequel lacking the heart and emotional core of the others. If you've seen the previous films, you'll want to see this, perhaps not worth full price in theaters, but try not to think too hard about logical inconsistencies and to enjoy the action/visual effects for their own sake. If you haven't seen the previous films, you might be lost and I would recommend watching at least one Terminator film before (I would say Terminator 2, the highlight of the series).Rating: 6 out of 10.

First, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a fan of the first two Terminator films I was never obsessed with them and so I didn't go into this film looking for it to recapture the feel of the first two. I was just looking for an entertaining action film with decent acting and I felt it delivered on both of these levels.As a side note, I have to begrudgingly admit that Sam Worthington was perfectly cast in his role.

Enjoyable while not being 7 worthy,"I'd have given it 6.5 If it was possible. Not quite a 7. But a welcome return of a serious Terminator movie after the farce that was T3. Great effects. A decent storyline that adds to the whole universe. Couple of bits that are a bit meh include. The character of Star. Doesn't add much really. Cute kid factor but reeked way too much of an attempt at the wee savage kid from Mad Max or Newt from Alien. Found the whole submarine headquarters theme a bit of an add on in the vein of 90's army General puts on the tough love act, could have not existed and been unmissed. Thought Worthington Yelchin and Bale all played their part well. The CGI Arnie was a bit cheesy. But not to the level where it was ridiculous. Overall a decent film in its own right that didn't rely too heavily on the old formula. Expanded on the universe in a way that was fresh and enjoyable without being groundbreaking. Nothing is ever going to rival T2 or T1 for that matter. I'm my opinion Salvation is the 3rd best movie in the franchise. Enjoyable without being exceptional.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What! Metal Gear!?,"I'm not one to advocate piracy, if only because it gives the McGs, Bays and W.S Andersons an argumentative advantage should any of their dross ever actually lose money. Nor am I one to revisit a widely publicised train wreck simply to stick the boot in. However when this dropped I attempted everything to avoid paying for it without being left out of the water cooler sewing circle. Any internet pundit worth their 'retro gaming' review site was picking apart continuity errors in Terminator 4 long before Bale lost his rag. And that alone is what prompted me to throw my De Bono hat o' many colours into the bog. A large chuck of Western Civilization refuses to grow up.

Not that this is a GOOD thing, but it is wiser to treat THEIR icons with a lil' bit of respect lest you become as universally loathed as George Lucas.Yes, the third one was much worse. Even meth addicts knew that.

It's not funny, it's not ""awesome"", it's not fun, it's just sad. Bale wants to make the effort, but after hearing a line like ""you have to send your father back in time so you can be born"" all he can do is facepalm. I caught myself at that moment contemplating a chuckle, which is rarer than catching yourself thinking. Feel guilty for making fun of Bale now?Restraining myself from whinging about bleedingly obvious holes in plot, continuity and logic, the crumminess of the pre-T-800 terminators (complete with Doc. boots and superfluous clothing) and the fact that everybody is trying their damnedest to give weight to the names John Connor and Kyle Reese by pausing and looking shocked after they say them, this is more a hatchet job on entertainment itself. Not so much a night out as slow punishment for those who gave it the benefit of the doubt. What do we have to show for this decade?

No salvation for the Terminator,"I am sad to say Director McG destroyed this franchise. His casting was terrible. Christian Bale is a great edgy character actor. He could not sell the audience he is the kind hearted John Connor. Bale should have been the Terminator. Sam Worthington would have been a better choice as John Connor. McG story telling at best was confusing. The story was all over the place with weak dialog. The visual effects looked great but they did not help tell the story. They actually made it more confusing because most of the time they had no purpose. His many battle scenes went on so long that they became boring. McG put in a lot of nonsense. Example, Connor has a piece of iron the size of a 2x4 plunged in to his chest that protrudes out his back. The next scene he is on the operating table looking like he was there for a yearly check up and the doctor say I think he has a bad heart. The movie is bad, boring, ridiculous and a big disappointment. Not even a good rental.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
THIS should have been Terminator 3,"Just saw Terminator Salvation and had a blast. At last, the bleak future that was hinted at in the first two Terminator films is fully revealed - and it's awesome. I never got that feeling from T3, which felt more like a rehash of everything we've already seen with a few twists thrown in. Salvation felt fresh and left me wanting more - instead of wanting it to end. The action scenes were intense and imaginative: they did the Terminator brand-name proud. Finally, it's a real treat when you get to see great acting in an action flick. Christian Bale - the dude pours himself into John Connor. It makes the myth on the screen that much more powerful. Pretty good movie - bring on the next chapter.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"""Terminator Salvation"" is a sci-fi action film released in 2009, directed by McG and starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington.","""Terminator Salvation"" is a sci-fi action film released in 2009, directed by McG and starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. It is the fourth installment in the Terminator film series and serves as a prequel to the original 1984 film. Set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by war between humans and machines, the film explores themes of survival, redemption, and the nature of humanity.The story takes place in the year 2018, approximately fourteen years after Judgment Day, the event in which Skynet, an artificial intelligence system, launched a nuclear holocaust to exterminate humanity.

Along the way, he encounters Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington), a mysterious stranger with a troubled past who becomes embroiled in the conflict between humans and machines. As they join forces to confront Skynet, they uncover shocking revelations about Marcus' true nature and his connection to the war.""Terminator Salvation"" is known for its high-octane action sequences, impressive visual effects, and intense performances from its cast. Christian Bale delivers a commanding portrayal of John Connor, conveying the character's determination and inner turmoil with conviction. Sam Worthington brings depth to the role of Marcus Wright, infusing the character with a sense of humanity amidst the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world.While the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was praised for its ambitious storytelling and immersive world-building. Fans of the Terminator franchise appreciated its exploration of the war-torn future glimpsed in previous films, as well as its nods to the mythology established by the earlier installments.Overall, ""Terminator Salvation"" offers an adrenaline-fueled ride through a dystopian landscape, blending spectacle with thought-provoking themes.

Not all that bad...,"Of course I have watched the 2009 movie ""Terminator Salvation"" before, but as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the director's cut edition of the movie here in 2024, of course I opted to do so.And right on the top of my head I can't say what the difference is between the ordinary theatrical cut and this director's cut that I just sat through.Regardless, the storyline in ""Terminator Salvation"", as written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, is an enjoyable one, for sure. However, it wasn't exactly the best of forays into the franchise. Watchable for what it was, sure, the movie was a prequel of sorts to the original 1984 ""The Terminator"" movie, for better or worse. I think it actually worked well enough, if you can look past the fact that it is Christian Bale that plays John Connor here.The movie does have a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood,
Helena Bonham Carter, Bryce Dallas Howard and Michael Ironside on the cast list. And while I do think Christian Bale is a good actor, it just was a big pair of shoes to take on portraying the role of John Connor.Visually then ""Terminator Salvation"" was good. The CGI and special effects are good. Well, for the majority of the movie, right up until the reveal of the CGI abominable version of Schwarzenegger. Sure, it looked like him, but it was just so painstakingly obvious CGI, and of a relatively poor quality. But hey, it was a nice touch to have the original Terminator show up in the prequel, fake CGI animated or not.If you are a fan of the ""Terminator"" franchise, then the 2009 movie ""Terminator Salvation"" should prove entertaining for you to sit down and watch.My rating of ""Terminator Salvation"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One word......Excellent!!,"Two of my favourite films of all time are T1 and T2. T3 was a mess! More like a comedy than a Terminator film.After reading the various reviews for T4, I was very pessimistic to say the least but was looking forward to watching it none the less! Anyway, after seeing it, I have one word to describe the film......Excellent! I cannot understand why it has received so many bad reviews. If you take the film for what it is, a post apocalyptic war movie, then it ticks all the boxes. Yes it does have plot holes, but if you are like me and want to be ""entertained"" when going to watch a movie, than this is for you! The action sequences, special effects, sound, pace, etc is all right up there with the best of them.For me anyway I hope they continue the story as it has so much potential, I go to the cinema at least 2-3 times a month and this is one of the best films I have seen in the last couple of years!

Action time!,"This is a good sequel, respectful to the original Terminator mythos. It does not add something to the story, it does not play with the time travels and interactions between timelines (for good, as the next sequels have proven unfortunately). The whole movie is mainly a battle in the future -unlike the other movies of the series-, where John Connor is already a top fighter but not yet the supreme leader of the Resistance, and Kyle Reese a young boy which becomes a fighter. Both are played very well.So we can see it as a good break time from the main ""time travel"" stories: The battle in the future, plus, the first contact of John Connor with the young Kyle Reese.Great action scenes, and robots-machines (without ridiculously evolved liquid medal and not-only cyborgs; just machines.The good -or bad?- person -human?

The only Salvation would've been them ending at 'T2.',"I gave Christian Bale credit for bringing the true ""Batman voice/bark"" to Batman in 'The Dark Knight,' despite the general public's ignorance on the true Batman and how he communicated. Unfortunately, against my argument, he uses it again in 'Terminator: Salvation' and this time, it really didn't fit.Aside from that, we have just a money-grabbing sequel that basically just showed ""Judgment Day"" combat scenes and was completely unnecessary. Yes, it has bangs, some good action sequences and yet another great Asian female kicking butt. But, what's gone is: the heart, the character development, the suspense, the acting and the good, sometimes funny dialogue from the first 2 films – the only ones that should count. 'T3' was a complete waste of space, so I don't count that one, and though this 'T4' is slightly better, it also shouldn't count. No wonder James Cameron didn't approve of this sequel.The series was as perfect as it could've been as well as a complete story with the original 'Terminator' and 'T2.' I seriously laughed out loud at the clichéd ""bad guy revealing the evil plot to the hero"" towards the end, downgrading Skynet to a mere human and stereotyped villain. Also, I respect Carter, but she was equally as bad in her cancer role, and what was with the helicopter dive to the submarine? Seriously? I should've listened to myself with my promise not to see another 'Terminator' sequel after 'T3' – the same promise I made on this dismal 'Jurassic Park III.' Yet, I did like Worthington and Bloodgood's performances, but Bale was certainly not at his best, and that kid, Jadagrace practically made me crack up as a cross between 'Aliens' kid Newt, 'Day Earth Stood Still' kid Jacob and a mini-Sideshow Bob. What a completely unoriginal character, as were most stand-ins.And enough with the homage to the original films – every 20 minutes – which only made me want to watch them again VS this one again Most of it was extremely predictable and got zero reaction from the audience I was with. Not the worst movie, but a severe downgrade from 'T1 and 2.'",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I am not going to blast this film and say that it was horrible. On the other hand I am not going to praise this film and say it was awesome. There were parts of the film that could have gone places and then quit just short of getting there. There were also parts of this film that should have quit well before it got where it did. While the two leads did a decent job of acting their roles the rest of the supporting cast were sub-par. I especially disliked the portrayal of Kyle Reese by Anton Yelchin. Not so much as his acting was bad, just the way the role was written.

The Story Lacks Slightly but Definitely Worth Seeing,"I just went to see Salvation last night and I must say I definitely enjoyed it. There is no question that this movie legitimately warrants the $5-10 bucks people will shell out to see this on the big screen (it is certainly worth seeing it on the big screen if nothing else). OK, so the story lacks a little bit, actually it lacks a lot. There isn't really a whole lot of substance to this film but the potential is there.It's nearly impossible to avoid the frequent belittlement of Director McG regarding this movie and I think it needs to be addressed. Yeah, maybe he isn't the next Steven Spielberg but nonetheless he's giving it his all. For the haters who claim McG is the reason this movie is ""trash"", they need to point the finger elsewhere. Though the dialogue in this movie probably only constitutes about 10 pages of the script and can be summed up in any one of the theatrical trailers, the blame should not fall on McG but rather the screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris. McG didn't write the script for this, he was in charge of making this movie pretty, and believe me this movie is pretty.The visual effects in this film are second to none. I was simply blown away at the intensity conveyed in some of the action sequences and the cinematography is stellar. Props to the production design and art direction of this movie for creating such a believable and realistic post-nuclear world that is so bleak, barren. The various models of Terminators in Salvation are bigger, meaner and more bad-ass than ever before and the explosions only get bigger as the movie rolls on. There is no doubt this movie is a summer-action-get your popcorn ready-blockbuster movie, and it should be treated as so.Though Bale seems almost typecast from his role as Batman, he is still the perfect fit as John Connor. Let's just hope Public Enemies (later this summer) and his next Terminator performance encompass more emotion so that we don't see Bale succumb to the regretfully same generic action hero that Nicholas cage has become.Even though the story lacks slightly in this movie, we have to collect ourselves and take a step back to realize that development for another movie is already underway. Lets be positive and think of this movie as a segue, merely a transition to familiarize the audience with the barren, post-apocalyptic landscape, and the key players of the resistance for the ensuing, and more complete story yet to come in the next film. Keep your fingers crossed.All in all, this movie is worth seeing simply for the unbelievable visual-effects, just try not to be too nitpicky.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Terminator Salvation (2009) **1/2,"I approached this fourth entry in the Terminator series with many reservations, knowing it was going to be nothing more than a wild, overblown, CGI-fest. But then I figured while I waited to buy my ticket: ""well, isn't that what this particular chapter ought to be?"", and it worked out okay with me. After all, if you're a fan of the other Terminator films like I am, you already know this day has been long coming where the machines will destroy mankind and the remaining humans who make up ""The Resistance"" are going to try to fight them and remain alive, to protect what's left of the human race. So what other way is there to show so much gross chaos and devastation? Much as I don't support overused CGI on principal, it seems that this type of movie would not have been as possible 25 years ago. Luckily, this is not ""all"" special effects. I was clued in on some of the plot details beforehand by foolishly reading a newspaper review (which also spoiled a surprise late in the show which I won't get into here), but as slight as the story is, at least there is one ... with John Connor (now appropriately played by the heroic Christian Bale) trying to locate the teenage Kyle Reese who, as we already know from the original TERMINATOR, will be Connor's own father. Thrown in for good measure is a second hero with a past history that's kind of interesting. Not a good movie, nowhere hear as great as the first two, and probably a notch below Number Three. I liked the casting of Christian Bale in this, given his popularity with the new Batman movies and also because he is believable in the part of a strong leader. But as an added bonus, Bale is much more acceptable as the grownup version of Edward Furlong (from T2) compared to the badly miscast Nick Stahl (T3). **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
If we stay the course we are dead! We are all dead!,"This is the sequel we never wanted, with the director we never wanted. A film that was made hoping to make a lot of money because of the fanbase, but really just annoyed the Terminator fanboys straight away.Terminator Salvation is the first Terminator film that does not have a Terminator going back in time with the mission to kill John Connor in some way or form. This one film looks at the war between the Human Resistance and the Machines after the nuclear war known as Judgement Day. Set in 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) has been an iconic but rebellious member of the resistance. He leads a team in the fight against the machines. In a raid his team receive information about a signal that could disable the machine and win the war for humanity. They also discovery that the machines have a kill list, with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) on the top of it. During the raid, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted killer is awaken from suspended animation. He is shocked to discover that Los Andreas is a hollow deserted city and ends up meeting Kyle Reese and a mute child (Jadagrace Berry). Along his travels Reese is captured and he ends up joining the resistance. He becomes their best hope at stopping the machines.I wanted to like this, there was some potential and no way it could have been worst then Terminator 3. I think critics were willing to brash this film for two reasons, first misjudging T3 (which was T2 made as a parody), and simply because McG directed this film. There are some positives, there are some good action sequences, especially when the Terminator was on the screen, references to the previous films, and Sam Worthington was very good in this film.But there are a lot of problems with this film that really held it back. I am also critical of McG as a director. He is a music video director who only knows how to direct 3 to 4 minute sequences. He is not good at story or character direction and he over stylises scenes, like when John Connor tried to take off in the helicopter. He over edits, and there are scenes when the camera can't stay still when it really should. He is not good at directing actors. The film lacked the dark and gritty feel it really needed, some moments were be a bit too melodramatic. It wasn't dirty enough, compared to Lord of the Rings where you believed in the medieval style world it was set in. Some of the ideas and scenes were pretty much copied from other films. These include, The Mute Child (Mad Max 2), Steady Cam Battle Scene (Children of Men), The jet plane dog fight (Independence Day), the human harvesting (War of the Worlds (2005)), the radio messages (I Am Legend), some of the robot designs (Iron Man), the CPR scene and the bridge attack (Mission Impossible III). But McG can direct an action scene, and more then a glorfied camera man like Brett Ratner. He can do smaller projects like We Are Marshall and should do more to build up his skill level. And really needs to change his name, because a grown man should not call himself McG!But I think the main problem with the film is the script. It was written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, who wrote the Terminator 3 and Catwoman (not good signs). It was rewritten a lot by Paul Haggis, Shawn Ryan, Johnathan Nolan and Anthony E. Zuiker, even during the middle of filming. It shows because some of the dialogue was weak, stiff or overdone: in T1 and T2 it was so cool, but not in this. The story too was nothing special, with both the writers and McG not sure whether to focus on Marcus or John Connor. The story reminded me of a Sonic the Hedgehog fanfiction which was a lot better then this script (and I really mean that because it was the fanfiction was well written). This Terminator film also suffers from a lack of a Terminator as either a good or bad guy. He is a compelling forces because of his power. There were ideas that were not used well, like the fine line between man and machine who how would humanity survive a post nuclear world. I also felt the resistance shouldn't have been an organised military force, but more a guerrilla force like the Viet-con or the Iraqi insurgency. This was meant to be the point when humanity was loosing really badly. Kyle Reese in the first film stated that he was born in a machine camp and it was John Connor who saved him. That should have been shown and not him fighting alone in LA. If the story was stronger, it might have worked better as a stand alone film.Whilst Sam Worthington was good in this film, most of the actors didn't do so well. Christian Bale, an actor I like a lot and normally picks his films very carefully, is on auto-pilot in this film. This is particularly specially because he had a famous rant when on set and he was staying in character when it happened. Common as Bale's second in command was really poor and wooden, and it must have been a struggle to carry him in the film. Bryce Dallas Howard was underused, and Helena Bonham Carter, one of my favourite actress didn't give her role her all. Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin were decent, but their character's lacked depth, especially Moon Bloodgood.The trailer pretty much shown the best scenes of the film.For the Terminator film no one wanted I give it a 2 out of 5. I wanted to like it but ended up getting disengaged with it. I think a director like Bryan Singer or Darren Aronofsky could have done so much more with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wall-to-wall post-apocalyptic action needed more time to breathe,"The first couple of Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmakers' decision to set this fourth installment (2009) in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI face, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand are: Conner's mate, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter in a peripheral role.On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is that there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that strings together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, but we barely know them and therefore hardly care. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfires due to overkill. That's why they call it ""overKILL."" It's a curious thing but all too true.Be that as it may, there are enough positive elements in ""Terminator Salvation"" to make it worth checking out if you've seen the first two films. For instance, Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until he is informed otherwise. At around the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between two characters sharing a warm moment in a world gone mad. The film would have been more effective if it contained more scenes like this. But there's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters. Meanwhile Bryce Dallas Howard has a uniquely beautiful face (although she's pregnant throughout the story). There are also some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.Bottom line, if you love action, you'll get it here. There are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots and Schwarzenegger-bots, all trying to terminate the protagonists. Since the events take place in a post-apocalyptic world it's reminiscent of films like ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970), ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) and, especially, ""Reign of Fire"" (2002), albeit with constant outrageous thrills.The first two films in the series successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. ""Terminator Salvation,"" on the other hand, only captivates marginally in preference for wall-to-wall action. That's too bad, but it has its moments; it's thankfully not as bad as ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes.

Terminated...,"Fot the fourth installment of the Terminator franchise, McG took the director's reins and steered the series towards something new. Terminator Salvation (2009) brings the story into the future war between the machines and the remaining human ”resistance” (or terrorists...) - an event which the previous films have all flirted with but something we haven't yet fully seen on screen. It could've been great: a post-apocalyptic world, people trying to survive in any means they can, machines hunting them day and night without a break, intense atmosphere etc...But sadly it isn't great, it isn't even good or passable but very poor. There's plenty of action in the film; big explosions, big machines, big everything... but that's all there really is. The film, without a stop, jumps from another scene packed with action to another – and that would be just fine (like in the previous Terminator films) if the scenes or the action were imaginative and interesting or that there was an intriguing storyline being told in the process but Terminator 4 hasn't got any of those aspects in it.The lack of a real or interesting story is what brings the film down. I could take the poor action and even the lousy performances from the cast if the story was right but now everything just has gone south. And it's a bit odd because I thought the principle idea of the story was great and something not seen in the Terminator -universe before but from the very first minutes of the film you'll find out that something has gone terribly wrong in the writing process (or with the executives..?) and the story filmed here is lousy, full of plot holes and shallow characters, cheesy dialog and so forth.The cast (as I hinted above) isn't doing the best they can either; especially Christian Bale (John Connor) was a disappointment, Sam Worthington (Marcus Wright) not being that much better – and they're the two leading stars you could expect a good performance, no matter what the script was like.Terminator Salvation is (sadly) a generic action rampage without any thought. The great post-apocalyptic setting is waisted alongside with the legacy of the three (or two...) previous films (a great source material by the way, though used ridiculously poorly) so badly that it's criminal. I know they're making a fifth one but I've lost interest. 1/4",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This is Judgment Day?,"Terminator Salvation (2009)** (out of 4)Fourth film in the series is a crashing halt due to some rather bland direction and an even blander vision of a screenplay. This time the film takes place in 2018, after Judgment Day, and it appears the machines are about to destroy the human race. John Connor (Christian Bale) is still battling the machines as a mysterious man (Sam Worthington) tries to help the young Kyle Reese reach safety. I know a lot of people were going into this film with low expectations but I actually had high ones but they were pretty much letdown by the twenty-minute mark and things really didn't get any better. I would personally argue against the PG-13 rating and I wasn't too thrilled with a certain star not being involved but the biggest problem here was the rather lackluster direction by McG. The entire vision of the post-Judgment Day came as a major disappointment. After hearing about these events in the first three movies I couldn't help but have a ""that's it?"" feeling while watching this movie. Yes, the effects are bigger and there are some newer creations but none of them had a Judgment Day feel to them. You might say the events here are just leading for a bigger fifth film but that doesn't make this one here any better. I found the action scenes to be over the top but to me they were just a bunch of noise without any emotion or punch to them. The only thing that saved this film from being a complete bomb was the final thirty-minutes after a certain twist in the story that I won't ruin. I thought the twist was the first time anything smart actually happened and it's one of the few scenes where it appears some thought and character development was going on. I always enjoy watching Bale but found him to be another disappointment here. I didn't mind his dark and gloomy voice in the two Batman movies but I found it rather annoying here. Sam Worthington is the one who really steals the film here and at times I couldn't help but wish he was playing Connor. Helena Bonham Carter is wasted in her role. There's a cameo here, which was certainly meant to make you cheer but I found it to be very stupid and rather corny. Will I go watch a fifth film? I certainly will but I really hope it's a major improvement over this one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As big and soulless as a terminator,"Think about the original Terminator. Think about the clever premise, the emotional resonance, the humor, the suspense and the special effects. Now get rid of everything except the special effects and about half the suspense and you've got Terminator Salvation. This movie is a big-budget action picture that simply throws a lot of action sequences at you one after the other. This makes for a perfectly watchable action flick, but it is also easily the weakest entry in the series.It also should have been the last entry. Producers have been squeezing everything out of the Terminator franchise they can for years, but the only reason to jump into the future is to show you how the premise of the previous movies and the TV series pay off. Instead, you have what will probably be the first in a series of big soulless action flicks that continue this big, uninteresting war story.They would have been better off just making a movie version of the tragically short-lived TV series, but at this point I feel Terminator is just done. There is nothing left.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good action movie.  Not up to the ""Terminator"" standard.","OK, So T2 is my favorite movie of all time, so naturally I was excited to see that a fourth installment was being delivered. The trailer was enough to get me Fandangoing my tickets. And that is just about as far as my delight got. Here's the thing: the movie isn't bad...as an action movie. But the Terminator franchise goes beyond ""action movie"". The Terminator story is sci-fi gold. It's almost as if the writers didn't fully appreciate the mythology of the Terminator series. As far as the film itself goes, the visual effects are well done, and the acting/directing isn't horrible. But the story lacks the mental ""kick-in-the-balls"" that came along with the other Terminators. So much more could have been done with the relationship between John Connor and Kyle Reese. The writers really missed an opportunity to develop a strangely sentimental father/son relationship. I am reluctant to give this movie anything more than 6 stars, but because it is now part of the Terminator canon, I'll throw an extra star in there. See this movie, but don't expect the ground-breaking visuals or mind-bending sci-fi that were present in the previous installments.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Less Disappointing than RISE OF THE MACHINES,"After revisiting McG's venture into the war against machines, I find I may have been a little too harsh on TERMINATOR SALVATION. I was pretty brutal in my discussions with friends on the movie, but now it doesn't seem nearly as bad. Maybe it's because I've also rewatched WOLVERINE and TRANSFORMERS 2 and realized this wasn't even close to be the worst movie of 2009. In fact, as long as you're just looking for a good action film, this does it's job and manages to entertain (albeit, brainlessly). Continuing the canon of the first three films, the movie finds John Connor (Christian Bale) rising through the ranks of the resistance against the machines, though there are still many doubters toward his ""prophet"" status. Meanwhile, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) reawakens after 15 years to discover there's been some major changes, to himself and to society. Together, Connor and Wright must cooperate if they want to rescue a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) from Skynet before they can alter Connor's history.As is generally the case with the TERMINATOR franchise, the plot isn't too complicated. In this film, the real stars are the special effects and CGI. Being that the film occurs during the war with Skynet, we're treated to a nice collection of new machines, ranging from the snakelike Hydrobots to the massive Harvester, and of course the T-800s (fresh off the factory line). The effects were incredible and the money was obviously well spent in bringing the war to life. The variety of killer machines make for some great action pieces, particularly Connor's climactic battle against a familiar face. Focus on the action spectacles in the film and I doubt you'll find yourself disappointed in the end.Christian Bale continues to prove he's got box office power, especially in the summer, as he adds another iconic character to his resume as John Connor. He isn't given much to work with, and he spends the majority of the movie growling, grumbling, or yelling but he's still a welcome addition. Sam Worthington does a fine job and I'm pretty sure, if the trailers hadn't ruined his character's major development before the movie was ever released, his performance would've been that much more impressive as it left the audience wondering ""is he or isn't he?"" before his big reveal in the second act. Rounding out the cast are some shallow, but decent enough supporting performances from Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes in the role as Kate Brewster), Moon Bloodgood being that perfect mix of tough/beautiful as a fighter pilot, and Anton Yelchin who, while he's been in some major roles in STAR TREK and TERMINATOR, still needs some time to grow on me.In all honestly, this isn't as terrible a movie as it's been made out to be. It's gotten a pretty bad reputation and it bombed at the box office, but as long as you don't go into the film taking it seriously (the plot holes won't let you), you can still find enough entertainment value. If nothing else, at least we can take solace in the fact that it wasn't as lame as TERMINATOR 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"It's a great movie, the date of release... not so much","This movie has been thrashed in ways it shouldn't. The rating, the date of release, the Box-Office success, the critics, everything is going to make this movie go to hell before it's time.This IS A GOOD MOVIE...yet, truth be told, this is not the usual Terminator Movie, but it's also true that the usual Terminator movie died with the 2nd one, the third is a bad combination of good elements.This is something that must be taken as it is: An amazingly well done action movie with terminators and John Connor in it.The issue with TS is that the nemesis is way too big... you'll see, the previous movies had A terminator to fight against, A terminator to center the evil part of the movie. Here we have countless terminators and a humongous skynet to fight against. It's quite logical to get the perception of emotionless characters if they're THAT hopeless.McG did a great job directing, and the details are there to prove how dedicated he was to make action sequences the way they're meant to be made TODAY. (real speed on bombastic action, steady-cam on the big picture, first-person on the character centered sequences, detailed sound, etc.).As to some people, the movie has many holes, filling them all will be insulting for fans and most smart people. The holes critics claim it has, is the way the characters deal with their reality, I mean, why has everything to be explained? It's not a 114 minutes long animated manual, it's a movie!. A movie that actually leaves many choices to be made on the sequels, a respectful movie, a movie meant to bee seen on the big screen.Watch the movie before discussing it, it's worth it, at least for the eye candy it provides countless times.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It felt good to hear that theme music again. I enjoyed it. It was a good Terminator movie and a even better action movie.,"When walking into the cinema i was deeply worried. McG? the guy who directed Charlies Angels? They got someone like that to direct a Terminator movie? That was a very big risk. But luckily he pulled off a decent installment in one of the biggest movie franchise's of all time.Terminator Salvation is missing some of the gems that made the other installments fun. Firstly no sense of humor. Secondly where's John Connor. He doesn't swear, he doesn't have attitude. Lastly, Hardly any violence. Which people would already know due to the American rating PG-13.Luckily they got some things right. I loved the references to the old Terminator's. Made me feel at home. Also i loved the ending. Felt like classic Terminator style.The biggest part of this movie is the war against the machines. What does that mean? Well it means action and lots of it. Explosions, car chases, guns, booms, bangs, kaboom. It never lets up in this movie but at the same time never goes over the top. The action scenes were great. Felt like a mix of classic Terminator and Transformers.Before seeing this i felt like there would be no story just action scenes. The writers nicely put a story in that ties in with the first Terminator. Since the story ties in with previous Terminator movies you should see Terminator 1,2,3 just to be safe in the story area.The Special Effects were amazing. Giant robots never looked so good. The acting was good and i liked the casting. From start to finish the movie is action with a great ending and a nice cameo. I felt relieved that the movie went out strong and was so happy to hear the old theme song again. Nice job Danny Elfman.This was classic Terminator with a bit of new blood thrown in. It worked well and i would go see Terminator 5. There are some who will hate it but i just sat back and enjoyed the ride and so should you. I recommend it if your a Terminator fan. It was better then Terminator 3: Rise of the machines but it didn't match up to Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I give Terminator Salvation...8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another Average Action Film...,"Im not going to repeat over and over again whats been said about this film compared to the T1 & 2.There was one thing that annoyed me. Okay in the first two films you see shots of the future war, you see the world torn apart by nuclear war. You see a dark sky and humans fighting on a post apocalyptic battle ground. Since its the future they are using laser guns, not machine guns. It creates a real scary atmosphere and you also feel nervous for these humans fighting in that atmosphere...and I applaud James Cameron for that.Even though I have seen the first two films about 20 times each when I am watching the terminators chase Sarah/John Connor I still feel on the edge of my seat and the intensity kills me! Cameron creates sort of like a ""terminator atmosphere"" So Terminator salvation is set in that future and I feel nothing like that, there's no ""terminator"" atmosphere to it and you hardly even see and t-800's in the film. If you are going to create a film based on previous master pieces I feel you have to copy exactly what they didn't that concept of the film and Salvation done the complete opposite.Big Transormer type terminators chasing humans on a desert with machine guns, sorry just doesn't feel anything like Terminator. It really was a pathetic attempt.Just another average action film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Second Chance,"In ""Terminator Salvation"" with his very existence in jeopardy and the entire Human Resistance threatened, powerful and impassioned Christian Bale as leader John Connor declares, ""If we stay the course, we are dead. We are all dead!"" Christian Bale is such an intense and explosive presence. He has also been publicized for his personal explosion on the set of ""Terminator Salvation"". Perhaps, this was warranted or not? Bale has since apologized for his lapse in judgment and manners. Bale's passion and intensity elevates Director McG's ""Terminator Salvation"". Up until now, McG's most noteworthy movies were ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". Being a ""Terminator"" fan and a huge fan of the first two movies by James Cameron, hearing about ""Terminator Salvation"" seemed bit of a crap shoot. McG does well. The director pays homage to the mythology, and creates a new one particularly in the character of Marcus Wright, brilliantly played by charismatic Sam Worthington. The story by John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Jonathan Nolan (""The Dark Knight"") is action driven and compelling pathos.""Terminator Salvation"" works, because Worthington matches Bale's intensity and power. Their styles compliment. Especially from the ""Batman"" movies, Bale embodies a fierce internal drive and intelligence. He also balances a sense of compassion in Resistance Leader John Connor. Worthington as Marcus Wright, who may be the demise of Bale's Connor or as he says, ""I'm the only hope you have"" is tortured and courageous resolve. Worthington balances strength and vulnerability. At the story arc, John (Bale) asks Marcus (Worthington), ""You think you're human?"" Marcus tells Resistance fighter (beautiful and strong Moon Bloodgood), ""Everyone deserves a second chance"" This spirit echoes throughout ""Terminator Salvation"". That spirit lightens McG's very dark and violent vision of this Post Apocalyptic world.The Terminator machines in the movie are amazing, and the action sequences are pulse pounding thrill rides. There is a spectacular scene where a Skynet drone demolishes a bridge during a high speed chase. And in the climax, the battle with Bale, Worthington, and the ""old school"" Terminator is very cool.We first meet Marcus Wright in 2003, prior to his execution. He literally signs his life away to dying Dr. Kogan (frighteningly frail Helena Bonham Carter), who works for Cyberdyne Systems. In the Terminator mythology, Cyberdyne designed Skynet as the ultimate autonomous defense system. However, when Skynet is deployed the system becomes sentient and causes the nuclear holocaust, Judgment Day.Now 2018, Kyle Reese (spirited Anton Yelchin) rescues wondering Marcus from Terminator attack in the Los Angeles wasteland. He says, ""Come with me, if you want to live!"" There are pockets of Resistance scattered throughout the remainder of the world. Kyle Reese, though a teenager, will become the father of John Connor (Bale)—part of the narrative paradox. Marcus and John are destined to meet. But are they defining heroes, or tragic rivals in the ultimate conflict? Bale and Worthington are awesome in this matching of wills and humanity. The supporting cast is strong for the most part. Moon Bloodgood is great as Marcus's friend Blair Williams. Anton Yelchin has that youthful zeal as Kyle Reese. Bryce Dallas Howard seems miscast as John's pregnant and loving wife Kate. She does not provide the movie's emotional anchor.In the end, ""Terminator Salvation"" is worth watching, because of the great hero story and the powerful performances by Bale and Worthington. The shining objects are the metallic machines and rumbling explosions, but what compels is the human story from the hearts of Bale and Worthington.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worthington Good Bale bad,The moment the movie started I was excited and enjoyed the opening scene with Sam Worthington. Then once the film started focusing on Christian Bale I started to get a little bored. Bales performance was like watching him portray his role as batman in the dark knight which was terrible no wonder people liked Heath Ledger so much. This is the problem with bale when he lowers his voice he thinks he will hide his annoying accent well guess what Mr bale it doesn't!. Sam Worthington showed to me he has what it takes to be a leading man in a movie even tho they gave him second billing in this film.The CGI was decent enough. The scene with the Mech Terminator was pretty amazing to watch. The Nuclear bomb scenes were a little bit of a let down. There wasn't enough terminators in this film I guess thats because its only 2018 and the war carries on past 2029.Now for the story which i quite enjoyed. It seemed at some points in the movie not all just some that it was a bit rushed. So overall I'm giving it a 7.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Zzzzzzzz....,"I like all the Terminators, I really do. I really dig even the 3rd part which was bashed a lot for no reason. However, this is not really a Terminator movie. It's a completely generic family friendly boring action movie loosely based on Terminator.Where should I start? The main plot is pretty much what most action movies consist of. Random, long, dragged out action scenes (ALL the time) with very little emphasis on the storyline unlike the previous Terminators. The special effects might have been good but I was too blanked out to really take notice. The so called post Judgement day world isn't nearly as dark and hopeless as portrayed in the previous movies. Christian Bale is a terrible John Connor. There are just too many plot holes when compared to the prequels. I just watched the movie a few hours ago and I can barely remember any memorable part. There are too many useless characters. The melancholic and helpless atmosphere all the previous Terminators provide is not present. Oh yeah, and the (completely awesome) signature score has pretty much been ruined.Overall this just a run of the mill action movie attempting to cash in on the Terminator's popularity. Complete bullcrap and I highly recommend you spend your 110 min on something else if you haven't watched it.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does exactly what is says on the tin,"I think the problem is, when you are going into this kind of movie, are the expectations of it. Nobody had any faith in the idea of McG directing the movie and then we had the trailers and every body wanted to believe it would be immense. It would be an epic. It would be this years The Dark Knight.But its not. But thats not to say it isn't any good.Everyone looks at the two original Terminator movies through rose tinted glasses and they are superb films that set new boundaries with film making, and rightly they should stay that way. Terminator 3 was very mixed critics wise but was very much, in many peoples opinion, the end of the franchise. However Salvation, when viewed by itself as a stand alone film, is actually very good.It has a very gritty, real lighting look about it. Solid performance by all (although Worthington struggles with his American accent) and has some immense action sequences in it and the CGI - although not exactly pushing the boat out - is mixed well with the late Stan Winstons models very well. It is an excellent action film, nothing more. Which is exactly what in many respects the first two were.This is not Shakespeare, its not Hitchcock or Wells; its a war film about robots hunting and killing humans in the future and when viewed like this (and viewed in a back side comforting 110 minutes) is stands as a good film that excites.It does not try to copy any of its previous (although one or two traditional lines appear and the ending will raise a smile) but it stands by itself as a contiunation of the Terminator saga and at the end of the day its a damn sight better than the third installment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Visually grand and full of noisy action, but that's it.","Building an entire franchise on top of the smashing success of two films was a mistake, and the comparison between ""Terminator 2"" and this film is even unfair. Through this film, we travel to an apocalyptic future, where a program called Skynet managed to start a war between humans and machines. Human resistance is led, of course, by John Connor. But what to do when a man comes to him who may not be who he says he is?I honestly don't want to talk about the plot too much because talking too much about it implies, in my perspective, revealing too much about the film, and I honestly don't want to do that. This is due to the fact that it is too simple and thin, in addition to being a little obvious, being quite easy to guess the main events and twists. In fact, the script, despite trying to offer us something more than chase scenes, turns out to be just a pretext for action scenes, one after another, with the story itself being relegated to the background.It is quite evident that director McG (what an absurd pseudonym, it looks like a car brand!) bet all his chips on creating a ""blockbuster action"" movie, and invested extensively in production values and noisy and impressive action scenes, neglecting almost everything else and letting the name ""Terminator"" to help to make the film saleable.The cast is satisfactory. As it could not be otherwise, Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to assume the role of terminator, but in a CGI version of himself, ugly and uninteresting enough to disappoint anyone. Christian Bale could have done better, too. He is a shadow of himself here. On the contrary, Sam Worthington offers us a complex and charismatic character, and Anton Yelchin also offers us a consistent and solid performance. Unfortunately for both actors, the film is not very interesting, and I have doubts if any of them keep good memories of this work.It is, truly, in the technical features that this film shows some value and justifies its budget. The action is the strongest part of the film and was designed to satisfy audiences who are pleased with much destruction, shots, explosions and noise. This is not necessarily bad, on the contrary, it is welcome in this kind of film, but sometimes excess is also a sin and exaggeration takes away some credibility in some scenes, transforming the film into something as real and exciting as a great and expensive video game. Cinematography is very good, the film has an elegant look and the destroyed world is impressive. The sets and costumes are very good and the effects and CGI are great, made to impress.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much better than 3,"Really a huge improvement over Terminator 3. The story on 3 was not bad, but the direction was awful; yes there were a lot of action scenes, but the heavy mood was lightened too much. Remember, it is doomsday, the fall of civilization and possible extinction of humanity; and Terminator Salvation try to recover that dark and painful feeling. I applaud that.The story fits well within the series, the actors do a good job. What brings the film a down, in my opinion, is that humans cannot compete with machines in brute force. No way! Bones cannot hold to nuclear powered steel. Humans cannot street fight with Terminators.Besides that, I pretty much enjoyed the movie, much more after watching T3. I feel it redeemed the franchise, congratulations!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing,"OK, OK. Just saw this at a screening, and all I can say is: Wow.This Terminator goes beyond the previous movie installments and really shows you how entertaining movies can be. To start off, the special effects were top-notch and action packed; Transformers 2 is going to have serious competition with Salvation for sure. The movie certainly delivers in all aspects of action and CG, but I wont linger on with the special effects, you will just have to see the movie your self.As for the story....Well, the first 2 Terminator movies were for the most part chase movies, where this movie really expanded on the Terminator franchise. In the first Terminator movies, they give brief scenes of the future with relative cheesiness, where in Salvation, it shows the world that I thought would be cool to see after watching the first Terminator, which is: the future. So, the story was cool, I won't give anything away, but I thought it was awesome to see a war against machines, rather than one terminator chasing one person, like in the first Terminator; of course the first Terminator movies were better, but I just liked this adaption very much as well.As for the acting: Christian Bale was a convincing John Connor and did a great job playing the leader of the resistance, whereas if Nick Stahl(the John Connor from T3) was in Christian Bale's place...that would have been funny, and not in a good way. Sam Worthington pulled off an outstanding performance, but...the rest of the cast wasn't as great as the leading actors...which was OK, but it was the only downer to the movie. McG didn't disappoint in delivering a solid action movie, although I do think they could have got a better director. =/ Soooo...overall this was a great popcorn-action-summer movie that is awesome, and probably anyone will enjoy it, whether you are a Terminator fan or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another mediocre Hollywood blunder.,"I'll keep it simple. Like Aliens vs Predator, Terminator Salvation lacked the same heart and story as the originals. It also should have kept the R rating of the first two. I'm sick and tired of these crappy Hollywood remakes with no soul and spirit. Lets see some writers and directors with some balls like Christopher Nolan with Batman who can do something good with any franchise and turn it into cinematic gold.The acting was dry along with the poor story and writing. The best part of the whole movie was the special effects with that alone not able to save an already bad film. In a sense the world audience pays to keep the Hollywood business alive. As a lover of film, I yearn to get a better return for the money I spend to be entertained. And lately this need is rarely meet beyond the dollar rental at redbox.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Garbage cans are always on fire in the future.,"I was hyped after seeing the theatrical trailer. Finally, we were going to see the war against the machines.I just got back from the pre-screening. Unfortunately, T4 was disappointing from the weak title sequence. Essentially the movie contains lots of explosions, a sprinkling of gobots and plenty of scenes that just seem - unbelievable (without the wonder).Sam Worthington does a good job with his role as Marcus, Nicolas Cage (or was it Tom Cruise) is angry as John Connor, and Michael Ironside is resolute as Michael Ironside from Total Recall.Here's my Terminator 4 'Homestyle' Recipe:1/4 Cup - Blackhawk Down soldiering scenes, 5grams - Road Warrior car battles, 2oz - Matrix harvesting robots, 1turd - Transformers (sans Megan Fox), 1gram - Resident Evil evil, 1fist - Mission Impossible impossibles.Stir together, add some average extras, a cute kid and a really uninspired score from the talented Danny Elfman then bake for 2hours.The only thing this movie is missing is a scene where a T-600 mows down a puppy with a Gatling gun, just so we know they are totally bad-ass.Actually, the T-600 are totally bad-ass, plus surprisingly stupid. They bring all the joy from every minigun experience you've always wanted. A nice homage to modern games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Team Fortress 2, and countless others where gamers fixate on spending endless rounds of ammo without hitting anything.If you enjoyed Matrix 2 and 3, the last Batman, Gears of War, Call of Duty: Modern Combat (great game BTW, way more involving story than this movie), and Cheetohs you just might like this.Makes you really appreciate classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, and Bladerunner.

Appropriately action laden and subsequently stupid (but a step up from 3),"After four entries, I'm afraid Terminator no longer makes sense. The whole time travel thing has gotten so ridiculous that attempting to descibe it hurts my brain. In Terminator, Our hero (Kyle Reese) was sent back from the future by John Connor, to ensure that his mother lived to give birth to him. This is understandable enough, and the Terminator ended up being a fine film.Now, just imagine taking something like this and making it ten times more convoluted, so much so that it interferes with the plot and degrades the movie. This is exactly what happen in Terminator Salvation. That and bad acting result in a pretty mediocre movieAt least it could have been worse. Terminator Salvation is more than a small step up from the almost unwatchable Terminator 3. It feels like something a bit more fresh, and less like a rehashing of previous entries (which terminator 3 was) The first half of Terminator Salvation is actually pretty good containing plenty of adrenaline without ove4r doing it, but the film doesn't get better, it gets worse. I found myself loosing interest rather quickly, in part because of the growing sense of idiocy, but more importantly, because like so many summer blockbusters, this is ultimitely a shallow enterprise, hard to care for. James Cameron invested some time is giving us characters; this film has cardboard cut outs.The end result while not terrible (and sometimes very thrilling) does not do enough for me to wanna recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Be Careful What You Wish For,"Being a big fan of the ""Terminator"" series, I have been salivating over this movie for about a year but I must say something was missing from it. I always thought it was great in the first and second movies when they flashed forward but for me it turns out that this future is just too bleak and uninteresting. My main problem with this movie is that it just wasn't that much fun to watch. Of course the action sequences are great but it is just not nearly as compelling as the first 2 movies. I can't really put my finger on it but I just felt flat and disappointed when I left the theater. While Bale is solid and believable as John Connor, this movie could not get me to care about the rest of the cast. For me this series just works better with the Time travel dynamic and the more they tinker with it (after the 2nd movie and T.V. show) it is becoming almost a parody of itself. I know they are going to make more of these because they will probably always make money but they should really quit while they are ahead.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dull and simplistic,"When I heard that they'd brought in Jonathan Nolan to 'polish' the script for Terminator Salvation I had a fair idea of what to expect. In case you don't know who he is, he's the guy who worked his magic on the latest Batman film ensuring that you saw a ton of stuff fly across the screen but didn't see anything resembling a basic coherent plot. He's worked the same magic with this film. I imagine the planning for this movie went something like this:Writer: Sure glad to have you on the team Jonathan, got any ideas for this scene?Jonathan Nolan: Wow! Car goes flying across the screen, then at your face.Writer: OK, and in terms of a plot? Any ideas?Jonathan Nolan: Woah! Big robot sneaks up on a bunch of people, he;'s like 60 feet tall but they don't see him till he's right there. Wow! Car flies right at you! Right at your face.Writer: Right OK, that's more just explosions though isn't it. How about the actual plot, what sort of ideas did you have for that?Jonathan Nolan: OK, plot? What about um, there's this cyborg OK?Writer: Oh, OK go on.Jonathan Nolan: And it flies across the screen at you.In terms of writing, plot and depth this film feels like some fan fiction.

I don't get where the bad reviews are coming from.,"Terminator Salvation is currently sitting at 34% on RottenTomatoes.com. I just don't get it. When it comes to films, I am very hard to please. I'd say out of every fifteen movies I see I would only describe one as a 'good' movie, and even less as a 'great' one. But Terminator Salvation suited me just fine. It's engaging, interesting, well-directed, and at moments surprisingly emotional. Of course it pales in comparison to Terminator 1 and 2, but that's James Cameron for you. I found it to be fathoms better than the abomination on film: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Terminator Salvation had incredible visual effects, preferring to film on real sets rather than extensive green screens and using real helicopters and cars over computer generated replacements, and opting to film Animatronics over CG models. The effect is quite endearing as we movie goers have been bombarded with cheesy CG effects since 1995. (I nearly wanted to gouge my eyes out at the giant CG Sandman in Spiderman 3 or CG baby in Children of Men). The story is straightforward, incorporating elements and themes ever so subtly from previous James Cameron films. Overall, I'd say the movie delivers. Definitely worth your admission price. I plan to buy it and add to my Terminator DVD collection (something I have not and will not give the privilege to the steaming pile that was Terminator 3). I'd say the fair score on rotten tomatoes should be a 69%. Maybe with more time and reviewers, the film will get the buzz it deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Best,"Petman predicted.one of my favorite movies out. This movie scares the sh*t out of me cause this could really happen in a century or less. Love the action, story, acting, and the camera choreography is golden. I just wish it was longer. I haven't seen the TV series, and don't care to. too corny for me. Great f*ckin movie. I'm not expecting another ""titanic"" like the critics are, out of a terminator movie. I'll watch terminator salvation a thousand times more than these lowball asshole critics recommend watching. Its an enjoyable movie to watch assholes, not a math problem.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
When is this going to end?,"John Connor (Bale) is again fighting the machines who want to eliminate all human life. He meets Marcus (Worthington) and Connor is not sure if Marcus is friend or foe from the future.It's easy to get lost in this story, and we constantly have to figure out who is the father of who even though the father is Kyle (Yelchin) a teenager and the son is John Connor, an adult; and where is Sara Connor?, and are we in the present or the future? Of course, I am making it more complicated than it is. Or am I?The acting by all was good, and there is a lot of CGI in this and it's all good too; but it takes up more than half of the movie and it's practically the same over and over again. Arnie was smart to get out when he did. Gets tedious after a time especially since most of the scenes are filmed in the dark. It's not even scary anymore. So much for date night stuff. Might have to check that Scary Movie thing out again.Also, the Marcus character and the Connor character look too much alike. Well, kind of. Why do they do that? Before I said Arnie was smart to get out when he did, but did you notice that another updated Terminator Model looked exactly like Arnie? Wasn't on the screen long. So you missed it. No big deal.I really thought this was going to put an end to the war with the machines. Wrong again. I went through BattleStar Galactica with the machines, and that ended. Or did it?The only sequel that outshone all that went before was the Die Hard series. This movie left it open to another sequel and I have had enough. When is this going to end? This one needs to go away. This is torture. I'm ready to let the machines win.I really wish the TV show The Sara Connor Chronicles would come back. I miss Summer Glau, the good looking machine who plays a good machine who protects John Connor, the young one. That gets complicated too, but it is preferred. (What did you say? She's not a machine? Oh.)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, well one S-word was heard.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Why Danny Elfman...oh why...why oh why....why...oh god why...,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet.The performances of all the actors involved ranged from adequate to good, I did not find any problem whatsoever with Bales performance of Connor, in fact he was one of the better performers in the film.The plot for me was absolutely fine and could have worked out excellently had there not been some key issues...Firstly...McG...he didn't do a horrible job, the majority of the film was shot well, although I took issue with certain aspects of it and certain changes and ideas he brought to the franchise. Still those things could be forgiven. Why the small child with Kyle Reece though? I mean why? it was a pointless addition and distraction that added absolutely nothing to the film and took away something from the grittiness of it all. The child was one of several small things like that I believe he made an error with. I don't want to list them all.Here was the MAJOR problem I had with this movie...DANNY ELFMAN and the WORST SCORE I have ever heard for a movie such as this. It sounded like I was watching Independence day not a terminator movie. Every nuance of sound that came from this score took away from the performance, took away from the plot, took away from the atmosphere in general...any sense of atmosphere or emotion or anything at all was 'terminated' as soon as Danny Elfman parped in with his nonsense.It has to go down as one of the worst decisions in movie making history to employ this man to do the score...what the hell was wrong with the scores used by Cameron in the previous terminator movies? they were perfect, they had a darker more sinister feel.I am 90% certain that had the score been the T2 score or something similar most of the people who disliked this movie would like it much more. The score dragged the whole movie down and made everything seem worse.Seriously I cannot understand how professional movie making people could seriously think this score was in any way appropriate to this franchise.Please god McG release a DVD version with a completely different score. Otherwise I will hold you personally responsible for the travesty you have unleashed on us.I give this movie an 8/10 purely because I believe the basics of it are there, the actors are there, the plot is there...however if I fully consider the score as well I would give this movie 0/10.

"The film has its surprises, but does not bother, as it is respectful of the established chronology, but does not add anything new for the franchise","After the controversial third film, which insisted on continuing a theoretically closed story in the second film and that brought some incongruities in its script, the duo of screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris are once again responsible for the fourth film in the franchise ""The Terminator"", now under the direction of McG, produced by the Halcyon Company, which bought the rights to C2 in 2007. This is the first to happen after the nuclear holocaust caused by Skynet, with actor Christian Bale as John Connor the future leader of the resistance and Sam Worthington as the cyborg Marcus Wright. The film also features a Kyle Reese from the first ""Terminator"" as a teenager, played by Anton Yelchin, as well as showing the origin of the T-800.The script, written in four hands by John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris, also responsible for T3, goes to great lengths to maintain mythology, insert elements and especially new robotic creatures and, at the same time, give a personal and global character to the fight against the machines, with the obvious intention of pleasing various types of public and, therefore, perhaps, not pleasing any. ""The Terminator: Salvation"" invests heavily in the post-apocalyptic tone, betting on desolate locations and new types of threats to establish a tone of urgency fundamental to the effectiveness of the story - and thus we soon met several new ""exterminators"" "", From aquatic robots to flying, passing by others that resemble motorcycles and, of course, a gigantic one that seems to be inspired by Transformers. With this, the action becomes practically uninterrupted, replacing the development of characters or even the plot with increasingly elaborate sequences that depend on visual effects and big explosions to work. The writers also add a new character - controversial, but which in theory does not contradict the chronology - who is not just the ""exterminator of the time"": Marcus Wright, a death sentence in 2003 who wakes up in 2018, finds that his bones have turned to metal and want to understand why.However, he exaggerates himself in the exhibition (a term used to designate how the film gives us essential information about the story) because the directors feel the need to explain to the viewer each of the new exterminators, to create a subplot for Marcus, a dilemma of ""second chance"" ... The amount of implausible things is piling up to the point of unbearable. Starting with the coincidence of Marcus running into Kyle; for Kyle, a boy, to be number one on Skynet's ""wanted"" list; The simple fact that Skynet is after Kyle and John, thus, for free, no longer makes sense, as Skynet would have no way of knowing their future. At the same time, John Connor's bow is missing pieces and what bothers him most: McG made no effort to show why Connor was considered a kind of messiah. The character is revered without any explanation and do not come to say that it is only because he is the son of his mother, as this does not seem enough for the degree of idolatry that he receives throughout the projection.Primary errors are notorious when using, for example, overexposure as a narrative resource, since, in addition to the introductory sign, it still depends on off-line narration, tapes recorded by Sarah Connor and, even worse, a long explanation provided by Helena Bonham Carter in the third act. As if that were not enough, Brancato and Ferris let absurd holes pass, such as the fact that Kyle drives perfectly although he makes it clear that he never drove a car before (something McG could have circumvented through a few plans that illustrated the boy's unpreparedness) and - infinitely worse - Skynet's refusal to kill Reese after imprisoning him, as this would put an end to the eternal persecution of John Connor.On top of that, we have Christian Bale who doesn't convince like Connor. The actor has a big problem. As much as they try to turn him into a star, he always ends up overshadowed by others. If in The Dark Knight (2008), even though Batman, all the spotlight went to Heath Ledger's Joker, now it ends up in the background, despite the status of protagonist: Worthington is the highlight, and practically the only one to get some kind of more enthusiastic reaction from the audience. He is the element of surprise, which will account for the best turns and lead the audience to situations that will define the course of the characters. Yelchin, on the other hand, works just like Kyle Reese, especially when he starts speaking the phrases we know from the first film. After all, who doesn't remember ""come with me if you want to live""? Certainly T4 makes several references to pay homage to the first two films as much as possible, but, in doing so, it gets stuck in a pre-determined structure that the script itself tries to detach itself with the introduction of Marcus Wright. However, the premise that guided the previous features remains: in the middle of the biggest dispute with the machines, a life needs to be preserved at all costs. This time it's not Connor's, but his father's, Kyle Reese.The most important thing to stand out in this continuation is that it messes with affective memories of the franchise and explains what was still a mystery in the previous films. Throughout the initial trilogy, war in the future was shown only in quick flashes, which placed us in the critical situation experienced by humans (especially as shown in the first film in 1984), and further hinted at what that life was like at that time, but without make it totally explicit. This time, we can emerge even more in a story that takes place entirely in the future after the nuclear holocaust and in the midst of the war between humans and machines. We got to know the Human Resistance command center and the bases scattered around the planet, the precarious conditions in which people lived with the scarcity of food and resources, how the attacks against the machines and the rules of that war were organized (avoid leaving at night not to be located by machines that used infrared). In this respect, director McG, photography by Shane Hurlbut and production designer by Martin Laing are effective in portraying that future as bleak and hopeless for humanity. All we see are rubble of buildings and entire cities in ruins denoting the massacre suffered by the human race. The images and makeup are dirty, showing the constant climate of war. The darker photograph further reinforces the tone of loneliness, abandonment and what it is like to live in fear that a machine will discover and exterminate them. Here, the machines also don't use human skin to infiltrate people. The idea of a metal endoskeleton walking and programmed to slaughter humans makes the sight much more threatening.McG focuses on telling a story about the human being. In a world inhabited by machines, it is precisely in the most crucial moments of the plot that questions concerning man are put to the test. Not just in acts of courage, but in decisions, thoughts and fears. It is precisely in the figure of the mysterious Marcus (Sam Worthington) that these elements are best represented. In a devastated world, staying human is often one of the biggest challenges. Although it lacks the creativity of the sequences conceived by James Cameron in the first two films, this fourth chapter is clearly superior to the third in the ""action"" category. The first action scene involving John Connor (Bale) is quite intense and graphically interesting, with the would-be savior showing off in a very virile way, as expected from the hero who would be Earth's last hope, as Kyle Reese of Biehn in Terminator. Connor steps on the head of the mechanical carcass of power, symbolizing the hierarchical order established between him and his enemies, perhaps at the moment of more intelligence in the script of Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato. The chase of the various robot-killing robots to Marcus and Kyle is sensational, but it happens very early in the film. It is also worth saying that McG, normally a filmmaker unable to have a more ambitious idea, surprises especially in the long shot that, even in the first act, brings Connor into a helicopter, being hit by the shock wave of an explosion, falling with the device and leaving the cabin - all without apparent cuts. And if Danny Elfman's soundtrack (another irregular member of the team) explores the theme composed by Brad Fiedel reasonably well, the sound design of the film is the only really exceptional element of the project, deserving to be recognized in the awards season.""Terminator: Salvation"" is neither surprising nor thrilling, staying most of the time away from the audience. The good action scenes immediately refer to other equally competent ones (there are sequences that seem to have been removed entirely from any Transformers), the director seems frightened by the responsibility of continuing something created by Cameron himself (who directed the first two films) and even the big cast, which still has names like Helena Bonham Carter, Anton Yelchin, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jane Alexander (four times nominated for an Oscar), cannot create greater empathy. It is better to go far and watch the two features that started this mythology and that, at least, have something to say. The film has its surprises, but all of them are wired from the beginning. It does not bother, as it is respectful of the established chronology, but does not add anything new. And the result, despite all the explosions, running and chasing, is to provoke yawns.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Impressive spectacle undermined by lack of substance,"The largest let-down aspect of this film is that THERE IS NO CHARACTER. You presume your following John Connor but you don't, you are shifted between two characters yet they are barely protagonists and you cannot have a story without a protagonist, and vice versa, period.The CGI is fantastic but not enough action involving the smaller machines - the common terminators which we love. The lack of real plot is just too hard to dismiss and the end 30 minutes are way too predictable.I still recommend it, it was quite fun and the machines look pretty awesome (though I'm sure i saw a terminator wearing a bandanna at one point...).

A bit busy.,"Like Terminator 3, I have seen this one before, but I couldn't remember what happened. Not because the story is the same as all the rest, which it isn't, but because it just wasn't entirely gripping. The fact that it was different is perhaps it's saving grace, but what I think let's it down is that there are too many things going on and too many characters involved. It's almost difficult to tell Christian and Sam apart at times, because of their similarities, among other things.I think as it is a John Connor story that it should have focussed on him more.All that said, as an action film it has all the fights and shooting that you might need, without going over the top.

It's not the end of the world as you know it!,"I truly believe in McG's commitment to the Terminator franchise and to this project. Propelled by the desire, not only to honour the franchise but also to endow his career with the kind of Batman Begins, franchise-revitalising boost that Christian Bale would surely provide, how could this possibly be a bad movie?Well, in fairness, it isn't. It's a really good picture and a fun way to spend two hours. But, has McG succeeded in taking things back to their gritty roots? Were all his efforts to force his cast and crew to read Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' in the hope of capturing a truly bleak, unforgiving post-apocalyptic future worthwhile?Of course not. It's McG and he's a plonker.Yes, as assured as the cast are, as wonderful as the sets and even to a point, the story are what you basically have here is a bunch of beautifully coiffured and made-up lipstick commandos throwing heroic shapes in a slightly litter-strewn desert while some robots that look a bit like Arnie fire miniguns very, very inaccurately at them.But what about Skynet? I hear you say. Haven't the machines taken over? Isn't humanity on the bones of it's arse?Well yes and no. You see,life in McG's future really isn't that bad. Basically, the rule of thumb is: if you see/hear a really loud, silver machine coming towards you, run like f**k. Other than that, you can basically just carry on as normal. The buses don't run anymore but if you have a hunt about there are some pretty nice cars lying around with petrol still in them. So don't worry, okay?Oh and for all you vain ladies out there, McG's future still has plenty of good hairdressing salons open for business (evidently).Seriously though, Salvation, apart from it's certificate 12A tameness is spot on. The cast are excellent with a reasonable balance between eye-candy and solid acting and the set pieces are universally thrilling. Although, I should warn my hero Christian Bale that if he plays it any more intense he is going to push himself into self parody.Salvation for all it's Charlie's Angels in the future-ishness is far superior to Rise of the Machines and personally I feel that an Arnie cameo would have wrecked things as only Arnie in his latter days could. As it stands, his digital appearance is a uniquely thrilling moment that almost makes up for the distance the franchise has travelled from it's dirty, downbeat first instalment.Provided we make peace with the fact that Hollywood simply doesn't do films like Terminator 1 anymore, then this is as good an action film as any of the current generation.But don't expect another Batman Begins.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's darker and it's grittier,"The film presents itself more as a standalone post-apocalyptic science-fiction thriller than as a continuation of the Terminator universe. With the exception of a few links and references, this fourth installment carries little resemblance to the original franchise and therefore fails to appeal to its intended audience.The cast is different, the setting and time period are different, and most importantly, the tones contradict those of previous entries. In contrast to past films, which were predominantly upbeat or mainstream, it is now grittier and rawer.Was this change necessary? No, I don't believe so, but I laud their ambitions and motivation to steer the series in a different direction. Now the main question is whether this unanticipated manoeuvre brought the producers the targeted profit. I'm afraid not; the film performed poorly at the box office, and I can see why!

"Alright movie, but did not bring any sort of salvation to the terminator series","I walked into Terminator Salvation with an open mind hoping to enjoy this new addition to the Terminator series, but I really did not feel that it delivered as well as it could have.

The story was good enough but there is so much jumping around it really doesn't feel like there a lot of character development. As far as explosions and CGI goes this movie delivers well in that category but, the real problem I had with this movie was the choice of actors. I mean why the hell is Common a supporting actor in this movie? Christian Bale has delivered some damn good performances in his time, but I literally burst into hysterics at one point in the movie at him screaming like three words, You'll know what I mean when if you watch it. OK so it was entertaining yes, it better F**king be with that kind of budget, but all I'm trying to say is I found myself laughing and making fun of this movie more than being captivated and absorbed into the experience it was presenting.

Review from a non Terminator fan,"When I first saw this movie's trailer for a screening of The International, I said to myself ''Man, this is going to be THE movie of the summer''. Well, I guess I was wrong, because out of the 200 million dollars this movie cost, it only made 120 million, which is a fair amount at the box-office but still, this movie could be considered a flop. And I'll admit it, I had heard reviews coming from the 1st weekend of this movie's release, saying that it was really hard to understand, I went to see it in it's 2nd week, and at first I went to see it only for the pleasure of seeing robots blow up. Well, this ain't Transformers, and I was pleasantly surprised. The story might have been a bit tough, but I didn't struggle much with it (although Terminator fans who are reading this review could and should correct me if ever I am wrong somewhere in this review). Basically, it is the year 2018, and John Connor is a man who is leading a resistance against Skynet, a computer/robot program who senses the humans as a threat. Connor must protect a young man named Kyle Reese, who is Connor's father, and must send him back to the future, where he can impregnate his mother and therefore ''confirm'' his existence. Elsewhere, Marcus Wright, a convict who was sentenced to death, wakes up 15 years after being ''dead'' and discovers what the world has become. He teams up with Kyle Reese...and you know the rest.The visual effects were super, and the script was hard to understand at first but pretty well-written afterwards. The acting was pretty good overall, with Anton Yelchin, Common and Moon Bloodgood giving average performances. Sam Worthington excels as Marcus Wright, whereas Christian Bale could've been a lot better, but was still pretty good: Don't expect any ''Dark Knight'' performance. Bryce Dallas Howard was good as well, but unfortunately, her character didn't have much screen time. The action scenes, again, were awesome and very well made, with the visual effects as stunning as Transformers (though you probably won't feel the difference because they aren't shown in the same ways). All in all, Terminator fans have been mixed on this movie, but I find that it's a good movie for the action if you haven't seen the originals, and I don't know if a Terminator fan should see it, but honestly, this movie is McG's best and I enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good time had by all (except Skynet of course),"Overall...a good movie. I watched on DVD worried that it would be like Star Trek... a disappointment. But it was much better than expected. It had drama, suspense, and enough links into the original stories that you could enjoy it as a continuation (or is it prequel)?It's a slightly strange movie however in that it deviates slightly (accelerated development of sky-net), and the role of Marcus is a strange secondary story that doesn't really start anywhere, and doesn't really conclude. The ending is a bit pat therefore.Overall there were some excellent bits in there... but also by the end, you're not exactly knowing John Connor any better than when you started, and as such his struggle at the end is less than thrilling. Also - the question has to be asked? Why did he not seek out Kyle before now? (but that's verging on a spoiler).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The acting in the movie is good but the movie seemed to be carried by their performances and the FX. There was something lacking though. The story was OK but something was off. I would have to say the direction seemed to be on a novice level. There were moments that could have gotten cut. One of the biggest problems i had with the movie is that this is supposed to be an R rated movie because of the subject matter. Robots killing people for the hell of it in a post apocalyptic world is not a kid friendly movie, so why try to be kid friendly. The third movie got that right at least.

T4: Salvation not the worst Terminator.,"I can safely say that Terminator Salvation isn't the worst Terminator movie: that honor goes to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Rather, this is the second worst Terminator movie. Sam Worthington was really good as Marcus Wright, but most of the other cast had their problems. Anton Yelchin did okay, but he just isn't Kyle Reese. Christian Bale had that irritating Batman grumbling voice going again (muhmuhmah!) and everybody else seemed terrified of sharing the screen with him. This movie packs plenty of thrills, and that's the reason you go to see this type of movie (unless you're a movie critic). The effects are pretty good, especially when compared to X-Men Origins: Wolverine. While this isn't the best movie of the summer and got beaten by Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian at the box office, Terminator Salvation is worth seeing in the theater or waiting for the Director's Cut on DVD and Blu-Ray. The PG-13 rating isn't a problem, but the film could have had more in it had it been Rated R. Thanks for reading this review.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Before Watching: Terminator Salvation (2009),"""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) is the fourth installment in the Terminator franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Terminator Salvation immediately raises the question: ""is this the worthy continuation to Terminator 2 that Terminator 3 surely as not?"" The answer is, sorry to say, a no.Speaking in terms of quality, Terminator Salvation is quite strong. The effects are nice, the scenery is beautiful at times, and small inventive things can be found to further expand the Terminator universe. The consequences feel more real than earlier, the action is even thrilling, and you care more for the characters again. As a standalone film, Terminator Salvation isn't really that bad and can be enjoyable.However, fans of the Terminator will immediately find issues, mostly in terms of plot consistency for the franchise. With this movie, we enter the iconic Skynet-controlled Los Angeles, a time we've only seen before in Kyle Reese's flashbacks from The Terminator, only to find that they don't match the present. There are indeed a few years between Terminator Salvation and said flashbacks, but the difference seems too big to compromise the two timelines. This isn't really a major detail, but for those who place weight on these details, it will be distracting.As for the canon, Terminator Salvation doesn't contribute too much of additional information or insight. It can be skipped as a part of the franchise, but again, as a standalone film - and as a way to explore the Terminator concept - it is really not that bad.My personal grade: a moderate 6/10.

Oh deary me.,"What a silly, silly movie. I wouldn't say i'm disappointed as after reading many reviews prior to seeing the film, i had a good idea of what to expect. But i have to say that at no point were these expectations exceeded. Terminator Salvation is a typical modern-day Hollywood blockbuster; lots of slick action sequences and good-looking young actors with little or no plot to back it up. I find it bemusing that so much money can be spent producing a major film and yet so little be invested in a good screenplay writer! What the hell. The amount of times i shook my head and despaired at how stupid this plot is beggars belief. When i first heard a 4th installment of the Terminator franchise was being worked on - and having seen a few sequence shots - i applauded the spin on the chase-premise and eagerly anticipated a serious futuristic war film. Sadly, T4 is way too dumb, unrealistic and lacking in atmosphere to ever fulfill this. Please tell me someone else wondered how John Connor manages to get back to his feet after being slugged in the chest by a T-800, thrown distance into metal bulkheads etc etc without breaking almost all the bones in his body??? Jesus Christ. How can anyone write this into a script and not think people will question it??? And how come Marcus, albeit in pretty impressive fashion, kicks some human butt in an early scene (but still conventionally) and then later (after we've discovered he's in fact a cyborg) is seen throwing T-800's around??? Why didn't he just use his prosthetic arms to crush the humans earlier??? Why was he struggling with them and how come his punches didn't rip the jaws off of the rednecks he was chinning??? STUPID!! Nobody has even thought about it! OK we'll just forget that bit 'cause he looked human then, but now we know he's a machine he can throw other machines around which probably weigh a metric tonne or something. Idiots. And one more major complaint: i was just about buying all the action stuff in the first half hour until the 100ft super-terminator shows up and starts picking people up and firing laser bolts. Yeah, OK, so we're supposed to believe that in just 9 years time (genius of Skynet or not) we can conceive a machine of that engineering complexity??? McG obviously watched Transformers a few too many times. Ridiculous.Oh OK at times it's a fun ride but that's it, nothing more. It's just impossible not to compare the 3rd and 4th films to the 1st & 2nd and wonder if Hollywood is actually capable of producing a blockbuster with an intelligent f**king script. We're not impressed by shiny things blowing up anymore. Any film with some money behind it can do that. Think up something realistic and innovative before you continue to ruin classic stories again.6 out of 10 just for some decent action sequences and occasionally reasonable acting, and a bit of nostalgia thrown in.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terminator:  Operation Terrible,"Firstly, McG needs to stop producing movies and stick with his cream of the crop television series. Terminator Salvation was a step down from the O.C., but in retrospect a step up on Spiderman 3.The powers that be in Hollywood thought bringing back the genius writers from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was a bright idea....evidently not! This film lacked the much needed dialogue to keep an audience intrigued and tuned during the gaps between the visual effects.Although some visual effects were appealing, it is hard to give them any positive recognition when comparing them to The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. You would think with 25 years of technological advances we would see some drastic improvements in visual effects of the series, but you don't! It is the same old.I don't even want to get started on the rips that are mirrored in this film, but I will. While resting my eyes during this film, I could not stop thinking that I was watching Batman, damn Christian Bale and his mono tone voice. Rips and parallels from Apocalpyse Now, Schindler's List, Armageddon, I Am Legend, I Robot, and many others are evident.The movies predictiveness could have been some what masked if they eliminated the PG13 restrictiveness during several scenes, but wait, that would mean less money from their target audience which is a big ""NoNo"".At most this movie is a rental.......actually I wouldn't waste the money just stream it.Guinnage",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Entertaining Summer Blockbuster,"""We've been fighting a long time. We are out numbered by machines. Working around the clock, without quit. Humans have a strength that cannot be measured. This is John Connor. If you are listening to this, you are the resistance."" John Connor (Christian Bale)If you are reading this review, you probably know more about the Terminator legend than I do, or at least as much because of Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in the original Terminator and the fascination about the relationship between humans and machines. It's 2018, not far from now, and Skynet has the upper hand, not a cellular phone company but the system governing machines that rule the world.John Connor (Christian Bale) is the leader of the resistance, and we, the audience are asked to suspend our belief about warping time (first Star Trek this summer, now Terminator), where a hero might meet his first officer or dad or Helena Bonham Carter, or a bad reproduction of Arnold. At any rate, director McG and the Catwoman writers have woven into the metal mélange of this sci-fi fantasy allusions to the Holocaust's boxcars of death, Mad Max's tangled landscapes, Apocalypse Now's menacing helicopter missions, and The Wizard of Oz's hopeful heart. Along the way are subtle references to futile wars such as in Iraq and the need for leadership over dictatorship. Terminator tries too much, but, hey, better than not at all or a film like Miss March.While the film spends precious little time with any theme other than mankind vs. machines, it has non-stop action for a summer blockbuster well worth the time unless you decide to take off for the future, a dicey business at best, as any of this film's heroes can attest.""I knew it. I knew it was coming. But this is not the future my mother warned me about. And in this future, I don't know if we can win this war. This is John Connor.""",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
T2 Clone,"This title comes after massively disappointing T3 sequel, so my expectations were pretty low. I knew it is hard to surpass T2 that was ahead of its time on many levels. The main reason I gave it 6 is because the story structure was a direct copy of T2, as if directors and scriptwriters did not wish to take any risk with the old T2 public, yet they seek to appeal to the new generations at the same time. The story is progressed in the same way T2 does: naked terminator, the scene with clothes, truck and motorcycle, skynet destruction... Only the players and the story are subtly different, and not at all original (already seen for example in Battlestar Galactica 2003 and Matrix). We see some new elements that fill the gap between T2 and present, but again, its all seen in recent movies and TV shows in a much greater detail, so no surprise there. The acting is alright for an action movie, but the characters are there simply to fill a role, there isn't any depth, any insight how they survive without food and water, how they socialize as a primal human need after food (ok, there are some hints for that and the war is going on, people are stretched to the extreme, but still...). It is a very dark movie, much more realistic then any previous sequel, yet, this not a Mad Max. I have to wonder if machines were so superb as presented, it is quite a puzzle how they didn't already won. Not believable in my opinion. SGI is almost perfect, but I come a long way to seek only triangles and textures in a action sci-fi movie to fully entertain me. Something is missing that simply means I won't watch this title again. The trouble with the movie is also a fact that ""the future"" is much, much closer to our present, so that is also a contributing element why the story is not so strong anymore. It will certainly reach to the newer generations to a higher point, but T franchise is in a bit of a crisis for me. I have to add this review comes in a timeframe of Japan earthquake catastrophe; of course it is affected and biased toward idea weather humanity will live long enough to see the judgmenet day with the machines or rather face the end from mother nature itself.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A BRILLIANTand FAITHFUL continuation of the franchise,"This film faithfully continues the storyline of the first 2 terminator films. In fact it mainly references the first one right down to use of familiar elements that gave me wonderfully nostalgic goosebumps. The tone is different for sure, more despairing and yes less humourless because this is about the future after Judgement Day. A world ruled by machines with pockets of human resistance.The story is great with a couple of wonderful twists. And towards the end there is a superb surprise that will rock the fans...well it rocked for me. The action sequences were relentlessly thrilling and tremendous in scope which to me is a tribute to Cameron's throw everything including the kitchen sink, action filming methods.he story of John Connors is actually a back story. Another mysterious character hold centre stage most of the time and the actor who plays him has great presence and star quality. I thought the film was intelligent and well acted for this sort of genre. The future is depicted very much as in the glimpses we see in the first 2 Terminator movies. Though not as darkly lit!This is a magnificent entry and I simply cannot fathom why this movie is panned by so many. And its not just the critics who are panning it, but more bizarrely, fans of the original. Its sad, because this film deserves its sequel but I fear it will not get it. It probably will be made but as a low budget straight to DVD trash. Sad because this was a truly great entry. My biggest surprise is how MCG, the man who directed the 2 enjoyable but tongue in cheek and nonsensical Charlie Angels films, pulled off such a seriously cool big scale thrill ride of a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hmmm...,"Sequels are a business fraught with difficulty. If you don't have a clear idea where the franchise is going from the start, they often get lost in a myriad of new characters and plot holes. Such is what happened to the Matrix sequels and such is what has happened here in Terminator: Salvation.It is the Year 2018, and Skynet's Teminator program is wiping out the human population that is left post-Judgement Day. In this war scenario we find John Connor ( Christian Bale )- not the messianic leader yet of the Resistance but a leader of his own pocket of hardened veterans. However his faith in his mission is shaken by the arrival of a new figure- Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) whose own agenda and past will force Connor to form an uneasy alliance with him in order to save Connor's father- Kyle Reece ( Anton Yelchin ).Terminator Salvation is not a sci fi/action film- but rather a futuristic war movie that doesn't really add up. By making this movie only M rated ( PG-13 if you are in the states ) the war against the machines is reduced to something quite...tame. Terminators no longer are the ruthless killing machines that they once were and instead are quite content tossing people around a lot. The whole idea of a brutal world seems silly as it lacks the brutal bit. Why don't the terminators simply kill the marines instead of tossing them against walls? Why doesn't Skynet simply slaughter the humans as soon as they arrive? To their credit Worthington and Yelchin are quite good in their roles, giving Marcus and Kyle some good scenes together and managing to find something in what is a pretty dull story. Christian Bale on the other hand is waaaay too intense. Every line is delivered with a frown and a grimace and he doesn't seem to get emotional at all- except to yell.Terminator: Salvation would always get compared to 1,2 & 3- but they've tipped the balance in the machines favour. In doing so the movie doesn't become more interesting, but less.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fanally, a movie to make me feel better about T3!","Okay, let me preface this by saying 3 things. 1) I'm not a rabid fanboy that thinks this series is epic in any way. 2) I'm not a hater of science fiction, even bad science fiction. 3) I don't think that you can add a spoiler to something that's already spoilt.That being said, there won't be any spoilers here just because I don't care enough about this movie to really go in any sort of depth. So why am I writing this? Maybe it's to gently remind people that this is a movie about killer-robots from the future. It's not art, folks. It's not the epic statement of humanity in our time.Where this movie fails, is that it's completely forgotten it's roots. The first 3 movies in the series didn't take themselves too seriously. At least the first and third didn't. The second one was practically pompous by comparison. Still, Terminator 2 was still somewhat aware that it was a science fiction film wrapped around a chase scene. That's where the excitement and fun came from. There was also a lighter side. The suspense was tempered by a self deprecating sense of humour. That's where Terminator Salvation fails.Terminator Salvation is a movie that forgets it's roots. All of them. The chase sequences are tired, there is no humour, there is no self awareness. Instead we're given bleak. It's almost as if director McG sought out new sources of bleak to throw in as a substitution for depth. There's nothing to frighten, or challenge or even lightly amuse the audience here, only dirt, sludge, grime and stern looks.Christian Bale truly shows his range as an actor. He has none. He glowers, glares, and gives us vacant grimaces as he tries his best to look like a killbot from the future. I'm guessing no one told him he wasn't playing the terminator. It's a tragic thing when you're out acted by a killbot.The special effects aren't anything we haven't seen before. The plot is really little more than a chase across some landscape which, I may point out, was done better in the previous 3 movies of this franchise. The characters don't really need names, you won't remember them anyway. The direction and writing go from lazy to comatose and it's really difficult to say anything positive about this straight-to-video theatre release.If this is the salvation of mankind then bring on Judgement Day.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Can hardly wait for more movies like these. The graphics are stunning and it does help if you watch the previous episodes first. There are a lot of references to the first 3 parts. If you like the matrix, you will love this. If you like the Chronicles of Riddick, you will also love it. And it has the potential to be as big as Star wars, one day if they work very hard on expanding this formula.

Good - Not Great.,"This film in its own right has some good aspects such as the cinematography and audio. The music and machines sounds are creepy. I think it gets the feel and tone right for a Terminator film. Something the last couple completely missed.However it really pains me that Arnie signed up for two more films after this but wasn't in this one. It really could have hit the mark as a great sequel.If the war always was inevitable, and John Conner leads the human race to victory... then there should be a film that depicts the Great War and victory. This could have been the first of two or three showing that.I always think Arnie should have reprised his role as an ageing scientist who developed the technology for skin over metal alloy and used his own DNA. This technology was then propelled by the machines. This would have led the way for the older human Arnie to be in the movie alongside flashes of a CGI younger Arnie robot.Unfortunately they have never been able to recreate the magic of Terminator 1 or 2 and this falls short too.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The scenes and dialogue still gently wash around my head today. The idioms of the robot assassin entered our culture.Terminator Salvation seems to believe its true parents were Matrix, I am Legend and War of the Worlds. Much has been made of Bale, and he is part of the films bastardisation. But there is no question the director has committed the patricide.This film stands on its own as a reasonable addition to post apocalypse franchise, but not as a Terminator.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Unfortunately, This is Not Terminator's Salvation Just Yet","It's not always easy to fill in the shoes of a person(s) that practically revolutionized the art of film-making, in one way or another. Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" was quite awesome, but it wasn't nearly as good as to become the beginning of a whole new series. There was Michael Caton-Jones' ""Basic Instinct 2,"" Ken Finkleman's ""Airplane II,"" and Joe Berlinger's ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,"" all of which weren't even close to the level of success as their predecessors. Even Jonathan Mostow himself tried with ""T3,"" but despite making profits and getting mostly positive critical reception, it was deemed as disappointing because it wasn't on the same level as the first two.The exceptions are always there. James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" Nicholas Meyer's ""Star Trek II,"" Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky III,"" Len Wiseman's ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" etc. And then there is ""Terminator Salvation."" Could it be one of those exceptions? Unfortunately, it isn't. . . not even close 'cause it wasn't even better than ""T3.""PLOT: John Connor, the man fated to be the leader of the Resistance, is trying to find his way to become... well, the leader, of course. The problem is, some people, particularly General Ashdown, doesn't believe in all of the nonsense he's spouting about new T-800s and stuff. Oh, and his wife Kate is with him also, pregnant and just being with him. Meanwhile, Marcus, a former criminal on death row who donated his body to some project by a sick chick, wakes up 15 years in a world filled with much deserts. He's trying to find out what happened and why he's there, while John merely plans and shouts and does nothing interesting.The main problem with this story is that it's nothing. It's as if the writers slapped it onto the film without any effort. When I heard Paul Haggis, Shawn Ryan, Anthony Zuiker, and Jonathan Nolan were brought in for polishes and rewrites, I literally thought this film would be a hit without a doubt. I mean, with writers like that, how could you make bad film? But trust me, it's bad. For those new to the franchise, the plot doesn't explain and introduce anything. When I watched ""Star Trek,"" I knew nothing about the franchise. That's the beauty of the film; it introduces the franchise to new audiences, while remaining as faithful as possible to its canon. ""TS"" isn't the same.Furthermore, there are several plot holes and implausible situations (for which suspension of disbelief can't save you from) that are just downright stupid that it's hard not to ignore. On a lighter note, I'm gonna have to say that the entire third act pretty much saved the movie (except for the very end). Arnold appears (it made the fanboy in me squeal), there's this whole big fight that's entertaining, and it's just awesome. So I'll give the film that.ACTING PERFORMANCES: Thought Christian Bale was badass in ""American Psycho"" and ""Batman Begins."" Well, me too! But not in this film. Bale gives one of his weakest performances in his career. His character is static, which is why he's not needed in the film at all, and he just shouts throughout the film. Get on with it already! Let's see something else!Sam Worthington, on the other hand, is pretty decent. He's sure the next up and coming actor every studio will be vying for. Other than his accent slipping out of place here and there, his performance is solid and believable. No wonder Cameron hired him for ""Avatar!"" The other great actor was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. I personally wasn't sure about him beforehand, but he was actually great as Kyle. Everyone else, though, was ""Meh.""ENJOYMENT: Well, as you can tell from my review so far, I am quite disappointed the way the film has turned out. Before the film was released, I was really hyped for it, from the moment Bale was cast to when the negative reviews came in. I was literally addicted to the franchise, catching up on every bit of news I could find.Bale was cast, the script was rewritten by skilled people, Arnold gave his best blessing, Linda Hamilton contributed to the film, Cameron recommended Worthington to McG, etc. How could the film seriosuly be any worse? (The rating was the only thing that bothered me.) When the reviews came in, I was, like, ""Pshh... I'll judge the film myself."" When I actually saw the film, I was disappointed.It failed to reach my expectations. It wasn't even better than ""T3."" And I felt it was the weakest of the series, no matter how hard I tried liking it.REPLAY VALUE: Pending.OTHER (MUSIC, SPFX, CINEMATOGRAPHY, ETC.): Finally! Here's something to talk about! I liked the music. Danny Elfman did a fine job, at least better than Marco Beltrami. His new theme was good, too. He retained the metallic and emotional themes Brad Fiedel left behind. The special effects are undeniably awesome also. From the complete computer generated Arnold to the amazing explosions, McG sure does know how to film action scenes and use special effects to its full potential. A lot of the credit goes to the late Stan Winston, who did fantastic work.The cinematography is just as great. Despite the Bale rant, Shane Hurlbut does a nice job. There were no problems with the lighting at all, the long shots were done efficiently, and the film's bleak, post-apocalyptic look fit perfectly. The sets and designs I saw on film were spot on as well.Verdict: What can I say? As both a stand-alone film and part of the franchise, this film fails at story but achieves in technicality. A near perfect example of style over substance, no? Let's just hope the fifth installment will bring back the credibility this franchise has always been looking for since 1991.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
There's not a lot from this century that will keep up with it....,"I just rewatched this film and enjoyed it a lot more on this second viewing. The performances are great all around. The effects are rather amazing and the plot travels in a lot of directions. Bale delivers a top performance in his part and so does Worthington. There really isn't a bad actor in this film.This whole movie is action from start to finish and the number of locations make this a captivating ride. It really is jam packed with action, everything from helicopters, to water to desert to air to motorbikes to gunfights to hand to hand fighting. When one considers it all, it's quite an achievement.The problem I think with this film was that it wasn't what people were expecting after the third movie. It is not a bad film. I think the current 6.5 rating is almost spot on. Considering my all time favourite movies are an eight or a nine, this is good.The effects and sets and ""creature"" designs are spectacular. I'd say far better than the most modern Dark Fate movie. It has many scenes that could have been done with a lot less but the factory scenes for example are loaded with extra sparks and details. The lighting is noticeably great too. The actual locations are varied and well chosen.If I had to pick a flaw, the Terminators have a thing for always throwing people instead of killing them more efficiently. And there were Terminators wearing bandanna's and various outfits, which is a bit strange.There's much more to be said about this piece of entertainment but overall it's a great popcorn sci-fi flick if something from this genre is to your wanting.

So close yet so far.,"At the start there is a scene where a Terminator goes after our Mr Connor and it is truly frightening, you can imagine these unstoppable, uncaring machines coming after you that cannot be reasoned with or deterred.

Scores of super hard killing machines unload millions of rounds with there gattling cannons and manage to hit everything but their target.

But then the humans don't seem to do much better either when they aren't shooting a bots.There is also a puke inducing scene like the one in Independence day where iron-man Jonny C takes the mic and reaches out to the resistance (who tend to be considerably less bullet-proof than he is) and spurs them to continue fighting.GOOD 1 Some of the robots are cool. 2 The sound is very good. 3 The stunts are cool 4 The film does propel the franchise forward1 continuity from the previous films isn't there (anyone remember?

Overall review,"Yesterday was the judgment day. I went to see the movie. I want to start with 2 main sentences: 1. Why do you guys spoil such a fantastic chance(s) to do a great movie series/saga? 2. Definitely could be done very much better with the same cast and effects.No story, just brief links with T1. A very nice, crappy movie about what could be as T4.Directed: 4/10 Story/Written: 3/10 Cameras: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Visual effects: 7/10 Sound Effects: 6/10 Casting: 7/10 Costume design: 7/10No Cameron name in full cast&crew list. This had a valuable impact on what has been done. As I mentioned story was very week. First part of the movie you don't understand what's going on at all. During McG's interview he was saying that this not a commercial movie, but I guess it was. Unfortunately 2 series have been spoiled already (3, 4). And I'm sure that next 5th movie will be a sequential crap for 3 and 4 and not back to great T2 level (actually that's what we were expecting from 4).Marcus Wright - good actor choice, but. What he was doing in this movie? Easy solution for producers? as a glue for pieces of story? or just a ""heart replacement"" for Connor?What was the movie about is a big question. Connor meets Kyle or what? A lot of time wasted on chasing, etc. Would be very nice to see where they got that sky-net signal decoder. Another glue for story. We see that new machines are strong, smart, cruel. Then Connor successfully sneaking into sky-net heart in SF, meeting only one t600 on his way. Then helicopter waiting so much long in the same place that much quite. And a lot of other very noticeable gaps of this kind! A lot of scenes in the dark that can not see what's really going on...Once they lost their chance to have Arnold in T3. Now a very short scene with T1 Arnold. Done not good enough! Could be much better! Shooting of the film started on May 5, 2008, I have a feeling that they were hurrying up to finish the movie!Nice new terminators: T600, T-bikes, etc. Good and realistic visual effects. could be done more. Very nice piece with gigantic terminator then followed by t-bike chase and ending with transporter part. Sound effects also were very realistic and good 3D. Great to bring back Guns'n'Roses track.

A confused film at times,"I don't know how I'm going to review this film. I should compare it to the others, but I would never compare this film to the three that preceded it. But let me give a brief summary on the first 3 before I review Terminator Salvation.The first Terminator film was the ultimate mystery chase film. The robot was a mystery, who revealed his true self little by little as his flesh began melting off during the course of the film. The audience just didn't know what to expect until the great finale.The 2nd Terminator film was as good as action movies get. Real stunts, epic production, and intelligent ideology to compliment the fantastic action and character development. T2 will always stand alone as the best.The 3rd film was lacking something, but it was very well written and acted. Arnold played the role very well in this film. It was solid, full of great action, even though it didn't have the emotions of T2.But as for T4 (Salvation)....I'm just at a loss for words. I loved some things, and hated some. First and foremost, the things I liked about it- Atmosphere. Loads of it. Great production for this film, even better than T2. The film was reminding of me some video games I've played such as the Half Life games, and Fallout games. There were some scenes that McG filmed very well, reminding me of Children of Men at times. The sense of chaos was felt in some scenes, and mystery, not knowing if the characters would survive the assault of various machines that could be very sneaky at times, causing me to jump here and there.Now, the things I hated. Quite simply; the PG-13 rating. The movie started out as a grim tale of survival. And the action was way too unreal. It became too far fetched and took away from the realism.John Conner. He was a complete waste. Forget Christian Bale's boring performance, it was the way the character was written that sucked. Poor Bale, such a fine actor, stuck in the shoes of a poorly written character. The guy yelled the entire film, whether trying to convince military characters to change their plans, or even in plain conversations, always yelling. And the leadership we all heard about was not evident at all. The guy was just trying to survive like the rest of humanity, there was no leadership besides his ranting on his daily radio show which was as motivating as a speech given by Mayor Bloomberg.Arnold's cameo. The only time the audience cheered in the theater. For all 10 seconds of it! Thats about it.The story in general. I'm a Battlestar Galactica fan and to me, this story presented in this film was for kindergarten kids compared to the depth of a series like BSG which has similar messages as Terminator films.The ending. Not going to spoil anything, but I'm just going to say that it reminded me of the first Terminator, except...the first film scared the hell out of me! 6/10 . Above average production, but the rating hurts it. This franchise belongs in the R category, and if it wasn't for the latest Star Trek film, I'd probably have no more faith in Hollywood anymore.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another one of that well made movies with a horrible script,"I guess I can finally say it this simple: New Hollywood movies become more and more stupid, while they look better and better. I have seen so many new Hollywood movies with a bad script. It really is a pity. The worst in those movies are usually the downright stupid, cheesy, no sense making endings. - Just like in Terminator Salvation.If I give a Hollywood movie 5 points, especially one like Terminator Salvation, that means, that I personally consider it worse. I hate those bad scripts. I don't understand how a movie can go through so many ""hands"", without anyone realizing how bad the conversations and the story is. - Objectively, there are worse movies out there. The great action and special effects are enough to keep me entertained. That is why I am still forced to give the movie 5 points. - Even though I personally value a good story a lot more.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cold, calculated machination","Like a mean killing machine, ""Terminator Salvation"" racks up the action scenes with boisterous gusto, but when tasked to fill in the obligatory narrative, McG's post-apocalyptic saga of John Connor delivers as much heart as a hunk of clunking metal. The third sequel to James Cameron's technophobic sci-fi series goes washed in desaturated tones and gets cheerlessly monotonous as it finds itself full-speeding to 2018, further stretching the ontological paradox between Connor and his father Kyle Reese without any attempt to inject a shred of innovation to John Brancato and Michael Ferris' script.Fourteen years after the sinister Skynet has eradicated much of humanity in 2004, John (a grim scowling Christian Bale), now leading a group of survivors in their battle against man-killing machines, is bent on using a newly-discovered radio frequency that could shut down Skynet's San Francisco base, while hard-pressed to find Kyle (Anton Yelchin), the member of the resistance who will one day travel back in time to impregnate John's mother, Sarah Connor. Joining them is Marcus Wright (dull Sam Worthington), a convict set to die by lethal injection in 2003 but mysteriously reemerges in 2018 amidst the Armageddon.Certainly absorbed by Cameron's relentlessly action-packed mythology, McG garishly sprinkles the film with nods to its forbears and achieves it with wildly mixed results -- from Bale's painfully awkward ""I'll be back"" to Yelchin's somewhat amusing ""Come with me if you want to live"" -- that it isn't much of a homage as it is a mere pastiche of catchphrases and trademarks flimsily bound by slam bang action sequences. And stripped of the kind of humor that defined ""The Terminator,"" ""T2,"" and to a lesser extent, ""T3,"" ""Terminator Salvation"" essays in its place a supposed human drama defined by hollow ciphers and superficial drama. The whiz-bang extravaganza and imposing setpieces keep McG's venture into the mix from being a total bust, but just like its array of assembly-line machines, once it pauses from the action and delves into emotions, one can't help but have a feeling of cold, calculated machination.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quake meets Matrix 3 leading to some sort of Starship Troopers,"Hollywood logic: to fight an army of T1000 (too expensive to feature in this movie) you also need an army of shape-shifters. This way Connor and Reese can and should change in time both in size and also the face, after all the human resistance is some sort of Witness Protection System - we've all seen Arnold locate someone by the picture alone. And if Batman changed bodies from one movie to another so does J Connor.And it keeps getting better and better. At least better than Alice in Wonderland. This is the Candy land. Where you don't have oil extraction facilities, no refineries, yet gas is everywhere. There are no factories around, yet everybody has a high-caliber gun, proper gun training and a little bit of sharp-shooter classes. There are no fields and the land is at least as poisonous as now, yet hunger is unknown. And the resistance is multiplying like rats in order for the machines to kill at that rate. Eh, in this fairy-tale land even terminators seem easier to terminate although they are larger than the models than can travel through time.Bottom line I guess the only reason why a resistance composed only of half-wits survives is because of outsourcing. That't right, outsourcing. The sensors clearly are calibrated in feet and inches and the software works in centimeters. That would explain for the tracking capabilities of the machines. Who would have thought such a phenomenon might be the last chance of humanity?Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Flawed, but a sincere effort to take the franchise in a different direction and build upon the themes and ideas.","In the future of 2018, mankind is fighting a war against rogue A. I. Skynet and the machine army following the events of Judgement Day where much of humanity was lost in a nuclear war. John Connor (Christian Bale) continues his fight against the machines and is growing in support, but is still doubted by many of the higher ups in the human resistance. A death row inmate named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who was supposedly executed in 2003 after donating his body to Cyberdyne wakes up in the unfamiliar future and becomes the reluctant protector of two young human survivors Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and Star (Jadagrace Berry). When Kyle and Star are kidnapped Marcus must travel to Skynet's headquarters and along the way encounters John Connor.Following the release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, C2 Pictures heads Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar had started preliminary work on the tentatively titled Terminator 4 with intentions to have Nick Stahl and Claire Danes return as John Connor and Kate Brewster respectively and showcase the up to that point only briefly glimpse story of the future war between humans and Skynet. Following the collapse of C2 due to a number of failures and underperforming projects (such as I-Spy and Basic Instinct 2), C2 folded and the Terminator rights were acquired by the Halcyon Company who were intent on producing a new trilogy. Production began around 2007 with McG signed on to direct. The script began with John Connor as a secondary character to Marcus Wright (influenced by the approach taken in Ben-Hur) and the bold and dark original ending was leaked onto the internet which resulted in it being scrapped in favor of something more conventional. The movie went through numerous re-writes to the point that Alan Dean Foster's novelization was entirely re-written despite being submitted. While I can't say everything in Terminator Salvation works, the movie does have a lot going for it in that it goes into an area previously unexplored by the other films in the series.The characters are really strong this time around with our lead character, Marcus Wright played by Sam Worthington a unique approach to the usual ""out of time, out of place"" protagonists we've seen before where this time Marcus Wright is a man who died by execution for his crimes and had made peace with his punishment only to find himself awakened to a war ravaged world. Worthington is pretty solid as a protagonist who goes from this detached ""damned soul"" to the reluctant protector of Kyle Reese and Star. Anton Yelchin is really solid in the role of a younger Kyle Reese (a sad reminder of what we lost with his untimely death) and despite being younger and less well versed in guerilla tactics you see that drive and energy that would drive the character in the first film and Yelchin has some solid moments with Worthington as the two form a mentorship type dynamic. Christian Bale is okay as John Connor, admittedly I like him better than Nick Stahl's take on the character from Terminator 3, but I never really felt all that invested in him as a character and felt like the most interesting aspects were either around him or in relation to him. I think that's always been a problem with this series when it comes to the character because John Connor is this ""Chosen One"" archetype to a ""T"" and aside from his arc in T2 where he was a child John's always been more a McGuffin than an actual character. Having seen the original intended ending I'd probably be more forgiving if that had been the road taken, but because of that internet leak John's just kind of ""there"".Despite being PG-13, the movie doesn't feel like it's been neutered or watered down and the action sequences and set pieces are well staged with a good sense of where everything is in relation to each other and the scenes and settings have a very Mad Max meets Black Hawk Down quality to them that works quite well. While some elements could've benefitted from more intensity (such as a scene where Marcus Wright and his companion Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood or ambushed by marauders) the action is impactful and well-staged. I think the third act is where the movie gets a bit weaker despite a really good twist involving Marcus Wright that adds to the dimensions of his character, but after that scene the third act kind of drags and eventually recycles bits from Terminator 2 (not excessively, but enough to call attention to it).Admittedly when I first saw Terminator Salvation 13 years ago I was probably a little more harsh than I should've been, and upon re-watch there's a clear understanding of the franchise and a genuine attempt to take it in a new direction. It's not flawless (far from it) but with the performances of Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin as well as some well-produced action beats and effects I can say without reservation it's a good Terminator movie even if it doesn't reach the levels it clearly wanted to.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Salvation Used to Come with a Sense of Humor,"The sci-fi series about cyborgs and the audiences who love them trundles on, giving us the least impressive (but still entertaining) installment to date.Judgement day has come and gone and the war between humans and machines is in full swing. John Connor (a super serious Christian Bale) is now in charge of the resistance, and a new breed of terminators built from combining humans with computers is under development. Meanwhile, SkyNet has issued a directive to kill Kyle Reese, John Connor's father, so that he can't come back in time and protect Connor's mother so that SHE can give birth to John Connor, who will one day lead the human resistance against the machines. Am I repeating myself? Thus the plot outlined in the four Terminator movies has finally come full circle (literally) like a dog chasing its tail.""Salvation"" is flashy and well made, but there's also something humorless and dogged about it in comparison to the earlier movies. There's none of the tongue-in-cheek humor, and McG can't stage action scenes as well as James Cameron. There's lots of nifty special effects on display here, but nothing you haven't seen before. The actors don't seem to be having much fun, and the Terminators themselves don't play a very large role, which means the plot of this installment is much less compelling than its predecessors. It also easily has the cheesiest and dumbest ending of the series, or of any number of other movies I've seen recently, for that matter.And for the life of me, I still can't figure out how John Connor ends up being older than his own dad, who he spends most of this film trying to protect.

what a show,"I can honestly say that this is one of the best actions movie I've ever seen. In fact, it is as good as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, HELL YEAH!Intense plot. Real good. Had some flaws, have to admit, but it was strong nonetheless. Everything connected and there was definitely an ""aaaah"" moment and of course a ""wow, that rocks"" moment.Great, with a capital G, acting! Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, the two main protagonists of the movie, put up one good show. The chemistry is just pure solace. Anton Yelchin, at first, I thought could not be the best choice to play Kyle Reese, who from what I remember from T1, was freaking hot. But, the dude actually pulled it quite well. (SPOILER AHEAD) Kinda makes you cry thinking that he is going to die soon (Back in T1, not this movie, duh!!)The action sequences, can't even begin to describe how good they were. What you saw in the preview, imagine that, but in a 2 hour preview! Have to admit, the first 20 minutes = Zzz. The next 1 hr and 30 minutes = I had too much terminator, eyes cannot close.Two disappointing things about this movie. a) the background score, what is up with that. Either there was no score, or it did not make a good impression on me for me to remember how it went! I am disappointed only with that. Hans Zimmer would have been a good choice, no questions asked! b) the ending. sorry, but I was hoping something else entirely. You would know when you see it. But even so, with this ending, the movie still rocked my day!So, my suggestion would be to catch this movie as quickly as you can! and make sure you learn your Terminator Trivia before doing so.

Movie? What movie?,"The reason the original Terminator was such an enduring success is because it had intrigue. Time travel is always intriguing and T1 had a new, albeit implausible take on it. And the fish out of water element of putting a typical suburban housewife in the middle of a struggle for the future of humanity was intriguing too.The fun of all this intrigue was that when the scary machine man from the future chased the kid and his mom all over LA, we were engaged. We cared. And because we cared, when the abundance of action did occur, it had a sense of purpose we could latch on to, a reason to take the ride.The problem with this movie, as with most of the post-Bruckheimer action films, is it has no intrigue, no character, no heart, and no sense of purpose. How one could produce a film about an apocalyptic future Earth devoid of intrigue is the most intriguing thing to me.So, like so many others in the genre, I've already forgotten about this film only minutes of having left the theater.What did I just see again? Speed, explosions, effects, and the attempted piggybacking on the intrigue created by James Cameron and a lost, forgotten Hollywood that once understood the importance of telling a story. What I saw was just another forgettable movie where plot came a distant second to action and effects.It is, of course, amazing what can be done nowadays. And T4 is a visual masterpiece of CGI and effects. But what a waste. Because without heart, intrigue, and purpose, there's really not much of a purpose in seeing this film.

Lacks imagination and could have played to its strengths more,"In Terminator Salvation, director McG creates a stark vision of a future in which a devastated world is filled with killer robots and humans who will do anything to survive. It's visually sublime, at times exciting, and introduces an interesting new character to the series. But while it's a decent part-reboot/part-continuation of the Terminator franchise, not to mention a marked improvement over Jonathan Mostow's forgettable Terminator 3, what keeps it from reaching the upper echelon of quality summer popcorn movies is a lack of fun and a story and characters that could have been beefed up a bit.The first Terminator film was an old-fashioned low-budget monster movie that nonetheless contained some frighteningly visceral imagery. The second film remains to this day one of the greatest action flicks of all time; groundbreaking film-making on a number of levels. Despite the first two films in the series being worlds apart in some respects, the things they had in common, besides some entertaining action, were interesting characters as well as a sense of fun and innovation. Terminator Salvation, in contrast, is generally lacking in all three of these areas.The movie opens in the year 2003 with a death-row inmate, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) agreeing to release his body to the custody of Cyberdyne Industries for research after his execution. Despite a bit of awkward scripting in this scene, Worthington and Helena Bonham Carter (cameoing as a Cyberdyne researcher dying of cancer) make it work; a demonstration of how talented actors can at times overcome a weak script.That said, Worthington's Wright is by far the most interesting character in the movie, and the movie fares its best when it makes him the focus, in part due to his character being the closest thing the movie offers to a new wrinkle in the franchise mythology. His interactions with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), whom he meets while wandering the ruined streets of Los Angeles, periodically inject the movie with some desperately-needed humor. Worthington's low-key, understated performance is pitch-perfect; he is believable as a badass whose mere existence makes him vulnerable, and movie-goers will likely wish that the film would have firmly focused on Wright's struggle to both deal with the reality of the world he awakened to as well as solving the mystery of what exactly happened to him after his ""execution."" In contrast, the activities of the human resistance, led in part by an adult John Connor (Christian Bale), seem strangely tacked-on, fairly aimless up until the point in the film in which Connor and Wright finally cross paths. This is not the fault of the performers; all the actors do as good a job as can be expected for a movie such as this. Bale's Connor is thankfully (for the most part) not the clone of his Batman persona that the trailers at times had suggested it might be. As was the case in Star Trek, Yelchin succeeds in playing the plucky, resourceful teenager. Carter's cameo is fantastic despite it being a bit under-written, and her presence alone makes you wish the writers had done more with the role she was given. But the clear standout is Worthington, in part because his role is the one that is scripted the strongest.McG's version of the future is fittingly bleak and colorless, and his periodic allusions and homages to the previous Terminator movies are a nice touch. Despite some impressive visuals, however, the viewer will easily detect a lack of imagination in McG's directing job. For example, much of the early action comes off as little more than a hybrid of Mad Max and Transformers (the ""Transforminator"" ridicule many of you have likely heard of by this point is well-deserved), while the climatic battle at the end of the film is almost a shot-for-shot remake of the one at the end of Terminator 2. It's not that the action is never exciting or fun to watch (which it is at times); it's simply not anything you haven't seen before. His pacing during the film's quieter moments is a bit hit-and-miss as well; it will become clear to the viewer that McG can direct action much better than he can drama after seeing how awkward some of the conversations between the characters are.Enough was entertaining in this film to give me hope that the inevitable fifth Terminator film will be willing to return to the core ideals that made the series a marquee franchise; interesting characters, innovative action, and a sense of fun. For now, we're stuck with just another hunk of over-buttered, seen-it-before summer popcorn that takes itself way too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Terminator so far!,"I loved T1. Brilliant movie with a great universe. T2 was good as well, with some new breakthrough effects and still the 'great' acting of Arnold.

Better than 3 day old Coyote,"Greetings again from the darkness. Can't quite put my finger on it. Amazing action and terrific special effects, stunning sound and a decent story that compliments the previous installments ... but still something is missing.First off, the casting is very odd throughout - Christian Bale as John Connor, Sam Worthington (in place of first choice Josh Brolin), bland Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes), Helena Bonham Carter (seriously??), Jane Alexander (in an action film??), and Common (with a competent scowl). Best choice is Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese. Mr. Yelchin is having a nice summer with Terminator and Star Trek (where he is even better).Next, director McG is an odd choice. Which of the Charlie's Angels films qualified him for this? Actually, most of his work is decent, but his work with the actors left much to be desired.Thirdly, why the heck is Sam Worthington on screen more than Christian Bale? Just a wild guess, but I suppose there was quite a disparity in their paychecks!Can't help but get a kick out the tie-ins to previous installment - Linda Hamilton's voice on tape, re-treads of famous lines and even CGI Arnold making an appearance.

More like 'Terminator Salvage Job',"I came into the theaters on opening night with fairly low expectations after reading some critical reviews - one of which used the term I am borrowing a bit here - calling it 'Terminator Salvage.' I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, and while the film will surely please some, for many others it may leave you feeling disappointed with this once mighty and critically acclaimed franchise.The effects and art direction were well done, but that's not saying much for action movies these days, nor is it enough to carry a film if you are interested in more than things blowing up. A strength of the previous Terminator films was that it was a sci-fi series that had a sort of realism that allowed many viewers to buy into the story. Over-the top acting, difficult to fathom plot lines, and things that seem to go against what we learned in previous films make the picture drag. Some actors struggle with the material, and Bale also seems generally as disinterested as he reportedly was before singing on, yelling his way through the film, and doing his an imitation of his voicing of Batman.Of course, there will be those that will come away enjoying it, but after growing up a huge Terminator fan and seeing it, i was not particularly impressed after the early part of the movie, and i will think for many who once loved this series you may not feel the kind of intense chill and suspense that the machines once portrayed to the audience. Inclusions of the cute, mute child character reminds me of how Jar Jar Binks seemed misplaced in 'The Phantom Menace' and another example of how 'Terminator Salvation' strays from the first two movies, perhaps in pursuit of an even wider audience (which could also explain the PG-13 rating, versus R ratings for the previous 3).Sadly we get a fairly mediocre and forgettable film that perhaps was not in the right hands, direction wise with McG. 'Terminator Salvation' is not awful, but not worth garnering any kind of significant praise. You know when you are laughing and it's not intentional, unless a film maker wishes to seek cult status for all the wrong reasons (like a movie that people do drugs with in a group to make fun of) this is not a good thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Directing alone does not account for this failure.,"The directing on this movie is actually fairly competent from a strictly visual point of view, the second unit directing was also not too bad, but the story had no drive and you didn't give a crap what happened to anyone. The supposed shocker moments were like 'who cares' instead of 'WOW'.Directors with no vision always produce movies like this, they end up trying too hard to please everyone and end up pleasing no one. Its a great example of hack film making, McG learned how to make movies by watching Michael Bay movies, not realizing that that makes him nothing more than a Michael Bay hack, and Michael Bay himself is nothing more than a hack of James Cameron. So we are watching a movie made by a hack of a hack of a good director.Good directors are like any other great artist, they only come along 1 or 2 per generation. So far for this generation the only director that can be possibly included in that list is Nolan.Let me give McG one hint, if your movie is filled with huge explosions from beginning till end, then none of the explosions will stand out in anyones mind, they just all run together. Have no more than 2 or 3 big explosions, have the spaced out so the biggest one is near the end, and have that be FOR some good reason or else no one will care.This movie is just a turd, I'm sure the average movie going public will just ignore it but its a real letdown for fans of Terminator 1/2 who really wanted something a little more after T3.Basically its a really poorly thought out story with one 'gotcha' moment in it that everyone can see coming a mile away. Too many big explosions that you don't care about. An ending that seems a foregone conclusion, and its really way too long.Bad. Avoid.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's dark and gloomy without Arnold,"It's 25 years since the original 'Terminator,' starring Arnold Schwartzenegger and written and directed by James Cameron, but our memories aren't too dim to recall how much silly loud fun that movie was, in comparison. Arnold and James also teamed up for the slightly less successful but still breathtakingly exciting 'Terminator 2.' Cameron left Arnold to his own devices (or rather another director) for the still less successful, but nonetheless highly profitable and arguably quite entertaining 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,' which heralds the situation chronicled in this still louder and more high tech and more fatalistic 'Terminator' blockbuster, which has had just about all the fun squeezed out of it. What a pity Arnold was too busy struggling with California's hopeless state budget to lend his endearingly wooden charm and outsize body to this movie. The first thing that's wrong with this version is that the machines have no personalities, not even an Austrian weightlifter's.We have to begin with a sci-fi plot device I can never quite understand: that the hero must enter the past to change things so the future--that is, the present--can turn out the way it is already. Or at least that's how it seems to me. I just find it hard enough living in the present. If anybody can go back and tinker with history, like Dick Cheney, at just about any time, what's the use? But this is the essence of the 'Terminator' franchise: delving back into the past to change things so your side, be it humanity or the evil cyber world, will have an edge.Throughout the series, humankind has been enslaved by machines. (Now that part I get.) A man named John Connor leads a revolt of the human slaves. How do we know that, if it's changeable? There's always that struggle from one film to the next over going back in time to prevent Connor from being born, or kill him off as a kid, or make sure he is born. This could go on forever; but then franchises are designed that way.What's equally mystifying in this cool-looking, stylistically distinctive, but relatively more pointless 'Terminator' film, the fourth in the franchise, is that this appears to be at least partly a prequel (maybe any time-travel story is?), but it's also thoroughly post-apocalyptic. The world, which just to keep things convenient let us call Los Angeles, is now a post-nuclear holocaust wasteland of broken metal and minefields. John Connor is Christian Bale. But--and this is another thing I can't quite follow--his dad, Kyle Reese, is among the prisoners, in the youthful form of Anton Yelchin, no longer spouting a Russian accent as in the new 'Star Trek'. And of course Anton has to be protected because the machines are out to kill him, because. . .well, if we know the series, we know why. Couldn't they just kill Christian Bale? Well, they'd like to, but they simply can't, because, well, he's Batman, you know, and he's a real s.o.b. as well.The ghost in the machine, so to speak (the machine of this rather mechanical sequel) is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a prisoner on death row in the film prelude who signs his body over to Helena Bonham Carter for ""research."" Somehow he pops up fifteen years later, very confused about what he is. A pity the muscular Worthington is rather bland, because he plays a pivotal role either as nemesis or salvation, it's not certain which.A cyborg gives his heart that Christian Bale may live, which seems rather appropriate given the apparently dysfunctional Bale's rude manners both on screen and off. Bale is relentlessly one-note as the leader in battle against the man-killer machines, and the anticlimactic ending states that the war remains yet to be won. All that's been accomplished is a lot of explosions (set off nicely by the dark, monochromatic visuals) and a lot of ornately bent-up metal, somewhere in what is referred to as Los Angeles. Let's hear it for the explosions (as well as the fires, the detonators, the electro-shocks, the crashes, the monstrous death's-head creatures, and the computer-readout thingies, for this is their film, and they light it up both literally and figuratively against the prevailingly dark and ashen landscape). Nothing else much matters, other than a brief and shining moment when what looks like a naked Arnold does battle with Christian Bale. In the other 'Terminator' movies, especially the first two, there was a lot more human interest. Even the machines were (almost) human, and that made all the difference.

Arnold was then expected to complete its mandate and then shoot, shoot that well in the thighs!Arnold back to film more movies your fans welcome!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This franchise needs to end right here and now. Yes, it was that bad.","Like a chicken without its head, Terminator Salvation stumbles blindly around the cinematic barnyard making lots of noise, but ultimately going nowhere. The movie jumps around in plot like a barefoot man trying to walk on a hot bed of coals. John Conner and company clumsily play out the roles and stereotypes that are better off left to the pages of the history books and sequels gone by. I'm no huge Terminator fan and no Cameron fan but did we really need to see this grim and dumb future that feels like a re-hash? I know I didn't.I hope this thing bombs bad. The last thing we need is future cinema to be showing McG's Terminator Revenge and Terminator Salutation. This franchise needs to end right here and now. Yes, it was that bad.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's decent.,"It's very bland and unmemorable Terminator film. It's has some very cool action, but not much of it. The story and everything are just bland. It delivers a servicable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, but doesn't quite live up to the theme","This was suppose to be an ""in between"" movie, not a prequel nor really a sequel. I read somewhere that this was going to tie up some loose ends from the original and the Judgment Day movies, but unfortunately it leaves many more dangling loose ends than it ties up...I suppose the insertion of another Terminator, who doesn't know he is one, is someone's idea of mystery or intrigue, but it sure didn't do anything to make this more ""interesting"" to me. Wow, and the first scene in Skynet's control room had me seeing Vickie from ""I Robot"". That felt like the writers didn't have enough imagination to handle this one. Oh well...I did give it a 7, but it just doesn't feel like a Terminator movie...good action.p.s. I thought I'd better put this in too, since someone is bound to notice...no, I didn't reference 3 movies, since I don't consider the T3 one to be ""worthy"" if you will...the only part of T3 that impressed me at all is at the very end when ""John"" realizes that the weight of the world really has landed on him...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wow,"Okay I will just start by thanking my stars that this movie was made . They did an excellent job creating a great vibe for this film. When I saw the original terminator at the movies and imagined John Conner - lets just say this movie would do more than suffice.
The only problem i have is that people are complaining and whats is going to happen is ,of course they will make another Terminator move and instead of this awesomeness and budget and cast ! it's going to be something more nostalgic again . I want terminator cannon ! not just movies about people hunting and being hunted by terminators, this is this very first instance in my life when I want to scream 'what is wrong with you people ' this happened it was done and it was done correctly who cares what you thought you wanted . Anyways, my rant and my review thanks a lot haters you are going to wreck everything . I guarantee that in 30 years when all the Terminator movies are lined up this will be top three and the rest probably won't even register. Certainly not after this response. I am so pissed off right now",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could Be Smarter,"Salvation succeeds on the editing and vibe as it strives for a dark knight sort of feeling - but it fails miserably on the plausibility of the premise. Machines are efficient and effective... they don't fight like humans.. they don't run around like Rambo. That's just idiotic. So... for someone wanting to be entertained from a 2009 version of this epic title series... it's just not going to cut it. Even Avengers and Transformers are becoming more ""plausible"" scenarios in the past decade. PS Christian Bale is always amazing in any case.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An absolute travesty.,"Terminator. I think the movie title is almost legend to its fans. I have seen the trilogy at least 20 times, and it's definitely my favorite movie trilogy of all time. This... absolute travesty to film doesn't even deserve to use the name ""Terminator"" in its title. There was no plot, no character development, no story, no... anything. It was like a Micahel Bay film, (not that that's entirely bad) in that it was just action, and... not even really good action at that.god! I'm trying to write a negative review and I can't even think of the words I want to say - that's how angry this film made me. Making a sequel to the best trilogy of all time must be difficult, but I could have stuck a pen in my ass, wiggled it around on a piece of paper for an hour, and written a better movie than this. For a summer blockbuster, it was maybe a 4/10, but as a followup to TERMINATOR?!??! no - your fans expected more - we expected something that lived up to the first 3. What you gave us was a sad, pathetic piece of sh** movie that had absolutely NO purpose, NO plot, NO characters that we could feel and understand and watch again and again - nothing!If I were rich, I would pay Mario Kassar to go direct a new Terminator 4, and pay to have every copy of this waste of a film burned. The writers, the actors, everyone - should all be ashamed of this. I can't give it lower than 1 out of 10 or else I would.In five years of reading IMDb, I've never signed up for an account, but I had to, JUST for you Terminator Salvation.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most dark terminator,Before I watch the movie all the people I now told me that terminator salvation (T4) sucks! But as a fan of the previous movies I couldn't resist and I wanted to see it besides the bad comments of my friends. What did I see? The most dark terminator of all the series. The only terminator movie that doesn't need special effects to stand up. The only terminator movie that the actors really plays. The only terminator movie that there is actually a plot.The first terminator will be the best of the series forever because of the prototype idea. But after that movie I put T4 as the second best movie of the series (sorry Arnold but I prefer the new version).I hope T5 will be in the same line with this one.,10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Don't think of it as part of the Terminator series and You will like it,"If you compare this to Terminator 2 then you will feel disappointed, but if you look at it as just an action film in its own right then you won't mind it so much. I was under the impression that their would be some character development in this film since they got talented actors Christian Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard to appear in this film. Turns out that was just a trick, we don't get to see them do any acting, they might as well have just had cardboard cut outs.Sam Worthington proves that he deserves to be thrust into the action spotlight, he has Avatar and Clash of the Titans coming up as well. Within a years time this almost unknown actor will have appeared in three huge movies. I first saw him in this independent Australian film called Somersault and thought he was pretty decent in that. He holds Terminator Salvation together, if they had gotten a suck actor to play his part this film would have crumbled.There wasn't much originality within the construction of a futuristic society, looked similar to a number of other crappy futuristic movies. I think they will probably make another sequel after this, why not?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Someone stop Sam Worthington before he opens the gateway to hell!,"The few humans who survived judgment day are waging a war against the machines that were responsible for the deaths of almost everyone on earth. John Connor, one of the leaders of the resistance is struggling to be the commander he knows he is destined to be and Marcus Wright, a machine who thinks he's a man, must struggle with where his allegiances truly lie.Terminator Salvation has very little to offer. The acting, writing, and characters are extremely sparse. Almost every character is about as two dimensional as a piece of cardboard and Sam Worthington acts about as good as one. This makes three action epics that he has starred in that have been a complete waste of time (Clash of the Titans, Avatar{sorry, it sucks}). For some reason instead of focusing on John Connor, who should be the main character of the movie, the filmmakers decided to focus on a ridiculous terminator who thinks he's human storyline.During most of the action scenes you can't tell what is going on, and when you can they don't make no sense. The entire climax of Terminator Salvation is one of more unrealistic and plot hole filled sections of any move in recent memory.Hollywood needs to stop making Termiator movies; it is completely ridiculous and the story ended with Terminator 2. The third movie was just a carbon copy of 2 with a female robot, this one is a complete mess and five will be even worse. So Please, no more movies about Terminators and no more movies with Sam Worthington. Thank You.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I tried watching it 3 times and the 3 times I ended up asleep,"Its really boring, just that. Not even the action is good on the movie, the looks of it is ugly, the story is a mess and is boring, the characters and flat and boring, everything is boring. I remember that even as a kid, I feel asleep watching it in the middle of the day. Its just boring, boring and nothing more but boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
