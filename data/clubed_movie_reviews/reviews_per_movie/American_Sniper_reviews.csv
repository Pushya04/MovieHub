"Bradley Cooper bulked up his shoulders and took on a very difficult role that etches him on the list of ""Great Actors"" as he plays the real life character of Chris Kyle.","(I hope I can get through this review without tearing up)Viewing this movie in the theatre is different than usual. While you walk in and grab your seat, you may feel that everyone around you is anticipating the same thing ... a powerful story about a powerful man with a powerful purpose. That's a lot for a movie to live up to.I believe you will walk out of the theatre with many thoughts after watching American Sniper ... and one of those thoughts will be that Bradley Cooper gave unwavering respect to Chris Kyle, his family, his fellow SEALS, his country and the movie industry. He bulked up his shoulders and took on a very difficult role that etches him on the list of ""Great Actors"" as he plays the real life character of Chris Kyle. Simply put - he was believable. His look. His accent. His Texas strut. His dip. His eyes. Watching the film you can clearly see what I assume to be parallel of what Kyle experienced on the battlefields abroad and at home. I can only hope the Kyle family and friends feel the same, as Cooper's acting appears to be a beautiful tribute to a ""Legend"".While Clint Eastwood didn't break any ground with direction, I do believe he was a perfect choice for this film and did an incredible job telling Kyle's story without putting politics on the screen. This is a rough story to watch no matter your political views ... war is hell on all sides. If Eastwood put politics in the film I believe the audience would have lost the purpose of the piece. This is a movie that liberals, conservatives, libertarians, and ""I-don't-knowins"" can appreciate.The best movies make you walk out of the doors seeing the world a bit differently. American Sniper gives an eerie look into a world that we, as Americans, are so far away from. Many of us don't know death like this. We don't know what it's like to face the mental and physical challenges our troops face during war. We've never been in the middle of a sand- storm fire fight. Eastwood, his crew and cast provide us with a small glimpse into what our troops face overseas and stateside. After seeing the movie inside an enormous mall, it was a bit surreal to walk out to an Urban Outfitters and Apple store full of Christmas shoppers. American Sniper will push you outside of everyday life to tell you a story that will stir your head and your heart.Personally, American Sniper brought many emotions about the courageous servicemen, women and their families that have touched my life. Over the years I've had the honor to work with the American Veterans Center (AVC) in Arlington, VA, who host the National Memorial Day Parade and Wounded Warrior Experience among other great events. Some of the veterans who starred in American Sniper have also shared their story during AVC events. If this movie inspires you to learn more about these outstanding men and women, please check out AVC.American Sniper also reminded me of the bravest people I know -- Lance Corporal Nicholas Erdy and his family. Much like you see on the screen, the Erdy's sacrifice and love for our country is the stuff superheroes are made of.To the Kyle family, Erdys, all veterans, servicemen and women, and their families ... thank you for your sacrifice and courage. Your stories inspire us to strive for love and peace. To Eastwood, Cooper and the American Sniper team ... thank you for clearly putting your heart into this important American story. Bravo.Bottom line - the Chris Kyle Story - American Sniper - is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
clint hits the target with American sniper...,"it was extremely 'even'. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced storytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i've seen in years...and while we're at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as well... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no reason to drag it out, either... i don't feel it lingered on any one dynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much violence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty horrors... it doesn't, on the other hand, turn away from any of the ugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the role. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle but present. it's as well done a war movie as i'll ever need.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood Propaganda and Brainwash,"I did enjoy the film on a purely ""for entertainment only"" level. Some of the gun fights and action sequences felt just like you are playing the game Call of Duty or Battlefield. 6.5/10 However, as many other have said before me, this film is totally inaccurate in its portrayal of America's role in the war.It fails to address the fact that America invaded Iraq for no reason other than to acquire resources.....Consequently many hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians were either severely injured or fatally wounded in what many now recognise as an unlawful invasion of another country.The danger is that those who are not familiar with the facts of this war may watch this (in the future) and be lead to a very inaccurate and biased view of what truly happened.It is for this reason that I have no choice but to give this a 1/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intense, Emotional, Controversial and yet Engaging","When it comes to true story films, there are times where film-makers try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being told. In this case, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper has already contracted not only positive acclaim but a stir of negativity and controversy that surrounds the way Kyle was really like in life. Some say he had lost his mind in the war for peace while others say he was caught up in the emotional aftermath after service but Eastwood has stated that his film is ""the biggest anti-war statement any film can make,"" and said that ""the fact of what war does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did""What AS tells is the true life figure Chris Kyle who served as the American military's 'lethal sniper' who has made more kills in his duty of tours during the Iraq war period after 9/11. It chronicles how Chris became a true American to protect his homeland and the aftermath of serving his tours when he came home to his small growing family, leading up to the final hours of his life.Pros:+ Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris Kyle is indeed a new height for his career, he gives a performance that can be described as gripping, tense and at times+ The action sequences are all done well, but at times it can be tense, violent and confronting for some.+ The emotional connection between the main character and his family, that the final scene that will either break you or make you undecided.Cons:The controversy that surrounds it, it can make the film an exaggerated lie or truth to what Kyle was like in reality but again it is showing what war can do on people on the front-line and home.OVERALL: Despite the controversy it has gained by writers , the film is indeed a strong acting showcase for Cooper while leaving audiences both open and more aware of the effects of war on human kind. Go in with an open mind and see for yourself for what you would think that made Chris Kyle a 'lethal sniper' for this country. If you had liked The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and Machine Gun Preacher (not a war film but somewhat similar to Kyle's story) you will enjoy this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A war movie through the eyes of a sharpshooter,"American Sniper is an American war film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the self-biography about the sharpshooter Chris Kyle. Chris is American who dreams of becoming a cowboy but after the events of 11 September, he decides to join the Navy Seals. Throughout the film we follow him on his trips to Iraq to fight against the terrorists, and we also see him during his trips home to the USA in between.American Sniper feels very American and patriotic. The film has more or less divided USA in two sections, while some praise the film for its portrayal of the American soldiers' heroic efforts, others feels it hails and embellish a devastating war. I feel there is some truth to both sides because on one hand it shows the brutality of the terrorists ways, even against their own population, but it also shows the American soldiers breaking in to homes of innocent people and using force and violence to get their way.Clint Eastwood has done well with the direction because we truly experience the soldiers' fear of never knowing who to trust, whether it's grown man or a small child. The war scenes are well made and they don't feel shaky or edited too fast just to force a feeling of action. Bradley Cooper does a really good job, probably the best I've seen of him so far, but I still wish we could have gotten to know his character even more. He's obviously a patriotic American but what really motivates him besides the love for his country, is sometimes hard to understand.Overall, I feel the film is OK and worth watching because it actually shows the brutality that was the war in Iraq, but I still can't help feeling that sometimes it seems Clint Eastwood had to bow down a little too much before Kyles' family. It appears they couldn't include some scenes just because his family didn't approve. As a story American Sniper doesn't feel unique or contributing in some new way for us, the audience, but I still feel you can watch the film and make up your own mind.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fantastic - Views On The War Aside, A Great Movie","I spent 27 years in the US Army, was in Operation Desert Storm (the original), was vehemently opposed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thought this movie was one of the best military/war movies I've ever seen. The realism was there, Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, the angst of a soldier during battle was portrayed brilliantly, the decisions we ask kids to make are real and they were realistically shown on screen, and as this film makes clear--war isn't a walk in the park. Anybody who thinks Bradley Cooper is a flash in the pan is sadly mistaken; this guy is the real thing. Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, Charlie Sheen in Platoon, and now Bradley Cooper in American Sniper. You've got to go all the way back to Gregory Peck in Pork Chop Hill or George C. Scott in Patton to get even close to an actor that gave a better performance in this genre. I saw it twice. Couldn't get through it the first time and had to walk out- -I got so damned furious at George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld for murdering all these innocent kids I couldn't watch anymore. Once I got past that I went back to see it again and trust me--it's phenomenal.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Voted 10+ by Americans for being American, <6 by anyone else","I'm just not sure what to think about this. I don't get why films have to have ""American"" in their name, other than for nationalism-peddling studio marketing scams. I don't get why they didn't just call it ""Sniper"", and it'd be interesting to see whether the same people voting this 9+ would give an equally good film the same score if it was called ""Islamic Sniper"". Propaganda is propaganda is propaganda is propaganda - whether it's produced in California, East Berlin, or in Pyongyang. I also don't get why Clint Eastwood chose this route, as his direction has been abjectly gorgeous again and again: the subtlety and elegant build up is always masterful. Nevertheless, i wanted to be open-minded, and not cynically write the piece off in the reactionary spin of labeling it American exceptionalism.It does seem very badly-timed and insensitive in a period of public battle fatigue, and it has clearly been extremely divisive. As one commenter pointed out, ""when America makes a film about a war with a country that can fight back, i'll watch it."" All i could think about was the very old WWI quote that war is old men talking, and young men dying. War is horrific: everyone who's never been in one is in favor. Listen to any veteran's stories from the Middle East (burning bodies etc) and you instantly sense the ambiguity and nightmare-ish disillusionment. 1M+ civilians have died in Iraq, and now we have the phoenix of ISIL.The terrifying statistic is that veteran suicides are now classed as an epidemic: 6.500 former personnel killed themselves in 2012 (22 per day over the last decade), and at least 20% suffer with PTSD (Shell Shock) - 50% of whom never seek treatment. More die from suicide than from enemy bullets, 22M receive some form of benefit, and 1M+ claims are hopelessly backlogged.There is clearly something to say about the US military with spending more than the next 25 countries combined: it's training, tactics, post-battle care, and its invasive ideology. There is no apparent community ""hearts and minds"" strategy (e.g. the British manipulative rule book), just bomb and burn. The fact the US has had 20+ wars in its 200 years - most of dubious success - and it's the most sensitive patriotic tender-spot for the US public despite being the most neglected, implies there is some real material here to be explored.And thankfully, the film slowly gets into gear to try to do that - to some extent. The first 30mins are fairly nauseating nationalism, but as time wears on, so does Kyle's disconnection with his ordinary self. The trouble is: one read of his book shows that the film character is a fabrication, or a pastiche caricature. He admittedly felt nothing of taking 200 lives, and was somewhat of an unquestioning military automaton: whether that should be celebrated as ""heroic"" is a matter of debate; ""skillful"" perhaps, maybe even virtuous at a stretch.Soldiers can always be elevated for their bravery, and causes can be celebrated in the case of their validation of the Just War doctrine. But this did clearly not pass the Just War test; nor was the nobility of the troops' conduct evidenced in the sympathies of the local population; and the site of women and children resisting foreign troops is abhorrent, no matter how vicious TheTerrorists (TM) are portrayed. No matter how unjust or unsympathetic either side is, we can all understand brotherhood/camaraderie, loyalty, skillfully disciplining oneself to the task, suffering the personal consequences, our basic humanity, and so on. Heroism is differentiated from duty by the fact it is an exceptional act, and this worship is beginning to feel like narcissism.I'm not sure what Eastwood's motivations were when parsing the script, but it sadly feels like dispassionate, sanctimonious back-patting. And if 6,500 men and women who offered to put themselves in harm's way have killed themselves and not even seen the counter-productive rise of the Islamic Caliphate they fought against for Halliburton, it's a gross disservice to ignore their testimonies in favor of an attempt at a serious version of Team America.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bradley Cooper Gives One Of The Best Performances Of His Career.,American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character. There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Decent movie,"Well first of, Bradley Coopers muscle-gain in this movie is amazing and it really is a good and moving performance on his part. This movie has both a love affair and the war drama you would expect from a movie about an American sniper, but neither really catches on. The part of the movie in between deployments doesn't really do anything for the story, and it really reduces the overall impression of this movie. It seems as though this part of the movie hasn't really received as big an effort as the parts when he is deployed in Iraq.The combat scenes are very convincing, they reminded me of Black Hawk Down, and you really can't put a finger on those parts. All in all this is a movie worth while seeing, and it will quite possibly demand an emotional reaction, but then it is soon forgotten. Maybe if i were American and had a sense of American patriotism, i would rate this movie a bit higher.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brutal and Powerful; American Sniper ranks among the best of the year,"American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's harrowing take on Chris Kyle's life and his service in the Navy as a SEAL sniper who killed nearly 200 enemy soldiers. The film is relentlessly violent and disturbing but honors the life of the late Chris Kyle in a very admirable way. It doesn't show this man as an invincible legend, it shows him as a mere man with a heart and soul that are clearly broken due to his sacrifice for his country. Bradley Cooper delivers the best performance of his career as Chris Kyle. Cooper didn't merely bulk up for the role, he became this man without any hesitation and doesn't hit a false note. Clint Eastwood proves that he can still deliver a phenomenal film even in his mid-eighties. It isn't only impressive for his age, but American Sniper is an impressive film in general. It doesn't wallow in classic war film clichès, it tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the book and while some creative liberties were taken in telling the story regarding pacing, it is an excellent film. It isn't an all out war film like The Hurt Locker, it is a heavy drama with plenty of gut wrenching scenes both on and off the battle field. The most interesting part of this film is the parallels between Kyle's life as a sniper and Kyle's deteriorating life state side. It is an interesting dynamic to add to a film like this and echoes past films from the 70s such as Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. On a technical level, American Sniper sores with great cinematography that is a bit more colorful when compared to Eastwood's past films and excellent sound design. You see every wound and hear every gunshot with realistic velocity. It is a truly great cinematic experience. Overall, American Sniper is a great film that will tug at your heart strings much like last year's Lone Survivor and even goes one step beyond that film and gives us grade A entertainment with grade A acting. It stands as one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
America rah-rah BS glorifying war,"Why do they have to portray Americans as mindless cretins? While Clint Eastwood has done some good work, American Sniper is merely a movie riding the ""rah-rah, aren't we great"" wave after an illegal war in Iraq.Instead of being a propaganda film, it would be better if the horrors and brutality of war were shown. Perhaps then we would have fewer mindless recruits embracing the path to PTSD.For one thing, the path to becoming a SEAL is GRUELING, and this film makes light of it. Also, killing another human is not s simple as this film would have you believe.I wnt to see more of the gore of war so the cretins who sign up will realize it is not the boy scouts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Any Way You Judge It,"I honestly believe every American should see this film. If after viewing you aren't filled with a sober reverence and feelings of gratitude then shame on you. This is the quintessential film surrounding the war on terror from the point of view of those that served and even their families. I've read a review by a former Navy Seal (Brent Gleeson) that says it best ""The way the film was directed coupled with outstanding performances by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller and the rest of the cast made for a heart wrenching and deeply accurate portrayal of the external and internal battles our service men and women face. Not to mention the even greater sacrifices made by the families and loved ones back home.""I would rate it shear perfection had they spent more time with his recovery and angst driven road back once he was stateside. This is easily one of my top five films of the year.",,Anonymous,Biography
Good Film,"Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in American military history. It begins with the thirty year old Kyle as a cowboy type who is searching for meaning in his life when he becomes a navy seal. After rigorous training he is sent to Iraq and becomes a legendary sniper. The war scenes look very similar to Stanley Kubrick's often used ones in Full Metal Jacket. The camera tracks from behind the soldiers as they move forward. The action is fast paced and well done by director Clint Eastwood. The melodramatic family moments are fairly typical, with the suffering wife holding the home front while hubby keeps the world safe for democracy. I found Sierra Miller annoying as Kyle's spouse, but Cooper was cast right in the lead role. Although a bit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is still one of the better films of 2014.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A beautifully well crafted action movie by the great Clint Eastwood,"Good work on Bradley Cooper's part as well, putting on the weight and getting into character to play Chris Kyle, a sniper for the navy seals who did four tours in Iraq protecting his fellow troops by being a legendary shot. the Movie explores Kyle having to deal with a rival sniper who was keeping him from doing the job of protecting his troops and having to deal with coming home to his wife and kids feeling that his mission was incomplete.Old man Eastwood mixed action, drama and humor in a way only a legendary filmmaker could put together.

"Bradley Cooper is Right On Target as Chris Kyle, American Hero","In American Sniper Bradley Cooper plays Chris Kyle, a real life Navy SEAL sharp shooter. The story is based on the Autobiography by Chris Kyle and chronicles his life and legend where he is reported to have over 150 confirmed kills in his career as a SEAL. The movie, directed by a legend in his own right Clint Eastwood, opens in the midst of battle where Kyle is about to make his very first confirmed kill. From there the movie jumps around with a series of flash backs to get you up to speed on the background of Kyle from childhood to how he ended up as a America's most deadly sniper. After the flashbacks, the movie takes you from one gruesome battle situation to another highlighting some of the more noteworthy kills of his career; all while trying to hold down a family, marriage and his own sanity.Overall this is not Eastwood's best work. There is no real visual style here. I wanted this badly to be on the level of Lone Survivor (2013). Yet with the exception of Cooper and Sienna Miller who plays Kyle's wife, there are no other real marquee actors. The performances seem flat and the world created seem one dimensional. Think the level of acting seen in Act of Valor (2012). Yes, there are some real military in here similarly, yet the actual paid actors are nothing special. That being said I think Eastwood was a very good choice for directing in this film. In order to truly honor the life of Chris Kyle the direction of the picture can't be politically motivated. There are many directors in Hollywood who would have loaded it too message heavy. This film does exactly what it sets out to do and highlights the life of the man and his family. Out of respect for the family I feel a lot was left out about the end of his life. It's very hard to fight back tears at the end of this movie.The real magic in this film is the performance given by Bradley Cooper. Cooper has been signed on to do this film since before Kyle's untimely death in 2012. Cooper briefly spoke with Kyle and met his family to get a feel for the role. Cooper is much smaller in comparison, so he put on nearly 40lbs to play the role. Along with the change in appearance his mannerisms and Texas accent are down to the proper detail. There are moments in the movie where you forget it's the A list actor Bradley Cooper. This is a career defining role that transcends the movie itself. With a dip of Copenhagen in his mouth, hat on backwards and Punisher emblem emblazoned on his armor, there is almost a superhero like quality to it all. And why not, here is a real life man who was the best at what he did, and he did it all for truth, justice and the American way. Like Batman or Superman Cooper's portrayal of Kyle is larger than life. I have no doubt the Academy will take notice of this performance.If you liked this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
First half is a recruitment video but second half feels more real.,"Based on the IMDb ratings and reviews I was expecting more and came away a bit disappointed. The first half felt a little bit like army propaganda at times. This left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth and probably ruined the more realistic second half when they started to deal with the negative effects of war.Cooper did a really good job. He deserves props or his portrayal. However, I think this movie could have been much better if they didn't have to get sign off from the family and the army requiring them to portray the main character in a certain way. Also the ending just sucks and no way around that one.To summarize, it was OK but not at all Oscar worthy imho.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average war movie.,"I really like Clint Eastwood movies and Mystic River is among my favorite ones.American Sniper is the story of an American sniper in Middle East war over several years.

What I really do not get is the patriotic ending, with real footage of his funeral parade.Why the sniper is considered a hero (ok he saved other soldier's lives) if he killed so many people?If you want to see a movie about war (not war movies) I suggest:Full Metal Jacket - The Thin Red Line",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top-Notch Directing and a Marvelous Lead Performance,"American Sniper (2014)**** (out of 4)Thrilling, tense and dramatic telling of Chris Kyle's (Bradley Cooper) rise from a cowboy without much direction in his life to becoming the deadliest sniper in U.S. history.Director Clint Eastwood has made countless great movies in his career and even tackled the war drama in brilliant fashion with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. This film here could have been clichéd in so many ways but thankfully a director with such masterful direction can take a familiar story like war and its impact on someone and make it feel fresh, tight and original. Since movies began, the war genre has been one of the most popular and they continue to pump them out yearly so trying to find a fresh way to tell a story is always a challenge but Eastwood and company really pull it off.American SNIPER is certainly about the war but it's main focus is telling the story of this American hero. The main goal of the screenplay is to show people what a special person Kyle was and balancing his personal drama and the war stuff was so wonderfully done that both story lines contained some real drama and one wasn't overshadowed by the other. I think that's the most accomplished thing Eastwood does here. Making sure that the war at home is just as intense as the war in Iraq. Another major plus is that, on a technical level, the film is flawless as it contains some of the year's best cinematography, a touching music score and some of the best sound effects out there.The wartime scenes are all shot extremely well and I think the best thing about them is the feeling the director shows in the fact that these men are really in a trap not knowing where the next bullet is going to come from. The scenes of Kyle doing his job were full of tension as were the scenes where we get more gunfire. There's a sequence early on, highlighted in the trailer, were a kid possibly has a bomb and this here is perfectly handled. The ending is also incredibly intense and the terrific editing here really helps build up the tension of the combat zone.What really pushes the movie from the opening scene to the very last is the terrific performance by Cooper who turns in his greatest work to date. I'm not sure how many people could have predicted that Cooper, who was mostly playing comedy roles, would turn into such a fine dramatic actor but he's turning into one of the most dependable actors out there. He's simply wonderful here and manages to really come across as a tortured person. The film shows Kyle from various points in his life. His wild younger days. His rise through the Seals. Of course, some of the most talked about scenes deal with the depression and anxiety that starts to set in. We've seen many actors deal with the ""struggling vet returning home"" and Cooper manages to bring a real depth to the character.American SNIPER isn't going to end up being the best movie on 2014 but it's certainly a very impressive film. Technically it's quite sound and Eastwood once again proves why he's one of the greatest director's out there. As for Cooper's performance, it's certainly a terrific one and overall this is a great film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about and be thankful for.",,Anonymous,Biography
An Engrossing Film! Cooper is Excellent!,"Based on Chris Kyle's autobiography American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History, 'American Sniper' Directed by the Legendary Clint Eastwood, is an engrossing biopic, about a true hero. Its a film about courage, love & patriotism. And Bradley Cooper shines as Kyle, giving an excellent performance overall.'American Sniper' Synopsis: Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.'American Sniper' is bold & disturbing, the horrific violence which happened in real life, is equally off-putting on screen. The excessive bloodshed/gore makes you feel repulsed. But, that's the reality it depicts, and hence this biopic works. Even the sequences involving with Kyle & family back home, offer moments of genuine warmth & subtle sadness.Kyle was a man of pure charisma & bravery, A true patriot, who fought & served for his country. And his sudden untimely death, by a veteran he was trying to help, is nothing but a massive shame. But as they say, the mighty shall fall & that's exactly what happened with the late/great Kyle.Jason Hall's Adapted Screenplay is honest & affecting. Eastwood's Direction is good. He has captured the intense war sequences, as well as the sequences back home, with conviction. Cinematography by Tom Stern & Editing by Joel Cox & Gary D. Roach, are passable. War Sequences are impressively executed.Performance-Wise: Cooper has emerged into a versatile actor & 'American Sniper' proves it. As Kyle, Cooper sinks his teeth into the part & delivers a measured performance. Sienna Miller as Taya Renae Kyle, his wife, is wonderful. Her emotional breakdowns appear real.On the whole, 'American Sniper' isn't for the faint-hearted, but this is a tale worth watching, for those who can absorb violence. And for Kyle, Rest In Peace.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Review - American Sniper,"Overall, a great movies, it takes a lot of time to explain not only the war but the relationship between the members of the same family and the friendship that are related during wars.In this movie, Eastwood wanted us to feel like every soldier as and identity, this why he didn't only filmed only war sequences, there is a lot of people who died or are injured in this movie, it shows that those who dead should be remembered, they weren't only soldiers, sometimes they were husband or fathers.For the family, it is always a tragic moment to lose someone no matter the danger that they have gone through during war.Often now, Eastwood makes movie about real heroes who weren't recognized for their services soon enough. I think that it is a noble idea overall.The only place where this movie is losing points, is that I feel that a certain part of the movie was more concentrated on killing a particular sniper of the enemy, The movie goes a little bit far by making a useless emphases on that aspect of the story.I recommend this movie, it shows us that Clint Eastwood still make good movies, this one was even nominated for an Oscar.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bradley Copper does a decent enough job , as does Sienna Miller and it does entertain if you can see through the stars and stripes.

Real,"We saw an Advanced Screening of American Sniper last week, and it was awesome. This movie was directed by Clint Eastwood and you can see his hand in it. It's not flashy, and it tells the story without adding to it like Hollywood tends to do with all war movies, especially ones about the recent wars our men have served in. You feel like you know at least a portion of what a sniper and his Seal team went through while serving in the Iraq War. But, most importantly, it also tells the story of an Extraordinary Man, a true American Hero, who devoted much of his life to his country, taking multiple tours to keep ""his men"" safe, and to protect his country. What an extraordinary movie. I can't say enough about it. Everyone should see this movie. See what this man did for our country. I would also recommend staying through the credits. All the film shown during the ending credits is from actual newsreels. An excellent movie. I wholly recommend it.Unlike other Hollywood takes on our soldiers, and the war in Iraq, this movie just tells the story. No fluff, no hidden agendas, it just tells the story of who this man was and how much he did for our country. You can tell this movie was based off a book by someone who actually had fought and lived this life. It's very real, and thankfully the book wasn't ruined, like so many are, by embellishments.It doesn't have the flashy coolness that studios tend to do when portraying our Navy Seals.It's cool to see that, but then you almost feel like what you are seeing is not real, inaccurate, just a Hollywood version of what our Seals do. Then the other extreme is the hidden anti-war agenda that is always being pushed. This movie just tells the story and after seeing it you feel like you know what it was like to be a Seal in Iraq. What clearing door to door for insurgents is like and what snipers do for not only their units, but for our country as well. How important they are in our fight against those who hate freedom. This story also shows what sacrifices spouses make in order for their men to be away fighting for their country. It also to me shows the best example of the hyper awareness that occurs and can't help bought be brought home when you have to be on guard constantly when deployed in a hot zone.I honestly went into this movie thinking there was no way Bradley Cooper could portray Chris Kyle, but was totally wrong in my assumptions. He didn't just portray this larger than life hero, he becomes him. Truly amazing piece of work.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, competent but somewhat thin in storytelling","I've often been in a group situation where I have felt smug and confident in my film opinion, an opinion that has fallen short of matching up with the group consensus. I don't mind to say why I think the Transformers movies have been huge disappointments or why another movie was not in ""too slow"" but rather it was moody and atmospheric. However, after watching American Sniper I was sheepish to admit that I had felt more than just a bit restless and bored in the theater. I felt a little bit like I just ""didn't get it"" which made me feel bad and I felt a little perhaps unpatriotic in not clapping in admiration when it was over (there was clapping and one guy upon exiting the theater remarked about he was surprised that the applause wasn't more exuberant).I will not pose this review as a conversation on what the message of the movie was or if it did not paint a true picture of Chris Kyle, although those are both rich topics to delve into. Even if this were not based on a true story, if Chris Kyle had been a fictional character, I do not feel the film did enough to investigate him. There was the scene that from his childhood where his father told him that in that family they did not raise sheep or wolves, but rather sheepdogs. This was our evidence that Kyle had a savior complex, but I don't think it was enough. There was the scene, again as a kid, where Kyle's dad praises his son's take down of a deer and that he had a special talent. Again, not enough depth to explain what made Kyle ticked. Instead we have four tours of duty played out in full and monotonous detail. I became more invested when Kyle was between tours and back home, trying to fit into life. If these tours were used more as flashbacks and related more through comparison and contrast into that ""ordinary"" life a better pacing would have been achieved.I read that Steven Spielberg had almost made this move and that he had taken a slightly different approach as an entry point. He would have brought the enemy sniper more into focus. Showing that the two snipers were two sides of the same coin and that perhaps war isn't about good and evil or if it is, it is from the vantage of where you stand. Maybe this would have been too similar to Enemy at the Gates, I'm not sure. I do think it would have made the movie more interesting for me at least.I do know several people that liked this movie. People that are reasonable and intelligent and who hold opinions that I would usually consider. For me, even with a worthy performance from Bradley Copper, the movie was too one dimensional and for that I would not be fast in recommending it.Blarv Score: 5.8 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gritty and Gripping,"Chris Kyle was the most lethal sniper in the U.S. military history. He apparently killed more than 250 Iraqui insurgents, though the Pentagon only credited him around 160, which nevertheless made him a legend of the U.S. Army. I started to read the book last year but stopped doing it since I first heard about the project. Eastwood and Cooper on board, that is promising. And of course they both deliver, and ""American Sniper"" is dense and blunt, quite like a shot.Cooper plays Chris Kyle, the ultimate ""American"": religious, patriot and uncompromising in his convictions. He is a noble and honest man regarding every aspect of his life, and that is something to respect. Cooper already played a soldier in ""The A-Team"" remake (Joe Carnahan, 2010), and it seems that he showed great abilities in the military stunts, and showed interest in the work of the army. He bulked up 20 kg and went through a really tough training, including Navy SEAL sniper sessions. Sienna Miller plays his wife Taya, who suffered the effects of war on his husband, despite his strong belief and determination. Her unconditional love was a massive support for Kyle.Eastwood has made an intense and heartfelt film, one of his trademarks, absent shows and unnecessary politics or philosophy. This is obviously the classic ""American"" patriotic film, but it differs from others in the approach of the man, who is an instrument to a purpose, yet a human being totally aware of what he does.Bottom line, this film is almost perfect in many aspects, and the only thing that does not hook me is how much it reminds me to ""The Hurt Locker"" (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008). That was way more focused on the adrenaline addiction the main character had, but the behavior of both characters after tours seemed to me pretty alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"At face value, not a bad movie, but the dishonesty leaves a sour taste.","The movie itself is not bad, but when supposedly based on reality, the dishonesty leaves quite the sour taste. For example, in the movie, a clip of 9/11 is played to justify the war, but 9/11 had nothing to do with Iraq. Secondly, our sniper gets himself into a pickle when he is falsly accused of having shot someone only carrying the Koran, and not a weapon. I found this scene particuarly odd as Chris Kyle supposedly wanted to kill anyone with a Koran -- even if he says he didn't.The movie just shows a very heroic depiction, someone who only did what was necesary to save himself and his men, where as in the book, Chris wrote that he relished in killing and had a blast doing it: ""I only wish I had killed more,"" ""I loved what I did...it was fun. I had the time of my life.""",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie and story of the Post-911 World,"American Sniper is not pro-war nor anti-war. It's just war movie.It's not a flag-waving patriotic movie, but it does feature characters who display patriotism.It does not re-litigate the Iraq War or the handling of the Iraq War. But the effects and the doubts are there on the peripheral.Now that we have that out of the way, lets talk about the movie. It has a perfect blend of war scenes, humor, and romance. It is not a 'guys movie' anymore than ""Frozen"" is a kids movie.It is an intense, suspenseful movie that does not overwhelm you with busy war scenes. It is intense movie in the same vein of The Hurt Locker.This story defines our time. Not just the 'snipping', but the effects of war on families and our veterans.

Born in the USA,"Now that the Oscar nominations have been let loose on the world, it is time for me to catch up on all the films that I haven't seen which have been nominated for 'Best Picture'. Beginning my journey, albeit a very small one with only three films needing to be watched, is American Sniper, the new movie directed by The Man With No Name, starring Bradley Cooper, last heard as a gun-toting raccoon in last years' wonderful Guardians of the Galaxy. Shall we begin?American Sniper focuses on the life of Chris Kyle, the ""deadliest marksman in US military history"", who during his time as a Navy Seal, racked up 255 kills. 160 of which were confirmed, whilst attempting to highlight the effects war can have on soldiers, both in a wartime environment and a 'normal' one. The word, ""attempting"", is probably the key fulcrum on which this review is based as the movie fails to paint a picture of how horrific war actually is, and instead, relies too many times on scenes that go full-on Call of Duty, with Black Hawk Down being the obvious inspiration, which in my mind, is something I have seen too many times before.In terms of the good, Bradley Cooper does a solid job portraying Kyle, whilst Sienna Miller, who subsequently has seemingly reappeared out of nowhere in American Sniper and Foxcatcher, does an equally as good job playing the role of the estranged wife who is caught between Kyle's love for her and his love for war. Aside from the two Kyles, the rest of the film is seemingly enriched with 2-D characters who come and go in relatively forgettable fashion, whilst the contrast between Kyle and the enemy sniper is rather poorly done and should have had more depth in order for me to actually care for the twisted relationship between the two. The word ""depth"", in general, springs to mind, as their simply wasn't enough in this film to justify its' two hour plus run-time, and it seemed to drag on and not really grip me like I wished it would.Overall, American Sniper, is a solid, yet unspectacular, flag-waving war film that attempts to show the true horrors and effects of war yet only succeeds in falling flat on its' face. Although it has been nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the forthcoming Oscars, it is probably the weakest of all the films in that category and in my opinion, should easily be replaced by Foxcatcher.Overall Score: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Keep Both Eyes Open,"Bradley Cooper is simply one of the elite actors working today. He has now been nominated for 3 acting Oscars. It's debatable whether or not he was better than other actors this year, I will judge that once I have seen all the films, but he is definitely Oscar worthy in American Sniper. But he's not the only great thing about this film. Clint Eastwood does a great job directing and the editing and special effects are top notch. It's one of the most intense films I have seen this year and so I have no problem with some of the nominations this movie received.It's really just an incredible story. At times the film can be heartbreaking. Almost half of my theater walked out weeping. I didn't cry, but man was this a tough one to watch. The fact that all of this (presumably) actually happened just makes it that much more difficult. One of the key scenes from the trailer begins the film and it sets the tone for just how intense it will be. Eastwood didn't really hold back on the brutality of killing over a hundred people, and the aftermath of what it does to a person. I initially thought the back and forth between the tours and his family life would take away from the experience but it really didn't. Sienna Miller did a very good job of giving us that emotion without overdoing it.Bradley Cooper bulked up and also brought the emotional gravitas it takes to lead this type of film. Chris Kyle gets literally lost in fighting this war that he doesn't realize how much this is negatively impacting his family and Cooper perfectly portrayed that. I also don't know if I have seen PTSD better displayed than it was here. Of course I wouldn't actually know how that feels but I do know that the subtly with which Cooper portrayed it was very effective. They also didn't make this person out to be too much of a hero. I appreciate that they didn't take killing this many people lightly.I also agree with the way Eastwood decided to end the film. Without spoilers I don't think there's any other way you could have served the film and it's real life characters better. American Sniper is a difficult film to watch, but it's one of the better ones this year.+Cooper's multidimensional performance+Story structure+Eastwood's directing+Doesn't hold back with the top notch editing8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A solid story based on true events and characters,"Due to the U.S. participation in Iraq and Afghanistan and related topics and issues, the two last decades have seen dozens of movies dealing with them - similarly to the decades after the war in Vietnam. Not many of them are good, focusing mostly on shootings and explosions, but American Sniper can be regarded as one of the best in its field.This is thanks to the director Clint Eastwood, and the star Bradley Cooper, above all. Acts of war and human approach are nicely in balance, everything seems realistic, the main character is no dumb killing machine without any feelings, war is not ""fun"", etc., often lacking in movies alike. True, the movie is practically focused on Cooper's character Chris Kyle, there are no comparable performances, but I could hardly find glorification/justification of the U.S. military involvement in the movie in question - wars are initiated by political and/or economic interests, the military is supposed to obey the orders coming from government departments. And there is no place for reasoning during battles - either you kill, or you / your fellows get killed.All in all, a serious and solid movie. I liked it more than e.g. The Hurt Locker or Zero Dark Thirty.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

8/10,"As always when talking about movies based on events regarding terrorism or war, you have to approach all of the content with delicacy and open mind. I have always done that for this types of movies and have yet to be truly disappointed both on the artistic and the informative style, I'm speaking of course about the recent ""Lone Survivor"" but more importantly of the masterpiece that is ""Zero Dark Thirty"". None of these have approached the material with a closed mind or with a America-f**k-yeah attitude (even if Lone Survivor did a little bit of that). So does ""American Sniper"" succeed in following the ordeal of these films? The answer is a plain yes. Of course we are talking about three very different films story and content wise, but the core of the historical themes remain.On the artistic side the film is very well done, it certainly and openly borrows a page from ""Black Hawk Down"" and even though it doesn't exactly reach those heights it certainly goes very near. Sometimes you can't really understand what's going on and who is shooting who, but for the very major part the action is riveting, gritty and you feel thrown into it. The emotional core of the movie is solid and thanks to the best performance Bradley Cooper has given yet we feel every sentiment his character goes through. It is very touching in multiple moments and overall an experience that should be had on the theater.Unfortunately the movie does have some problems. It doesn't answer, or even ask many questions and doesn't deepen any arguments about the war. The only themes which are treated are about patriotism and veteran stress, and whilst hands down it does a f***ing stunning job at portraying these aspects of the war and making me emphasize and understand as I had never done before, the movie is simply not an interesting look at the Iraq War. It is an interesting look at a fascinating character, in the mist of this war that could have opened up so many more opportunities for provocative filmaking. Plus it has very tyring end credits, that kind of ruined the nature of the movie. Whilst the film is trying to convey patriotism in a very human way that had me very attentive, the credits just blow it up to one thousand and took away a lot of the emotion of before.Anyways, I don't want to seem I'm putting out there a too controversial statement, I liked the movie a lot and took away a lot from it, it is a great portrayal of a complex real life character, I just wanted another Zero Dark Thirty going into it and most certainly and unfortunately didn't get it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Heavy, real, raw. A story told with a snipers precision","Chris Kyle's story has been told and did not miss a beat.Bradley Cooper becomes the man. There is no one else that could have portrayed Kyle like Cooper did. He should receive the Oscar for best actor, hands down, for this. From the beginning to end he captures every moment of Kyle's story, which inevitably jumps off the screen and into the viewers soul.The supporting cast is simply perfect.This is not a feel good movie, it is a portrait of one man's life and those that surrounded him. These consisted of his brothers in arms, his family, those that he fought and those that he killed. For him there is no glory in the tag 'America's greatest sniper.' His job was simple to save the lives of those he could. He did this with honor, courage and he did this better than most humans could.Kyle is a true hero, this movie depicts this, not through slow motion, juiced up violence but a deep and dark production of a brutal reality.My heart goes out to his family and true friends. This man delivered and overcame so much and his love and courage will echo on well into the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper - propaganda or not?,"There seems to be an unwarranted amount of controversy surrounding Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, American Sniper. Many left-wing celebrities, feminists, and other liberals are crying ""propaganda!"" All art forms have the possibility to serve a political or religious agenda and many are meant to do so. From anti-war protest songs to Michael Moore documentaries to religious texts. I guess it's easy to forget that the main goal of art is to entertain. Two things about me: 1. When it comes to most political topics, I consider myself a liberal, 2. I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan. I am also, for the most part, anti-war. Most films about war can be considered anti-war films, but there are a few pro-war films. Those films might be considered propaganda, but at the same time might be considered enjoyable and even great works of art. Three movies off the top of my head that take a seemingly pro-war stance: Sergeant York, 300, and the latest installment in the Rambo franchise. The best of those, Sergeant York, is the one most blatantly a propaganda film. Yet, I still enjoy the film. So I believe that when you watch a movie, especially by a master such as Clint Eastwood, you should put your political beliefs aside as well as the political beliefs of the artist(s). It's perfectly possible to love the works of Ted Nugent and Sean Penn at the same time.I've never read Chris Kyle's book. I don't know how closely Eastwood's film followed the book and I don't know how honest and true the book was. For all I know Chris Kyle was a great and kind man or Chris Kyle was a complete and total douche bag. Maybe he's a xenophobic, jingoistic, warmongering asshole. Maybe Clint Eastwood is one of those too. I don't know, and frankly I don't care because it is completely irrelevant to the point of this review or the point of American Sniper.As I watched it, I was unable to put aside all the politics and pro-war sentiment stuff because I was searching for it. As it turns out, I was searching in vain. I could find no war mongering. I could only find a little of the flag-waving pseudo-Patriotism. The fact is, I found plenty of anti-war sentiment. It did not show me, in any way, that this war Chris Kyle and the others were fighting was just. It did, however, show the ""War is Hell"" theme common in almost all war movies, whatever their political leanings. Many of the negative reviews point out how all the Iraqis were called ""savages."" Yet, Clint Eastwood was not trying to say that all Iraqis are savages any more than Quentin Tarantino tries to say that all black people are n*ggers in Django Unchained. The characters in the movie use the word savages. I would guess that this is authentic language and an accurate portrayal of the folks fighting over there. I just can't find any basis for these negative reviews, that seem to judge the politics of Kyle and Eastwood more than they judge the film. Let's not forget that Eastwood directed Letters from Iwo Jima, a highly anti-war picture.American Sniper is a solid film. Bradley Cooper gives a strong performance and Clint gives us another competently directed film. I did expect to see a little bit more snipering, as it were. There was some in the beginning and then not anymore until the climactic scene. Chris Kyle kept going back to war partially because he felt like he had unfinished business, and mostly because he couldn't cope with his regular life in the states anymore. This shows the negative psychological impact that war has on folks and how, much like someone who has been released from prison after years, they are unable to adapt to normal life. Kyle's inability to cope is similar to the main character in The Hurt Locker (a movie that was not branded as propagandist garbage or given bad reviews). This difficulty to conform to stateside life after being in war is further studied in films like The Best Years of Our Lives.At first, when I saw Chris Kyle and his wife watching the tragic events of September 11th on TV, I sort of rolled my eyes and felt like that could have been left out. Looking back, I don't think it was used as a propaganda device, but rather shown as a motivational device to Mr. Kyle or just shown as an important event in their lives, as it was in all American lives. So is American Sniper patriotic? To be sure. Is it sentimental? At times it is, but great art often is sentimental (see Norman Rockwell or Charles Dickens) because it invokes those warm fuzzy emotions in all of us. I actually think that American Sniper was able to accomplish something remarkable, and that is it was able to tackle the subject of the second Iraq war without judging it either way, good or bad, just or unjust.Bottom line, American Sniper is a good film, but it's not a great film. It can't touch Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales or Million Dollar Baby. I came into it curious about it's politics, but not obsessing over them. It was entertaining, and that is the first and most important thing one should consider when reviewing a film. Then you think about how it made you feel and then you think of how it looked and sounded and how well the performers performed and maybe lastly you can think about it's politics.American Sniper is not as good as Sergeant York. It's not as good as Letters from Iwo Jima. It's not as good as The Best Years of Our Lives. American Sniper is as good as American Sniper and that's good enough for me. 7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best war movie in years,"I had high hopes for this movie and was not disappointed, Bradley Cooper delivers what I think is his best performance thus far. It kicks you in the face and takes you along for the ride. I also commend the attention to detail in every aspect of this film, you could almost taste the Iraqi dust in your mouth. The story follows an American soldier from his home in Texas to the battlefields in Iraq, true camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long time. The portrayal of ""p.t.s.d."" and how it affects our soldiers was heartfelt and real. If you haven't seen a good war movie since ""Saving Pvt. Private Ryan"", this one's for you.

The story of one man's sacrifice for his country.,"1st off this movie is NOT a commentary on the War in Iraq or the debate over the merits of that war. This movie is the story of one soldier, Chris Kyle, who became a sniper for the Navy Seals and went to fight in the war in Iraq.The film captures the thinking and motivations that inspired many to join the U.S. military in the late 90s and early 2000s. It captures the sacrifices made by those who risk everything for their country, and their families sacrifices as well.It also show's what the soldiers have to go through when they leave the battle field and return home to a normal life. What they go through with their families, and trying to cope with living a normal life.The cinematography was excellent. The writing was well done in building suspense and revealing the battle story lines. The acting was good overall, with Bradley Coopers performance being Oscar worthy.If you're open minded and want to see a great movie that portrays a small part of the War in Iraq from one mans point of view, then you should see American Sniper. Is it the greatest movie of all time? No. But its one of the best war films to come along since Saving Private Ryan.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epitaph of Great American Hero is Eastwood's Best Film,"Few times does a movie remain entertainment yet tell a deep truth, American Sniper manages just that. If one wanted a recent definition of a American Patriot hero it's effectively brought to life by the masterful direction of Clint Eastwood. This movie will be his crowning achievement in a much celebrated career. Such a feat could not be accomplished with just any story however. The life of Chris Kyle, and what he stood for, makes a perfect synergy.Bradley Cooper's amazingly real depiction of a ""complicated, yet simple Texas cowboy"" breathes life into a story surrounded by the darkness of war. It single-handedly makes that phrase ""The Greatest Generation"" as one that didn't end after WWII. It wouldn't be a stretch to say Coopers got a lock on best actor after seeing the film.American Sniper is rare in that it feels brutality honest yet palatable. While folks such as me led a very normal life stateside men just like Chris Kyle were laying everything on the line for the very belief of good we were enjoying. One can't help but feel humbled by what these men accomplished. War is the worst of humanity without doubt, but within war the best of America often rises above both evil and politics. Chris Kyle was assuredly one of the finest examples in all of American history of such and American Sniper is a fine testament of which we all can be proud. See this movie for any number of reasons, but take away the best we as Americans stand for.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Combat Film or Domestic Drama? Please Pick One, Mr. Eastwood","People are seeing what they want to see in ""American Sniper"" without paying a lot of attention to what Clint Eastwood is actually saying.There's been a liberal firestorm leveled at the film for its pro- military, pro-killer attitudes, to which I say: Have these people actually seen the movie?I identify as liberal myself and have aimed more than my fair share of criticism at our military and the things it's used for. But anyone who thinks ""American Sniper's"" final message is pro-military is unfairly biased and isn't watching the film with an open mind. In Bradley Cooper's character, the film portrays the kinds of guys I think the military is probably full of -- guys who join up for noble ideals, are genuinely proud of America and their role in protecting it, think that's what they'll get a chance to do once they're in the military, and then are asked to do things that they can't mentally and emotionally handle. The film doesn't make a villain out of Cooper for being such a good and deadly sniper, which people seem to take exception to, thinking wrongly that if the film doesn't turn him into a villain, then it must intend him to be a hero. But I think the movie just feels bad for Cooper more than anything. He's just a decent guy who has a job and does it well, but the job he's asked to do is horrifying and something the average American can't even comprehend.As for the movie itself, I didn't like it very much, but not for the reasons everyone else seems to have for disliking it. I felt that Eastwood wasn't sure whether he wanted to make a domestic drama or a straight-up combat film. Combat mostly wins out, with the domestic part, which should have been most interesting, feeling like a somewhat obligatory add-on, full of clichés and standard melodrama. Sienna Miller, as Cooper's wife, is a fine actress, but she's stuck with a thankless and boring role. Cooper is very good, but the movie's emphasis on combat over character development limits how effective he, or anyone else given the same role, could be.Mostly, I came out of ""American Sniper"" thinking: ""That was no 'Hurt Locker'.""Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Entertaining, watch with caution","First of all, the problem with this film is not the acting or directing. both of those roles are done competently. It contains great action scenes, some suspense and is overall a classic American inspirational movie. The problem lies on the seemingly uncamouflaged attempt to sell America. words and phrases like ""patriot"" and ""the greatest country in the world"" are thrown around constantly in order to inspire an audience with the same ideas and show America as the ""good guy"". It just seems as if they were trying TOO hard to make this a propaganda movie.However, if you're smart enough to detect the movie's propagandistic nature and do not fall for the ""America is N#1"" speech, you will probably find yourself enjoying a well- made war movie retelling the true story of a man capable of amazing feats, and a ""hero"" for some, Chris Kyle.Bradley Cooper does a GREAT job at transmitting his characters complex psychological issues, and Clint Eastwood's directing is still a seal of quality. Don't get brainwashed into joining the US Army JUST because of this movie and you will be glad you watched it.Im still not convinced about this movie being ""Best Picture"" material, and mainly after watching the other nominees, i have no doubt that this movie does not deserve to win, at least not in that category. As any other good action movie, I believe its main goal is to entertain, and that it does. Inspirational",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not too bad but, not good at all even tried to watch the 2nd time","Update 3/17/19 after the 2nd time viewing:Would still maintain my early review when the movie was released. I've also found the directing, the screenplay and editing still sucked big time! How the sniper would like to have a blabber to be his spotter? A spotter is the extra eyes for the sniper to help him spot some target he may or may not find quickly or soon enough. The spotter should be as alert and focused as the sniper in the combat zone as well as the killing zone. Yet this sniper's spotter couldn't keep his mouth shut, he didn't pay any attention to where the sniper focus, he just laid on his back and kept blabbing, running his mouth off.Then, a sniper when working under the blazing sun, all things around him were so bright, yet this sniper didn't use his cap to cast a shade for his eyes, but wore his baseball hat reversed. The sniper when positioned himself under the blazing sun, he at least should put some black tar paint under his both eyes, just like the football players, to reduce the flare of the sunlight reflecting up into his eyes. Yet this sniper neither used his baseball hat's visor used for blocking sunlight from the eyes, nor applied black tar paint under his eyes. With the excruciating Middle East sunlight, he might lose his eyesights pretty soon. Yet he just did the shootings like nothing happened. What a joke!Then just during the nanosecond before the shooting, the camera ridiculously shifted back to his boyhood, shooting deer, sitting in the church, stealing a mini-bible, helped his kid brother beating up the bully at school.....on and on, the craps simply couldn't stop. Why, because if just tried to tell this sniper's military killing records, there might not enough footage for this lame movie, so lot of unnecessary craps had to kept adding up to prolong the movie time.
If you want to know why people always cursed by saying: ""A loaded crap!"" Just watch this movie, and you'd understand immediately.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I got a very mixed feeling when watching this film. i got an impression that the screenplay is kinda a patchwork, the playwright did not quite really understand the life story of this sniper, and there's not too much to tell, so the guys who wrote the script had to use lot of flashbacks and to fill up the empty spaces. the whole movie didn't give the audiences a present, an uptodate current feeling, but just a poorly assembled tidbits of this sniper, his simplified boyhood, his cowboy period, his finding about the first girlfriend cheating on him, and in between the trainings after he joined the navy seal, meeting the love of his life in a bar, then became serious and then married her.There's nothing well-developed almost on anything about this guy's back-then storyline, just some superfluous jumping-around meaningless dots. i also noticed that navy seal's sniper training a bit shallow, those guys lied on their bellies, recoiled and moved their bodies by every shot, and that's not good to show a really good sniper would reacted during and after every shot.The other thing i like to point out is the formulaic and popular sound track, the loud and huge vibrating sound during his sniping mission. those loud ooooommmm sounds were also became so popular in movies such as 'gravity', 'preditor', 'alien', 'intersteller', 'star wars', but using it in this film only sounded more inappropriate and ridiculous, since when a sniper doing his jobs, his mind would be totally zoned out of any sound and noise around him, if those loud booming sound were used to describe his on-site mind condition, he wouldn't be possible to shoot a target, yet this loud out-space sound would appear in every scene of his shooting, and it's stupid. a sniper used a satellite phone talking to his wife during the mission? a sniper never stopped involving small talks or joking around with his team mates during the missions? the American soldiers always shooting blindly to all general directions where the sniper already long gone, these American soldiers were only showed their arrongance, poor training, naievity all the time. those stupid yada yada annoying dialog, unnecessary wedding, funeral and hospital visiting at the nursery, the v.a. hospital, the arguments in bed with his wife....all and all, just formulaic unnecessary scenes that usually dominated in mediocre movies. Mr. Eastwood just did a mediocre directing job in this mediocre film, a poorly patch-up shallow work that didn't bring me deeply enough to be moved and only turned me into a bystander. the more i watched it, the less star i would give to this film.",,Anonymous,Biography

one of the best war+melodrama movies ever... best of Eastwood in a decade.,"American Sniper is based on an autobiography by Chris Kyle, written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. It's the story of the life and times of Kyle, who had four tours in Iraq, totaling circa 1,000 days, resulting in more than 160 kills credited to him as a sniper. The film is about his experiences and the costs - emotional and psychological - they had on him. It's about how punishing the American Dream can be. The idea to make the film with these themes was brought to Eastwood by an actor to whom this was a personal project about which he was passionate. This deliberate humanizing of the soldier at the center of the story into a tenderhearted family man is what sets American Sniper apart from other recent war flicks like Lone Survivor and The Hurt Locker. Consequently, we really care whether this patriot will ultimately return home safe and sound. Directing= 10/10 Acting= 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Writing: 9/10 Sound:10/10 Editing: 10/10 ..........................................

A Compulsion to Serve,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"". Shakespeare wrote those words for Henry IV, but director Clint Eastwood's latest film depicts the sentiment for Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL sharpshooter known as ""Legend"". Screenwriter Jason Hall adapted the story from Kyle's memoir (co-written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice).You may not be aware of the sniper's role during a war. In an early scene (used in the trailer) we experience the incredibly stressful moment of decision that Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) faces as a mother and young child enter the street  are they a threat to the platoon or not? The decision means killing a woman and child or risking the death of many U.S. soldiers. If he is wrong, he faces a jury and military shame. Most of us lack the capacity for such decision-making. As a flashback to Kyle's childhood shows, most of us are either sheep or wolves. Only a very few are sheepdogs with the aggressiveness to protect the flock. Chris Kyle: sheepdog.The story takes us through Chris' aimless young adult years on the cowboy circuit. He's a tough guy who likes to drink and party with his friends. September 11 acts as a call to action, a call to service. SEAL training is shown and the point is made that Chris is the old man in the group, but he displays a quiet leadership trait. We then witness his flirting with a snippy Taya (Sienna Miller) at a bar counter as his SEAL buddies throw darts at each other's bare backs (don't try that at home, kids). Soon enough Chris and Taya are married, and Chris is called to the front.Back and forth we go through Chris Kyle's four tours. His expertise in war is offset by his inability to adjust to family life. He has a compulsion to serve and to protect his fellow soldiers, but he is unable to fit into the suburban life of cell phones and grilled hamburgers. Not surprisingly, Taya struggles with his struggles. Bradley Cooper gets to be the legend, while Sienna Miller is the emotional mother who has seemingly lost her husband – not to death, but to an obsession to serve.The film does little to explain why Chris Kyle is exponentially more productive than other snipers, and even less to explore his PTSD and mental anguish outside of the front. It's Bradley Cooper's acting that provides us what insight we do get, and he does a remarkable job capturing the hulking, uncommunicative giant who doesn't really understand the ""legend"" title  he's just doing his job and following his nature.The tragic end is handled with grace by Eastwood, and it left my full-capacity movie theatre as quiet as a church during prayer. It's possible to be a legend, but not a hero, and the movie makes no political statements regarding war or foreign policy. What it does show is that most of us are not sheepdogs.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
clint is in top form at 84,"Clint Eastwood has done an on point masterpiece of art, creativity, bravery and truth. The movie is factual and simply indicates that 9-11 started a war and that, that war hasn't ended. This is the story of one man who was incensed at the Islamic attacks on his country and wanted to go and hunt down Islamic terrorists and stop the perpetrators of needless self righteous violence. Attacks nearly as horrible as 9-11 have been perpetrated till this day all over the world. The entire world is at war with Islamic extremists motivated by the Koran that fuels attacks and war with its over 100 violent verses that command the slaughter of all that believe otherwise. American sniper is not for anyone who hates America,is delusional about war never being necessary, or that is going to defend a religion that initiates killing. Every single actor was top notch, well chosen and the screenplay was magnificent, worthy of the sacrifice of the main character and it is a story Clint felt was important to tell; ESPECIALLY at this time in the history of the world. A message that needed to get out. This is not a divisive movie, it rather sheds light on a divisive brutal heartless enemy that already has promoted violence and division all over the world and American Sniper shows how peace can to attained, through courage and strength and only.... through courage sacrifice and strength. Mr. Eastwood used his talents to tell the life story of a man he greatly respected. Too bad for 'controllers', he still has the right to do that in America. Great movie. Truly great movie. We still have a few real Americans left. This movie was vastly inspiring. Everybody walked out of the theatre in Owings mills Md tonight moved to the core and breathless with awe and patriotism. You could feel it in the air and one man got so emotionally involved in the movie that he spoke out several times sporadically during the film. It was in no way annoying and I think everyone in there was as moved as he was. It showed how touched he was. I felt exactly the same. The movie was 'edge of your seat' every single moment, and it was a good flick in addition to being totally relevant.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't pay any attention to the politically motivated reviews,"First of all, this movie tells the story of an idealistic Texas cowboy-turned soldier, wanting to serve his country and protect Americans. Others may disagree with the reality of who Chris Kyle was, but this is the story the movie portrays. The character flaws some are attributing to him are laughably minor and wouldn't have added anything to the film. But it seems if you are pro- America in any sense, and have any character flaws that offend politically correct sensibilities, anything that portrays you positively is disregarded as propagandistic garbage. Regrettably, many are labeling anything that portrays America or American soldiers in a remotely positive light during this conflict, as propaganda, and they're doing it strictly for political reasons.Others claim this film portrays all Iraqis as murderers and ""savages."" I didn't get this image of them at all, even though Chris Kyle does use the term ""savages"" to describe those they are fighting. But it's hard to blame him given the sadistic brutality they inflicted on other Iraqis. He wasn't using the term broadly to describe all people of color in a racist sense, and to claim he was is simply projecting your own bias upon him. Those who helped Americans are portrayed as sympathetic victims of our mutual enemy's brutality. Those who tortured and butchered the Iraqis who helped Americans, are usually shown being shot and battled by American soldiers. This is/was a reality, and I reject the idea that a movie like this should make no moral distinction between our troops and those who mean them harm. What those one-star people seem to be clamoring for is a film depicting Americans as the real villains. Essentially, they were just disappointed it wasn't the propaganda they wanted to see.The morality of war is complicated to be sure, but consciously inserting an anti-war moral message in an attempt to affect people's opinions, is an act of overt propaganda. This film does show the moral conflict Chris Kyle has to reconcile within himself as he often has women and children in his cross-hairs and must decide. There are others in the film who struggle with the validity of the conflict as well. It also depicts the toll war takes on soldiers who are injured physically and mentally, far from the one-sided, propagandistic message many have claimed.That aside, I had problems with the script, directing, and use of CGI to make obviously fake babies look real. You couldn't get a real baby for a nursing scene? You couldn't use real drone footage of Fallujah or something, other than sketchy video game graphics? Chris Kyle's nemesis, is often portrayed as a parkouring, Rambo-like character, tying his bandanna while looking at himself in the mirror. All that is just silly. So the film is not perfect in those respects, and those flaws often take you back out of the story you are trying to immerse yourself in. The quality of the filmmaking is on par with Gran Torino. It's a little clumsy, but a worthy effort.Bradley Cooper does a good job, but is it really Oscar worthy? The bottom line is that the story is compelling and if the events are true, one cannot come away from this film without a deeper respect for Chris Kyle, his family, his service and his sacrifice to save others, as well as for others who serve in the military. Claiming this film is propaganda because you don't like Chris Kyle or disagreed with the Iraq war, doesn't change the reality of the story that this film tells. Was Chris Kyle flawed? Undoubtedly. But good people, like good films, are often flawed.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Greats,"Before I start this review I would first like to thank every man and woman who is currently serving or who has served in the U.S. Military. You are the reason why we even have the freedom to make, watch, and review these films. Thank you for your service!This film was quite possibly one of the greatest military movies in U.S. history. This movie is the story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, and his life off and on the battlefield. It's amazing to see just how strong this man was as he left his family for a life on the battlefield. The screenplay, written by Jason Hall, was one of pure brilliance. From the witty remarks to the expressions of pure suspense, Bradley Cooper brought complete life to the role of Chris, a father, husband, and American hero. The visual effects were stunning and believable and the sounds were loud and crisp. At some moments, it feels like you are actually on the battlefield. The suspense that they built was captivating and it kept me on the edge of my seat.This movie is definitely one of the best war epics I've seen in a long while. When the credits started rolling, all you could hear was the boisterous applause from the audience and then the complete and utter silence of acknowledgement and gratitude. I give it 9/10 stars and wish it tremendous luck in this year's awards season.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Movie - KYLE  IS A HERO!,"Chris Kyle joined the Navy in 1999 because he wanted to protect his country. He had no say in whether or not the US went into Iraq. What were the US troops sent to Iraq supposed to do? Refuse to defend themselves? Refuse to protect each other? In reply to user Qrobur, It's pretty obvious that when Kyle refers to the enemy as 'Savages', he's referring to the insurgents, not Iraqi civilians. In my book, if you kill people by sawing their heads off, setting them on fire, chop the hands off of thieves, plant IED in areas where their Iraqi countrymen can and do accidentally trigger them, stone women to death, trick little kids and mentally disabled into strapping on a suicide vest, use your countrymen and/or children as human shields you ARE A SAVAGE! To everyone bashing Kyle and the movie: Why did you watch it? You had to know what it was about before you watched it! With approx .01% of the US signing up to defend it, those who do are all heroes! I am grateful that they have the guts to. Having to patrol and constantly have on their mind that the next step they take could blow off their legs, or get them shot in the face (as has happened to their friends) is a level of stress that most people will never have to endure. I for one, deeply appreciate their guts, selflessness and sacrifice!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great performance by Bradley Cooper in a very good movie, which unfortunately came out in a year full of Great Films and performances.","To start, this film seems to be over shadowed by the early comparisons to Lone Survivor and with any movie on war people will call it propaganda before in viewing, especially when you're dealing with a controversial figure like Chris Kyle. People can say that this film glorifies America, or that it has strong religious undertones but if a man is religious I don't think it should be cut from the adaption to film. The film itself asks great questions regarding the mental stability of soldiers, and although the questions aren't openly asked you can tell by Bradley Coopers performance that this is a heavily troubled man trying to deal with his demons completely on his own. I don't see the film as glorifying or as propaganda, it simply shows what goes into making these people, the events which started to open their eyes to the path they would eventually take. This film is a lot different than Lone Survivor, which I don't think would stand a chance at an Oscar Nomination no matter how weak the year was. I feel American Sniper could compete and could have won awards had 2014 not proved to be such a strong year for performances and film in general.Just a side note, I went in to the film not a ""fan"" of Chris Kyle purely because I knew of him more as a guest on Opie & Anthony. I also noticed how often he'd crop up on situations like Fox News, so my political views are quite different than his, and I'm also not religious. You shouldn't allow these things to stop you from watching this film, think of it more as another Good Eastwood movie with a really good stand out performance by Bradley Cooper.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Little to engage with,"Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a uncomplicated film about a seemingly uncomplicated man. Bradley Cooper puts in another impressive performance as the tight-lipped, hulking marksman Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, clocking up 160 confirmed kills over four tours of duty in Iraq. Seeing that many people assassinated through the scope of his own rifle must surely have weighted heavily on Kyle's shoulders, only we wouldn't know it as Eastwood offers such little complexity to the man that we learn virtually nothing about him.The film is little more than one action scene after another. The opening scene, which sees Kyle faced with the awful decision of whether to take out a child he believes is holding a grenade and on his way towards a unit of American soldiers, is riveting. From then on, Kyle's scenes are a repetitive montage of enemy or civilian, shoot or don't shoot. When he's on the ground, the action is confusing, and with such slight character dimension offered to Kyle's comrades, the tragedy of their deaths hold little impact. It's also difficult to sympathise with Kyle himself, who is portrayed as little more than an ignorant racist who lives his life by his father's recognition of him being blessed with the gift of aggression.This would all be fine if Eastwood provided any sort of context. If wars need these kind of men in order to be won, then make that the point. If the film is supposed to be an honest look at a remarkably efficient marksman of questionable ethics, then offer us a window into his motivation. Any references to a controversial war, it's legality, and the methods employed during the invasion are completely ignored. Feeling the need to stick to familiar movie tropes, Kyle is faced by a foe, the Iraqi sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik), who did not exist in real life. He is a faceless, near- wordless villain, someone to boo and hiss at. Like all the other enemy soldiers, no motivation, background or personality is provided.There are a few good points. Usually the 'home life' scenes of any war movie grind the narrative to an unwelcome halt, but it's in these moments where we finally get a glimpse at Kyle the real person. His wife, played by a very impressive Sienna Miller, is a rock (but thinly written), and it's through her eyes that we see Kyle's struggles with PTSD. And Cooper is excellent, bringing what little humanity to his character as the script allows and bulking up to an enormous size to do the man he's portraying justice. But ultimately, the film left me feeling hollow. There is no feeling of the passing of time, little to engage with on an emotional level, and Eastwood's personal views on such a hot topic and divisive figure are non-existent.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
American snafu,"As far as I can remember, this is the fifth movie I've seen about the Iraq wars, after 'Three Kings', 'Route Irish', 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Green Zone'. From those five, 'American Sniper' is the most patriotic, the most war-justifying, the most pro-US. But it's also the most shallow and the most one-dimensional.In a way, it has the same set-up as an other classic American war-movie: The Deer Hunter. Blue collar, well-meaning young guys sign up for the army because they think it's a good thing to do. In the war, they get damaged beyond repair. When they return home, it's impossible to pick up their old life.So far for the similarities. Whereas The Deer Hunter delves deep into the psyche of the soldiers, and into the way the war changes their lives, American Sniper stays on the surface of what really happens. The film only offers simple statements and easy explanations. By linking 9/11 to Iraq, the film also deliberately makes an historical error.As a Hollywood blockbuster, 'American Sniper' is entertaining and efficient. But as the historical document director Clint Eastwood probably had in mind, it's disappointing. Not because it's too patriotic, but because it underestimates its audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Try judging Chris Kyle as a drama figure and not as a symbol of American propaganda,"First thing first: i am not a resident of Texas, not even an American citizen and that means that i have no intention to say some inconsiderate statements like ""God bless America"" as a conclusion to my review, but also i would not dare to characterize the movie as a disaster because i don't like USA's foreign policy.After all that let's get to the point. We all know that Eastwood prefers to use characters that are tormented by ethical dilemmas and that's exactly what we see in American Sniper. Chris Kyle is a man who tries to balance between the dictates of his own conscience about what truly means to be a soldier and being a good father and husband. Bradley Cooper has succeeded to present the psychological portrait of a man who tries to survive a war, protect his comrades and also deal with the burden of every death he is responsible for. And that's where the eternal question comes: has anyone the right to take a life if he is saving in this way more lives? If the answer is yes, what are the lines between offensive and defensive behaviour and when a sacred (for him) purpose is becoming crime and murder?These are the purposely unanswered from the director questions that have to put into thought each one of us. And that's the point where the spectators of this film are unfortunately divided into two groups: the first one thinks that the film is an hymn to American patriotism and the second group that blindly reprobates the film because they cannot separate art frοm politics and every member of this group believes that the movie is a vehicle of American propaganda.In my opinion, they are both wrong. The director strongly disapproves the practices of any war but also wants to show to the world how difficult is for a man to live with the war wounds both in his body and his soul.Finally a special reference must be done for Sienna Miller who had an excellent performance as the wife who has to support her husband in his life choices but cannot raise a family by her own and plays the role of the equalizer in Kyle's life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This film was thrilling, but wasted a lot of potential.","American Sniper was an interesting look at the life of sniper Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American history, and his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (P.T.S.D.) or it could have been. The acting was very good, especially from Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle. Unfortunately, all of the other characters in the film were focused on so little that they sort of just fall into the shadow of Chris Kyle. The military shootouts and white-knuckle decisions were masterfully done. It should be noted that there were a couple of scenes involving gruesome scenes with young children that could be very uncomfortable to watch for some people. As hinted at earlier, the scenes at home, where Chris Kyle had to face his inner demons and watch as he and his wife slowly fall apart were very underwhelming and often ended way too quickly without answering or addressing anything other than pointing out that there is a problem over and over again. The resolution of this film was WAY to fast and lacked any emotional impact. Many military movies had great shootouts and action scenes, so this movie needed something to stand out from just a bland movie, and while it had a huge opportunity to do that, it did not take it. The movie was very black and white and did not explore the moral gray areas of war as much as it could have. This is not a bad film. It just does not deserve be known as one of the best military films ever made. To summarize this movie in one word: overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Heads will explode in the ""hate America first"" crowd!","Read many of the negative reviews of this movie, and you will see the venom of a twisted political agenda. You will see words like ""redneck"", ""sociopath"", ""Christian baby killer"", and ""nazi"", along with many an anti-Christian, anti-southern US, and anti-US in general comment. I do believe that many of the people writing these types of reviews have not even seen the movie, and are essentially acting upon a Pavlovian reflex to hate and curse all things pro-American-yes; this crowd's handlers certainly have their drones well trained. While it is true that Eastwood has handled his directorial duties with a more subtle hand in the past, this is a well-directed, well-acted effort that deserves its Oscar nominations, but will probably not win the biggies. Chris Kyle's story is compelling and gut-wrenching, poignant, sad, and uplifting. Bradley Cooper deserves the best acting nod. While modern-day Hollywood loves to spit out blood, gore, ultra-violence, and soul-rotting perversion for every taste, all in the name of ""entertainment"" (ala Rome before the fall), nothing offends that community and its supporters more than a non-satiric, non-revisionist, look at a subject like patriotism, family values, or any theme based in Judeo-Christian morality. I mean, these are the people who want to allow Roman Polanski, a sick pedophile who drugged and then sodomized a thirteen year old girl, back into this country so that he can once again practice his ""craft"", when he should be smoking in hell-just like all the ululating terrorists Chris Kyle sent there.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Incredible performance, and true to Chris Kyle","As I read through some other reviews I have to wonder if anyone read the book. A person well read on Chris Kyle would realize that he thought he was fighting a worthwhile cause. This movie is taken from that point of view, the view of the person that this movie is based on (What an idea). I appreciate this because it allows me to really get in touch with Kyle, and feel his struggles. This was never meant to be an antiwar movie, but a true representation of the feelings that a majority of these men and women feel as they're fighting. The comparison to the Nazi Propaganda film in Inglorious Bastards is an absolute injustice to the true message of the film. It's the true story of a man who would put his country fist, because he was a true patriot. There is no other way to put his message on screen without showing Kyle in that light.Now for the actual film itself. I thought it was a very well made film. Every scene is gripping, and the war scenes in particular are intense, and show a somewhat realism of war. When I first heard the Bradley Cooper was Cas as Kyle I wondered how a mainly comedy actor from Philadelphia could pull off a war hero Texan. But my god is he amazing in the part. At no point while I was watching did I think I was watching Bradley cooper, I was watching Chris Kyle. His performance left me speechless. Sienna Miller as Taya Kyle doesn't get enough credit for her performance as well. The phone call scene as she is walking out of the doctor's office is truly emotional. Most of the supporting cast is great in their roles as well.All in all is the movie perfect, no not really. But it is a truly great film, that portrays the life of Chris Kyle in a respectable and mostly accurate way. Nobody tried to interject their viewpoints in to his story, because that's not the point of the film. It is meant to portray a great man, in an honest respectable way. It accomplished that goal, and is a fitting portrayal of a man who fought for his country, and died for his brothers in arms",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a mixed result,"Based on the true story of Chris Kyle, an expert marksman and U. S. Navy Seal, Bradley Cooper portrays the main character who fought in the front lines during the Iraq War.The first half of the movie is seen mainly through Kyle's viewpoint. He is a devout patriot and sees his mission as saving his country and its people. This is a fair viewpoint but the movie avoids the many counter-arguments happening at the time of that very divisive war.Iraqi civilians are mainly portrayed as the ""bad guys"" which is unfair considering their ordinary lives have been uprooted with so many radical changes.Thankfully, the film doesn't have a totally biased viewpoint. It is quite honest in the difficulties faced by soldiers after returning home. For Chris, this is mainly reflected by his wife, played by Sienna Miller, who is clear in her unhappiness about Chris' drive and how he has changed. Though Cooper gives a rather good performance, there could have been more depth and subtlety in the portrayal of someone who is driven while denying the effect of the traumas he has experienced.At times, the film seems too long but it ends with a very moving finale that is felt well after the movie's completion. The ending also centers around an event that boldly and effectively takes place off-screen. - dbamateurcritic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sad But True!,"Love Clint Eastwood as a director as he doesn't do much wrong. This is an interesting movie depicting the true story of Chris Kyle. I didn't know the story and so didn't see the end coming. I think the movie is very well done as it does show the ugliness of the war in Iraq and the impact particularly on families and the soldiers themselves. You truly can't be trained to kill people then expect it to have no impact on you! I think Clint has directed a very realistic movie without going over the top with the action sequences. He just shows things as they probably were/are. Bradley Cooper does an outstanding job capturing Chris Kyle without adopting a action man status which would have made the movie too 'American corny'. Sienna Miller is also great as his wife. This movie isn't overcomplicated and tells a story of a man who does his job extremely efficiently but still suffers as a lot as people did and still do coming out of an intense fighting/killing situation. An expressive movie again by Clint, and definitely worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This didn't sweep the Oscars but it swept me away!,"My name is Kyle Kyle. I was born yesterday and my parents wanted to name me after Chris Kyle who is undoubtedly the biggest American figure since Benedict Arnold. My last name is pure coincidence but God himself knows I would give my Red blood, White skin and Blue collar to be a part of his lineage. My parents took me to see American Sniper on opening weekend and needless to say, my entire life has changed. Chris Kyle, a Martyr to Freedom and a symbol of a Nation's Pride wrote his life story right before it was unfairly cut short and the greatest American filmmaker, Clit Yeastwood took it upon himself to adapt this ever-reaching, patriotic spread bald eagle of a story to the silver screen.Never will there be a life story so captivating, so important and so celebrated in American History. I have a dream. I have a dream that one day his autobiography will be required reading in any and all American History classes. From grade school to grad school. From the earth to the moon. From my cradle to my grave I will use this book as a companion to my bible to get me through my struggle, to pray, take my vitamins and be true to my country because I'm a real American. You simply can't manufacture this kind of cultural respect and patriotism for the greatest country on earth. Chris Kyle has taught me to stick to my guns and if anyone tries to intimidate or threaten my personal beliefs I have my right as an American Citizen to stand my ground. After all we have to fight injustice to keep the history of our great nation alive. If we give in to outsiders (those people) we will lose our identity and our greatest achievements like Joseph McCarthy, The Vietnam War, Beatlemania, High School football, man-caves, marriage, Reaganomics and 9/11.I noticed something during the movie as I was flailing my arms and legs in my seat. I took a look around to see grown ups my parents age (15 and 21 respectively) and other grown ups even older than them and something happened: they all turned into babies.

Elise Robertson put in a good effort but it wasn't one of those transcendent performances like we saw from Ahney Her in Gran Torino or Sandra Oh in Sideways... it was okay but a little shallow in my book.As I said, it was a pretty good war movie and, you know, the good guys won on the battlefield but lost in regular society.The theme of PTSD has been dealt with in a whole bunch of other movies, this one didn't give us any more clues as to how to recognise or deal with it.The simple truth is that you can't put a man straight back into the normal world without some sort of formal training, just as you can't put him into the world of blood and guts without preparation. Nevertheless they continue to do it at both ends of the seesaw.Whenever I watch these types of movies I'm always appalled at the stupidity of men (either soldiers or cops) walking into buildings thinking that a gun in their hands can save them from a guy waiting on the other side of the door with a bucking big fazooka. Not only that, but what are they doing in these crap hole cities where there's nothing but crumbling buildings and garbage strewn across every street, why not wait outside the city gates until they've all polished each other off? They don't seem to care who they kill, as long as it's someone. From the aerial shots they give you, the cities are usually in some sandy wasteland with only a couple of roads in and out. Why not just lay siege and wait for them to surrender. Geez if you did that in Vancouver they'd give up in a couple of hours 'cos they couldn't get their Lattes... but I digress. It's good Clint Eastwood stuff and he hasn't failed to entertain me so far. This is on the far edge of entertainment,pushing into unsettlement, therefore a movie that makes you think .....and movies like that are worth watching. cheers Billc",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding,"As a movie, outstanding! As for Mr. Kyle, he is an American Hero. His country sent him to do a job, and he did it. Anyone questioning the integrity of this American, can go question the Bush Administration and any other administration that continues war. I believe in Peace. Our troops went because they abide by authority. It is sad to see any human die; Thank you politicians. Thank you Mr. Kyle for helping so many people in such a short time here on earth. Peace is with you... The director and actors amazing. I want to know more about the sand-storm seen. And who filmed the funeral procession footage? It made me cry. I highly recommend the movie. I have a feeling Mr. Kyle would want the Marine who killed him to not be prosecuted, but get help for his PTSD.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A polarizing movie,"Regardless of how closely the movie follows the ""true"" life story of Chris Kyle, it is obvious from the reviews that it is very polarizing. Having read a number of the negative reviews, people that do not agree with the U.S. involvement in the middle eastern conflicts must be very capable of ignoring the atrocities of Muslim upon Muslim to actually believe that some of the atrocities depicted in the movie could not have happened. What do the recent events in Paris along with the continual suicide bombings using any gender and age for bombers tell you? The movie did not depict Kyle as a classic hero but as a killer in a time where no one knows how the next killer will be dressed, where the attack will be carried out, and that there is little hope that any ruling group will ever come to any peace talks.This is the world we live in now. This movie doesn't deny it or change it, and it doesn't glorify the effects these prolonged conflicts have on the returning veterans, but it also doesn't try to analyze that side of it because that is left to the viewers to sort out. It is sad to see that the negative reviewers seem to want the movie to hand them a definitive argument against any response to the current worldwide conflict between various religious, political and economic factions that are not clearly defined by governments and borders.The movie allows the viewer to figure it out, if capable. Sadly most don't want to.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
great war movie.,"his movie is about PTSD and the effects war, and is an amazingly put together story. You may not like the story and what it tells about a man's feelings toward a group of people who are trying to kill his fellow countrymen. But in war your military brothers are your family and wouldn't you protect your family? Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper have hit a home run with this film, and Bradley Cooper will be hard pressed to ever be better. Watch the movie for what it is and not for what it isn't. This isn't American propaganda in fiction, it actually has happened. I'm sure for the sake of the movie some aspects have been missed or even added but that has to be done in all films.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not only a patriotic story,"I had very confused expectations about this movie: I adore Clint Eastwood but his late films (Hereafter and J. Edgar) didn't make me fully satisfied. I adore Bradley Cooper too, because I think that he was a surprise in this last years. Despite this the war is not my favorite theme for a movie. Technically ""American sniper"" is a beautiful movie: I appreciated the shoots, the close-up on the wonderful, expressive eyes of Cooper, the sound effects, the scene in the middle of the sandstorm. Knowing the political thinking of the director, my fear was to see an ode to the war. It isn't. It is a truthful portrait of a man with questionable values. Not a mere story of patriotic ideals.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Legendary Service To Country,"Legendary Service To Country: Watched American Sniper directed by Clint Eastwood, starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. This 2014 American Biographical War Drama based on the 2012 book by The ""Most Lethal Sniper"" in U.S. Military History, U.S. Navy SEAL Team 3 Chief Chris Kyle who was credited with over 150 kills, depicts actual combat events which took place over in Falujah, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.The film begins with Chris Kyle played by Cooper and his younger brother Jeff Kyle played by Keir O'Donnell as rodeo cowboys from Texas. After watching news developments of U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanznia and Kenya, Chris Kyle is compelled to join the Navy Seals, so he does. During his training, Chris meets his future wife/mother of his children, Taya Kyle played by Miller at a local bar, they start talking, and in a matter of time they are married, Taya gets pregnant, and Chris is soon deployed four times in to the combat zone.While over there, Kyle faces challenges of being away from his newly planned family for months at a time, which creates strain on his family-life, killing enemy fighters including children, losing comrades in combat to extremist snipers, coming home transitioning back to civilian life which is difficult due to his combat-related stress, and finally he finds that this war is the war which can't be left behind.The movie is action-packed, gripping, eye-opening, filled with emotion and definitely well directed by Eastwood and characters portrayed magnificently by Miller and Cooper. If you are looking for a real-life depiction of the challenges/sacrifices American Forces face in the Combat Zone, definitely check this film out! It's 132 minutes long, Rated R, but worth the time to go see. My cinema score is 8/10! ‪#‎maverickradio‬",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tribute to Hero Chris Kyle (R.I.P.),"Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" (2015) is similar to 2014's ""Lone Survivor"" in that they're both straight war flicks based on true stories, the former taking place in Iraq and the latter in Afghanistan. While these movies are similar in theme, tone and quality, I give ""American Sniper"" the edge.Most reading this realize that Kyle was murdered in 2013, along with Chad Littlefield, as they were helping some piece of sheet with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In February, 2015, the scumbag was sentenced to life in prison without parole.Since ""American Sniper"" is about a recent American hero with, by far, the most kills of any American sniper in history (on record, that is), it's obviously pro-American and, consequently, indirectly ant-liberal. As such, the film gets raves from conservatives and utter loathing from far-left types. (Why a loony leftist would even want to see a movie like this is puzzling. Who goes to a movie they know they won't like? Which goes to show that many of the leftists who give ""American Sniper"" the absolute lowest rating didn't even view it). As for me, I don't evaluate movies based upon their patriotism or political leanings; I grade them according to their quality, the most important thing being whether or not the movie is compelling. Someone can make a movie that perfectly agrees with my perspective on life, but if it's mediocre, unimaginative and boring then it's not a good movie and I'll say so.That said, I found ""American Sniper"" worthwhile because it's the first movie I've seen to offer a first-hand look at what it was like to fight in Iraq. Bradley Cooper is very convincing as the humble yet resilient Kyle. So this is a solid war flick that somewhat addresses the negative effects of war and it's sure to please (particularly) conservative/patriotic types, but it lacks that special perspective or flair that marks great war films, like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Fury,"" ""The Thin Red Line,"" ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""Glory,"" ""Ride with the Devil,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""The Young Lions"" and ""Paths of Glory.""The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Morocco and Southern California.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scratching the surface,"It's always tricky to review a biographical war drama centered around a war hero, especially when that specific hero emerged as such in the middle of a modern-era conflict that still divides people's opinions. On one side, there will be the usual anti-military guys yelling that it's U.S. army propaganda on the first occasion, and on the other side, there will be the pro war people who'd be ready to shoot you in the face if you ever were to hint that there possibly is a conspiracy behind 9/11. Both groups unfortunately can't seem to have a nuanced opinion on such a sensitive subject, even if their lives were to depend on it.First off, I'm not American, and I always try to play the devil's advocate when it comes to these sensitive subjects because, in my humble opinion, the truth usually lies right in the middle of opposed polarized opinions. Second, I want to review this as a film. I'm not here to judge the morality behind Kyle's actions, or behind the conflicts he was a part of.American Sniper begins with a montage of the early adulthood of Chris Kyle. The film does not drag with the introduction to its protagonist, and quite frankly, it could have gone a little longer. Mr. Kyle enrolls in the army, we see a few boot camp sequences, outlining his strong character, mixed in with glimpses of Kyle's urban life, notably when he meets the woman that soon enough becomes his wife. The film pretty much keeps rolling with this exact same formula until its ending, alternating between polished combat sequences from Kyle's tours to Iraq and his family life, which ends up being greatly affected, as if Mr. Kyle's mind never leaves Iraq, even when his feet are planted on U.S. soil.Clint Eastwood's directing is probably the film's strongest asset. The war sequences are very well shot, and the camera's calmness during Kyle's homecomings progressively fades away to match the camera's nervousness that is initially exclusive to the war sequences as Kyle's mind becomes increasingly affected by his trips to Iraq.On the downside, American Sniper's duality becomes redundant after a while, especially when it comes to Kyle's family time, which has a considerable clichéd feel to it, and is simply not very heart warming. On one hand, you got Chris Kyle the soldier, the man that's barely shook up after putting a hole through a child's body, and, on the other hand, you feel like Eastwood is trying to portray a tough-minded, sympathetic character whose allegiance to his duty is untouchable but who also happens to be a caring husband and father, as any typical model American citizen would (or should) be. Unfortunately, with the lack of a proper introduction to the character, a lack of key moments that truly define the character, and the shallowness of the paradox between Kyle the soldier and Kyle the family man, the viewer is left with very little food for thought.Bradley Cooper's performance is nonetheless interesting, as he does manage to make the most out of a character that's limited by average screen writing.And here lies the real problem of American Sniper : lack of depth, both in its depiction of the character and its portrayal of a problem that strikes several war veterans : post-traumatic stress disorder. This probably should have been the key theme to exploit, and while this is what it becomes towards the end, it feels like American Sniper barely scratches the surface. This is definitely unfortunate. Personally, I thought this was a missed opportunity to elaborate on a problem that is key in this specific story.If you think post-traumatic stress is an interesting subject, I would highly recommend you watch Harsh Times, a David Ayer film which spends nothing more than the opening credits sequence to show war images, and then spends its whole runtime portraying a character struck with post-traumatic stress disorder, his personality, his actions, his ambitions and how his whole life and the lives of his surroundings are affected. For amazing modern war sequences, Black Hawk Down's and Lone Survivor's, in my opinion, surpass than the ones offered in Clint Eastwood's film.That being said, American Sniper is still a competent feature, and juxtaposing combat sequences with family life to bring up the post-traumatic stress theme was an excellent idea. However, the way everything is delivered prevents it from becoming a truly engaging film both emotionally and cinematically.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
'If you think that this war isn't changing you you're wrong.',"Why do we as a species just keep killing, making war, destroying countries, making surviving soldiers' minds scared and dysfunctional? For those of us who have been through extended combat in wars throughout the last century and into the present answers to those questions escape us. But despite the lurid subject matter of watching men kill men under the umbrella of 'war', films such as this keep our eyes focused on the pity of war. Jason Hall adapted the book of the true events as recorded in their book by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and James DeFelice and form all the facts molded a story that gives us a distilled version of the four tours of duty in Iraq as a navy Seal Sniper that 'won' Chris Kyle 160 kills and in doing so allowed us to witness the moral and mental deterioration of a man's soul. This film SHOULD be seen.Chris Kyle was a Texan who wanted to become a rodeo cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism. Post 9/11 happened, so he joined the SEALs in order to become a sniper. After marrying Taya, Kyle and the other members of the team are called for their first tour of Iraq. Kyle's struggle isn't with his missions, but about his relationship with the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle it with his urban life, his wife and kids. It does not end well for anyone.Clint Eastwood's direction is razor sharp and he doesn't miss a step. Bradley Cooper brings an astonishingly fine performance in allowing us to see all aspects of this driven man. Sienna Miller is excellent as his sensitive wife, and there are poignant little character vignettes by Jake McDorman as Biggles, Luke Grimes, Sammy Sheik as the Iraqi counterpart to Chris, Navid Negahan, Jonathan Groff, Cory Hardrict, Keir O'Donnell and many other in this huge cast. The cinematography is so realistic it is difficult to watch and the locations in Morocco are disturbing real. The film will keep you awake after seeing it, and it should.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top Film.,"I watched this film with high expectations just because i knew the story would have me engaged after seeing the trailer. And i can say that the film did meet those expectations.Firstly Bradley Cooper pulls out the best performance of his career. I haven't been a Cooper fan in the past but after this film I will take him more seriously. You can see the sheer effort he puts into his characterization as a way of honoring Chris Kyle's patriotic life.Eastwood manages to capture the alienation that war can cause in a man very well. The parallels of his time in Iraq and at home are extremely effective in conveying Chris's struggle in handling war. We see he is more alive whilst with his 'brothers' in a war zone than with his wife. The battle scenes are extremely realistic and suspenseful, the sound mixing does justice there. The scene locations are very entrancing and realistic. There was an element of what i call 'Hollywoodness' in setting up the narrative at the beginning but that didn't diminish what was very satisfactory watch. I did feel there was something missing from the narrative but Eastwood was being authentic in the sense that he told a truthful story in tribute to a soldier.In short this film is an insight into the mind of a gifted hunter, who sacrificed his normality for a sense of fulfillment and duty. Eastwood doesn't go down the metaphoric route like 'Apocalypse Now' but rather explores war through the psychoanalysis of one of history's most potent killers.

Interesting story with good acting,"I liked American Sniper because of the story and strong acting. Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was raised in Texas and taught to stand up for himself by his Dad, who also taught him to shoot. He was living an underachieving life it seemed when events caused him to enlist as a Navy Seal at the age of 30. When he makes it, he gets drafted into the Sniper team, and begins four tours of duty in Iraq I guess it is. The story reports he became the highest performing sniper ever with 160 kills. Chris Kyle is real, and this movie was based on his book.Clint Eastwood directed this story. He certainly added some Hollywood material, like this cat and mouse game between Kyle and an Iraqi sniper Mustafa that plays out continually. Since we have no idea what Mustafa was really like, this whole section was created.Sienna Miller plays Kyle's wife and does a surprisingly good job of holding her own, delivering some gut-wrenching pleas for her man to return home.The best part of this film is the acting from Bradley Cooper. Kyle did four tours of duty, over 1000 days of combat, and he never seemed to fully shake what this required him to do - be always vigilant and alert. He obviously suffered medically from stress and other PTSD symptoms. this part of his life was brilliantly scripted by Eastwood and performed by Cooper.The story itself however holds no major surprises since it's based on a book, and a lot of newspaper material that you certainly heard and read. So the ending is not a shocker, but still sad, and Eastwood, as often directors do, weaves in real-life footage to bring home the point.Whether all that is shown is true, that's up to you to judge. But I encourage you to watch American Sniper because the story is well written, but mostly the acting was excellent. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper highlights the man behind the myth,"I've heard mixed things about 'American Sniper' directed by manly man director/actor Clint Eastwood, and I never cared much for Bradley Cooper in his first role that got him an Oscar nom (the overrated 'Silver Linings Playbook'), but for this third Oscar nomination, I finally think Cooper has elevated his craft to a genuinely amazing place. He gives real-life Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle wonderful charisma, yet he keeps the portrayal grounded, making for a charming every man.Narratively, I think Eastwood does a wonderful job of deconstructing a myth about this fellow, who came to be known as the deadliest U.S. sniper in Iraq. The film's pacing is intense, and (after seeing Fury) it cemented for me that war movies are my horror movies (and I saw this film at home via a screener during voting for the Florida Film Critics Circle).American Sniper just rattled me, and many of the performances are suitably intense, from the villainous bully intimidating the locals called ""the Butcher"" to an especially heartbreaking Sienna Miller as the wife waiting for Kyle back home. I know Eastwood's a big director with a reputation, but I really connected with this film, and I think it's worth catching at the multiplex.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Typical But Superior Example Of Eastwood's Work,"After seeing the extremely pornographic war porn of FURY I then decided to watch this movie which was not only multi-award winning but also has the somewhat shocking stat of being the biggest grossing war film unadjusted for inflation of all time . I had to double check the box office figures . It didn't exactly spend weeks and weeks at the top of the British box office film charts and didn't really garner the sort of critical acclaim it was getting in America . This is understandable though . Even the title featuring the words ""American"" and Sniper"" conjures up all sorts of visions of ethnocentric stereotypes of jingoistic rednecks from the good ole USA zapping bad men with brown screen and beards who are bad men simply because they've got guns , don't speak English and aren't American citizens where as the good guys have got guns , many have beards and simply the goodies because they are Americans . Add to this the predictable but understandable aspect that people have to bring their politics in to the arena and you notice people are simply voting either a 1 or a 10 for this film due to being against or for the invasion of Iraq . I resisted this and simply watched the film as someone who enjoys cinemaThe truth as far as I can see it is it's neither the quasi-fascist propaganda piece nor the masterwork many people are claiming . What this film is a film by Clint Eastwood and one of his better ones . Now to be fair Eastwood isn't in my opinion an outstanding director . He doesn't have a unique noticeable style similar to Tim Burton , Martin Scorsese or many other directors but is a good at making character driven films devoid of any flashy gimmicks . Instead he keeps the camera relatively still and let's the performances carry the film . He also does his best at bringing an empathy to protagonists who at first glance who are unsympathetic characters which is probably what a film like this one needs in order for it to work . It is interesting the amount of pedantic minutiae some critics have gone in to such as Chris Kyle's motives for joining the Navy SEALs or his reaction towards shooting a woman and child but bare in mind you're watching a Hollywood and not a fly on the wall documentary . One thing that has been embellished is the long running duels between Kyle and enemy sniper Mustapha but this is no doubt to give a much needed structure to the narrative that's in danger of being disjointed and episodicIn short AS isn't a perfect film but is one of the better films to have been directed by Clint Eastwood . It is also one of the better films to have been released last year . Where it earns my respect is the fact that it is the biggest money earner from last year that saw the box office being totally dominated by fantasy and superhero movies and one genuinely hopes this might lead a mini revolution in Hollywood in to making serious and sombre films featuring real topics as their premise . I live in hope",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great war movie 8/10,"The story of chris Kyle, one of u.s military best snipers is a story of how war affects a man's life and mind. The action sequences were great and Bradley cooper is fantastic as chris Kyle. I liked how the movie shows his journey of becoming a marine and his fears and inner conflicts of what to do when he's in sniper possession. From his childhood till the day he was killed helping another veteran. I just wished the scenes where he was with the other veterans were longer so it seems he has been through some sort of ""journey"" and now he is taking care of himself, trying to stay alive and well. To see him with the other veterans at the end of the movie helped me understand his suffer during the war. And I wished we would have seen more of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poor film about a serious subject,"American Sniper is suppose to be based on the Autobiography of former Navy Seal Chris Kyle and his life inside/outside the military. However, in reality the story is grossly inflated, making Chris Kyle out to be some amazing hero, where in reality he was just another cog in the wheel. Many key-pivotal aspects of the film were not part of his autobiography AND were based on his wife's memory, not actual facts written by the man himself. The screen writer Jason Hall, who has zero experience writing features, had only ONE phone call with Kyle before he sadly passed away. Many exciting and interesting aspects of Kyle's life weren't included in the screenplay.Crucially, the audience is incapable of connecting to any of the characters or feeling sympathy for the actions that take place. As a consequence, the emotional component has been left out entirely. Even the combat missions are boring at best, never leaving the audiences in any suspense. Worst part is, the film includes a fictitious and horribly conceived antagonist, as device to keep the audience in the story. Without it, there would be no story, the film would simply be too disjointed, more like a documentary miniseries, rather then a narrative feature film. The fictitious character adds the ""glue"" necessary to keep us watching.Outside of the poor screenplay, technically the film was a train wreck. Much of the film is suppose to take place in Iraq yet it was shot in Southern California. For wide shot's, they had a second unit in Morocco doing some 2nd unit work, but every single Iraq scene was the same buildings used over and over again. The military vehicles, weapons, clothing and combat actions were all wrong as well, silly mistakes for such a big movie. In the finale, fake vehicles, helicopters and an absolutely atrocious sand storm, destroy whatever realism remained. There were other huge mistakes like using a fake baby in one scene and mannequins for wide shots! Yes you heard me correct, mannequin's were used in the backgrounds of wide shots and YOU COULD TELL thanks to the digital cinematography and projection.The film was actually boring to watch because it was visually uninspiring and flat. If the audience can't connect in any way to the characters, if the story is downright predictable and there isn't really any driving force, what keeps the audiences attention? Generally, stunning visuals and music can help a poor screenplay, but this film has neither a sore OR anything remotely redeeming about the cinematography. It was a truly ""flat"" film with no dynamics in the audio mix, cinematography, screenplay or acting.Even though Bradley Cooper is an amazing guy and a great actor, his character wasn't strong enough to overcome the films glaring issues. It's just sad such a great ""American Hero"" had his story butchered by one of the best filmmakers we have.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Red White and True?,"Clint Eastwood has become a highly respected figure in the film industry. His iconic acting would have got him there, but add on his prolific film score composing and the fact that American Sniper is his 37th (THIRTY-SEVENTH!) directorial credit and the much over-used epithet ""legend"" is surely applicable. Given that I was less than complimentary about his last film (2014's Jersey Boys), and particularly since he still doesn't look – at 85 – as someone you want to get into a fight with, I'd better be nicer about his latest! And that's not hard, as it is a very good film.Bradley Cooper hunks-up to play real-life Navy-SEAL Chris Kyle, a sharp-shooter as a deer-hunting kid who, patriotically driven on by the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, 'signs up' and just gets better and better as a SEAL sniper.On his wedding day he gets his call-up to his first tour of duty in the dusty and dangerous hell of the Iraq war. The film effectively charts both his stressful and dramatic tours of duty (where he quickly acquires the moniker of ""Legend"" and a price on his head) as well as the devastating effect that the build-up of post-traumatic stress has on his married life.""Silver Linings Playbook"" aside I've not always been a great fan of Bradley Cooper's acting, but in American Sniper he really delivers a brilliant performance, switching from the outside world's view of a macho hero to a haunted and tormented soul when given calm to reflect. Although (in my book) he probably won't win, it's good to see he was Oscar-nominated for this.Donning the dark hair dye, Sienna Miller is also extremely good as his long-suffering wife Taya.In the same way as ""The Hurt Locker"" got to the unvarnished reality of the Iraq war(s), so this film also lays on the tension by the bucket-load. The action sequences are extremely well done, with the story-arc over the four tours of duty being Kyle's zealous pursuit of his equivalent on the other side: a Syrian Olympic sharpshooter who has been taking a toll on American troops.Whilst I was moderately engaged by the film, it is rather too energetically painted in red white and blue for British tastes, and dispatches ""bad guys"" at such an incredible rate compared to the US troops that by my reckoning the war should have been over in under 2 weeks. My wife found the war sequences rather repetitious and I can see her point: the film's 132 minute running time could have usefully been trimmed by 15 minutes or so. A lot of the dialogue in the film is also difficult to hear: somewhat ironic in that it has been nominated for Oscars for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing (so what do I know?!).With other Oscar nominations for Best Film, Best editing (well deserved) and best adapted screenplay, and with its fervently Patriotic feel, this is bound to do quite well on February 22nd. It's only a shame that there wasn't a category for ""Most plastic looking baby"", else this film would have been a shoe-in for that.(If you enjoyed this review please see my past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address on the site to receive future reviews.

Another American Propaganda Piece That's Nothing More Or Less,"Out of the 8 films nominated for Best Picture Oscar this year, 4 of them chronicle the lives of notable personalities, first being the renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, second is the legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, third being the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, & finally we have the deadliest sniper in US military history, Chris Kyle, in American Sniper.Based on Chris Kyle's memoir of the same name, American Sniper tells the story of the decorated United States Navy SEAL marksman who served 4 tours in Iraq War & earned the notorious tag of the most lethal American sniper with 160 confirmed kills. The film adaptation briefly goes through segments of his life, his time in Iraq as well as the difficulties he faced in readjusting to civilian life & domestic responsibilities after returning home from his duty.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film is a one-sided perspective on the subject of Iraq War that depicts all Iraqis as dehumanized savages, is brimming with American glorification, even tries to justify United States' moral policing habit on the world stage when that nation could really use some of that in its own backyard, and just like Lone Survivor which was released over a year ago, is nothing more than a mere propaganda piece made exclusively for American audience.The technical aspects are finely executed but none of its elements have anything that can make them stand apart from other examples of the genre. The cast comprises of Bradley Cooper & Sienna Miller, and the rest of its supporting cast simply exists. Cooper chips in strongly in the role of Chris Kyle & adds another impressive act to his résumé while Miller is brilliant as Kyle's wife who becomes increasingly concerned with the evident change in her husband's personality.On an overall scale, American Sniper neither succeeds as one of the best examples of its genre nor is amongst Eastwood's best works as a director. However, you have to give it to the 84-year old filmmaker who still isn't showing any signs of slowing down & despite being a very mediocre film in my opinion, its combat sequences nevertheless manage to elevate its entertainment factor to a level that's probably enough to satisfy the majority of mainstream audience.Undoubtedly the weakest nomination in both Best Picture & Best Actor category at the upcoming Academy Awards, and quite unworthy of its recent praise as well considering that there were far too many better films & more compelling performances to come out in 2014, American Sniper might be raking in millions at the box-office right now but content wise, it has nothing new in store for those who are looking for a fresher outlook on the subject of war.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Everything is done exceptionally well, just one problem that keeps it from being great","It was fine. Nothing spectacular and certainly not Best Picture worthy, but there's no changing that. Everything in the film was done exceptionally well, but what keeps it from being that absolutely incredible film that is Best Picture worthy is what is not in the film. Chris Kyle has said some controversial things and the movie never really goes into that whole ordeal. Personally, the best way to make a biopic about this guy would have been to cover even the nasty things in his life. Well it could have been worse. The movie could have painted him as an American hero, cased closed, but for the most part, it stays fairly neutral there. The leaving out the controversy was honestly the only problem I had with the movie. Bradley Cooper is fantastic, he deserved his Oscar nomination. All the action scenes are very well directed and realistic, which at the very least makes the movie not boring. The action, direction, and Bradley Cooper's performance make the movie worth watching, despite the one previously mentioned problem.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly a great movie,"American Sniper is one of those films that takes you on a journey through the eyes of a true hero. First off, Bradly Cooper played an amazing role, definitely the best of his career. He bulked up in muscle and just let the role consume him. The overall story was interesting and had a good pace. The directing and cinematography were really done well, the movie looked great and it really drew you in from the beginning. The one thing that I did not like about it was that it didn't tear me apart emotionally like I wanted it to. In the trailers, it looked like this movie was gonna make me cry, but it wasn't as sad as it originally shown in the previews. Other than that, very well made movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful and thrilling, hits the mark","American Sniper is a film based on the true events that surrounded Chris Kyle, a heavily skilled and determined American SEAL, and his brothers-in-arms in the Middle East during a time of war and crisis. It's a story about a boy who grew up to be a man and yearning to fulfill one specific duty: To protect men, women and children from those who seek to do evil and harm.The movie takes us through a bit of his early life and training, and then juggles between his 4 tours in Iraq and his life on US soil as he struggled with internal and external dilemmas. It's an accurate portrayal of the life of Chris Kyle, and his confirmed 160 kills that saved many innocent lives.The film is not perfect, but aside the minor editing flaws, fake babies, and a few sub-par directing decisions, it's a movie well worth seeing for the action, the drama, the laughs (there were some good ones), the cries, the story, the characters, and the patriotic tribute to the men and women who serve. I would also like to mention the respect given to Chris Kyle and his family is well executed in the film, and I've never seen a theater packed with people so silent as they filed out as the end credits rolled, silent save a few sniffles.There's a lot of controversy regarding the actions and beliefs of Chris Kyle. Do not let this mindless squabble tell you who Chris Kyle was, go and see the movie yourself and learn of the sacrifices he and ALL troops made to keep the US (and others) safe. This isn't a story about a blood-thirsty killer, this is a story about a man who was committed to his God and his country, and who ended blood- thirsty killers.You can do some protecting for yourself and others in the theater, just bring some tissues to protect those around you against running makeup and wet cheeks.God bless our troops.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Watchable action-drama with glaring character omissions,"While American Sniper is an entertaining movie, I don't think it's as thought-provoking as I'd like it to be. This seems like a wasted opportunity to me. Instead of an interesting character study, we instead get what is mostly an action movie, with some hammy drama thrown in. Chris Kyle always felt in the right even when he was clearly wrong. He seemed a nearly flawless man, when in actuality he was quite flawed. He's a proved liar, and slanderer, yet the film portrays Kyle as some kind of flawless American Hero. At no point in the story did I feel the tension Eastwood was trying to invoke. The situation with his wife, and child, are clearly meant to be stressed, nigh on the breaking point, but it never felt like the weight was there to back up the performances. Everything felt so safe, and not at all stressful. It's shot beautifully, and there are some interesting visual choices. One example: a sandstorm where we can see just as little as the soldiers can. Little touches like this make American Sniper at least enjoyable for one watch, but repeat viewing is unnecessary. If you can get past the glaring omission of some of Kyle's less-desirable character traits, you'll most likely enjoy the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece !!!,"'American Sniper' is one of the most amazing and most important film of the last 20 years .Basing the film off of the life and autobiography of one of the most lethal military snipers in our country's history, US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, Clint Eastwood's unique style and direction mixed with an incredible performance from actor Bradley Cooper ultimately creates an unforgettable and powerful experience that pays great respect to the life of a man who sacrificed so much for his nation. This masterpiece must be seen by every American , especially now when the threat of Islam and the brutal inhuman sharia law is being imposed on all infidels around the world by muslims . The threat is greater than ever and we must face the truth and stand up for freedom against savagery .This film is extremely well-rounded as it presents heart-stopping, intense action, gripping, tense drama, and details not only the skillful and brutal combat that existed in Chris Kyle's military career, but also shows the many struggles a solider can experience once returning to their life at home and away from the battlefield. This amazing masterpiece is a must for all . Chris Kyle is a great hero to every person who cherishes freedom and loves his country , amazing person , in a fight between the savage Muslim world )and the civilized world kuffar countries ) we must support the civilized world . I cried at the end of the movie and I will go see it again and again .",,Anonymous,Biography
Don't understand the hype,"American Sniper was not what I expected. First off, I have no problems with the actors or the director. This film felt like some type of documentary. I know its based on a book about Chris Kyle's life as a sniper for the U.S. Military. This film seemed to be going through the motions. I never saw a any scene in this film that stood out or that is memorable. Talk about being underwhelmed. Due to all the hype and talk about a great film, I'm so disappointed. Maybe I should have read the book instead.I should find ""The Hurt Locker"" DVD and call it a day. This was by far a more interesting film about soldiers in Iraq.

A Dubious Portrait of American Patriotism,"The heavily disturbing image of the Twin Towers falling to their burning end and of people leaping off from its heights lit an unstoppable fire in many Americans on that day. Since then, many patriotic Americans have enlisted in the army, hoping to find some form of fulfilling resolution to all this terror. Some of them even agree with the war's never-ending duration in that it will protect the homeland from any other terrorists as long as they ""protect and serve."" American Sniper follows the true story of one of these soldiers: Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)—a tall, sturdy All-American who continually chooses to leave his beautiful wife, Taya (Sienna Miller), and later on his two sweet kids for the sake of protecting this ultimate American ideal. He's a man who truly believes in the war, and thus, he also turned out to be the deadliest sniper in US history with a confirmed kill rate of 160 people throughout his tours of duty. How could a human even tolerate the responsibility and sight of so many corpses and gore without a particular psychological toll? Well, unsurprisingly, the answer is that one can't, and Kyle only displays the kind of issue here that many individuals choose to irresponsibly gloss over when they're on a support campaign for war: PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Following yet another visit to Iraq, he comes home to the pain of looming anxiety and lengthy sessions of completely zoning out from reality.With American Sniper, Clint Eastwood manages to create a thoroughly intense war film. As the deafening gunshots ring around the IMAX audience, the film's meticulous sense of gritty realism ensures to keep the viewers in pervasive suspense. Even when Kyle isn't focusing on deadly shots at a suspicious man's or kid's head, the brilliantly tense score sounds off with a foreboding build-up of what sounds like a sniper rifle reloading, followed by its haunting discharge, so as to never ease the tension in the room and keep us on the edge of our seats. There's no way I can emphasize the excellence of the sound use enough (the sound mixing and editing) in this epic, installing you into an observational post right there on the battlefield as many get blown to bits left and right. It's rough; it's graphically violent; it's unsettling.Bradley Cooper once again makes a smart choice for his latest role; this one though might not be as showy as his performance in Silver Linings Playbook, but his distressed eyes and failing psychological condition tell us everything we need to know through his journey. In which case, it's also supported by an impressive actress in Sienna Miller who works with fairly little material but adds so much more of her own emotional meat into the role than expected. The look of worry never leaves her face; even for those small intimate moments of family time and reunions with her husband in which excitement and merriment briefly spring out, she eventually returns to her emotional default—to a sort of declining hope for the future of a soldier's life. It's a shame Miller isn't receiving more attention in the awards circuit. In sum, from a technical level, American Sniper is one of the more memorable experiences in the modern war genre, but when we regard what's supposed to be an enthralling narrative, we start to witness questionable elements.Like with Angelina Jolie's Unbroken, the major problem here is the sheer closeness to its subject. As the narrative flows along, it becomes more transparent just how much of a tribute American Sniper intends to be to Chris Kyle's legacy, followed in the end by the standard biopic footage that shows us the outcomes of his life and history. Eastwood's obvious jingoistic attitude here unfortunately adds a lot of bias when an objective and more intelligent perspective would've made for a far more fascinating study of a man who has sniped and brutally killed more people (whether innocent or genuinely criminal) than a normal human being can possibly endure in a state of sanity. There is no absolute morality in this tale as right as (simplistically) cheering on your nation, no matter what, sounds.Every time American Sniper hints at hesitation from its protagonist, it refutes any possible anti-war arguments by reverting to blind patriotism again and again through heroic dialogue, the numerous American flags sighted across the movie's mise en scène, and the obvious tributary segments. ""This war was just destiny, and it's up to us to enthusiastically back America up in its undoubtable bravery and (supposed) righteousness,"" says American Sniper. Then again, considering something as heavy-handedly named as the film's very own title, you know exactly what position in the debate it will take.Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/American-sniper-review- a-dubious-portrait-of-American-patriotism/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Right on!,"""American Sniper"" sure hits with surefire accuracy in many cinematic categories. Clint Eastwood's picture depicts the story of real life NAVY Seals Sniper Chris Kyle; Eastwood does deliver the good, the bad, and the ugly about patriotic duty and gritty warfare in the movie. Kyle was called the ""legend"", as Eastwood himself is and Clint has directed another solid offering in the twilight of his career. Now, ""American Sniper"" is not a a perfect movie; Jason Hall's academy award nominated screenplay was a bit overrated and it did have its sporadic misses with one too many formulaic lines in a war picture. Bradley Cooper was mesmerizing as Kyle and is worthy of his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Sienna Miller showed yet again this year that it's ""Miller"" time with her impressive work as Kyle's wife Taya; Sienna fit the right ""taya"" for her role.

American Sniper: The real legend?,"'American Sniper' is based on the memoirs of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, written by Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is the deadliest shooter of all time and is called ""the devil"" by his enemies. From 1999 to 2009 he established a record with most murders as a sniper in the history of the US Army. Kyle learned the tricks on this matter when he was a child and would play a prominent role in the fight against terrorism that began after 9/11. Of course, the controversial feature film American Sniper did not win Oscar for Best Movie and would star leader Bradley Cooper head home with empty hands. The Academy does not like politics. They only like the 'appearance' of political engagement. And that's exactly what American Sniper, the first movie about the Iraq War, does: It's not a real representation of the real thing. Clint Eastwood's newest film is not an honest portrait of war and what it does with the people involved; It is an unforgettable homage to the navy, considered by many Americans as one of their greatest legends.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A well-made film that misses on doing justice to American veterans,"Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" supposedly tells the true story of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, a soldier who has become a legend for killing over 160 Iraqis during his three tours of duty in Iraq. I am so ambivalent about this film because on one hand it's superbly made (with first-rate performances by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller); on the other hand, it strikes me as insultingly oversimplified in its portrayal of socio-political conditions during the Iraq 'war' as well as barely touching on the serious psychological effects returning veterans have had to deal with. Moreover, its screenplay by Jason Hall used too much 'artistic license' -- for example, in real life Kyle never engaged a sniper-antagonist named ""Mustafa"" (an actual sniper killed somewhere else) -- and Hall deceitfully sanitizes Kyle (who bordered on being sociopathic in his callous and joking attitude to his many kills).The worst thing about the film, however, is the patronizing and jingoistic last sequence of Kyle's memorial service, ending the film just like a commercial for the armed services. In the theater at which I saw it, many veterans (who have been deservedly proud of their service) began shouting and egging other audience members into loudly chanting over and over as the end credits rolled, ""U.S.A.! U.S.A!"" as if it were a sporting event (during which time I had to suppress my own very different thoughts at the Bush administration that put them there). Here, the film was reaching far beyond honoring Kyle but pushed it to hero-worship. I think veterans like Kyle deserve a less clichéd, more nuanced portrait of the sacrifices they made, including an accurate detailing of the psychological damage veterans had to cope with after coming home. This part of his real story was virtually ignored, only hinted at (e.g., in the scene of the family dog). Eastwood should have been more concerned with ending on the tragic human cost over any patriotic sloganeering for people to cheer at.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chris Kyle the most lethal sniper in U.S. Military history.,American Sniper the book was a incredible read of action and heartbreak. and it told so much that no movie could contain it. When I saw American Sniper the movie. The basic parts of the book are in intact. Hollywood but intact. Although it glosses over Kyle's early years and it misses the point as Kyle's upbringing was not anything like that. nor was his rodeo career. Kyle had made his mind up long before any terror attacks to join the military. Kle had been badly hurt in a rodeo where a horse fell on him breaking his wrist badly which required pins. at first the navy passed on him because of this injury. but Kyle kept at it and got into the Navy S.E.A.Ls the elite and best of the best. Kyle's book goes into more in depth detail of his training then the movie does and it goes a long way to explain his actions. And his beliefs. It also explains a lot better about why he did what he did. But again since this is a movie it only has a limited time to tell the story. And it does with heart breaking accuracy. There is a lot of action and a lot of pain. As we see Chris Kyle progress from young Navy S.E.A.L to a husband and then a war vet.The movie's best parts are when he comes home between deployments and we see the toll the war is taking on him. Kyle is pushed back into the normal world where nothing seems the same anymore and the only thing keeping him sane is his family. the heart break comes at the very end when we find out about Chris Kyle's sad tragic end. My favorite part comes where we Chris at a garage after his last deployment in which he and his team rescue some marines after a intense battle and Chris meets a marine he saved. Chris is in a garage with his son getting his car fixed. The sweet bit was the interaction between Cooper and the boy playing his son that was realistic but the icing on the cake was when he meets a man he saved and his reaction to the man as he tells the boy your dad is a hero thank you for lending him to us . That part choked me up quite a bit because I am a father. and I know how hard it was for Kyle to go to war with a small family. The battle with PSTD is simply the most authentic I have ever seen and you realize just how much the war changed him. And as he realizes it. And struggles to come back to be Chris Kyle the man and the husband and father. was this a perfect movie no far from it. but it was maybe the best war movie I have seen in a long long time.,,Anonymous,Biography
That Fake Baby,"Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)'s pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife (Sienna Miller) and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he cannot leave behind.This movie is quite the Rorschach test. Although it does not present the real Chris Kyle (the murderous sociopath) at all, it does give us a film that could be seen as pro-war or anti-war or neither (or both). Clint Eastwood is to be commended for that. If there is a political message to be found, it really is in the eye of the beholder.But that fake baby. You can praise the film and Cooper's performance (which is decent). You can forgive some of the cheesy parts, like the over-a-mile sniper shot... but that fake baby.

Powerfully Intense.,"A film that's been nominated for best picture at the Oscars and also has a lot of controversy behind it, that's a lot to take in for a movie studio.American Sniper tell the story of Chris Kyle played by Bradley Cooper. Chris was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname ""Legend."" However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to ""leave no man behind."" But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.I remember a time where Clint Eastwood use to make pretty damn good movies. Unforgiven, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino and Mystic River. All these movie right there are one of his best, but for the last couple of years he's been making some bad or really boring movies that forgot about. Until American Sniper came out and at last his back on track of what made him good in the first place, because American Sniper is a great movie.Bradley Cooper in this movie dose a Oscar worthy performance and...wait a minute, his nominated for one. Now that's what I like to see. Cooper really played Chris Kyle so well that I think this is my favorite performance from him, because he got all the stress, all the hard work to protect his family & country and war itself effecting you from the people you killed, and Bradley Cooper got the character right and showed that he was only human.The directing from Client Eastwood was nothing but great. With his other films (And I'm talking about the bad ones) his movie always have this slow paste feel to them making it uninteresting, but with this it's always going and it never slows down. I'm not talking about the action that makes the movie more quick past, no I'm talking about the movie characters and it's sense of atmosphere of intense and quick reaction and that got my interested from start till finish, and that's brilliant film making by Client Eastwood.Now for the controversy of this movie: 2014 was the year for controversy and yet it's pretty pointless to start a controversy for this movie over a American hero who may have do some wrong things, but who hasn't in a war zone. The people who started the controversy is only advertising the movie more, I mean just look at the The Interview and how much people sawed that by all the controversy and almost the start of World War 3. The controversy for this movie is by Chris Kyle actions towards Muslims and how the movie adversest him has a perfect war hero, and that's just ridiculous to get all bitchy about. Chris Kyle probably did some bad things in the battlefield but he also did some good things that saved many solders lives. To those who's criticizing Chris is only adverting the movie more and everybody is going to watch the movie and you going to get a lot of hate for saying that.Now for problems: The films editing seem to past some important scenes in the movie and I'm not going to say what scenes I mean if I do then I must spoil some scenes. And that's it for problems.American Sniper is a excellent war movie that shows how brutal war is and how it can effect on people.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Solid, moving Iraq War stuff, a bit by the book but well done","American Sniper (2014)1) For those familiar with the military culture in the U.S. this will offer some familiar insights into how families deal with their servicemen overseas.2) For those who know the war in Iraq either directly or through the movies, this will add to a series of rather good movies (though only movies, to be sure) about that tense conflict. It doesn't have the depth of ""The Hurt Locker"" and others, but it's well done, and has real impact.3) For the idea of a sniper, the adulated and reviled rifleman who picks people off on the edges of battle, this movie goes far, and this is probably the unique contribution of the film.4) As a movie, as a construction of scenes and flow of narrative ideas, it's good, very good, but nothing beyond the normally well made movies that Clint Eastwood (the director) and many others with professional backing manage to pull off. It's not easy, but it's stuck a bit in its methods, the movie-making protocols.I number these because everyone has strong opinions about the content of this movie (and to an extent the director with his well known conservative politics). I don't know what to make of it in a larger context because I'm not an Eastwood fan outside of his movies, and I'm not in favor of what happened in Iraq. Politically. However, once you send our young men and women into a war zone, you have to understand the war for what it is, not for what it might have been if it wasn't. Obviously.The revelation of this movie is that it makes clear what it is to be in this troubled situation EVEN IF you were all for it. The leading character, the sniper, played with astonishing realism by Bradley Cooper, has to be all kinds of things to satisfy himself. This is a movie about a man who has something to prove, but also a duty to perform. His personal life, his marriage, his role as a father, is all compromised by this duty to do something he thinks he has to. And he does extremely well.Whatever you think of the politics (or whatever you call them) that go with the release of the movie, it's still a really conventional story, well told. There are no creative leaps, no unexpected insights, nothing to make it go outside that old box people talk about. So enjoy it for what is is, thoroughly.

Iraqis were ""savages"". 150 confirmed deaths presented as a game score. Funnily enough the most prominent death: that of our protagonist gets no time at all.This could / should have been the Deer Hunter of our time but didn't even deliver the Post Traumatic War syndrome message meaningfully.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Generic, Ordinary, and Guessable On Top Of Being Racist","Whether it be the political, racist, or factual debate, most of us probably have not been able to check into our go-to news websites or scroll through our Facebook newsfeeds without hearing opinions being thrown around about American Sniper. I used to love seeing conversation surface around movies, it means the cinema still has the magic to strike a nerve with audience and evoke strong opinions. With movies like Gone Girl, which prompted a conversation between feminist and misogynist interpretations, it is okay because no one was hurt by it. That is not the case with American Sniper. Seeing responses to this film is probably the closest comparison we will get as to what modern audiences would say if ""Birth of a Nation"" were newly released in the modern day.American Sniper's hideous ideology is not easy to accept for open-minded individuals, considering Chris Kyle conducts himself in a sexist manner, rejects any notions of thinking in a larger way, and is flat-out racist against Iraquis, often referring to their race of people as ""savages"" and ""scum"". The racism inflates each time a line of dialogue is spoken through Bradley Cooper's mouth; you will wince and wish you were watching a different movie. For a Hollywood film to come out so firm with a political and ideological stance is almost as alarming as the racist slurs themselves. The screenplay does not look to criticize or question this aspect of Chris Kyle's personality. Instead it praises him and hold him up as a hero. Yes, this is the probably the only modern-day film that will label someone a hero who is verbally explicit in his bigotry and racism.American Sniper bizarrely boasts its bigotry as patriotism, which is not only disturbing but worrisome. The problem with this aspect of the film is the ugliness that Kyle's ideas of the divide between the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is encouraging ultra-conservative and zealous patriots to continue using a racist characterization of Iraqis, and if one does not reinforce Kyle's ideology, they are not patriotic. But being uncomfortable, or at least acknowledging, that Chris Kyle had a very dense view of the world and was very racist on many occasions does not equate to anti-military views. I think most everyone would agree that we would not even be having these debates about a movie if it were not for the troops who have defended our country. My grandfather served in the Korean war, so this is not me being, as I've been accused, ""a crazy, America-hating liberal."" I am a liberal who hates that a film ties racism to a heroic image, and that the film breaking records at the box office. (Phrases used in tweets praising American Sniper like ""sand-n*gger"" have shaken me to my core.)In addition to the ideology/social impacts of the film, I cannot say that, as a movie, it should be held up as one of the achievements of 2014. I have found this fitting phrase in describing it: a ""knockoff Bigelow film."" American Sniper attempts to be like The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty; it wants to be like Kathryn Bigelow's films like an elementary child imitates the actions of a junior high teenager in attempts to be ""cool"". But like that child, American Sniper just looks silly in its failed attempts.The cinematography is muddy and not very pleasant to look at, unlike those other films. The film editing, though among of the film's better attributes, is looser and less precise than both war films above. And the ""emotional impact"" is the horridly fabricated in this film. Not only is American Sniper ineffective in clawing at my heart but actually produces an opposite effect where, because of the terrible dialogue and a horrendous Sienna Miller, the scenes where we see Chris Kyle at home with his wife and family are laughable and cheaply melodramatic.Clint Eastwood's directing of American Sniper is also quite linear. There are no inflections of the story or shades of the protagonist, just a paved-over, flat line of scenes strung together with little human feeling involved. His directing and the overall film are saved from being downright loathsome by the tense action scenes where Eastwood manipulates the audience into those with great suspense and anticipation. My favorite aspect of American Sniper was the straining, articulate sound design, but that's no reason to sit through a film as long and abysmal as this one. If I were recommending movies based on sound quality alone, you better pencil in Transformers: Age of Extinction after your screening of American Sniper.Bradley Cooper received his third acting nomination from the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts, and Sciences without any precursor nominations from critics or other major award shows, which almost never happens. Cooper has been on a roll lately, giving two great performances directed by actor-friendly director David O. Russell. But here, I feel bit fatigued by his nomination. Cooper is fine as Chris Kyle, but does not warrant an ample amount laudable acclaim. Most of what Cooper is trying to covey as an actor is suffocated by Eastwood and the screenplay's straightforward, dense, machismo portrait of who Kyle was. Cooper seems to be doing something inside grey-space but you'd never be able to know because his vision is not appreciated by the creative team behind him.For military families and fans of the war genre, this will probably tickle your senses in the best ways, but for everyone may be offended by the content...most likely in more ways than one. American Sniper is the generic, ordinary, and guessable war film you would hope it would not be. Heck, even Lone Survivor, which is a B-movie at best, took more daring artistic choices last year than American Sniper does this year.Grade: C-",,Anonymous,Biography
The hyper political society...........,"I am retired US Navy. I am in the large majority of sailors that did not ""see"" combat. However I did 2 Persian Gulf deployments aboard a carrier and a one year ground deployment in Kuwait.This story is what it is. To hyper politicize it is very disgusting in my humble opinion.Those on the left are generating all kinds of hate towards Chris Kyle calling this story propaganda. Some of the far left are parroting hearsay about how Kyle was ""redneck"", racist, went on killing sprees, described the enemy as savages, and took out Hurricane Katrina Victims. The left constantly cries out that President Obama got Osama Bin Laden. Obama and Biden routinely remind us of that. The ironic thing is that the Navy SEALs were the ones who killed him.Those on the right are pretty much in lockstep with the book and this movie. Talk radio constantly reveres the Chris Kyle story. Fox News constantly has Taya Kyle on the air and constantly airs Chris Kyle interviews prior to his death 2 years ago.I'm here to take a neutral and apolitical stance. War is hell. Did we ""need"" to go into Iraq? There is no correct answer to that question. We did it, Chris Kyle believed in our mission, followed lawful orders, defeated the enemy with his sniper rifle, excelled at it, and saved American lives. He made the hard but correct choice to return to his family at the expense of his stellar Navy career.I personally believe that this kind of story does need to be told and do need to be based on actual events. However, I have very mixed feelings about the actual Navy SEALs putting themselves in a ""glamorous"" and public eye so soon after their service with books and movies. I do think it is possible that some of it is ego, some of it is hyper political, some of it is for personal or financial gain.I think that the active duty SEALs still out there carrying out missions unbeknownst to us do so with the thought of completing the mission by destroying the enemy with the utmost precision and intensity, return home with all their shipmates, hug their wives and kids, then turn around and do it all over again. These guys do not say ""Look at me, I'm a Navy SEAL."" The general public cannot nitpick the specifics of the Chris Kyle story. I as a retired sailor cannot nitpick his particular story. Only Chris Kyle and God must reconcile the events that took place.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very moving film,"I have a husband and father with PTSD from combat and found this film (with all its little inaccuracies that other reviewers insist on pointing out) a window into their experience, that they can never tell me about. I didn't focus on what was credible or not, just the emotional intensity of the tours and the readjustment back to family life. Whether or not Kyle's views where accurate didn't taint that he was doing the best he knew how with the information he had. I can agree that America is manipulated by the government/media and they used this influence at 9/11 to start a war, but that was not what this movie was about IMHO. It was about family... and specifically, a soldier's family. I love my husband, and feel so separated from him at times because I can not understand. Thank you Clint Eastward for showing all that see this film a tiny glimpse of what our Guys are living and maybe the why they live through it too. Their sacrifices are not in vain if they believe they are doing the right thing (on all sides).Judge not; lest ye be judged Matt 7:1Isaiah 33:22 For the Lord is our judge,the Lord is our lawgiver,the Lord is our king;it is he who will save us.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not bad,"I was really looking forward to this but when I saw it it was a little long winded and boring.I couldn't understand a word Bradley Cooper was saying, his accent was so strong and it was like he was mumbling (Like Brando mumbles) but Brad Cooper is not in Brandos league so not as accepting as if it was Brando mumbling.There were some interesting themes presented but nothing fully developed. Story was confusing with soldiers and terrorists all looking the same.Didn't focus on Kyle being a sniper that much somewhat more on family man but neither themes were fully developed and only touched the surface.Overall an average effort by Clint Eastwood.

"Tight, Elegant, Combat Scenes","A story of the highly talented Seal Sniper Chris Kyle. This film avoids the complications of the political reasons America occupied Iraq. In its place, we follow the personal motivations of a young man who enjoys physical activity as a cowboy rodeo rider. His personal morality is summed up in just a few sentences: Don't be a bully. Don't be a victim. Be the protector that eliminates the bully. And so it logically follows that as a SEAL sniper he can practice what he preaches.Kyle protects fellow Marines as they enter a war zone and do house to house searches. He has no qualms about killing anyone who is in the area to do harm to the Marines; and this includes women and children. While the viewer may blanch at the thought of killing children; please remember that these children are armed and used to destroy Marines in various ways. So far so good.We follow Chris Kyle into his family life. Director Eastwood keeps the focus on the protagonist's Post Traumatic Stress. And Eastwood uses manipulative symbols to place the viewer in the shoes of Chris Kyle. Thus, I left the theater with a mild case of Post Traumatic Stress. Someone on the elevator said, ""What is that, there?"" and I freaked. I was still 'in the movie'; I was still in the war zone. When a movie does this to you, place you in the protagonist's position, it has elevated itself to a remarkable movie. I now understand Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. This movie is not entertainment. Rather, it is a journey in another person's life.This movie has its references to the American Flag, yet it does not explore reasons why we are occupying other countries. It seems that American values such as the freedom to speak freely, to make personal decisions about religious choices; to make occupational career decisions freely; are enough justification to feel good about America.Kyle is pictured as an honored legend, a protector of soldiers. He is not referred to as a ""hero"" in the movie. Certainly to volunteer for combat means he is placing his emotional life in the balance. And this movie follows him and displays the consequences of Post Combat Stress Syndrome. This means his memory will not let go of the combat environment which he has been in when he ""comes home"".I have read many of the bad reviews of this movie. It seems that most of them are a personal try at propaganda making, exaggerated, emotional statements that roam from political views to moral views. These people simply damn Kyle for being a sniper. Yet, in Kyle's view, his conscious is clear. He is on a side, and he protects the soldiers of the side he is on. He does not return to the U.S. in any way confused as to his loyalties.The elegance of these scenes has to do with Eastwood's direction and timing. He manipulates the viewer to live the stress, the wonder of combat in a sandstorm. Every scene follows logically and flows.Is the movie simply a recruiting vehicle for the Navy? My answer is no. It shows the real life consequences for volunteering for war duty. To be propaganda, we would have to be placed in a state wherein we are making machine decisions using our emotions while the underlying facts are twisted. Since there is a great deal of discussion on IMDb, this discussion will make you ""immune to propaganda"" before you see the film. Discussion and free speech is what disables the propaganda machine. You won't be volunteering for duty tomorrow, or next week like a robot.Is the movie true? Probably. The scenes are mostly ordinary incidents which are intensified by the fact that combat happened somewhere, sometime. You will follow Kyle's journey. This movie is not a Rambo movie. Kyle is never pictured making over the top advances towards the enemy. I recommend you see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tragic and tense film.,This movie is focused on the daily life of an ameican sniper in mission in Iraq . We can see the calm arround the sniper who is contrasted by the chaos of war scenes.

How mad we are?,"I know this movie supposed to be a biographical movie and in some way it was, but I kind a felt it was missing something even though this movie was made about rather young man.This movie was made in kind a regular way, you know, Hollywood has it's own style and this movie wasn't revolutionary . I don't say it is bad, but it is also nothing special and sometimes even makes everything too predictable.However I have to admit that I found this movie very watchable and I watched it from very beginning till the end and my view was more or less concentrated on the screen. So it means that there were quite some action scenes which make my blood pump quicker and also many scenes which made my heart feel sad and made me thoughtful. And if you are looking for a movie which will boost your wellness then this is not one of those.This movie for sure will leave you with more question than answers.

This Major Misfire is Off-Target and Overrated,"Synopsis: A good guy goes on a 10 year killing spree in which bad men, women and children ""make his day"" while a nation rejoices.Verdict: I'm afraid my expectations were far too high going into this. First, the reviews were too good to be true. Second, Eastwood has excelled at handling violence and the impact on men in Unforgiven, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. He's also managed to portray both sides of a conflict fairly. American Sniper fails to do any of that. It is a very simplistic film that moves from scene to scene propelled by cliché and jingoism. Thus, it seems like it was made-for-TV.Sienna Miller - why are people praising her performance? The only thing she's done here is an average job, which I guess is a huge step up for her. Bradley Cooper does a fine job, I thought. Eastwood completely bungles the ending with an awkward - almost absurd - scene followed by news reel footage that feels tacked on.People have claimed that Chris Kyle was no hero. That is unfortunate, but what ""hero"" is perfect? Somewhere out there is a far better, more balanced film waiting to be made - perhaps a documentary. This is NOT that film - nor is it as good as other sniper cinema, such as Enemy at the Gates, or even Sniper. American Sniper is my choice for the most overrated film of 2014.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something special,"A two-word title with the first word being 'American' is a common appellation for a Hollywood movie - think ""American Graffiti"", ""American Beauty"", ""American Gangster"" and most recently ""American Hustle"". In this case, the real-life eponymous military hero is one of epic achievement and reputation. Chris Kyle was a Texan cowboy who became a Navy SEAL and served no less than four tours in Iraq as a sniper credited with 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probable kills. As a result, he has been proclaimed the most lethal sniper in US military history and awarded five Bronze Stars and two Silver Stars.Kyle's story - based on his autobiography - is in safe hands with 84 year old Clint Eastwood. This is a director who knows how to portray war, having even made two films about the Second World War battle for Iwo Jima, and as cinema this is a stunning work. From a tense opening which involves a split-second life-or-death decision, the movie never lets you go. The repeated tours, with frightening stake-outs and terrifying shoot- outs, represent a visceral experience for the viewer. I saw ""American Sniper"" on an IMAX screen and the huge images and brilliant sound made me feel as if I was there.As Chris Kyle, Bradley Cooper, who has beefed up big time and keeps his emotions tight, looks and sounds a world away from his normal-bodied, emotionally-expressive roles such as in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" or the previously-mentioned ""American Hustle"". This is truly a powerful performance. As his wife Taya, British actress Sienna Miller, normally seen as a blonde, also looks and sounds very different from the days of ""Layer Cake"". Other support roles are well-cast, although the naturalistic dialogue is not always intelligible.""American Sniper"" is ""The Hurt Locker"" meets ""Black Hawk Down"" with narrative elements (a conflict between snipers) from ""Enemy At The Gates"". If it is magnificent as an action movie, it lacks psychological and political subtlety. Director Clint Eastwood and writer Jason Hall present Kyle (known to the marines as ""The Legend"") in uncritical, almost mythic, terms and there is virtually no context to the war. But, when the credits roll up silently, you will feel that you have seen something special.",,Anonymous,Biography

One of the better biographical movies out there,"Now I quite enjoyed this movie I would have given it an 8 but I thought the fact that Clint Eastwood used very obvious fake babies was too much, completely ruined the immersion for me, though this is not the only reason.Plot: I don't spoil movies for myself so I had no idea about the buzz that you see in the media which spoils it for you. That said the presentation of the Al Qaeda make it all too obvious who would be taken out, it would have been much more interesting to have a briefing about 10-12 Al Qaeda leaders and then show some of them being taken out. I thought there were some pacing issues, too much back and forth between home and Iraq, some of it would have been better off if it was blended because there is a little bit too much repetition this way. It is an emotional issue but a director with a little bit more rigor would have shown us the last scene(instead of just texting it to us), that had potential for groovy empty feeling.Directing: Clint Eastwood can't get off the wide shots sometimes, there are many cases where he sets up a good wide angle and then just leaves it at that which doesn't help the viewer associate with the characters. Smarter camera work would have helped us feel the casualties as a greater loss.Acting: All around okay, nothing noticeably terrible I think but nothing off the charts either.I don't know what people are so riled up about, this movie isn't about politics, its about a guy, I thought as far as telling the story well they did right by their politics. I'm sure plenty of pro war people watch the anti war films and love them but now that there's a more pro war movie it seems leftists don't show the same open mindedness.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well made, quintessential 21st century war film that doesn't go deep enough","Stories of American soldiers — their bravery in the field, their struggles to return to civilian life — have been well documented by Hollywood. The first thing to think about, therefore, is what makes each a necessary or unique story to tell. ""American Sniper"" tells of the life and years of service of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL sniper who killed more enemies than any soldier in U.S. military history during his four tours in Iraq.Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was a Texas cowboy who at the age of 25 felt he could be of value serving his country and became a Navy SEAL. While in Iraq, Kyle was primarily tasked with protecting ground units from threats they couldn't see, meaning many of the people he killed were in a position to take the lives of American soldiers. Before he finally finished serving, his reputation as a legend proceeded him.That, in essence, is what makes ""American Sniper"" different from other 21st century war films. The other elements of his story make him just another soldier: a man who was willing to put his life on the line for his country, left his wife (Sienna Miller) and two kids for months on end to do it and wrestled with the side effects of post-traumatic stress disorder when he was home and after he quit. The film soundly and movingly depicts the life of this consummate soldier, but it glosses over the story's defining characteristic — that its main character is both a beloved hero and an elite killer.As a blue-blooded patriot, Clint Eastwood is both the perfect and maybe even the wrong choice for this film. Eastwood certainly shows us why he's been a good director for so long, in some ways reminding us after his recent string of critical duds. Yet he (and admittedly screenwriter Jason Hall, who adapted Kyle's memoir) evades a certain level of depth when it comes to the themes and issues this story presents. The film doesn't ignore PTSD and the hurtful effects that military life can have on a family, nor does it silence the point of view that war, specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom, is inherently controversial, but it does limit their influence on the film's message.Hall's screenplay walks the line when it comes to opinions on war. Put a Southern, conservative, God-fearing patriot in the same theater as an urban, liberal, agnostic and one might tell you ""American Sniper"" is an amazing, truly American film that honors those who rid the world of evil to keep America safe, while the other might say it casts an uncomfortable shadow of doubt over war as it relates to American values. A third person might even tell you it's nothing short of propaganda.Although it doesn't pick sides on war, ""American Sniper"" does choose to portray Chris Kyle as a hero, and therein lies the controversy. Not that Kyle wasn't a brave and good person, but that he's a hero for his actions. On one hand, while working closely with Kyle, his friends and family, filmmakers do not want to create something that would in any way be disrespectful to them. On the other, certain aspects of his story are conspicuously under-developed, with the emphasis on the action and suspense of the military action he saw.To avoid delving too far into it, I'll simply say that never before has a movie's credits sequence informed its message to the extent that ""American Sniper's"" does. It honestly complicates the movie, what the takeaways are supposed to be, and highlights a lot of the gaps in the storytelling, primarily how what we see in the Iraq scenes translates into the ""legend"" of Chris Kyle at home. The script merely hopes that lots of characters telling Kyle how they've heard this and that about him will convey the truth of it to the audience. Nothing that we see truly confirms how incredible of a soldier Kyle was.To go back to the surface layers, ""American Sniper"" holds interest and suspense extremely well. Eastwood's technique doesn't compare with the way Kathryn Bigelow powerfully portrayed soldiers in the Middle East in ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" but the level of intensity in both the action sequences and in the way Kyle struggles at home exhibit excellent craftsmanship. And neither is it dumbed down — Hall creates some sharp dialogue and plenty of humanizing, touching moments.Cooper is probably the best thing about the movie. Sporting a legit Texas accent and bulking up to look almost exactly like Kyle, he definitely shows his versatility. Most of his previous roles have showcased charm or paranoia; here he plays a realistic, humble action hero of sorts. In the non-action scenes, he could colors the Texan stereotypes with a complex psychological portrait.""American Sniper"" captures the essence of the contemporary war story in a way that allows contrary opinions to coexist, but it doesn't answer the question, ""why Chris Kyle?"" His story is compelling, probably more compelling than most, but ""American Sniper"" doesn't feel like the story of ""the deadliest sniper in U.S. history"" so much as the story of ""a dedicated, courageous soldier who happens to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

Dramatization of the deadliest sniper in US history,"It's easy to romanticize about soldiers, but snipers have their own unique and alluring shroud of mystique. Any gamer can tell you how cool it is to play Call of Duty and be the hotshot camping out on some rooftop picking off bad guys all day long. In films, you can look at Enemy at the Gates or Barry Pepper's character in Saving Private Ryan and marvel at a sniper's deadly prowess. Far be it for me to comment on what experiences soldiers of any kind go through, I have no doubt that the reality of being a sniper is nowhere near as glamorous as the media makes it out to be; it's a burdensome duty in which one has to take lives indiscriminately in order to save lives. I can't even imagine the stress of having to evaluate who lives and who dies - to include women and children - in the heat of the moment.The deadliest marksman in US history - Chris Kyle - is the focus of this film: the real-life Navy SEAL who served four tours of duty in the Iraq war. The movie tracks his career across all four tours, with occasional breaks where he reunites with his wife and has difficulty adjusting to civilian life. Thus, the film dishes out two different conflicts: the fight against al-Qaeda on one hand, and the struggle to adjust to life after war on the other hand. Both narrative strands offer their share of compelling scenes; the combat is quite intense and harrowing, while the family drama emphasizes stress and emotion aptly. Together, it's a consistently-engaging experience that will truly underscore the intensity of war, and the hardship of overcoming post-traumatic stress.I have no idea how close the film adapts real-life events, but a few contrivances can be spotted easily. It is quite the black-and-white film that glosses over the complexities of the war. I almost pegged it as a pro-war movie, until the last act started to emphasize the futility of the war effort and illustrate the hardships of veterans. The film does outright refer to Iraqis as ""savage;"" it's probably meant to label the regime rather than the entire country or culture, but it can be taken the wrong way easily. There are strands of jingoism that will rub some viewers the wrong way.All that being said, I was personally enamored by the characters; I found them easy to follow and relate to, and it made their journey in and out of war a compelling one. The film sets up an actual villain sniper that Chris has to take down; I don't know if this was invented for the movie or what, but I thoroughly enjoyed the sniper-vs-sniper plot. The film has its fair share of messages; on one hand, the film does emphasize the ""this is why we fight"" message, but on the other it digresses into the physical, emotional, and psychological damage on the characters and their families. These aren't subtle themes at all, but I felt the two together formed a point and counterpoint that keeps the film rather well-rounded.This film uses good-looking photography and punchy editing. Bradley Cooper is excellent as the main character, and the other actors aren't too bad either. Writing is okay. All the sets, props, and costumes look authentic and creditable. Special effects are sparingly used, and mostly okay. Sound design is superb. Music is okay.American Sniper is for snipers what The Hurt Locker is for guys who defuse bombs. I favor American Sniper more though, because it doesn't have nearly as many stupid parts as The Hurt Locker, and Chris Kyle is a far more compelling character. The character is ultimately what makes the film most watchable, and with quality acting, it is well worth seeing.4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining war movie,"Entertaining war movie.The story of Chris Kyle, the greatest sniper (in terms of confirmed kills) in US military history. 160 kills in four tours of Iraq.While the war and action scenes are great, the human side seems rather superficial. Director Clint Eastwood tries to make a theme out his struggle between duty and having to kill people (and what war is doing to him and how he relates to his family and other non- combatants) but this is not explored very well. The movie is uneven in that we have intense war scenes followed by back-home scenes which should be emotional but lack depth.Eastwood used to be a master at human drama and deft manipulation of viewers' emotions (see Million Dollar Baby, as a very good example), but here he seems to have lost his touch. Instead he opts for a more bombastic, action-filled approach.The other issue with the movie would be the accuracy of it. By many accounts some of the details are not accurate. The faults lie mainly with some of the lesser details, which have been dramatized for cinema.This all said, while not a brilliant, or multi-layered, movie, American Sniper is a fairly good war movie. It does also raise the thought of what war does to those who fight in it, even (or maybe particularly...) when they are incredibly good at their part in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good film, unfairly judged.","Having not read American Sniper the book, I have to take this film at face value and I have found it to be a good film which is being unfairly hounded in the media and even on here on IMDb.I have seen in many outlets this film is being slated as over-the-top pro American, anti-Muslim and as glorifying the war and depicting all Iraqis as terrorists. I think this is a very harsh judgment. There are elements of that (not nearly as bad as I was lead to believe) but we must remember that we are telling one man's true story here. If these are his experiences and those are his views then it is not unreasonable to depict them.From the criticism I had heard before seeing this movie, I was half expecting a Die Hard style film where Cooper kills all the bad guys while shouting some bad a** catch phrase and saving the day. Instead it shows a sniper who (to me) seemed to take no glory in killing or his title as America's most lethal sniper. He has a simple pride that he was doing his job well and that every life he took meant saving the life of at least one of his fellow soldiers.Having not read the book, I can't say if Clint Eastwood was being unfairly selective in what he chose to include in the movie, but if this is how it happened, who are we to judge? You may not agree with the war itself (I don't) but this is not the place for such debate.The film itself was solid. Bradley Cooper did a great job in becoming Chris Kyle. There were moments of good action, serious drama, and couple of laughs for good measure. There was a good balance between ""action"" in Iraq and life at home showing the family drama and personal struggle while trying to settle back in to normal life.This might not get my vote for the best picture Oscar but it is a good movie that does not deserve all the negative press it is getting. Ultimately I think people will have to make up their own minds on this one, just don't be swayed by anything you might hear before seeing it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Aim your expectations low,I have never really had any interest in modern day war films especially one's that focus on a single character's story. American Sniper (2014) is exactly that kind of film. The film is based on real life Navy Seal Sniper. Chris Kyle. Before watching this movie I had no idea that it was supposed to be based on a true story.I personally found American Sniper to be a very particular kind of war film. One that is catered more towards Patriotic Americans than it is for a wider audience. I personally know nothing about the US Navy Seals mainly because I'm British. This film is about one American soldier who is pretty much treated like a god because he killed so many people during the war. I appreciate the story the filmmakers were trying to tell of a man who sacrificed a lot for his country and was changed forever by a horrific war. But sadly the film just doesn't come across that way it focuses too much on who has the highest kill count than it does the harsh reality of war on both sides not just the allies side.The acting is fine Bradley Cooper gives a decent performance and the film is definitely well directed by director Clint Eastwood. Sadly this film just didn't interest in the same way as classic war films like Saving Private Ryan. If you have little interest in war movies especially one's that focus more on violence and action than storytelling then I wouldn't recommend watching American Sniper (2014).,3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great, realistic war movie.","The movie content, acting, direction, sound directing, cinematography were all outstanding. Only the Band of Brother mini-series is on the same high level as American Sniper (and American Sniper had only 2-hours instead of 12 episodes). The ""1 star"" or less ratings and the liberal rantings of many posters belie the fact that the story was about a guy who was doing what snipers have always been for and so much needed: protecting the infantry and armor troops of their side from enemy snipers and infantry. Period. Don't bemoan the necessity of it or fill your review with your political axe-grinding. Get over yourself; particularly those lib do-gooders who would have all necessary and difficult undertakings done by anyone but themselves. I was a US Army Ranger in Vietnam 1967-69. SSgt Carlos Hathcock was the best known Marine sniper of that era and there are many a Marine infantrymen who came home because of him. Chris Kyle was the next generation to save US Army and Marine infantrymen.

"The Flaws Are In Clint's Vision, Not Chris Kyle's Life","Most of the positive reviews of this film boil down to ""I love America . . . so I love this movie!"" Most of the negative ones come down to ""America is evil and stupid. Just like this movie!"" As a Desert Storm era Marine veteran who considers himself a liberal, I would like to evaluate this movie in a different way, comparing its strengths and weaknesses to a very similar picture, LONE SURVIVOR, starring Mark Wahlberg and directed by Peter Berg.SNIPER is an effective war movie. It has panoramic scope, epic action sequences, moments of true tension and white-knuckle suspense, and it successfully packs Chris Kyle's four tours in Iraq into one coherent and compelling narrative.The problem is, SNIPER is a Clint Eastwood movie, and the depiction of Chris Kyle is limited by Clint's narrow world view. For Clint Eastwood, being a hero (in fact simply being a man,) is always a matter of going it alone. Every movie he makes is a restatement of this theme, and SNIPER is basically HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER goes to Iraq. There's a town full of no-goods, and a lone stranger rides in to deal with them. Then he leaves. That's not all there is to the movie, of course, but that's the only part Clint Eastwood really likes or understands. Whenever Chris Kyle is bonding with his buddies, or trying to deal with his wife and children, the movie goes flat. Not because the real Chris Kyle didn't care about those things, but because Clint Eastwood doesn't.The vision of lone-wolf courage in SNIPER is very different from the vision of brotherhood and sacrifice in LONE SURVIVOR. Clint Eastwood celebrates ""aggression,"" as if that's all courage comes down to. But you don't have to be a liberal to see how shallow that is. After all, Sonny Corleone in THE GODFATHER had plenty of aggression.The Navy SEALS in LONE SURVIVOR have aggression, but they also have discipline and teamwork. And they have each other. Clint Eastwood totally does not get that. The sidekicks he gives Chris Kyle are mere cardboard cutouts. (Like his wife and their rubber baby.) They're only there for Chris Kyle to save. But the SEALS in LONE SURVIOVR are true equals, a band of brothers. When they're joking around they come across more like the Beatles in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT than like lone wolves filled with aggression. What they are called upon to endure is truly the ultimate ""hard day's night."" The story's tragedy is that they can't save each other from death. But the everlasting triumph of the story is that they do something more important. They save each other from making the wrong choices, from being dehumanized by war.When you watch LONE SURVIVOR, the enduring image of courage is Lieutenant Mike Murphy (played by Taylor Kitsch) climbing to the top of the hill to call for help for his wounded men. He's willing to die because he loves them more than himself. Notice that he's not fighting at this moment. He's not even armed. He's making a sacrifice. That's what courage is, not ""aggression."" You don't need weapons to be a hero. All you need is love.Again, let me be clear. I know that the real Chris Kyle would understand this, and would have behaved the same under the same circumstances. But that's not the story Clint Eastwood wants to tell. He doesn't want a band of brothers, a team of men who laugh and cry and are ready to die *for each other*. He wants Dirty Harry. He wants a lone wolf who feels nothing but contempt for the ""sheep"" he protects.There were some liberals who chose to hate on LONE SURVIVOR, but on the whole I think it was a movie that was easier for us to respect and understand. Because the themes of love and brotherhood and sacrifice far outweigh the killing. American SNIPER paints the opposite picture. For Clint the guns and the violence are glorious in themselves. And he doesn't see how self-destructive that really is, not even when Chris Kyle is going to the gun range for the final time.Clint Eastwood thinks he's glorifying Chris Kyle by making guns the center of his life. He doesn't understand that he's actually oversimplifying the character, and retelling a story the Beatles already told. It's not a story of brotherhood, like LONE SURVIVOR or A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. It's the story of Rocky Raccoon!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotionally complex and also filled with compelling action,"I'm just going to start off with saying that ""American Sniper"" is not going to be the movie I'm cheering for when it comes to the 87th Academy awards, but that in no way means that this is a bad movie. When it comes to the acting, it's truly excellent. When it comes to the drama, it's also very good. The action is compelling and the story very interesting. If the title worries you (as it did for my very Canadian butt) don't worry about it because this is in no way a jingoistic pro-war, kill all Arabs movie. Actually I found the film to be profoundly intelligent in the way it handles the wartime events portrayed in the life of the main character.Based on the book ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History"" by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the titular ""American Sniper"" with Sienna Miller playing his wife Taya Renae Kyle. The plot, it's mostly self explanatory, but concerns for the most part the reason why Chris Kyle decides to go into the U.S. war, how he deals with his job, which is nothing but killing people, and how it affects his life back at home.Out of this Clint Eastwood effort, the thing that stands out the most for me at least, is the way that it has several elements that remind me of a western as much as a war film. You don't become the most lethal sniper in the U.S. Military without getting a lot of attention. In the way that the people in the story responded to the presence of Kyle (I'm talking about the character in the movie now) it reminded me of so many sharpshooting lone gunslingers I've seen in films set before the west was won. The man becomes notable because of his own skills, sure, but it's the way the people around him perpetuate the accomplishments that turns him into a legend. There's a mix of pride in being so highly regarded, but also an enormous amount of pressure. Thanks to Bradley Cooper's performance, I felt like I could truly feel the weight being dumped on the man's shoulders as he pulled the trigger again and again. If a regular guy misses a shot, it's not a big deal, but can you imagine if the guy you've heard hushed whispers about missed, how disappointed you would be to hear that? You'd cover it up and perpetuate the myth, and then it would become a self-fulfilling truth that the guy is the deadliest sniper ever. Additionally, if I may quote ""Predator"" for a second, ""If it bleeds, we can kill it"". I would think that becoming such a great sharpshooter might go to your head and that you would think yourself invincible, at least a little bit. If you miss though, not only would you recognize yourself as a regular guy, but the people that you've been intimidating with your legend, they would recognize that you're just human and that you can be quite easily (and in a most demoralizing way) be taken out.These ideas fascinated me. How much pressure can a normal man that's being asked to perform like a god take, particularly when there are any number of people gunning for him to fail, and a lot looking to take him down to raise themselves to that Olympian status? The other element of the movie that I really liked plays hand-in-hand with this wester/legendary gunman idea. It's the portions of the film where the story is not set on foreign soil or on the battlefield, but at home where Chris has to try and readjust to normal life. I was surprised to see that as much as this film shows in great detail what happens on the battlefield, it also takes the time to show the consequences of this in normal life. Chris is not OK when he returns home because no human being should be asked to take that many human lives. The film deals heavily with post-traumatic stress and how pulling a gunshot does not end when you pull the trigger. His job isn't like a normal soldier's job where they are shooting people right in front of them, people that pose an immediate threat. For the most part he's very far from where the action actually is and he's picking people off in a very matter-of-fact manner. That has a heavy emotional toll on a person and I felt it.What sold the movie for me was Bradley Cooper's performance. He is completely genuine in it and helps make all of the complex themes and emotions tangible. He also handles himself very well in the action sequences (I guess doing ""The A-Team"" was good for something) and I felt like there was some good, and complex chemistry going on between him and Sienna Miller. I can see why this film was nominated for so many academy awards, and I'd say when it comes to several of them (best actor and best adapted screenplay for example) the praise is fully justified. Best picture though? I don't know about that. It's not a big issue though. They can't all be ""the best movie"" and I think this is an intelligent movie that you will enjoy, I certainly did and not only because of the really intense action scenes. I was very impressed by how much emotion and how many complex themes were present. If you're worried that this is going to be some cheap piece of propaganda disguised as a film, that's not the case; ""American Sniper"" is a great movie.

Another Fine War Drama from Eastwood - American Sniper,"Clint Eastwood knows how to make good films AND he gets them done right. A lot of other producer/directors know what it takes to produce a good film, but are not willing to do what it takes to get that finished product just right. This tale of Iraq is the best war film of that era since Hurt Locker. The constant movement from the battlefield to the home front is far more effective than a letter from home. As a soldier, I knew men who couldnt wait to get back home, and then, when they were home, they couldnt wait to get back into action. This man falls into that category. I love the analogy of sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs; I will steal that sometime in the future to lecture my kid. A really good war film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Great film, don't listen to the idiots who say otherwise",I really enjoyed the film was great film. I was glad to see last year that they were going to being making a movie and didn't exactly know what I'd think of it but it was great very heart warming and just shows what kind of ordeals are troops face over there. Its sad to see these people comparing it to a Nazi film it pisses me off there's no comparison first of that was a Nazi the Nazis were horrible people this Is an American solider who's fighting terrorist. Nazis murdered Jews killed Americans and are Allies Chris Kyle was killing terrorist so anyone who states otherwise is a fool and doesn't deserve to live in this country are troops are what keep us safe and put their lives on the line just to have cowards bad mouth them on here. If you've got such a problem with are troops leave go to some Muslim country see how safe you are there.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The best war movies are always harrowing. American Sniper is this and more- an exploration of humanity, masculinity, and potentially, our downfall","There's a certain bleakness about war for me. That we, as people, are driven to kill each other on the battlefield, again and again. And again. Being born into a relatively blessed time, decades since any major conflict that would have involved me had I been alive, it's still surreal to imagine that to wage war is inexorably human. That for the longest time, men have been driven to kill other men, for kin or country.In talking about sheep, wolves and sheepdogs, The American Sniper paints a picture of why some men choose to engage in war. To fight the good fight. To stick up for those who can't stick up for themselves. And in someway i felt like it insinuated- to lose that belief, that drive to 'fight the good fight' is to let yourself die in the heat of battle. But how could you not second guess what you were doing, if it involved killing children, destroying homes, invading another person's land, their land for millennia? I'm always struck by the irony that, to be a war hero means to be incredibly good at killing other people, efficiently, effectively.Bradley Cooper paints an enthralling portrait of the archetypical American hero- the sheep dog, tough guy, with his southern gentleman-ly manners and undeniably human morality. Perhaps what i don't think it does is capture the humanity of the Iraqis. Save one example, we don't come across any Iraqi civilian who's not out to get Americans. Perhaps showing the human side of Iraqi life wasn't an aim of the film. But i do think it treaded the border between aggrandising the heroism of war and shuddering at it's wretchedness very finely.Overall a great film to start 2015, and likely realistic- but very much a patriotic representation of an American war hero- that perhaps misses detail on the other side of life in war.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

American Sniper ? More like ' Big budget shoot fest ',"Well this movie put me into one hell of a roller coaster ride not because it was good at all times but because there were lots of downs in the plot , more than i had expected from a Clint Eastwood movie. First thing off the bat , this movie was shot with realism in mind , this by far is one the most realistic ground to earth biopic military cinema I have watched in a long time. The protagonist isn't hailed too much , he is put into the right stance , in the right situation with the right depth. The use of a steady camera for an action movie like this something that is really good looking at how action movie nowadays have evolved ( ahem end of watch ). What really pisses me off in this movie is the plot and character progression , and in this review i guess i would be pointing out more of the negatives than the positives because this movie has managed to leave a sour taste in my mouth.1) Casting :- Perfect ! I cannot imagine anyone else who could get into the shoes of the most lethal sniper. He acted well with the script which was provided but felt a bit too dragged on and forced when it came to him acting with his co-star Elsie Robertson who are supposed to be in a relationship. The chemistry felt a bit too pushed and crammed according to me especially when the plot wants to force on the points of family problems in the lives of the seals and marines. Elsie Robertson did a good job too , portraying the life of a woman who lives every minute in a cloud of fear , of becoming a widow. Emotions are seen to hit throughout the charts but as stated previously the overall chemistry amongst them didn't catch out very well which is disappointing looking at how capable the cast and the crew are with their immense talents.2) Direction :- It's Clint Eastwood , the movie is filled with his vibe and energy and his passion for direction is clearly seen here. Irrespective of his age , his hands and mind behind the camera still work brilliantly sever since Unforgiven. The camera shots between and during action scenes fit perfectly into the tense moments. But it is funny how the intense scene from the trailer was the first scene of the movie. As far as the action goes , Clint Nailed it. The sounds were top notch , every sniper with a silencer sounded like a silenced weapon every time Bradley scoped at his target there was a rush of Adrenaline. But in his path of making a realistic military movie Clint failed miserably at depicting the personal like of Kyle. Either he was concentrated on the war aspects or just too lazy , the core of the film was just left out which is a huge backlash.3) Story ( Plot ) :- OK this is where everything in the movie falls apart. I am glad about the fact that Clint stayed true to the source material given to him , in fact the plot is pretty much linear and one dimensional. The story was crying of depth which the script writer Jason Hall just left out in the blue. Following are some of the problems that i faced while and after watching the moviei) Plot Progression :- The movie had a total runtime of 120-130 minutes but wasted it's time on unnecessary aspects like Kyle's cowboy passion and stuff. Instead that time could have been utilized at developing more about Kyle's childhood , his relationship with his brother.ii) Character Progression :- Bradley meets a girl , they hang out , he goes to war and his wife calls him telling she is pregnant . That is quite seriously how the scenes progressed. There was little to no explanation and absolutely no hints of relationship and chemistry , the pregnancy and the relationship was just forced to focus more on the war aspects.iii) Fault in marketing :- The movie was sold to us as an intense sniper action movie with a runtime packed with tense set pieces and heart pounding moments. Let me clarify something . It is nothing like how i described it above. This movie should have been called American Shooter or American Gunman because the movie shows Kyle Sniping for the first 30-35 minutes and last 10 minutes of the movie which is kind of sad especially when the actual sniping in American Sniper is only quarter of the total runtime. Lethal shooter yes , sniper , maybe , but the movie has shown me only a few scenes proving the point, and that opening intense scene in the trailer , that's the only intense sniper scene in the whole movie.I rated this movie an 8 on my first viewing but as I keep thinking about it , the movie keeps going down and down with it's score , the ending , please , the ending was incoherent , loosely left , i get the point that the ending was the way it was described in the source material , but as a part of the movie , the way it was shown , was complete misstep.On a whole this movie is a good time if you are going in for a 2 hour action flick with little to no character development. This movie is something really perfect if you were bored one day , and watched it when you had absolutely nothing to do , after watching hangover part 2 again. The plot is jumbled , though linear was convoluted by the director , the relationships are messy , but overall for the production money put into this , I would say it's a good action movie , not a very good standalone.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"American movie, for American ""hero"" in an American war, what could go wrong?","I was very intrigued with the trailer, mesmerized to say the least. The movie was another thing.When I was the USA I met this Chris, he was no hero. Just a guy with a rifle and a sense that he was right.For most of the patriots there is no room for the idea that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy; ()or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; ()or a complex guy in a bad war who convinced himself he loved killing to cope with an impossible situation; ()or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system that, yes, also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial-killer people to do oppressive things over which they have no control.()Or that Iraqis might be fully realised human beings with complex inner lives who find joy in food and sunshine and family, and anguish in the murders of their children.()Or that you can support your country while thinking critically about its actions and its citizenry.I'm even surprised to see that people vote it ""Best of""...Well what do I know, I'm just an European.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Pop Propaganda,"The War on Terror has been raging on since the seminal moment of this millennium; September 11, 2001, a day that has quite simply changed everything since. No part of our lives has been entirely unaffected, and the fact that this holds true for every American citizen may help to explain the reason for the film's astounding success in its first weekend; just about everyone seeing this film knows exactly the details and events surrounding the conflict which Chris Kyle became known as 'Legend,' which only enhances his stature in most peoples' eyes as a bonafide American hero who risked his life four separate times to fight intense combat in Iraq, often forced to stay behind and cover his fellow SEALs and Marines who were deployed to more dangerous work such as house-to-house searches in war zones for information about al- Qaeda leaders. It is his story that has come to represent the accomplishment, at whatever price, of the early phase of this newfound type of conflict. Whether or not it has been worth the risk remains hotly contested.It should be noted that it is almost impossible to review any film which covers any aspect of the War on Terror without comparing it to Zero Dark Thirty, Katherine Bigelow's masterful account of the ultimate mission for the United States in the Middle East: to hunt down and kill Osama bin-Laden. Chris Kyle himself has said in interviews that he wishes he had been assigned to SEAL Team 6, the team responsible for although he certainly did his share on Team 3 in killing various Iraqi insurgents. Nevertheless, on a filmic level, Clint Eastwood's steady, conventional and even-keeled style seems to underwhelm this material. Here we have the story of a man where the tagline is ""the deadliest sniper in US military history,"" yet the bulk of the story seems to take this description for granted. In contrast to Zero Dark Thirty, the screenplay doesn't get into the specifics or details surrounding the complicated aspects of fighting terrorism on the enemies' home turf and the impact that has on American foreign policy as a whole. Indeed, much of the larger geopolitical themes are muted here in order to focus on the rather repetitive structure of showing Kyle's extraordinary ability to kill from astonishing lengths.Of course, this is a much more focused type of story, but the character of Chris Kyle seems to be an archetype symbolizing American forces instead of a fully-realized individual. He exhibits typical behavior of any deployed soldier regarding guilt about dead soldiers as well as the conflict between needing to remain loyal to his family and his country. These are well-treaded conventions of recent war films, not the least of which is Bigelow's other intensified journey into the mind of the modern solider, The Hurt Locker. Kyle is very similar to Jeremy Renner's devoted and effective soldier who finds himself addicted to any form of combat as a drug, although the true story element does add a different understanding of the effects.This is not to say that the film is made without a certain amount of professionalism and understanding. Bradley Cooper is very effective as Kyle, bulking up without looking too muscular or movie-hunkish. His acting focuses on the details of portraying a patriotic Texan, complete with the slow drawl, affection for beer and rodeo, as well as complete devotion to his wide-mouthed wife and growing family. Cooper's full range as an actor is on display here, complete with the dead-eye stare of a man who has seen horrors impossible to describe and feels an uncontrollable need to try and bring equilibrium to his life. Sienna Miller seems to have relegated herself recently to playing wives of real-life characters, having done so in Foxcatcher and here. She brings a glamorous quality to Taya, portraying her as a loving wife who puts the need for family stability above her husband's inner desire for combat and revenge.It is this revenge element which many critics have leeched upon as evidence of Kyle's racist and jingoist attitude towards Iraqis and other Islamists. Although Eastwood does take a pretty apparent right-leaning view of the conflict, he nevertheless attempts to extricate any sort of moral judgment on Chris Kyle and his importance to the American hero mythology. The point of this story, to whatever effect it may have, is that one man saw himself not necessarily as the savior of freedom and democracy, but simply a soldier who followed the orders to protect fellow soldiers from behind, perched above with a high-powered rifle and an eagle eye. The impact this will have on the upcoming trial for Kyle's alleged murderer will undoubtedly be felt throughout the media. It will be interesting to note the recruiting effect of this movie as well. It's easy to imagine a lot of young men getting hyped for fighting through these images.",,Anonymous,Biography
America to America,"Some believe, or at least write, that this is propaganda, I do not agree entirely. I believe this is glorification, or a celebration of what was a troubled American war veteran, those stories are needed, especially if you see it in the light of Client Eastwood. I think he has made a very well crafted movie (so what you can see a baby doll), this is really a good story, well acted by all involved, very indulging and exciting for the viewer.Maybe it is mostly by America to Americans, it is a very patriotic movie, but also a proud movie about fighting for your country, not giving up on each other, believing and hoping for the best, overcoming fears and having seen and experienced terrible things you can't even begin to imagine or express.Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job in the role of Chris Kyle, he makes it all seem very real, his tours to war and all the things he has to do there, all the things that he experience and just can't leave behind, the things that troubles him and those he keeps bottled up or can't shake and explain. I really felt his dedication to helping others, not leaving anybody behind and being there for your mates and country, and you can really feel how it starts to crumble and become too much, the frustration and the feelings and anger his body can't handle.A though movie, but more in a psychologically sense then in watching what is actually being shown, it is not very bloody, there is a war, but most of the struggles are in his and your mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Virtuosic Filmmaking,"War movies are not my genre of choice. I am a romantic comedy fan. ""American Sniper"" is such an excellently made film that it demanded my full attention and earned my esteem. This is a violent, bloody, war movie with a sad ending. The film is so expertly made I left the theater exhilarated. Such is the power of art.It is astounding that this film was made by a director, Clint Eastwood, who is in his eighties. ""American Sniper"" is fast-paced, gripping, suspenseful, and the most truly contemporary film I've seen in a while. It addresses what we are all thinking about: the West's confrontation with violent Islamists. The film feels as if it was peeled out of our brains during our nightmares. There is no elegiac feeling here. No nostalgia, no backward glances. It is all now, now, now, now, with the forward motion of a locomotive at full tilt. With ""American Sniper,"" Clint Eastwood has outdone himself and set the bar very high.Bradley Cooper is flawless. His commitment is one hundred percent. This is a performance for the ages.""American Sniper"" tells the true story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in US military history. The film depicts him as having been taught to hunt by his father. His father also taught him that there are three kinds of people in the world: wolves, sheep, and shepherds. It is the shepherd's job to defend the sheep from the wolves. Kyle became a rodeo bucking bronco rider.After terrorist attacks, he decided to join the military to defend his country. He was sent to Iraq, where he did four tours of duty. He covered soldiers moving into urban combat zones in cities like Fallujah. He would lie on rooftops, survey surrounding areas, and shoot at suspicious characters, including women and children assigned to bomb troops. Interspersed with his tours in Iraq, Kyle married his wife and fathered two children. After his return to the US, Kyle aided returned veterans who suffered from PTSD.""American Sniper"" follows this story in a completely straightforward, unadorned fashion. You can't help but think of other war films when watching ""American Sniper."" The flamboyant operatics of ""The Deer Hunter,"" the heavy-handed, manipulative, almost propagandistic politics of ""Coming Home,"" the graphic combat of ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""American Sniper""'s style is almost no style. The movie simply meticulously recreates what Kyle did and saw. There is a scene where American soldiers raid the headquarters of The Butcher of Fallujah. There are shelves on which human body parts, including at least one severed head, are stored. The camera does not linger on this hideous and telling sight. The moviegoer sees these body parts for only as long as the soldiers running through the headquarters sees them.There are no White House scenes, no Pentagon scenes, almost no scenes of reporters commenting on the war. There are no lingering shots of gas stations hint hint – petroleum caused this war! One soldier does begin to question; he dies. Kyle attends his funeral. A mourner begins to read a document questioning the wisdom of the Iraq war; she cannot finish. The three-volley gun salute drowns her out.The movie soundtrack begins with an ominous male voice intoning ""Allahu akbar."" Characters who are obviously Arab and Muslim are shown doing very bad things, including one very brief but disturbing scene of a man torturing a child to death in a hideously inventive way, in front of the child's father. American soldiers are shown being dedicated and trying to avoid civilian deaths.Politically correct moviegoers will decide that what is missing from this movie is the heavy hand of an interpreter reaching in and telling you that the war was a mistake, that it was all about petroleum, that the American soldiers were all racists, that the Arabs were merely attempting to defend their homeland from invaders, that truly evil men like the Butcher of Fallujah were the products of failed US foreign policy.I found ""American Sniper""'s minimalism to be an incredibly courageous and innovative stylistic choice. Eastwood must know that every moviegoer enters the theater with his or her own opinion about the Iraq War, about the West v Islam, about terror. We know that Fallujah is now under ISIS control. We know that another war looms.This isn't the viewer's movie. It isn't the politician's movie. It is Chris Kyle's movie. The movie veers wildly from scenes of incredible tension and horror in Iraq. Kyle goes on leave and is back in the US. Suddenly the biggest issue is getting a collie to behave at a family barbecue in Texas. Kyle sits in front of an empty TV screen, reliving Iraqi battles. The film delivers no lecture about PTSD. It just lives Kyle's PTSD with him.""American Sniper"" is a gripping, suspenseful, involving, virtuosic film. I am glad it is getting the Academy-Award nominations and record-setting box office and audience it deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie one can rate on 2 different levels,"As a European, to me it's clear this movie is pure American military propaganda. Celebrating a sniper who shot over 100 people in a country that was invaded under false presumptions. As such the American invading army can never be heroes, they are occupiers shooting people who merely defended their country, like Americans would protect their territory. It's however a big step from defending one's own territory, to invading a foreign country and trying to glorify the people, including military personnel involved in it.On a second level one can watch the movie pure as an action flick. It's well made with some suspenseful scenes and the atmosphere of being in a war is well captured. The character itself isn't that well developed however... yes, he has some doubts when shooting children but there is no much psychological exploration going on here. It's kind of a cliché: man thinks he has bigger things to do being a sniper, than taking care of his pregnant wife.Is the man a hero? Surely one can not be a hero if one invades foreign soil under false pretext and snipes people who are merely defending their territory. But guess the US needed a movie like this, so the can still believe they are the policeman of the world, with plenty of heroes around.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-hyped but still solid stuff,"Talk about poetic license. Having read Chris Kyle's autobiography on his time in the Navy SEALS and his experience as a sniper in the Middle East, there was countless times throughout this picture that I caught myself questioning whether certain things happened and other times I was bemused at just how much screenwriter Jason Hall had adopted the story of Kyle into a more by the numbers hunt for the ""Big Baddie"". While Hall and director Clint Eastwood have meddled with many of Kyle's most central experiences in the war, at its core American Sniper is still an often thrilling and well made (if slightly by the numbers) examination on war and the toll it takes on those within it.A story and subsequently movie tailor made for those with the stars and stripes proudly flying outside their house, American Sniper is an often fascinating look at the burden war takes on an individual and those living with them. Chris Kyle and his dedication to his SEAL brothers and the want to protect them is an amiable ambition that supporters or detractors of the war could only but admire. Kyle was a man that put country first, God second and family third, a somewhat questionable order of life's priorities that endure thanks to Kyle being totally sincere. In Kyle's autobiography it was clear that the man had a deep love and desire to protect his country and that's something Eastwood and Hall get across well whereas something they strangely struggle with is Kyle's actual sniping. A large chunk of Kyle's tale is how he managed to bag 160 plus confirmed kills but here in this movie Kyle's sniper escapades feel like an afterthought. Its clear director and screenwriter thought it best to find another anchor to lay their movie on and you'll see more of Kyle with a machine gun than you'll see sniper battles so it comes with a pre-warning not to expect to many long range cat and mouse battles. With the focus somewhat laid off seeing target after target drop to the ground due to Kyle's keen eye the film finds its soul at the centre of Kyle himself and his relationship with his wife Taya.In a story that seemed open to extract emotion out of the battlefield, American Sniper is a strangely emotionless affair when it comes to Kyle and his comrades. With weakly drawn and short-changed side players, you'll struggle to find emotional investment in Kyle and his brothers of war yet thanks to Cooper's stunning turn and Miller's nicely constructed support, the film finds much needed heart in the love of these two people. Cooper really does give a career defining turn, physically different and sometimes unrecognisable; Cooper inhabits Kyle with a respect and believability that elevates a stock standard tone to another level. Whenever he is beside Miller or simply on the phone to her, the film feels more alive than any of the so called big battle sequences and it's a credit to Hall and also Eastwood that they have accomplished such a well-drawn relationship to pay homage to a genuine real life love story.I don't feel that American Sniper is an amazing film, a film somewhat undeserving of some of the plaudits placed upon it by the Academy but it's a film that does its job in a way you'd expect from such an experienced filmmaker like Eastwood and a nice step up for him in quality after a string of recent misfires. Elevated to another level by Cooper's great portrayal of Kyle and with a powerful last 10 minutes, many will be calling American Sniper one of the better films of recent memories despite it being a sometimes frustratingly cold and generic America FTW tale. In the end American Sniper could've been something more but also so much less and judging by its incredible box office and audience reception, that's all anyone has asked for.3 and a half unfortunate rattlesnakes out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

When the character can't overcome the legend,"Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" put me in the same kind of mood ""Lone Survivor"" did this time last year, in that I was reflective of why so many Americans, myself included, rush out to the multiplex to see a new war movie. The answer, from what I gather, is fairly simple, in that most Americans have very little conception as to what occurs overseas, and that mediums like books and films are our windows to the frontlines of combat. With war films based off true events, factual accuracy is always debatable, and the persistent fact checking often circles itself enough to the point where you don't know what to believe; nonetheless, if the combat and the human stories are done correctly, along with the presence of a clean structure, you will feel a war film and that's just about as good as anything.""American Sniper"" is destined to be the audience favorite of the next few weeks, and to be fair, it's easy to identify why; if you're someone who hasn't seen a lot of war films, or even if you have, this particular film packs a serious punch. A lot occurs in a little over two hours, and images and sequences many won't be used to will likely upset viewers and provoke feelings and attitudes that aren't usually provoked, even when watching a war film. At the end of my showing, over eighty people walked out in stone-cold silence; it was one of the most somber and telling signs I've ever witnessed exiting a movie theater. Everyone, regardless of their opinions, had just witnessed something that had them at a loss for words or an inability to speak their opinions as the credits rolled.The film tells the story of the deadliest sniper in United States history, a Texas native by the name of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), who enlisted in the Navy SEALS following the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies. He was eventually drafted into the Iraq War following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and went on to earn the name ""Legend,"" for his prolific body count and his persistent loyalty to his squadmates. However, back home, as one would expect, his Taya (Sienna Miller) feels his absence, struggling to raise children and maintain their home, especially when every time Chris returns home, he is burdened by nudging thoughts of discomfort and an inability to readjust, which makes him want to return to the frontlines.The film keeps one foot in Iraq and the other back in Texas, showing the contrasting lifestyles and the effects each one has on Kyle has a person. Iraq has him in a mood that is constantly alive, working to protect and operate as cleanly as possible, where back home shows him burdened by the thoughts of his current disloyalty and his persistent thoughts of war, as he clearly starts to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. A great scene in particular has Kyle staring at a Television set during a party, with thunderous explosions, helicopters, and combat being heard at deafening levels, leading one to believe he's watching coverage of the Iraq War; a brief pan around to show us his point-of-view shows the television set is turned off.Eastwood keeps ""American Sniper"" grounded in humanity when it comes to showing the scenes involving the after-effects of each of Kyle's four tours in Iraq, but neglects to develop him as a person. A critical structural flaw in the film occurs within the first half hour, where the scene from the teaser trailer - showing Kyle with his crosshairs on a suspicious woman and her child as they harbor a grenade towards U.S. soldiers - remains a teaser in the feature film, with Eastwood cutting away from the action as it's about to unfold to show Kyle's life as a child before returning back to said scene to witness the outcome. During the time where Eastwood and writer Jason Hall expands on Kyle's upbringing and eventually enlisting, significant father/son moments and true motivations are simplified, resulting in a rushed treatment of the founding years of the character's life. On top of that, Eastwood corrupts the suspense he conjured from the trailer of the film by interrupting such a tense scene in the feature film, taking us out of an environment and interjecting us into several others when he should've kept us grounded in one.Furthermore, the character of Chris Kyle remains largely a vapid caricature, characterized only by such buzzwords as ""legend"" or ""amazing,"" never giving us the tender, more human side to the man that the film has initially suggested. What we largely get are combat scenes that are sometimes gripping and other times spatially incoherent or certain scenes that lack emotional leverage because they spell things out through the use of dialog or obviousness (IE: Kyle's face staring into the television as he witnesses one of the World Trade Center towers collapsing into rubble). While Cooper may be giving us one of the strongest performances of his career, effectively achieving the combination of unsettled and fragile, Hall's writing greatly shortchanges Sienna Miller's character, who is resorted to nothing more than being a wife who constantly calls her husband in either frustration or sadness and doesn't become her own central identity.Nonetheless, there's a real overload of content here in terms of how much the film shows and how deep it's willing to go in certain situations. Eastwood and Hall do their best not to leave a stone unturned, and Cooper follows along nicely, creating a character who can be fearless at times and unsure and self-critical at others. ""American Sniper"" will please a great deal of audiences, but serious issues with the film's structure and depiction of its titular character should not go unnoticed despite the film's ability to captivate and illicit emotions.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper is a powerfully riveting biopic assembled by the absorbing efforts by Clint Eastwood,"American Sniper is one of the most powerful war movies Hollywood has unleashed in recent years, as well as one of the most controversial. Concerning the one of America's most celebrated Navy Seals Chris Kyle, this movie offers an enthralling, if not masterful inside look on an American soldier who's been showered with endless respect for his duty in the Iraq War (like many soldiers who set out to fight overseas), while remaining a questionable figure by some of the public. Chris Kyle has varied in what many called a true American hero for his active duty, while condemned as a cold-blooded killer by others for his callous attitude towards Iraqis, at least what was described in his autobiography. Nonetheless, Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood brings his appealing cinematic talent to the screen to this admired American figure to life in a riveting form. By no means in this biopic a masterpiece, but it firmly demonstrates true talent both in front and behind the camera. This film focuses on the true story of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), a U.S Navy Seal who garnered fame upon racking up over 150 confirmed skills during his duty in Iraq. The story follows Kyle during his four tours in Iraq and the struggles he faces back his Post- Traumatic Stress symptoms and the strain in his relationship with his family, particularly his wife Taya (played by Sienna Miller).This movie is not the first time Clint Eastwood has tackled on the casualties of war. After all, he was the director behind 'Flags of Our Father' and 'Letters to Iwo Jima', both of focused on World War II in the Pacific Theater. This film however, sees Eastwood focusing on not an entire platoon trudging through the heat of a bloody battle, but a single figure who was forced to deal with the punishing horrors of war both on the battlefields and the psychological and emotional state of his character. The combat sequences set in the urban areas of Iraq are exuberantly shot and executed in a way that showcasing the sobering nature of active combat. Soldiers are brutally killed, and some of which we get to know very well. While the political complexities of the war are only thinly explored, Eastwood doesn't fail to show that war is hell. The scenes taking place off the battlefield is where most of the emotional resonance hits hard. As his active duty takes a toll on his wife who's disheartened by his physical and emotional absence, the story opens up a wider and brighter light on the complicated nature of Chris Kyle. In particularly, Kyle is brightened with a powerful performance by Bradley Cooper who fuels great fortitude and versatility in the role. While Eastwood makes the effort to portray the centric character as a hero, the controversy surrounding the man may give those who are less of a fan of him a cold shoulder, mainly due to some claims about his callousness towards the Iraqi mentioned in his autobiography. In the end, it is somewhat easy to see both sides of the argument of why he is respected by some and hated by others.American Sniper is a powerful, riveting biopic that excels with the immersive talent of both Bradley Cooper and director Clint Eastwood. Like many war movies, this one hit hard, enough to have driven my friends and I to tears as we walked out of the theater. Although the patriotic tone of the story and the portrayal of the Iraqi may prove to be a bit too jingoistic for some, there is certainly some talent on and off the camera that deserves to be admired.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie about a guy that shouldn't be remembered as an American hero,"First of all let me say it is difficult for me to review a movie like this one. Because I'm against war, and certainly wars that are not justified at all. America had no reason at all to start a war in Iraq. The only reason they started a war there is for oil and for weapon business. Like most of their wars actually. You will never see them going to war in countries where there is nothing to gain. War is for idiots and anyone that is condoning it is an idiot as well. If that is the definition of being a patriot then patriots are complete fools. The man in the story obviously liked killing people and should certainly not be remembered as an hero. But that's how I'm thinking about wars, patriots and all that kind of unimportant things in life. Now about the movie I have to admit that it is a good movie. Well directed and with an excellent Bradley Cooper. I wished every war movie was just fiction but it isn't. We are the parasites of this planet and we will eventually completely destroy it. Too bad but that's how it is, too many idiots in command and too many idiots following their orders...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Wet Dream,"Let me begin by saying I love US middle-eastern war films. I recognise the complexity of the situation that led to the placement of US troops in Iraq, but regardless I thoroughly enjoy the modern war setting combined with middle-eastern cultural elements. Green Zone, The Kingdom, Black Hawk Down, Mosul - all movies that I rate exceptionally highly.With that out of the way, it couldn't be clearer that American Sniper is painting the most simplistically pro-US message possible. There's no depth to the storytelling past 'we good guys, they bad guys' (several lines in the movie are VERY close to straight up quoting that). My complaint isn't the film's pro-US angle (Black Hawk Down was also pretty pro-US) but the utter simplicity of American sniper's implementation of the viewpoint makes it predictable and mundane. It's like a 12 year old's moral view throughout, and all the potentially great moral conundrums throughout the film are lost because of it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie you can skip,This movie showcases the hell a soldier has to go through to get into a prime killing zone!! once you have shaped your self as a killer then its hard to comeback!! the story however needed to play a little bit with the environment it was set in!! cooper is a true American n has a lot of aggression towards those who have done bad to his country!! He sees his friends die in-front of him which cuts his bravery into a darkness in himself!! However this is totally an American insight to the situation in Iraq. The movie neither goes deeper into the mind of the soldier or the family or the enemy. The death of the actor at the end is sudden and also a hard thing to take as he survived the hard stages of Iraq but dies after having some time off from the devil's nest.,,Anonymous,Biography
"As a Vietnam Veteran, this movie lifted my spirits!","I am so thankful for this movie. It gives me hope that Americans will have a better understanding of the inner battle we Vets have about having had to face difficult decisions during war. Bradley did a great job in portraying Chris via his voice, body language and facial expressions. I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and I thank him for having the fortitude to produce this amazing movie and helping to bring to light that when one has to pull the trigger on a weapon to take down the enemy, it is not something we take pleasure in. Maybe now, Americans will understand a little more about how we Veterans feel in our daily lives in living the memories of war time events and trying to deal with the people we come in contact with on a daily basis. As an author and Vietnam Veteran, I thank all those who took part in the production of this movie. Hooyah! Bruce Goldwell, author",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Direction!! Acting!! American Sniper!!,"BY STEPHEN MARCHEAmerican Sniper, Clint Eastwood's Iraq War film starring Bradley Cooper, opened last weekend to a small measure of controversy and an epic public response. The movie made an estimated $105.3 million over the long holiday weekend, an absurd sum for an R-rated war drama devoid of superheroes. It broke two January box-office records previously held by Avatar—by Avatar, for the love of God— and it has already surpassed almost every Clint Eastwood movie's lifetime gross in a few days. (Unforgiven made $101 million over its entire run.) Most remarkable of all is that American Sniper deserves all its success. It is the first great film made about the war in Iraq. (It follows sniper Chris Kyle's tours in Iraq, which included the Second Battle of Fallujah.)The controversies surrounding American Sniper are predictable, although still quite silly. Michael Moore made the claim that snipers are cowards, and then seemed struck that anyone was offended by the remark. A bizarre statement, truly. You can accuse Navy SEALs of a great deal, but cowardice is not on the slate. Others have more seriously taken issue with the way the film represents history. To which I can only say that going to a Hollywood movie for a history lesson is like going to a brothel for a lecture in philosophy. You're in the wrong place.THE BEST BEST PICTURES FOR MENA MICHAEL KEATON STORY HE WOULD RATHER YOU DIDN'T... No one is denying the quality of the film, well, with the exception of those fake babies. That would be nearly impossible. What makes some critics uncomfortable is their perception of the film's celebration of violence. Chris Kyle, whose autobiography provided the basis of the film, was the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. He was a naturally gifted shooter from boyhood, and his gift was nurtured by dedicated training until his deployment to Iraq, where urban warfare provided the perfect venue for its expression.Eastwood does not shy away from displaying Kyle's incredible skills with a rifle, it is true. But to say that American Sniper is pro-war or even a simply heroic portrait of Chris Kyle is deliberately to misinterpret it. At the beginning of the story, we see Kyle as a child in Texas. His father instructs him in a simple code: There are wolves and there are sheep and there are sheepdogs in this world. And he is to use his violence to be a sheepdog rather than a wolf. In the broadest terms, the story of American Sniper is that of a man given this incredibly crude ethical system, thrust into the morass of the Iraq War, and watching it crumble.During his first tour, Kyle is forced to decide whether to shoot a young boy as he runs toward a convoy of soldiers with what appears to be a grenade. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan progress, as the tours add up, the decisions become even more complex and the purpose of the violence less clear. Kyle's sign is a crusader's cross. He displays a skull very similar to that of the Punisher comic-book character on the side of his Humvee. He wants to make war on ""the evil"" of ""the savages."" He takes missions out of a spirit of personal revenge. His counterpart, his foremost enemy, is a sniper named Mustafa who takes videos of his kills and sells them on the street. But at least when Mustafa goes to kill, he's in the same country as his babies. ""God, country, family"" is Kyle's motto. It's also the motto of ""the savages.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Met a Sniper Back From The War,"I met a man who came back from a long tour of war about a few years ago. He was a Sniper in great shape but with a huge moral problem that hung over him when we met. I questioned him as to what was bothering him and after great reluctance and me pursuing it gently, he opened up. He was a trained killer and not just in sniping either. He had killed so many people he lost track and was tortured by what he did. He had been through much counseling, received input from religions and friends and still couldn't find his peace on the subject matter. I asked him why he was staring at me when we first met. He said ""I was assessing the best way to kill you and I had three ways to do it"". He said he couldn't help this thinking and carried it around with him all this time. I realized it was his training which I rated a ten for effectiveness but with personal chills added! I asked just for the hell of it how would you kill me? I am a 5'11 with a heavy muscular build in great shape guy. He says he would have chosen a blow to the neck area and when I pressed him for details, he left it at a head blow area below the neck and felt uncomfortable discussing it with me. I also noticed his demeanor changed from civilian to professional killer and he noticed it too. Both of us changed the subject. I left him with...you know you served your country and did your duty and it had to be done and he says I know all that and have heard it before. He just couldn't come to grips with what he did. This movie tends to glorify the work that had to be done. But this man I spoke with remains highly conflicted and in pain in regards to it. BTW...there are Snipers out there that don't want to be known, glorified or identified. Famous for killing people? As far as a movie goes for entertainment purposes...be entertained, enthralled and even satisfied for getting your price of admissions worth. But ponder the true cost of the story and the part man plays in it.....Definitely a popcorn, snack and tasty drink movie",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just about the best of 2014,"I had two unusual things happen when I caught Clint Eastwood's American SNIPER last night.Usually, when I go see a movie on Sunday nights, it's not unusual for our group to have the place to ourselves. What happened last night? The 9:30 showing of American SNIPER was SOLD OUT!! We had to attend the 10:00 showing – which was about 90 percent full.Secondly, and most importantly, when the movie ended and the credits rolled, instead of hearing the usual crumple of paper, murmuring of people and movement to the exit, the theatre was DEAD SILENT with NO MOVEMENT as the credits bathed over us.Such is the emotional impact of American SNIPER.Bradley Cooper – rightfully nominated for an Academy Award – stars in the true story of Navy Seal Chris Kyle, the proclaimed ""LEGEND"" who saved countless lives with his accurate shooting. But this movie is more than a ""war"" story about an American shooting the enemy from afar – though it could have been and it still would have been a good movie. Director Eastwood, along with screenwriter Jason Hall, crafts a story that is much more than that, switching between Kyle's 4 tours of duty abroad to his acclimation (or lack thereof) back home. It is in this toll on Kyle that the movie finds it's heart. Sienna Miller – far removed from the tabloid headline grabber she was earlier in her career – is sensational as Kyle's wife who tries to bring Kyle back to the real world. Her acting was a revelation to me, I quite simply didn't think she had it in her. Make no mistake, however, this movie is Cooper's and he more than steps up to the plate. Gaining weight (40 lbs!) and a gravitas heretofore not seen on screen from him, Cooper brings the steely eyed determination of ""killing the bad guys"" with the internal trauma that this job created. This is Cooper's 3rd straight year of being nominated for BEST ACTOR and I hope, this time, he wins it.I was moved by this story and would rank this right up there with 2 other movies that tell the story of our recent wars overseas – THE HURT LOCKER and ZERO DARK THIRTY – quite possibly, the best of the 3.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Strong Action-Heavy War Film That Hints at, But Ultimately Skirts, Deeper Meaning","Chris Kyle, sniper extraordinaire and lightning rod for many reasons (some of which are entirely of his own creation), gets the close-up treatment in an appropriately controversial film. Much of the popular criticism centers around Kyle's casual, almost matter-of-fact tone about the inevitability of American military involvement in Iraq and a simplistic, one-dimensional perspective on the native combatants. From what I gather, much of that was toned down from his autobiography, on which this was based, and on the screen it's somewhat more excusable. In an industry that's already seen the likes of Rambo and Commando, it's hardly the first to commit that sin, though it does remove us a bit from reality and make the production's more grounded, thoughtful aspects a bit tougher to swallow. American Sniper's battle scenes are a major strength, intense and morally-exhausting, but occasionally they drift into idol worship and stretch to assure the audience that his strikes were justified. Kyle's descent from suave, charismatic bar-denizen to haunted, self-righteous battlefield legend is a difficult but effective journey, well-managed by Bradley Cooper in the leading role. The frequent hints and nudges about his struggles with PTSD on the homefront are nicely done, too, right up until the closing moments when the film spontaneously lurches into a tacky fairy-tale ending that felt so jarring and undeserved, I wondered if it might be a dream sequence. It's better than I feared it might be, but asks many more questions than it answers and quite often falls short of delivering on teased potential. As snapshots of a superstar's life behind the scope, and behind the battle lines, it works. As a finished thought on the man himself? Not quite.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The events driven approach limits the film to being a very one note and simplistic film and character piece,"I have seen a lot of Awards Season films in my years, and at some point I suspect that I will take the approach that I take towards summer movies now – which is to let them and their hype pass, and come back to those that outlive their publicity and marketing. However, with American Sniper I was intrigued to see it for myself on the basis of the reported controversy; with some slamming the film for glorifying someone who killed so many people, while others saying that the hero marks the life of an American hero who put himself in harm's way in the service of a mission given to him by his country. I approached the film open to whatever it chose to do of these, and curious as to what others were seeing, but the odd thing is that the reason that the film is accused of both extremes, is that it does both of them.As a narrative the film is events driven, starting in childhood, training, deployment, tours, and finally a return home. It is understandable in its structure and it is not its fault that these places and experiences almost feel too familiar now thanks to video games and films making heavy use of them as entertainment. The film focuses totally on Kyle, keeping the camera very close to him even to the detriment of other characters and situations. In a way this makes the film more engaging because we do stay involved with one person rather than the fog of war, but at the same time it also limits the scope of the film to his perception, his actions, his bottled up feelings. In this way it really plays it so straight that you can take it how you want to find it – which was maybe the aim of the film. So if you feel Kyle was deeply affected by having to kill women and children in a war without end, and threw himself into his mission rather than confront his own actions, then the film doesn't do anything to dissuade you from that; but if you think he was a square-jawed hero doing what he needed to do without question, then the film also gives you that. So the extremes of the argument get to be happy with the film – or unhappy with it (which to watch them fight, you would be fair to assume is the same thing).The problem then is that for anyone who is not coming in with an agenda to feel a certain way, the film actually does very little, because this ""straight shooter"" approach provides very little of interest. Cooper does what he can with his face and body, while Miller plays it reasonably well; however it is all very straight and there is no nuance or room for thought or extension. In his direction Eastwood delivers good tension and action on the ground; okay he uses artistic license quite heavily to build in a specific narrative tension, but it works for what he wants to do. With his characters though, he cannot find much outside of scenes that exist specifically to perform that function – of which they are generally late in the film and as functional as they sound.There is lots of online fighting about who Chris Kyle was, what this film does, and what it is trying to say; part of this does come from the way that the film doesn't really take a stand, hinting at things, avoiding others, muddying other aspects to produce a mostly event driven film that broadly tells a tale, but never really gets anywhere close to the person, people, or place.",,Anonymous,Biography

And, sad that he was killed doing what he loved. (Helping soldiers) Also, sad for his wife and family that they lost their father and role model. This movie is clearly a fantastic one that should have dominated the Oscars. But, a left-wing leaning group like Hollywood would never elevate a movie that portrays American excellence.

"Made with palm-sweating tension and based on a real life military sniper, this is Clint Eastwood's best war movie in a long time.","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's second 2014 film (after Jersey Boys) and the best we have seen from this veteran film director in years. Contextually, this film looks and feels like 2008's Academy Award winning Best Picture, The Hurt Locker, but with Eastwood's deft storytelling, American Sniper is equally Entertaining and thrilling, yet dramatic and tragic, and wrung with palm-sweating tension throughout.Based on memoirs of the highly decorated US military sniper, Chris Kyle, the film opens in Iraq in 2003, and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is in prone position on a rooftop, rifle in hand, and tasked with over watch as an infantry unit kick down doors in search of insurgents. He sees a woman and child approaching the unit but must make a split-second decision on whether they pose a threat to his fellow soldiers down below. His spotter reminds him that he could ""fry"" if he kills an innocent woman and child. His gut tells him otherwise. Just when his finger is wrapped around the trigger and ready to squeeze, we are taken back on a 25-minute flashback. We see him raised in a conservative Texan family, then through rigorous Navy SEAL training, and then courtship, marriage and parenthood. It's a vital segment that makes us want to care about him and the decision he is about to make. It is also where we learn Kyle's three main priorities – God, Country, Family – values that would go on to make him a ""Legend"".It takes four tours of Iraq and 160 confirmed kills to earn that proclamation but we don't get to see as many kill shots. Between taut firefights in Iraq and coping with the anxiety of his wife (Sienna Miller) in Texas, we get hard-wired into Kyle's psyche thanks to a career-best performance from a bulked-up Bradley Cooper. After Academy Award nominations in Silver Linings Playbook and last year's American Hustle, Cooper is on a hat-trick and this is definitely a side of him we have never seen before. Miller, on the other hand, gets to portray the wife of a soldier and she delivers with seasoned skill, but these scenes are too few and short for a screenplay intended to venerate a war hero. And how it does! With about 90 percent of the screen time dedicated to Kyle, we are given a complex character study of an individual tasked with preserving or taking life. Unlike other war films where soldiers kill counterparts 'in the line of duty', Cooper's Kyle often finds himself wrestling with an almost obsessive compulsive disorder but one that ensures his wife and kids remain free and safe in the motherland. However, the ramifications are close behind. As much as Kyle is revered by his peers and commanding officers, the price on his head swells, and so does his reputation amongst insurgents as ""The Devil of Ramdi"".In the wrong hands, American Sniper could have been misconstrued as American propaganda. Look no further than Peter Berg's The Kingdom, a right-wing hoopla that literally screams ""us versus them"". Instead, 84-year-old Eastwood shows restrain for political subletting, especially given recent headlines on the on-going ""war on terror"", by telling a well-knit story of courage, determination and patriotism. Not since his very own WWII double-feature, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Flags of Our Fathers (both in 2006), has Eastwood been so confident and controversial in an action film. Dusty, smoky, war torn Iraq feels authentic and that's before some frantic gunfights reserved for the many action sequences. While action scenes can get quite heavy and violent, at times it feels like a portion of a first-person-shooter video game. Then again, American Sniper is all about Chris Kyle, his POV, and why the US military could benefit from more soldiers like him. Towards the end, one scene has Kyle pull off a near impossible shot with utmost precision. It's one of several reasons why Kyle will always be known as ""The deadliest sniper in US military history"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely Biased Movie,"As a standalone movie, this is a great film by a great director. However, the ideals it pushes shows just how ignorant the creators truly were. All of the Islamic and Iraqi soldiers are portrayed as enemies and ""savages"" to use Kyle's own words. A much better movie about the themes portrayed in this movie would be ""The Hurt Locker"" where it does not focus on the good guys or bad guys, but rather the life of a soldier and the trauma he/she experiences because of war. Overall, this could just be seen as a piece of American propaganda and sadly so. I was expecting so much more from Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, but this film let me down because of its overly patriotic themes.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bravo!,"Clint Eastwood was in top form for American Sniper, his 34th feature film as director. An Oscar nomination for Best Director would have made very good sense to me. At 84 years old, the man should be an inspiration to geriatrics the world over and the rest of us who hope to live that long. And who better to take a page out of Quentin Tarantino's book by using a great old Ennio Morricone tune?Neither the perilous hell of battle nor the depths of human wickedness have been more powerfully and realistically depicted in my cinematic experience. Furthermore, they dutifully honor Chris Kyle's perspective without it being a pro-Iraq War propaganda piece. It is a skillful balancing act for what is not a political film per se. To say that the film needed an anti-war agenda is tantamount to saying that it would have been better if only they had disrespected the man's memory. Though I myself do not approve of the Iraq War, it is not in black and white terms. I much prefer a challenging, thought-provoking film to an anti-war spoon-feeding.Bradley Cooper seems to take nothing for granted by giving his all to one good role after another. The part of Chris Kyle is his most demanding and transformative. I have liked him in many roles and have long understood him to be a real go-getter and capable actor, but this one stands out as a remarkable achievement. It is one of the better performances that I have ever seen. He insisted on achieving believability and succeeded beyond doubt.There is so much I like about the film that I almost feel like I am pawing in the dark to criticize it. However, another early scene developing the relationship between Kyle and his wife Taya would have been appreciated. Well, that and a preposterous fake baby that I hesitate to mention since I was fooled by it in the theater. But I figure almost everyone who reads this review will have already seen the film.Snipers have a way of captivating the mind and are therefore good film subjects. It is the precise art of marksmanship, the idea of playing God, their strategic importance in warfare, and as the makers of this film understand in spades by having included a sharpshooting adversary named Mustafa, the idea of the hunter being hunted.Chris Kyle risked his life over four tours and roughly 1,000 days in order to protect his fellow soldiers. This was courageous and he is an American hero, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. He is a hero to all people who support an aggressive stance against the enemies of civilization. He had a real and important job to do and did it exceptionally well. This much should be agreeable to anyone in their right mind, however ill-conceived they consider the war. Nevertheless, I have observed a moron explosion in response to the film and fueled by the marvelous success of it. I regret to see such one-note, mouth-breathing opposition to the war in lieu of measured arguments. Snipers also have a way of stirring up emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing,"Putting all the politics aside, and disregarding any personal feelings about the Iraq war, I found this film to be lazy, lacking any merit, and ultimately quite boring. The main character is unsympathetically portrayed which I don't think was intentional, and rather one dimensional; there seems to be an underlying assumption that he is deserving of the audience's respect simply because he can shoot a rifle. I found the film overlong and rather 'garbled', and lost interest half way through. I can't understand why it was nominate for an Oscar, other than the standard American self congratulatory response to any aggressive action against other countries.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of Zarqawi's favorite methods of execution was pushing a drill bit through someone's head with a cordless drill) Another film critic says that Kyle is or was a psychopath who just loved mass killing.But the fact is that of those 160 plus ""kills"", he probably saved at least 40 - 90 American Marine, Army, and Iraqi lives, especially when he killed people ready to explode bombs and grenades.I wish I had been young enough to have helped him.My take: The film is very coherent, and narrates a full, tightly narrated story of what American Warrior families go through, fighting an asymmetrical war on terror.American Sniper is one of the best War Movies every made.Too intense for children, but a must see for adults.",,Anonymous,Biography
A war with no winner,"Bradley Cooper, bearded and beefed-up, sheds his glamour-boy image and delivers his best performance to date as real-life US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, his country's best-ever sniper. who in four tours of duty in Iraq took out over 150 enemy combatants. Both in Iraq, where his team-mates fall beside him, and at home, visiting hideously wounded and mentally scarred veterans, Kyle sees the full horror - and the true cost - of war. The movie's final moments, subtly mixing diminuendo with crescendo, powerfully underline the theme that the end of fighting is no longer the end of a war.Men at war: territory that we've been visiting for decades. At 84 Clint Eastwood has lost none of his edge; his direction here is just as tight and edgy as Kathryn Bigelow or Ridley Scott.Sienna Miller is very convincing as the party girl turned home-maker who frets that Chris's devotion to his country is making him neglect his wife and kids. The tension in their marriage is finely balanced against the tension on the rooftops of Baghdad and Fallujah. There's not a lot that's new in American SNIPER, but it's two-and-a-half hours that remind us that in wars there are ultimately no winners.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Haunting and Powerful,"I was unsure as to what to expect from this movie. Part of me was worried I would encounter a ""'murica"" flick with guts flying all over the place. This movie, however, was brutal in such a tasteful way. It is a powerful story and so well told. It was about the man; not a commentary on a war, and not propaganda for a country. It is such a good ""war movie"" for this very reason. Furthermore, the cast could not have been better picked.If you want to know if you should see this movie, I will only say this; at the end of the movie, the whole packed theatre left in absolute silence.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much of the same but still very classy,"Jack Reacher once said ""it's never the same with a sniper out there"". I imagine that to be a very true statement. 'American Sniper' is the true story of Chris Kyle a Navy SEAL sniper who went on four tours of duty to Iraq and set records for the amount of people he killed during his career. Now, instantly you can imagine the amount of political debate that is going to take place over a film like this. Do you portray him as an out and out hero? Do you portray him as a hero, but also put a negative spin on his actions? Tough decisions for the filmmakers to make right out of the gate. Did they do a great job with them? I'm not entirely sure.Bradley Cooper has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Lead role for this film. The Academy loves an actor who transforms oneself for a role and that's exactly what Cooper did putting on an enormous amount of weight. He also had to learn a Texan accent which I felt he absolutely nailed. The thing that's going to stop him winning is probably more the film than anything. It just never gave him that one scene to blow us away with. Still he was incredibly consistent throughout the film and being nominated three years in a row is no mean feat.The film's biggest downfall is that the first four-fifths of it feel like we are just going through the same experience over and over. Not a lot is really being added to the story along the way. We understand what is going on and it just feels a bit like it's being rammed down our throats. Clint Eastwood has proved himself to be a fine director in the past. I noticed in the trivia section an interesting comment relating to Chris Kyle's real life father telling both Eastwood and Cooper (who also produced the film) that he would ""unleash Hell"" if his son's memory was disrespected in the film. I can't help but wonder whether that had any effect over certain scenes they might have liked to include along the way. There's no dodging the fact that people with certain political agendas are not going to like this film.That being said it has been nominated for Best Picture and while it has next to no chance of actually taking home the award that's still an impressive accomplishment. It seems the Academy likes to put at least one war movie in the the category each year ever since the success of 'The Hurt Locker'. The movie has only been out a few days and already it seems to be stirring up a lot of debate, as was probably to be expected. I know I plan to go and read up about the real life events and do some fact checking against the movie to see what was included and what wasn't. All that aside though it's a pretty good watch for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overwhelmingly Outstanding In Every Regard,"American Sniper portrays the patriotism felt by millions of decent Americans fighting a hidden enemy that even today organizes to attack us on our homeland. Preemptively eradicating this evil radical extremism found in so many different states must accelerate if we are to prevail. This movie exemplifies the ongoing struggle with evil that our soldiers endure every day which is hidden from most Americans reality. They are sacrificing their lives to fight for the very rights that allow the morons to post negative comments on this forum. Chris Kyle was a hero's hero and this movie does an excellent job of putting the viewer into his shoes. Clint Eastwood's directing, the screenplay, the acting was all top notch. In real life Chris killed more than 255 of the radicals and set an example of what is required to exterminate the evil whose only goal to kill the rest of us. Thank you Clint, Bradley, Chris, and our troops for their sacrifices to keep us safe. This should be required viewing for US citizens.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Should've been an HBO miniseries.,"American Sniper is yet another example of why more stories should be told through a medium more akin to an HBO miniseries, similar to John Adams or Bands of Brothers. By trying to force Chris Kyle's incredible life story into a 2+ hour traditional film format, the story did little to no justice on Kyle's impressive accomplishments, both militarily and as a man. The result was a very jumpy and shallow viewing experience where you didn't feel a connection to Kyle's SEAL teammates or his wife, Taya. The actors, namely Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, did the best job they possibly could've done with the script they were given. The script was the best it could've been when trying to fit into the clichéd 2-hour time slot. But it all comes back to the decision to make this into a movie. It just wasn't possible. There were also some directorial decisions that I found highly questionable but they weren't major nor were they things most people would either pick up on or care about. Ultimately, this review should end on a high note though, so I will point out the strongest element of the film: the ending. The closing 10+ minutes are incredibly moving and deliver, what I believe was the entire purpose of the film itself. They leave you in awe of the man, the myth, the legend. The decision to leave the remaining credits without audio was also a genius decision. I've never left a theater and felt like I was leaving a funeral. I believe that is the appropriate feeling that this movie should portray and I commend Clint Eastwood for making that so.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Compertently made, but overly simplistic of a complicated and emotive set up","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs we open on Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) on the battleground in Iraq, we see him faced with the most unenviable of dilemmas: his target sight's set on a young child, who's been handed an explosive device, which is to be thrown at his comrades. Will he pull the trigger? Before we can find out, we are thrown in to reverse gear, as we learn of Kyle before he signed up and became the solider with reportedly the highest number of confirmed kills ever, through to the severe PTSD he developed after several tours of duty.While enjoying a film career with a fine and varied back catalogue, Mr. Clint Eastwood has never been one to steer too far in to the murky waters of controversy, which has sadly befallen him with American Sniper, one of many inevitable biopics revolving around the Iraq war, and the tense political climate that followed. Certain segments of the media and society have accused it of war glorification and a celebration of American imperialism. The politics are pretty much set in stone beforehand either way, but this is undoubtedly an overly simplistic and under developed film that, for it's basic competence and technical flair, fails to really get under the meat and bones of itself.It plays, as it does, as an examination of one subject, a deeply flawed and morally questionable man, who despite showing bravery and dedication in going to Iraq and protecting his comrades, evidence has shown he thought of the Iraqis in a less than commendable way, even if many were shooting at him and trying to kill him. The film seems to generate controversy from any number of angles, and Eastwood has applied a deft approach to this real life killing machine, right up to the end showdown with the Olympian Iraqi sniper, resulting in a fastest finger first dual ('you feelin' lucky? Well, do ya, punk?')For quite a huge downside, there's a fairly high upside, too. Cooper was enthusiastic for the lead role, and he fits it quite well, managing Kyle's gravelly Texas accent and mannerisms, and gliding through all the dramatic elements of the film. Eastwood thoroughly pores over all of Kyle's post war life, and his lack of stability as a civilian, in public and in private. It's the sort of thing he's known for, and despite some hiccups, he still does it well. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The story of a true Legend!!!!,"From director Clint Eastwood comes ""American Sniper,"" starring Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and, as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname ""Legend."" However, his reputation is also growing behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to ""leave no man behind.""

A deeply moving war film,This film about deadly American Seal Sniper Chris Kyle is a deep look into the psyche of a trained legal killer. In an Iraq plagued with ambushes and IEDs the US forces are often sitting ducks for the ISIS militia operators. Kyle sets about providing cover for the army patrols.Bradley Cooper executes a convincing role in this very realistic film. He shows a deep understanding of the pain suffered by men experiencing war memories.Since this film is based on a real life experience the ending is a though it has been written into the screenplay. Kyle is helping a PTSD sufferer adjust to civilian life when he is gunned down at a rifle range. One of America's greatest heroes id taken from us too early.

"Boring, episodic movie","Unlike many reviewers (most of them paid film critics), I will try to separate my personal animosity to US policies in the Middle East from my measure of the artistic merit of ""American Sniper"".My wife insisted on us watching ""American Sniper,"" then lost interest in the first hour. Most of the truly engaging, emotional scenes are revealed in the trailers. What comes in between those engaging moments are detached episodes chronicling Chris Kyle's tours in Iraq. I admire Kyle for his personal code. However, I did not admire Kyle's inability to question the policies of those under whom he served, even when director Clint Eastwood slyly presents evidence to motivate Kyle to do so. What Eastwood does fail to do is provide a subtle transition from extroverted ""good old boy"" to extreme introvert; whom, in his wife's words, is ""not here"". However, I doubt any director could have done so, given the absence of such scenes in the screenplay.This being said, while Sienna Miller is very good, Bradley Cooper, as ""Chris Kyle"" is nothing short of extraordinary. I cannot imagine another acted who could have done it better.Without revealing the end of the movie (which is ridiculous, given it is ""old news""), let me say it is perfectly appropriate. Chris Kyle paid the appropriate price for using his skills to help the wrong people.I give ""American Sniper"" a ""6"".",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clint has done it again,"AS is just another great film in a long line of great ones directed by our Clint, with the exception of Bloodwork. Again based on a true story, another post war, middle eastern tale, that starts a bit before 9/11, Bradley Cooper in the performance of his career, plays real like sniper, Chris Kyle, who at the start, is forced to make an impossible decision, to take a little boy bearing a grenade. We follow Chris's story, where he meets his wife, then is called back again tour after tour, to take down the bad guys, linked to of course, the main monster/asshole who, is gladly six feet under. Watching this film again, reminded of me of just how much I hate terrorists. AS too, isn't as bloody as you expect it to be too. It holds back, violence quite minimal. Kyle had visited a lot of the injured soldiers too who became amputees, paraplegics, giving them refresher courses on shooting. In it's starting, for a moment, I thought I wasn't watching Cooper. He's that good. Also first meeting Chris Kyle, we don't warm to him, when his then girlfriend gets involved in altercation, before she is sent packing her bags. In fact, I found him obnoxious. Near the end of the movie, where Cooper finally decides to quit touring, his mental state kind of breaks, where his iron fisted resilience keeps him in check. I thought that may'be there could a little bit more light thrown onto his mental state. But again this pic is up there with other true story anti terror tales, where Cooper's explosive performance is unforgettable, from an actor who just gets better. Sienna Miller, perfectly cast is very strong and sexy as his wife. Of course the actors are always better looking than the people they betray. This is one of the great films to start off the year, with some moments so intense, they're gold.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Blood letters,"The cinematic craft here is uninteresting with nothing really to recommend it. I put that aside. This is woeful stuff indeed for other reasons.What irks most is the tremendous sense of complacency. You'll see this in how it starts. A cowboy who never had the slightest interest in the larger world before TV footage of the US embassy bombings interrupted his beer drinking session one night, suddenly awakened by a sense of purpose. From his end, someone half the world away woke up and decided to bully America for no reason.The film takes care to make the whole thing, repeated tours in Iraq, about the dogged effort to apprehend a hight-ranking al-Qaeda man. It's something the viewer can substitute as a reason for leveling a country if he absolutely must have one, tied to 9/11. No mention at all of the bugaboo with WMD or Sadam anymore, it has been purged away.But of course that's all something someone like him might truly believe. Here's the tricky bit. The protagonist never questions anything about his mission but how come Eastwood doesn't? Oh there is some moral pause in all this like when he watches through the sniper's lens at a child trying to pick up a RPG, wishing he just drops it. There is some indignation during the funeral over how long this crusade must go on. We do see returning veterans shattered by horrors. But how come the worry is only about what our people have to suffer in service to country, never why?The ending crystallizes this ignorantly narrow focus in a larger way.The American hero has kind psychiatric help waiting for him, he gets to heal in a spacious house with his family. He gets a long funeral procession with flags waved along the streets. A movie about him. It reminds me of watching an NBA pregame last year where US army veterans were paid respect by the whole arena; going beyond political right and wrong, I was amazed truly by all this structure in place to receive them. Iraqi lives on the other hand are truly wretched, nameless, ""terrorists"" on their own country when seen through the lens of the foreign sharpshooter there to liberate, Iraqi structure reduced to the stone age.Oh I don't subscribe to the notion that people in the area are happy to lead peaceful and tolerant lives if we only just stop invading. Collective soul in the area has been shaped by forces that divide deeper than anything that happened 50 or 100 years ago; Iraq being a fairly recent adoption that stands on what used to be the border that rival Muslim empires ravaged for centuries. It might have stone aged itself like Syria these days and Lebanon prior without any other help. But I would rather lament this and the ravaged soul and plight of the area before that of the American hero who made it back.",,Anonymous,Biography
Eastwood takes America on a tour of the Shock Corridor,"American SNIPER ~~ Viewed at Cinestar Berlin, March 5, 2015.It's,hard to tell whether Bradley Cooper as hero Chris Kyle --- is a sharp shooting junkie, just addicted to war, an unflagging American patriot, or maybe all three. In any case, a very strong but restrained Oscar worthy performance to say the least. As a Navy Seal trained super-sniper using state-of-the-art sniper equipment he volunteers for four consecutive hazardous combat missions in Iraq leaving his little children and constantly pregnant wife behind in small town Texas. The film opens with a scene of the superstar sniper viewing an Iraqi woman clad in black robes with a little boy at her side suspended in his cross-hairs. His finger is on the trigger as he carefully draws a bead, but -- a doting new father himself back home as we will soon find out -- he is anything but eager to gun down a defenseless civilian woman and a child. However, this is not just any innocent civilian woman and any child. The woman slips a bomb concealed in her robes to the boy and whispers something in his ears ~~ obviously instructions to run at the American armored car and soldiers down the street in a glorious kamikaze attack, kill a few of them and go to Heaven. BAM! The boy goes Down as the bomb falls harmlessly aside. The woman tries to retrieve the bomb to complete the suicide mission. BAM again -- That takes care of her as well -- with a big blotch of blood up against the wall. We then get the back story of how Kyle was trained as a boy by his father in the art of hunting with a rifle, how he grew up in the macho atmosphere of Rodeo bronc-busting and met his future wife during Seal training at a lowdown local saloon. Heavy duty physical training on the beach prepare the Seal volunteers for the arduous tasks ahead. Quick no- nonsense marriage. Off to Battle.MIssion One. Back to the cross-hairs and the grim mission in a battered Iraqi city constantly under attack by Guerrilla Arab defenders. In an action to find Al-Zaqari, ruthless head of the Al-Qaeda enemy, Kyle and his cohorts ruthlessly roust civilian Arab families in their homes. In one seemingly ordinary household a stash of bombs and weapons is found concealed under the floorboards. One Iraqi father is ruthlessly gunned down by fellow Arabs for ""talking with the enemy"". This is a ruthless war on both sides of the fence. House to house and room to room -- no glorious battlefield vistas. Endless fierce shootouts ensue that make the Okay Corral look like a Girl Scouts picnic. From the scene of battle Kyle often chats with his anguished wife back home via cell phone. All she wants is for him to come home to his family. All he wants, it seems, is to keep shooting down more of the enemy. Big question: Who needs him more ~~ His country or His family? After a particularly furious battle -- in overpowering red darkness filling the screen for many minutes, Kyle has had enough and yells to his wife on the phone over the din that he is COMING HOME -- this time for good. At home he is obvious rattled by his lurid war experiences. He volunteers to assist other crippled and traumatized Iraqi war veterans in recovery. On February 2, 2013, one such veteran shoots him dead. Almost as big a shock as all that has gone before! The denouement of the film is the memorial service for Kyle with a stadium in Texas named after him. Lots of American flags but not waving too strongly. The end credits roll before a stunned German audience. Nobody leaves until the lights go up. A powerful non-judgemental Clint Eastwood Judgement. The American Gun Dream reconsidered.

American Sniper (2014),"Directed by Clint Eastwood. Starring Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Luke Grimes, Jake McDorman, Cory Hardrict, Navid Negahban, Keir O'Donnell, Kevin Lacz, Sam Jaeger, Kyle Gallner. (R)Potent but controversial story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (based on the memoir he wrote with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice), who served four tours of duty in the Iraq War and became the deadliest sharpshooter in the history of the US military. Director Eastwood's patented plain-spoken style may not be the most effective voice for this material, which conveniently smooths over most of the thornier aspects of its protagonist's personality and viewpoint; embellishing or outright manufacturing antagonists may work for the sake of rooting interest during the chaos of modern warfare, but it only serves to stake its flag further in the field of belief that the Iraqi people were one and all enemy ""savages."" Touches on (and glosses over) a number of issues beyond the battlefield, such as the moral quagmire of the Iraq War and the physical debilitation/PTSD suffered by vets returning from war; the most interesting part of the story actually takes place after Kyle comes home from his final tour of duty, but those details are rushed over to get to the awkwardly-assembled but unsettling final day of Kyle's life. The efficient precision of the filmmaking and Cooper's strong central performance are commendable in service of its limited mission statement; blunt as a bullet, but that may be enough for most audiences, who turned the film into a surprise box office smash.

"Heroic and Heart-wrenching.  A story of not just the war of bombs and bullets, but also of the mind.","Well I'm no movie reviewer, but these are my thoughts on American Sniper.If you're wanting to watch a movie about snipers you're coming to watch the wrong film. American Sniper isn't a ""Saving Private Ryan"" romp of violence and carnage, though there are the scenes depicting events which took place over the various tours of Iraq that Chris Kyle undertook as part of a US Navy SEAL team, and I mention team for a reason. Bradley Cooper's performance is impressive, and has clearly done a lot of work for the role. I think Sienna Miller (portraying the wife Taya Kyle) was nuanced and sensitive, and though her time on screen is limited it is memorable and touching.I've seen and read many reviews that describe this film as a glorification of US military, how it creates the polarisation and massive over-simplification of the conflicts that the US (and her Allies) have gotten into in the Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan etc) and that it establishes the US as the good guys with the natives as the bad guys, how American Sniper is nothing more than shoddy film making that acts as merely a recruitment tool for the US Armed Forces. My overwhelming feeling is that those who reviewed the movie as such most likely have never served in their nation's armed forces, and fail to grasp the essence of what Clint Eastwood is putting before us.American Sniper isn't about the glory of war, far from it. Using the lens of this one man's life of service to his nation, Clint Eastwood bares the soul of every serviceman and woman who is willing to make that sacrifice for their country, their people, their way of life. That these high ideals might initially motivate recruitment, but that through the fires of selection and training, and the forge of operational deployments, brotherhoods are created that cannot be understood fully by the average person back home.Chris Kyle, like so many other servicemen and women in the US and British forces, was a Protector. He cared for every battle-brother out there (though he met a fraction who would have actually deployed), and that desire to protect took him into the hell that is war so that others might live, to take the fight to the enemy to prevent it from festering like a cancer and spreading to his own shores, a sentiment shared by many that I know. John 15:13 ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""To those that saw that movie as some sort of tool for glorification and recruitment, I would say that their left-wing liberal agenda had their minds made up before they went to watch that film. The emotional trauma that Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) goes through is brutal. It quite literally threatens to tear his family apart, it robs him of his humanity, it brutalises his soul. This movie doesn't shy away from letting us see the naked violence that simmers just below the surface as he embraces his wife or kids, of the darkness behind the eyes of a man living in a peaceful world, having just returned from hell.I saw American Sniper as the story not of some super-man, but rather of a real man with real depth and vulnerability, who takes on that role of Protector and swallows the poisonous violence, horror, and despair that is war, all so that others will not have to be exposed. There is a huge societal threat from mental health illness in our current and former service personnel and I think it is marvellous that a mainstream Hollywood film is shining the light into this dark attic of our collective mind.Are the characters in the movie the most complex and evolved? No. Would it have been nice to see more character development? Yes. To do all that we would have needed a series of films as this story spans many years, and I don't believe that this would enhance what Clint Eastwood is offering to us.It's worth seeing, but go in looking for the human story, not one of wild special effects and teeth rattling explosions. Finally let me leave you with a quote that is close to my heart personally, and that sums up my feeling of American Sniper the film:War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.

Clint Eastwood embraces Chris Kyle's toxic ideas,"Three weeks into American Sniper's record-breaking release, you likely already have an opinion on the film, even if you haven't seen it. In a tweet, comedian Seth Rogen famously compared it to ""the movie that's showing in the third act ofInglourious Basterds,"" whereas documentarian Michael Moore called it a ""mess of a film."" The debate has largely focused on the portrayal of Chris Kyle, American Sniper's protagonist. Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall depict him as an ""anguished soul"" (in the words of author Max Blumenthal), torn between saving his country and the weight of deciding who deserves to die.But the real-life Kyle was anything but tortured and morally conflicted. The Guardian's Lindy West (also a contributor at the Daily Dot) reminds us that Kyle was ""a racist who took pleasure in dehumanizing and killing brown people."" Kyle's only regret was that he didn't kill more.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
One-Sided History,"American Sniper is a biopic of Chris Kyle who served the US military during the war in Iraq, with his skills leading him to a reputation as their most lethal sniper, by the amount of kills. As the human inside, we see him as an obvious patriot, while struggling with a conflict of being haunted by war. Summing that information up is what mostly justifies the entirety of the film, but even so, it's still not kind of enough. There might be more compelling stories to tell within the biography of this man, surpassing the film's common view to him as an American hero. The war itself is also portrayed as one-sided which makes it less groundbreaking. While the craft and the acting are strong enough to keep up the film's value, it still doesn't hide the fact that there is something lacking in this character study.There has been several controversies in Chris Kyle's career that didn't make it to this biopic, the film's perspective to the soldier is his heroism, how much he is committed to fight and die for his country. The big love for one's nation is an obvious trait defining a US soldier, as well as suffering the usual condition of conforming himself into war, almost forgetting how to live normally with his family. The movie does well examining this side of the character, especially when it shows the effects of war within his humanity. But the ordeal only goes beyond the reminder of the jolted pain and noise of warfare once and however gets easily resolved. A better exploration of this conflict is an opportunity left out hanging, but what it has shown is already well depicted anyway. The movie probably hails too much to the soldier which keeps repeating his praise and only leaves his forgiving flaws.The war, while excitingly directed, gets an underwhelming treatment. The battle never gets a shade of gray, the enemies are basically just bad guys willing to kill without any remorse, no matter how young or old they are. Not that this is a big deal for war cinema, but this is basically just typical, that it could have been way effective if they're mostly faceless. The other soldiers don't get the development they needed for us to remember or actually care for them as characters. Luckily, the action is expertly handled, brimming a lot of tension around the battlefield, as bullets fly sometimes unpredictably, also showing how their actions affects the people outside their fight. The moral dilemma of taking down someone only comes if the target is a child, which is once again typical, but still remains compelling to bring pressures to the Sniper. Bradley Cooper does well as Chris Kyle, living up with the man's patriotism and strong will.American Sniper doesn't really dare to go beyond to what has praised the soldier, we do see his flaws as a human, but the most questionable ones are mostly left out implied. Great biopics often tend to challenge the figure, but here he is noble, nothing more and nothing less. It can be both acceptable and not, but the craft and talent still spares a lot of excellent achievement, which makes it quite gripping. The film seems to avoid too much serious criticism, but then this is a story of patriotism and seeking beyond that might be too much to ask for.",,Anonymous,Biography
Twin themes of biography and tragedy fight for your attention,"A technically perfect film but c'mon you knew that even before the title rolled. Eastwood, formerly the #1 film star in the world (which makes me how old?) knows more about framing a shot than most other directors have forgotten.It is above all else a biography, and those are not common in Tinseltown anymore. The rules for bios are different. There was George C Scott as Patton and Burt Lancaster as Jim Thorpe ... etc.These were not dramas. These were not entertainment. They were ..... shadows of what was.One of the problems with bios is that they tend to be tied to the era of the of the main character and that too limits commercial long term appeal.Which is why even now the Biography channel has made more bios than Hollywood ever did ... or ever will.And it is also a tragedy. On many levels. On the obvious level (the ending, no spoilers). And on the metaphysical level. One has to wonder how kind history will be to the Iraq incursion 50 years from now? A lot of things change over time. We work the Germans and Japanese today without any problem. WW2 films do not have the popularity they used to. So where will American Sniper be in 50 years? Just asking.The acting is understated because that is what you do in a bio. Miller is stunning even without her usual blonde hair.Almost a guilty pleasure in its own way. Just like Kyle, who kept going back in-country without knowing why, this film will haunt you for days after you watch it.And you won't quite know why either.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper,"Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Back home to his wife and kids after four tours of duty, however, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.American Sniper is directed by the one and only Clint Eastwood and stars Bradley Cooper. In fact Cooper completely deserves his nomination for best actor in a leading role, he is terrific in this film and gives an excellent performance. Plus, the cinematography does look very good, action sequences are fairly well handled, there is definitely some suspense and heart pounded scenes as well. There are a lot of controversies surrounding this film, in the fact that a lot of people don't really think that this man should be idolised because of some of the things he has said on his own biography. What I liked is that this movie doesn't glorify war with the usual American honor and medals. The movie first trailer, with this kid carrying a RKG grenade, was the most intense trailer I've ever seen. The question is do I shoot him or not? Those decisions are one big/important key theme of the film and the fact that it's weighing down on this man; because no matter who you are you can't go to war, pull a trigger, have someone across from you die and don't feel anything. You do. It shows how ugly and damaging it is for a person. However Eastwood's approach of this story is a little too black and white as the subject matter is kind of a grey area. The movie itself does not explore any of that, it basically depicts him as a perfect war hero who rescued a lot of people lives but there is this downwards spiral in which the more he takes tours and the more he loses himself. There is this dark hidden story of this man who's deeply damage. It doesn't properly get into the more deep and darker aspect of what PTSD can do to someone and how it can truly affect a family. Some scenes show that Kyle is a wounded man but it doesn't get once again in the emotional core of it. Do you remember this clown from The Hungover? You can be sure that this man is going to stick around for a couple more decades.Overall American Sniper is a well directed and acted war epic drama looking at certain point of a The Legend' life without truly exploring the depth of his emotional damage and PTSD.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cooper shines in Eastwood's imperfect war drama,"American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle, an Iraqi war veteran and Navy SEAL who during four tours of duty became known as America's most deadly sniper. A good 'ol boy from Texas who spent much of his early adulthood without purpose, attempting to be a cowboy and getting into fights. This all changes when our embassy's are bombed in Africa and the American public first hears of Al-Qaeda. Kyle finds his purpose and enlists in the Navy.Bradley Cooper is excellent as Kyle and deserving of his third consecutive Oscar nod. The rest of the cast of primarily unknowns performs well under the steady direction of Clint Eastwood. Make no mistake that, although this is a tale of duty and sacrifice, Eastwood's conservative leanings are more than readily apparent. Also, the fact that it is based on Kyle's own book leaves us with a feeling we aren't being told the whole story, or at least not objectively.Unfortunately, many people have a difficult time separating the soldier who is doing his job and following orders from the politics that sent him or her there. This clouds their view of what for the most part is an entertaining and well crafted film.We feel for his family as they miss him each time he gets deployed and how they cope when Kyle comes home, struggling to find normalcy. Kyle is besieged with the sounds and visions of the battlefield when home and consistently dwells on his unfinished business overseas.The combat scenes are well done and impactful. However, the constant reminder that he is ""a legend"" in the military community, from people he meets at home and abroad, gets to be a little tiresome after a while. I also thought his personal battle against a skilled Iraqi sharpshooter named ""Mustafa"" was a little ham-handed.In the end Eastwood crafts a film that effectively shows the horrors of combat and how those horrors deeply affect the soldier's home life. I leave the decision of whether Kyle is an all-American Hero or perhaps something else, up to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Incredible, breathtaking movie","I hardly take the time to review movies, but I had to review this movie...I watched American Sniper in the very front row of the movie theater because it was sold out and we had a large group. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and my eyes hurt from sitting that close....and this movie was worth all of it. I was so sincerely moved by this movie and the acting was incredible. I can't even understand the negative reviews from some people. I was reading someone's review complaining about how this was like all the other war movies like the Hurt Locker. This statement is false. This movie was based about a specific Navy SEAL's life. Do you know how many movies there are about football or sports? Do you know how many movies there are about superheros? Just because there are many movies made about similar topics, doesn't mean that it's the same and doesn't mean that they aren't all unique and great in there own way. This movie made me want to know more about Chris Kyle and made me understand a little bit better about how much our soldiers sacrifice and how much the war affects them. Bradley Cooper was amazing in this movie. I think this was his best role yet. He was so believable. Clint Eastwood has done it again...He is such a talented director. This was one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth the Watch,"Reading through so many reviews on here and it is simply making my blood boil. Most of them, I have found to be more personal opinion based on the guys actual life and/or profession and their personal views on the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, that any movie review is completely obscure. The reviews are in fact more propaganda than the movie in which they are reviewing.So here is MY movie review: #1. This movie is a typical ""War"" Movie. It has action scenes that are filled with suspense that will keep you engaged. #2. The Role of Chris Kyle was convincingly played throughout most of the film. #3. Director Clint Eastwood, does take an artistic view and adaptation of Chris Kyle's Autobiography, American Sniper, to which I think shares between a 50 and 60% likeness to the book. #4. The ending of the movie, does evoke emotion and admirable respect for a man who would have died for his country, brother frogmen, and the Marines that he frequently provided overwatches for.I think that the movie would have been better had they stayed more with Chris Kyle's words, than with these artistic directions that had augmented the story toward more of a propaganda role. He shouldn't have made Chris' decision to join the military in response to political causes, but should have acutely and astutely shown us that Chris had always been a patriot and had been considering the military as a viable career option even before he joined up with the rodeo.Even with these things, the movie is still worth the watch.It is important to know before watching that this movie isn't about convincing anyone over the political aspects of the Iraq war. It isn't about why we got into the war or whether it was justified or not. And I think that is just as well, because in life, Chris Kyle didn't really care if it was a ""justified"" war, or a politically correct war, as some would want to judge it as. For him, the U. S. Government, called him into war, pulled him out onto the front lines to perform the job that the government has trained him to do, which is to kill enemies of our nation and of our soldiers. He put it very clearly. He didn't care about a single Iraqi. He wasn't over there to protect them, or to bring democracy to their nation. He was there to save the butts of the Marines, Army and other SEALs from immediate harm and/or certain death.I have found it odd over the months that so many people empathize more with 160 people he killed than the unknown quantity of American lives that he has saved. It wasn't killing or the thrill of that made him shoot. It was saving the lives of his team, Marines, and Army, anyone he was watching over. They lived because HE had their backs. Every time he killed an Iraqi with an RPG, he brought home another soldier to their family. That is why he didn't want to quit. He found it intolerable to stand on the sideline and watch his brothers die, especially when he had the ability to save them.People are content with labeling him, and sure at times all labels apply from the right perspective. But I am sure that the service men, he helped to save, I bet their families are forever grateful that he didn't hesitate to pull that trigger.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A patriotic biopic which is not quite captivating as it unfolds, but Bradley Cooper's committed performance alone makes it worth a shot.","As the closing credits roll, I believe the American audience would be stunned by chronicles of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American History. Now will the Non-Americans be equally stunned by the experience? Of course. I wouldn't say equally, but remarkably enough depending upon your sentiments about army-people. American Sniper puts forth the patriotism and heroism of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who is gifted with enormous talent and accuracy in shooting. With record number of Sniper kills associated with him, he saved countless lives on the battlefield and and had soon become a 'legend'. Now I don't want to draw any comparison with what is depicted in the movie and what actually happened, I will just review it as an independent film.Chris's father told him and his brother to always be the 'sheepdog', the protector who will go to any extent to provide protection from the evil. Initially Chris was just a cowboy, but after watching US embassy attacks in Kenya on TV he decides he has got more to his life and joins Navy SEALs. At the same time he marries Taya (Sienna Miller) a woman who initially said to him she would never marry a Navy SEAL until she falls for Chris. His first deployment was in Iraq, where he faces a tough situation where a woman and kid try to attack them with grenade. With his pinpoint accuracy he takes both them down as his first kills leaving their troops safe. It does look plain and simple on screen, but from the point of view of the man about to pull the trigger whose decision is going to decide another person's fate its a whole different scenario. Over his first tour, Chris kills numerous people and keeps getting more and more recognition. He talks to his Wife who is pregnant over phone time to time. After returning from his tour, he and Taya have a boy. Despite being home with his family, Chris still faces the trauma of war zone and at the same time has determination to protect his country. After the 9/11 he is more determined to go back on field and goes on second tour to Iraq. But this time his wife worried about whether he will ever return. Plus, the enemy camp has deadly sniper who was an Olympic medalist and now an opposition for Kyle.Clint Eastwood, as the director at age of 84 brings the realism of war ideally. The war action and shooting sequences are nicely done and edited. Technically the film is really strong, but I wish they did something better than the poor CGI Sandstorm in last part. Based on autobiography with same name, American Sniper does good character study of Chris Kyle and his emotions. Bradley Cooper seems to have put in a lot of effort for building the body apt for the role. Also his expressions on the battlefield have necessary aggression and the touch of conscience at the same time.I doubted the Academy for his nomination, but I was wrong. While character of Chris Kyle gets the necessary focus, but there is nothing interesting to talk about anyone else. Taya his wife, does nothing more than worry about Kyle most of the time. As for soldiers on battlefield, most of the people change over the different missions, leaving Chris the only character to deeply root for. The screenplay though I thought was not as great as the performance and is quite generic. Apart from the few war fight sequences there isn't much meat to fill up its run time. Still it runs for 132 minutes which felt like divided into 4 parts, each one for his each tour to Iraq. And each part starts becoming less and less interesting than the previous.I think we should have seen more development on Chris character when he is back home than on field. Also the war tension is missing mostly apart from few scenes.Like the one moment when Chris has to decide whether to shoot a small kid who tries handle a grenade launcher and he wishing badly that kid drops it, the scene was quite intense. There is lot of violence, one scene was difficult to handle, where a terrorist kills a boy drilling through his head. Oh God! Captures the savagery of the kind animals there are in this world. Another thing I did not like is ridiculously less use of background music, the experience would have been a lot more intense and filled with lot more emotions with a good score.In the end, American Sniper is not very captivating all the way. Bradley Cooper's performance adds the necessary depth to character of Chris Kyle elegantly. While rest of the things don't match up, there is abundance of patriotism. Even if this is overused in films a lot, American Sniper works as a good biopic which doesn't decentralize from its main character. Definitely worth a watch.RATING:[3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
It seems that a lot of you missed the point of the movie...,"I've watched the movie like 30mins before now. Let me say that movie isn't mind blowing, special effects are almost void...but it is a bio, not an action. Another, the movie isn't anything special, but it is hard to make a movie according to some storyline that has been happened. #1 - some people complain about storyline not existing...hm, storyline is pretty solid, the life of Chris Kyle. I had no trouble into getting a grip on it. #2 - cant expect a movie to be war neutral. Movie is about Chris Kyle, Chris Kyle was an American Sniper, it is perfectly normal that movie is an America's show. #3 - this is a bio! Cant be displayed with scenes that woulda make it more war neutral - that was the war time of Kyles life! It would've been stupid if you, as the director play a scenes in this movie that are about killing Americans. Simple. #4 - some guy said ""...redneck saw 9/11, redneck applied for army..."" like the director coulda changed it. That HAPPENED! That Kyle did! If you do not like that, don't hate a movie, hate Kyle. #5- if you do not like a movie that pictures an National Hero in the patriotic way, do not watch it...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspector Harry takes on Iraq,"American is a highly detestable film with not one single redeeming feature. The so-called 'hero' is depicted as a simple-minded good for nothing who can only find a goal and a bit of excitement in his empty life when he kills Iraqis in their own country, generally safely hidden on a rooftop - and he does not really know why. All Iraqis are depicted as one-dimensional, cowardly, cunning, double-crossing characters who betray their guests, families, and fellow-countrymen.Kyle himself does not undergo the slightest change over the 2 hours of the film - he never asks himself a single question. He only suffers bouts of PTSD which are supposed to raise compassion among the spectators but of course no compassion should be felt for the 200 Iraqi citizens he has ruthlessly executed.Let us now imagine the reverse situation. Let us imagine an Iraqi film called 'Iraqi sniper' in which the hero carries a copy of the Quran and takes random shots at US soldiers invading his country. Then the film would be booed and hissed, unanimously rejected as a shameful instrument of Islamic propaganda and the main character would be called a terrorist. Yet, a half-wit who shoots a fawn at age 8 and a child 25 years later is hailed as a hero. This is truly baffling.American Sniper feels like the good old 80's again, with a simplistic Reaganian/Rambo II/Inspector Harry ideology. Even the cinematography seems to be stuck in a time warp with not one single interesting shot or angle. The director has obviously gone past his sell-by date. He should watch and get some inspiration from The Hurt Locker or Black Hawk Down and the likes. Or just retire. How the same director can come up with Gran Torino and then with this hagiography of a nitwit is truly mind boggling.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A riveting story of the 'legend',"Aiming for the deer through the bushes, young Chris Kyle quickly learns the importance of getting the job done and the honor in being a guard dog of the sheep. These humble origins turn him into a cowboy who competes at various rodeos with his brother until he learns about the bombings at the US Embassies in Africa. An urgent desire to serve for the nation with his remarkable skill as a marksman, gets him enlisted for training as a SEAL. Clint Eastwood yet again indulges into the mindset of a man, a violent one, whose troubles during war were brought back home. Completely avoiding the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle's stories and claims, Eastwood chooses to remain true to his achievements on field and their repercussions back home. 'American Sniper' will evoke an enduring sense of patriotism for the men who win and lose at wars in faraway lands and concern for the trauma that seldom leaves them.As he takes aim for a headshot on an Iraqi boy carrying a bomb given by his mother, a flashback into Chris Kyle's past reveals the origins of this man of violence. After negating the threat to the convoy, Chris and his team team are assigned to take down an Al-Qaeda leader and his second-in-command, the butcher. Plans with an informant fail terribly as an enemy sniper renders the SEALs helpless and they barely manage an escape. Chris goes on to kill numerous potential threats, earning him the weight of being the 'legend'; a title he would rather keep undisclosed from his wife. Taya (Sienna Miller) is a caring wife and mother who reminds Chris that apart from being a hero for his country, he is a father and a husband. With a bounty on his head declared by the enemy, Chris departs from his wife and new- born son for his second tour that would bring success to his team against the butcher. By his third tour though, the enemy sniper 'Mustafa' causes serious damage to the SEAL team and its morale as Chris continues to remain edgy and uncomfortable on his visits back home. There is a responsibility upon Chris' shoulders that is beyond just that of reporting for duty. Perched on rooftops overlooking the movement of convoys and teams of Marines and SEALS, Chris eliminates any threat to his team. He thus feels that he is entrusted with saving the lives of every single soldier on field. While at home, playing with his kids or watching TV, Chris is haunted by the notion of the being constantly at war, trying to save those he couldn't.The fourth tour to Iraq would require the American Sniper to take down the threat of Mustafa deep inside enemy lines. Motivated by revenge for the loss of his friends, Chris takes a seemingly impossible yet very risky shot at the Syrian Olympic shooter and exposes his team to an astounding number of insurgents that swarm into their building. With a fast approaching sandstorm, not fast enough backup of forces and depleting ammunition, the SEAL team is faced with more than just the enemy's gunfire. This thrilling sequence is brilliantly directed by Clint Eastwood who doesn't shy away from incessant bullet firing and other imminent dangers.As Kyle calls it a day, he takes the advice of his wife and sees an army doctor who recommends interacting with soldiers who have just returned from active duty. Through their physical and mental injuries, Chris' compassion serves as a purpose to life after war but he could only find peace for a while.The engagement with the war in Iraq makes the audience want to return to the battle field as much as Chris desires to. Eastwood takes us right in the middle of the battles through the eyes of the sniper and behind his life and death decisions at the spur of the moment. Bradley Cooper's sincere portrayal enables the director to keep it real and engaging. With his Texan accent and cowboy swag, he pulls off a mellow character who transforms into America's most lethal marksman and a struggling family man. This has to be Bradley Cooper's role of a lifetime. Sienna Miller's expressive emotions create conflicts for Chris but behind it all is her love and concern as his wife.Tom Stern's cinematography in the tense war zones as well as the gloomy surroundings of Chris' return to home portrays the environments as they are for the characters. Combined with the visual effects and stunts, it creates some riveting action sequences that are among the best of Eastwood's films. As a director who cares about the human element in his stories, much attention was paid to depicting Kyle's struggles. Yet, for cinematic reasons the director chooses to overlook Kyle's interaction on media upon his return, rather leaving him with recovery from the post-war stress.The up-to-date individual and readers of Kyle's best-seller would know how it all ends but Eastwood's culmination of the narrative is genuinely moving. He engages the audience with Kyle's character so well that the end leaves us hanging in disbelief. Yet, there is an overwhelming sense of pride and patriotism that builds up to it with the pin-drop silence in the theater in the last few minutes being a testament to Chris Kyle's heroism and Clint Eastwood's remarkable direction of powerful human stories.8.689 on a scale of 1-10.",,Anonymous,Biography
I may be on the otherside of the planet but Bradley Cooper can still get a head shot on me.,"This film was surrounded by hype and the word ""Oscar"" has been thrown at it a lot, however it lacked something. At times it tried to be a classic Iraqi war film with houses and cars blowing up left, right and centre. In others it was slow and showed the impact of war on the soldiers and families. If one theme had simply been explored then the film probably could have blown us all away however it felt as if it tried be everything. Tried too hard to cater to the masses. That's not always a problem but can leave you wanting more. Wanting to know more about other characters. Wanting to know more about the relationships that have been built.The film was enjoyable throughout but maybe I've just seen one too many war films that this one didn't quite capture me as much as I was hoping.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good film but nothing exceptional,"Massive Eastwood fan and this is a good war film, gets into the mind of this American hero, but it isn't as good as the Hurt Locker, won't be winning Eastwood any Oscars, and does not have anything extra or special about it. What it does portray is the madness and the insanity of it all and where they was no end objective in what was trying to be achieved and of which I don't think anyone t this day knows what was intended, and that comes across well in the film and the struggle that injured vets have, and the question as to what was it all for.Good film, but does not have that bit extra special which often Eastwood can bring (Letters from Iwo Jima was his touch of excellence on war and a film that should have won the Oscar than an inferior remake of a Hong Kong film).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Deeply Personal Piece Of Bravura Film Making,"Clint Eastwood's powerful meditation on war fits squarely with the themes that have informed his body of work, primarily the belief that with the absence of God, it is up to the individual to do God's work. There's a lot going on in Eastwood's and screenwriter Jason Hall's examination of Chris Kyle, considered the most ""successful"" military sniper in American history (and portrayed by Bradley Cooper in a performance that elevates him from above-average to outstanding): he's a patriot but also an employee, a man who has found his career and is simply doing his job. There is some very graphic imagery to reinforce war's hellish nature but there's also an awful lot of banality: Kyle and his colleagues spend time during lulls in their missions discussing the mundane things that people typically talk about during work breaks. Eastwood and Hall are clearly admirers of their subject (the film's final images prove that point) and they do give him the benefit of the doubt (the film's sole flaw is that it acknowledges Kyle's PTSD while stateside yet by the conclusion he's inexplicably cured), but they're realists when it comes to the job he's hired to do and make no bones about his lack of concern about the morality of his mission. (As one character astutely points out, he carries a Bible with him but never opens it.) The film is galvanizing in its combat scenes; they move with an immediacy and adrenaline that surprises you, considering Eastwood's age. But he never blinks. Tom Stern provides the excellent cinematography, filming with a brightness that sharpens the action. (The film's final battle, though, takes place during a sandstorm, blanching and obscuring everything--it's harrowing.) Like all great Eastwood films, ""American Sniper"" stays with you after it's over, encouraging you to meditate about everything it's trying to tell you (it's about a lot more than has been discussed here) and inviting you to argue back at it. It's a conversation well worth having.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A neutered Hurt Locker,"Back then, I really loved Hurt Locker, for its depiction of hopelessness, randomness of death (remember Guy Pierce dying in the first 15 minutes?) and the detailed portrayal of human feelings through action. I truly believe it deserved the Oscar and I truly felt the obscenity of war watching it.Now American Sniper is sort of the same, great direction, great acting, famous director, story about the war in Iraq. However, it has no balls. The Jihadi are all the same, mindless faceless barbarians attacking and killing from hate alone. The Americans are all nice guys with a life back home, protecting each other. The lead actor is a walking cliché: the Texan who is taught by his father to believe in God, shoot and protect the weak and goes to war when he sees a bomb attack at an American embassy abroad. Basically all characters are cardboard.Within minutes you know that it will all going to be a propaganda piece. This movie lets every American redneck have a picture of Chris Kyle on the wall above their bed and to want to kill some ""Hajjis"". Eastwood defended his film as antiwar, but I call BS. The hero of the film went to Iraq 4 times and the movie kind of lets the viewer believe he would have returned if it weren't for this wife and children nagging on him. The only antiwar piece in the entire story is in that one line of text at the end of the film.Now, I don't know what Chris Kyle wrote in his book, nor do I know if the depiction of his character was accurate in both book and film. But if this film was supposed to be antiwar, it failed miserably.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not Eastwood's Best But Not His Worst,"In my opinion, I don't think Eastwood has made a great movie since Gran Torino. Changeling and Invictus are good; J. Edgar and Jersey Boys are okay films. However, those movies did not give me an impact like Gran Torino. Unfortunately, American Sniper did not do that but I still overall enjoyed this movie.Clint Eastwood does a good job on giving suspense. I could feel the tension with the audience members and a sigh of relief when the movie immediately does to another scene. The film does it consistently and it really doesn't get tiresome. Even though I could feel the tension, I really wasn't on the edge of my seat at all like the audience. I think the only reason why I didn't feel this way was because I already knew about Chris Kyle. Those who don't know anything about him were probably more interested than me.One thing that I really appreciate about this movie is that it shows the effect of what happens after you leave the war. I mean I felt bad for this guy many time because it was haunting what he was going through. However, there were scenes that involved Sienna Miller's character and those scenes broke my heart. I won't spoil it but goodness it is heart wrenching.Bradley Cooper did an excellent job. How he gained weight for the role and talking with that thick slurred accent helped me feel like I was not looking at Bradley Cooper. It's not my favorite performance (it's American Hustle) but he did do a good job. I don't believe his performance is Oscar worthy though. I just thought there were other performances that I thought were better. Sienna Miller also did a great job. I feel like she's under looked because of Cooper and also because there fantastic female performances. I'm telling you though she is good and those scenes that I mentioned earlier will prove my point.I don't believe this film really deserves a nomination for best picture or actor. The movie itself and Cooper's performance just did not hit me with an impact like some other movies and actors. However, American Sniper does an excellent job on showing how war can traumatize those who fought for our nation. There were some scenes that felt incredibly long, but there were also moments that were heartbreaking. If you don't know the story of Chris Kyle, then you are definitely in for a ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rather disappointing...,"I enjoyed the cinematography, color grading, and sound design of ""American Sniper"" a lot.However, the film's heavy glorification of the American military detracted from the authenticity and impact of war in general. While the movie depicts the protagonist's struggle with PTSD, it frames this more as an individual issue rather than addressing it systemically.

Have yet to read one accurate review of this film..,"Every review seen by this author has either brutally criticized the film for all the wrong reasons, completely missing more troubling mistakes, or falsely promoted the film as patriotic, pro-war or anti-Muslim, which is also wrong, completely missing Eastwood's point. It is as if the film is only seen through a political lens regardless of being critical or supportive.The film is artfully produced and saturated with a sense of futility, empty heroism, dread and the soul sucking nature of war. Despite Eastwood's political conservatism his work and particularly stylistic choices have always been great. This author approached his latest film with trepidation but ultimately agreed with Eastwood's statement that it is an antiwar film- one that dramatizes how innocent deaths are just a fact of war, how many of the ""insurgents"" may be ordinary people trying to survive, assumed guilty at a critical moment, and killed, and how even the most venerated soldiers can come back in a state of spiritual crisis. The film shows nothing but horrible events carried out by all sides and a gravitational downward spiral inside the central character, who meets his fatal end.The film's popularity with the right wing is reminiscent of the way skinheads showed up in large numbers to ""Romper Stomper"" a 1980's Australian film that was a scathing indictment of skinheads. Maybe fans are drawn to any dramatization of a certain character and scenario, even if the message is a critical one in order to re-enforce an identity or seek camaraderie (ie a pro-gun or anti-Muslim social phenomenon).What is wrong with ""American Sniper"" is far more complex than lionizing pathological bigotry. Whatever Eastwood has done wrongly he has not done that. The screenplay itself is rather good. It is not pro-war. It does *not* elevate religious bigotry, it just depicts it plainly. It does not denigrate Iraqis in any way, it just shows the US military doing it. It shows that plainly and without bias. Anyone with a moral foundation will be repulsed to see it, regardless of how that callousness is perpetrated by the central characters. Part of Eastwood's point is there is no moral compass in war scenarios. You have to find your own way through the events in the movie just as someone might in reality. There are few indicators in reality (except bad ones), and Eastwood offers none to his viewers, yet Kyle's ultimate fate is the telling of the tale.Eastwood's mistake, possibly inadvertent, was making Kyle seem like a reasonable person. Kyle's own autobiography may indicate he was not.Eastwood depicts Kyle as an anti-hero, as opposed to a blustering or pathological islamophobe capable of killing at will. He depicts Kyle as someone beginning to wrestle with some form of remorse for his actions or what he had been a part of. This is actually more insidious or propagandistic than showing a plain, ugly truth but every reviewer misses this possibility (even Chris Hedges).Eastwood may have underestimated Kyle's martyr-like stature to some people. Perhaps in order to make a more meaningful and relevant story, he cleaned up the central character and inadvertently white-washed Kyle, because who would care about the story of a patriotic psycho? Is it possible Eastwood did not know of Kyle's popularity, his subsequent popularity if the film did well, or did Kyle became popular as the film was being released, changing the social context of the film?Whatever the case, Eastwood claims it's an anti-war film and it clearly is, but on the other hand Eastwood should make a statement about Kyle and why he erased whatever pathological ugliness existed in his biography while retaining his name. That is what he did wrong. On it's own, Eastwood's story is a good, realistic, relevant war fiction but regarding the real Kyle it is probably a dangerous, misleading white-wash. It might have the effect of lionizing the real, controversial Chris Kyle as a hero not based on his life but based on the film. His real biography probably does not support his heroism (or even anti-heroism).There is the question of Kyle's real actions vs. macho bluster, but his writing has taken on an independent effect at this point. Eastwood needs to explain why he took such a possible license and diversion from Kyle's own biography. The popularity of the film should not translate to popularity for Kyle if it is wildly inaccurate.",,Anonymous,Biography
it is a shade pathetic the sensation falls upon this ill-devised picture,"Amid its unanticipated parade into this year's Oscar race (6 nominations including BEST PICTURE and BEST LEADING ACTOR) as an extremely late contender, and more astonishingly, its domestic box-office outburst since last week, Mr. Eastwood's biography of Chris Kyle, the most prolific Navy SEAL sniper, arrives to the fore in Egypt.The film stirs a massive controversy in the states albeit it has achieved a career peak for the octogenarian film legend, as there is a pungent odor of jingoism permeating the narrative, particularly centers on its defamatory depiction of Muslin race in the Iraqi war zone, what is exacerbating is that under the current international circumstances, it doesn't help to dissipate the acute prejudice in the stateside, pitifully, Eastwood could not been more open-minded in his well-executed anti-war drama.Conspicuously, this film is relentlessly sending an ant-war message from A to Z, but it could be shallowly misread as a bias propaganda simply because the whole perspective is from the slant of Americans, how perilous the front-line is, how the inner struggle comes to pester his conscience when Kyle (Cooper) is facing menaces from suicidal children and women, how devastating when the casualty befalls on your teammate, etc, while mistreating the middle east counterpart as canon fodder or barbarous murders (even towards their own kind).Back to home, Kyle (Cooper)'s PTSD symptoms are zoomed in on empathetically, from his withdrawn numbness stiffly obstructing a normal communication with his wife Taya (Miller), to his fitful violent behavior due to his hallucination or an aggressive paranoid towards the quotidian life, Kyle's hero-status is not a desirable one, when praised by a young veteran (a delightful cameo from Jonathan Groff), whose life he once saved, Kyle's robotic reaction potently suggests that it means nothing to him, even though he proudly proclaims that saving lives is the noble cause for his actions.Indeed, if one can discard the miasma of racial disrespect (frankly speaking, a very difficult task to pull off), Eastwood has made quite an engaging film to behold, the incontrovertible grip to his brainchild can be traced seamlessly through the horizon-widening hovering shots by DP Tom Stern, the stifling sound department throughout the taut action sequences, the life-or-death suspense within one trigger by its swift editing and an end-game retreat in a lifelike sand storm.Bradley Cooper gives a formidable performance here, a sea change in his physique is too evident to ignore, but Kyle's elusive persona doesn't proffer too much Oscar-worthy moments for his, we can only assume that Academy is still in the honeymoon period with him, three nominations in a row is an overachiever (especially considering the über- competitive candidates this year) which seems to boomerang within certain time (as the case for my ginger goddess Amy Adams). Sienna Miller, whose career has been in the stagnant water for years, certainly receives a stimulating boost this year, after a small part in another Oscar-hopeful FOXCATCHER (2014), her role as a supportive wife pans out convincingly without any bells and whistles to enliven Taya to be a character with any noteworthy novelty, only to testify she has honed up her acting chops and can shoulder on some more challenging projects now.American SNIPER cannot evade to be compared with Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER (2008, 8/10), which is far more humane and non judgmental in its integrity. Theoretically it could have been a top dog in its game, but Eastwood's right-wing stand does taint its wholesome awesomeness, however as far as profit is concerned, we onlookers should not bark at the moon, it certainly eclipses everybody's expectations, there is no losers in this round, notwithstanding that it is a shade pathetic the sensation falls upon this ill-devised picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yawn,"Someday movies will stop getting praise for their ""patriotic undertones"". American Sniper is a fine movie. But by no means is at as good as people made it sound. If you said this movie wasn't good people asked if ""you didn't love 'Merica"".
Bradley Cooper did have a good performance despite the lazy writing. I don't often fall asleep during movies but I did both times watching this. So if you're looking for a movie that really is just another ad for the military complex of America, then check it out! But don't expect anything fantastic, it's a very low 6/10. It would be a 4 if it weren't for addressing mental impacts of war.
And if you do watch this, please don't buy it. Don't encourage Clint Eastwood to be involved in more movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true American hero,"I thought this movie was powerful. It portrayed the military man he was, how he had to adapt to civilian life again, the struggles of war. For him to then be killed by a man he was trying to help, who was also dealing with post war mental health. It shows the strains and stresses of what war is really like. I believe this movie to be excellent and moving. Sad ending for such a great Soldier. Reading some of the reviews, surprise me. I wonder how these guys would cope 1. Just with war in general. 2. Being a sniper which you have to battle with your mind playing tricks, being 100% alert the whole time, whilst laying in your urine and poo. My hat is off to the man and it's so sad he died.

America needs to move on?,"American Sniper's apparent banner message is that America needs to move on. Troops are coming home to live among civilians again; understand their experience. But a lot of the time it seems to forget this intention or even to have one. It would like to move on, but do so with no questions asked.It has a job to do delivering a dramatic war film and manages to dissuade instinctive repulsion for long distance anonymous kills and portray its protagonist as a protector and saver of lives. But in choosing to ignore the context and causes of America's wars in the middle east, as perhaps it must do to survive, the film plays like a heroic western from a lost golden age before anyone asked ""what about the Indians?"" As with Zero Dark Thirty, neutrality allows home team xenophobes who like to see things in black and white to read it as the story of a just war against far away bad guys. There is a cruel Iraqi villain and first person shooter POVs of Iraqi skulls popping like cream soda. Those looking for hate porn can find it.

Clint Eastwood Brings us another great movie !,"American sniper it's a story about Navi seal Sniper Chris Kyle who had 160 confirmed kills from 250+ possible. The movie doesn't try to show why America invaded Iraq ,was it right or wrong , it doesn't show any political stuff that has to do with this situation . It's the story of Chris Kyle on only his . The movie is violent , disturbing and it captures the sense of sorrow around this story . IT shows Chris as ordinary man not a superhero or a legend , a man who is very patriotic and believes in his purpose to protect his country. Film shows how war does affect soldiers and their families after they come home will it be enemies you killed , violence you saw or comrades you didn't save .The only problem i have with the movie is they showed Chris Kyle a little more anti-war person than he really was , who after going all this still kept loyal to what he believed . Eastwood focused more on his humanity side which i have to admit worked damn well . Bradley Cooper gives an amazing Oscar worthy performance , best one in his career , he transformed not only physically but mentally too. Directing is very good everything works around main character , helping us to understand him more and using close up shots letting Cooper Shine as a diamond . overall movie is shot very well battle scenes are real and very very intense sometimes you just hold your breath , the stories transition between Iraq and U.S. is done in right moments so the story wont suffer from it . the movie keeps good balance between action and drama and the cinematography is really good something not so usual for Eastwood tho a little to colorful for his movies one of the best movies of Clint Eastwood and definitely of the year go watch it",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unnessary political propaganda in real life story of an American Hero,"American Sniper is a must-see for those who are craving for the powerful war movies. Clint Eastwood's six academy nominated film is worth watching overall. Bradley Cooper's portrayal as America's most lethal sniper is undoubtedly his best performance yet. His dedication of changing his physique and getting the vocal similar to Chris Kyle is simply impressive. He totally deserves this year's Oscar nomination. The story telling is quite compelling, yet it occasionally fills with unnecessary political propaganda in the life story of the ""Legend"". All technologies in making of this film will make everything seemed so realistic which will make you feel with the Iraq war experiences as if it is happening just right in front of you. Overall, ""American Sniper"" is definitely not a feel good movie as it has some tragic events which are currently happening in this world. Combining with the brilliant sound effects of intense shootings and realistic cinematic shots will make you to be on the edge of your seat during the entire running time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's rough out there, even in real life.","""That was evil like I've never seen before."" Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper)Besides The Hurt Locker, I can't think of another film that better expresses the frustrations and horrors of the war in Iraq than Clint Eastwood's American Sniper. Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is called ""Legend"" by his fellow troops for his sniper expertise, 160 confirmed kills to be precise.Based on Kyle's writings, the film is executed in a stark, realistic fashion that Kathryn Bigelow would approve. The colors are bled out, like the camouflage desert uniforms; the dust swirls at times like the fog of war, and true to the genre, the middle-class home life is less than glamorous with a wife clamoring for her husband's return. Taya (Sienna Miller) was seduced by Chris after meeting him in a bar (even though she avowed no interest in the ""self-centered pricks""), a metaphor for her seduction into thinking she could marry a SEAL and have a normal family life.The abnormal life is couched in four tours for him, each one progressively distancing him from his family. He feels the obligation to protect them and his buddies from evil. Having not accepted the fiction of WMD's, where some other soldiers have, he doggedly pursues the enemy the best way he knows how, as a sniper, and a very good one at that.The battle scenes in Fallujah are even more horrific than those in Fury because the enemy is not in tanks but hiding in civilian clothes. It is virtually impossible sometimes to tell the good guys from the bad. For example in an early sequence, Chris is faced with the ultimate sniper horror: a mother and child walk suspiciously toward a group of soldiers, and he must decide if they are hostile or not. Even our cool-hearted protagonist has to pause in situations like this.Eastwood has again shown that a director need not be young to be relevant and powerful. American Sniper will make you happy we have just about left the Iraq theater, but it will not make you feel safe for the rest of our engagements in the mid-east.",,Anonymous,Biography

American Sniper Review,"American Sniper is an absolute masterpiece. It was an amazing story about SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and his 160 confirmed kills and his struggle to leave behind the war, and to balance his family.Bradley Cooper gave an absolutely Oscar worthy performance and Clint Eastwood showed again his true directing talents. The film is action packed, all while balancing a solid story and acting. Even our friendly neighborhood left wingers who don't support this war have to support Chris' service for this country, and respect how Eastwood and Cooper brought the characters and the story to life. It is a movie that truly hits the heart and makes you thankful for all you have.It's one of of the best war movies out there, it shows the struggle soldiers have with PTSD and it shows us why we're free, and the price paid for that freedom, all through the eyes of the legend Chris Kyle.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
American or Non-American,"American Sniper (2014)( Clint Eastwood) By Hossein Aghaee. American or Non-AmericanFinally last night I got a chance to watching the last film of the Mr Clint Eastwood. (One of the my popular director) For me that Gran Torino (one of the Eastwood's Movies) always being in my top ten choice when I make a list for best movies that I have seen so far watching American sniper was a great shock. In Gran Torino distance between nations or better to say human more than any time seems shorter and shorter as far as Eastwood as an impatient American man who has experience war in Korea savior or better say sacrifice him for non-American boy from the same geography (east Asia)but in American Sniper Bradley Cooper in the role of Chris Kyle in response of adviser question that asks whether Sometimes think about 160 men that were killed in Iraq, Says more than that, it pains him to why more people are not killed to protect the lives of American soldiers. Eastwood in the final scene of Gran Torino sending him as the old man of story to the conscious death without having weapons for that non-American boy of story could live more comfortable. But in one of the American sniper scenes Chris Kyle in response to the cries of his wife who desperately wants him to stay with his American family rejected her request and perhaps killing Mustafa in his mind. It's time to put aside their weapons and ending unnecessary crisis in the world.Hossein Aghaee July 1394",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Suspenseful, Emotional, Real","This was an amazing movie and the book was as well. As for others saying that it was not true is a load of BS.Chris kyle was sued for slander but not because the story he told was untrue. Kyle was sued for saying in his book that he punched out a celebrity, and later in an interviews came out and said he was talking about Jesse Ventura. So Jesse Ventura sued Kyle and before the case was closed Kyle was murdered and then Ventura kept pressing charges against Chris Kyles widow and got 1.8 million dollars. Just because there was a case for slander doesn't mean it had anything to do with the movie. The untruths were resolved before the movie was made.On another note the movie was very emotional and suspenseful. It makes you realize how lucky we are to have our fellow Americans put there lives on the line everyday to protect us from terrorists.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A watchable movie but a very one sided view of the war in Iraq.,"The movie was very good and watchable no doubt, but not as good as it was hyped up to be.The Iraqi scenes were excellent and the home scenes took a while to understand, but, the story line of Iraq was a typically American view of this and every war, where the Americans are the good guys and the enemy are evil.The American one world view or one directional view of a conflict took over this movie. Some historical accuracy to give balance to the movie would have been better served for international viewing, but, the movie was never really created for an international audience as I see it.Bradley Cooper was excellent in the role but the director could have made the reality of the conflict and what occurred a fair bit more accurate.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What an incredible bad testimony to the US military, to honor such a failure and child slaughtering maniac as a ""hero"".Also the movie appears to be one of those super long commercials to lure young folks into serving in the army, fighting wars no one knows why, obediently serving the cash money brothers from wall street.Oh yeah i forgot: Allah Hu Akhbar!

Am I Supposed to Care for this Guy?,"My review for this film is not even going to revolve around my opinion on the real life Chris Kyle. Yes, he has said some horrible things, but that is not what my four stars are for. My four stars are for how horribly propaganda-filled this horrendous patriotic film is. Wow,I have never seen such a black and white picture view of any type of war in the first place. Didn't you all know that every single individual in Iraq is a terrorist, while every American is a pure saint? There are no grey lines here, because once you are in Iraq, every child, mother, and father is going to have a bomb strapped to them, at least according to this film.I also disliked how perfect Chris Kyle was portrayed in this film. Why is he so perfect? I mean I get it, his wife has so many struggles with him, but even when he is back at home, he happens to run into former veterans who praise him for being a war hero. Chris Kyle (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) was just awful, I'm sorry. He triggered me to no end. I also just love how he goes from cowboy to army man in what feels like seconds, all because of a news story on the TV. ""Look what they did to us,"" says Chris, the savior, Kyle. And then he joins the war, nice job!Also, I now it's a biopic, but the integration of his relationship was just bad. They had no chemistry until the last 20 minutes of the film. It was so laughable. The fact that this girl would fall in love with an ignorant, self-centered (and yes, him wanting to help others over his own family is self centered) person triggered me. This overly patriotic man has such a black and white picture of the world. It's America against the world, right??????? But yeah, the relationship was stupid and unrealistic.Also, the editing was atrocious and laughable. The passage of time in this film was so horribly done that I began to lose track of where we were in the story. The story goes from him being a cowboy, to him being in the army, to him impregnating his new wife, to him having a son, to him on his second tour, to him holding his newborn daughter, to him coming home yet again in like 30 minutes. It's so unbelievably stupid! And the editing will go from him shooting at a range to him kissing his wife to him at army training to him then having a kid. Like what was even going on? I understand the film is long already but couldn't we get some time to embrace some of the emotions?The action sequences were boring too. Some guy on IMDB described the film as a feature length version of the short Nazi propaganda sniper film found in Inglorious Basterds. This film was just so repetitive in the action, that I honestly could not even take it. I really didn't care about anybody who died and I didn't really feel any tension, except when kids were about to get shot or when bullets ricochet to people's faces.My final complaint, among many, is the use of a doll instead of a real life baby during a scene between Chris Kyle and his wife. It was so obvious it was a baby, and when they were handing the baby off to each other, it looks goofy as heck. I have never seen something look so fake. It looked like they were carrying some Baby 🍼 👶 Alive doll. If you can't accord a baby, why even include it?Also, when they got married, they announced Mr and Mrs. Chris Kyle??? What the heck? Is the wife's name Chris?Anyways, why do I give this film 4 stars instead of 1? Well, surprisingly enough, I found the last 20 minutes of the film to be surprisingly genuine and good. The wife and the husband had some chemistry, finally. I actually loved seeing Chris Kyle doing everything his wife has been begging for his him to do all of this wife. I loved seeing him finally have some intersection with his kids. It was honestly kind of beautiful. And the final scene and credits makes me wish the film developed so much more of that throughout the rest of the film. It was so good and emotional.To sum things up, I enjoyed the last 20 minutes of the film, and the rest just was laughably patriotic and just pandering. Boo! For anybody that wants to actually enjoy your main character, watch Kyle's fourth tour and on. You might actually not be bored and start to care.Honestly, what was Clint Eastwood thinking with this film? Wow.",,Anonymous,Biography
"""Fades to Black.....""","Very good film to represent war, I think it was done pretty accurately. At least that's how it feels for someone who hasn't been to war. The movie seems to be filmed in a slightly different way to usual, skipping big moments usually hovered over for too long in any other film. It says ""this is going to happen"" and then skips to the chase and cuts straight to it happening, I liked this as it seemed to work well with the film. It follows an interesting relationship between one man and his family and one man and his army crew (whatever the special name is for them), but can be quite slow at times although they are cutting big bits out, and seems to go on for quite a bit. The action scenes are great with some really gripping decisions in the balance and DOES seem completely realistic. My MAIN problem with this film, is that it takes the jump cut editing a little too far, so much so, that it feels like the film has no end. At one point the screen fades to black (out of no-where) and writing comes up explaining the end of the film as if they couldn't be bothered to film it. It was a BIZARRE experience ! I will certainly remember it, but that doesn't necessarily mean I liked it !",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Precision Precision : Cooper Kills It,"I didn't know the story behind Chris Kyle (the most lethal sniper of U.S history) until that final one liner played across the screen following the last frame of the movie. Undoubtedly the greatest role Bradley Cooper is to have portrayed to this date. The three times Oscar nominee, receiving nominations three years running is now part of an ensemble of ten actors to ever have achieved such; Russel Crowe being the last. American SNIPER is not just another movie of war. Instead it delves into a deeper and more sensitive core of how war challenges and changes those in the hot center of it and the ripple effects on the families left behind. Directed by Clint Eastwood, finally to me THE HURT LOCKER steps down to number two! This is a must watch.Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is a Texan lad who grows up and takes up the Texan way of life and aspires to be a cowboy. Kyle and his brother are brought up in a household where his father mans a tight ship. Into his thirties Kyle seeks into a deeper meaning into his life. He enlists himself with the US military as a Navy SEAL and is soon decorated for his 4 tours in Iraq accumulating 160 confirmed kills which earns him the nickname ""Legend"" amongst his fellow SEALs. American SNIPER unfolds the story of Kyle from the moment he fires his first shot up until that moment he is honorably discharged from the US military. The question that hangs over our head is will he be able to leave his days of the battlefield behind?Don't go seeking for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN instead look for some of the deepest acting you will witness in a war hero. Cooper displays passion. Cooper displays determination. Cooper displays nothing but the want to make sure the audience feels and understands the days of Kyle and his unit in Iraq. The explosions did not impress neither did the faint CGI nor the blood. They were by far the weakest links of the picture. Cooper instead pulls a Tom Hanks Cast Away move by actually being the only person on screen that matters. I mean no disrespect but the supporting cast disappears in the background noise of Cooper's ridiculous acting skills. At intervals it is felt as quite parallel to that of LONE SURVIVOR but Wahlberg is left way behind. The man behind the camera in this instance cannot be overlooked. Director Clint Eastwood is no D – League ball player. He is an All Star. I can only imagine how intense his chats with cooper may have been. For a character that speaks and does very little, the depths the character plunges into is astounding.

That is what Chris Kyle did to the end. Even when his duty ended, he was still assisting victims of the war and giving them hope and courage.Clint Eastwood does a fine job of depicting Kyle's 4 tours in Iraq.

Real disappointment with some of my fellow reviewers,"I read a lot of one star reviews that claimed the movie was a bunch of propaganda and I can only conclude they are referring to the news footage in the film of the 9/11 attacks and several American embassy bombings that occurred around those years, I think the footage lends to the character development of Charlie the protagonist of the story and to anyone who saw those planes fly into those buildings as I did on that day who still draws out conspiracy for the sake of propaganda I'd say give it a rest because no one really cares what you think anymore.I was ready to give the film 9 stars just to offset the nonsensical rantings of all the one star voters but to be honest it wasn't as great of a combat movie as I'd been led to believe with the scale of 10 leaning towards a movie more like Black Hawk Down, truth be told I thought the action sequences seemed like something you see in a lower budget film or even something made for cable television and quite frankly I'm starting to wonder if Clint Eastwood hasn't become menopausal with all the tear-jerk reaction scenes that are shot each time Charlie Kyle comes home from a tour.Did I care for Charlie? Nah, he was kind of a dick but I would imagine most SEALS are, considering their really just trained for one thing and with that said I supremely value the contributions made by them on behalf of their fellow soldiers; this guy prevented the bloodshed of many American soldiers and for that he should be commended as he was with great pomp and fanfare... but seriously Clint just do a film without all the emo stuff for once will ya?

The American Sniper,"In the film American Sniper the main summary is about Chris Kyle a sniper for the Navy seals. Chris Kyle is played in the movie by Bradley Cooper. Bradley Cooper is very well known Actor and plays the role very well. As we get to know some of the back story of the film, Chris Kyle was one of the most deadliest snipers to live. 255 kills but only 160 confirmed. In the beginning of the film Chris is a bronc rider in his mid 20's. He is unsatisfied with what he's doing with his life. Then throughout the movie it shows us how Chris becomes the man he is and was until his death in 2013.
Overall the film is a great way to learn how pressure with PTSD affects many people after and during a war. Chris fought a battle with PTSD when being home from fighting. Many military men have this when they come home. Some can change this but others can't. There are multiple movies based off the war in Iraq, but this one was focused on one main character unlike Zero Dark Thirty and 13 Hours. Both of those films have multiple characters that they tend to focus in on. One thing I saw that was interesting is that Chris was all about going out into a battle unlike other men. Serving his country meant a lot to him and you realize that during the film. Clint Eastwood is known for making great films, going back to old westerns and newer military movies. Clint Eastwood is the perfect director for this film and the film was created in California, along the Malibu shores. Clint made multiple scenes in this film feel special to the actor playing the role of Chris by having the actor feel the same way that Chris felt when it truly happened.
A main scene that I found to be very important and breathtaking is when Chris makes a remarkable sniper shot. Another scene from the film makes you feel the tension between the main character Chris and a little boy. The film makes good transitions from Iraq to back home. Chris's Wife deals with a lot of stress taking care of their 2 kids and the film shows that very well by making us feel what she is feeling. Chris's wife is played by Sienna Miller and her name in the film is Taya. Sienna Miller has been in more than 28 films and American Sniper is her well known film.
Overall, this is a film I recommend especially if you like military movies. Battles in Iraq are very important because we still have troops over there to this day. Clint Eastwood makes great films, this was one of my favorites. Being though this film was based off a true story it makes it come to life even more and makes you feel the way the characters felt in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
skillfully made by Eastwood,"Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) and his brother are raised by their hard-nosed father to be sheepdogs defending against the wolves of the world. They are weekend rodeo cowboys. After watching the African embassies bombings, Chris signs up for the SEALs and meets Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) at a bar. They get married and he goes off to Iraq as a sniper. On his first tour in Falluja, he kills a kid with a grenade. He returns on multiple tours and facing a skilled Olympian sniper called Mustafa.The war action is quite tense. Clint Eastwood's years of experience have laid the foundations. This is skillfully made despite the fake baby. The biggest pet peeve is these guys chatting on patrol which obviously leads to an explosive attack. It's a bit of a trope. Chris' private life is well shown but his closed off nature is not always the most compelling drama. It also hits a little too much on the head sometimes. For example, he's talking to Taya on the phone when a battle explodes around him. It's an interesting but overwrought scene when it happens the first time but the movie returns to the well again. This is a very much heroic portrait which may annoy certain people. As a movie, it mostly works well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wrong On Quite a Few Levels,"This is not it guys. I'm sorry but I have to be very negative. I realize some can't stand any negativity, so I ask you to read this at your own discretion.Let's begin with the movie. No spoilers. Just let me say it wasn't much better than the usual straight-to-TV movie. The budget was somewhat higher, but this is where the good stuff pretty much ends. Don't expect awesome sniper-stuff or anything like that. In fact, the little bit you saw was utter nonsense. I served myself and I can tell you, not even regular troops were like that; very unrealistic and unprofessional. You get to look through the scope, so let me tell you it's a made up nonsensical thing they came up with.This movie is a drama first and foremost. It's about the inner person of Chris Kyle, his partner, his life. As mentioned before, none of it was done right, convincingly nor was I moved to care.The movie is based on a book of a soldier who's known to 'shoot first, ask questions later'. This is what his comrades said. This makes the 200 kills suspicious from the get-go. Needless to say that his colleagues put this carefully in the media and anonymous. And needless to say that the main stream media didn't pursue this angle.Chris Kyle is the same person who needed to ridicule Jesse Ventura in his book. He supposedly floored Ventura. Ventura sued the Kyle estate and won the case. What's interesting is that no SEAL witness could produce a consistent story even though they were there. This angered the Jury, as they explained in the media, and hence allowed Ventura to win the case.They (the anti-Ventura SEALS) subsequently complained in the media that 'what happens inside should stay inside'. It supposedly is a unwritten SEAL code (cliché cliché). But none of them was consistent enough to mention that Kyle ignored that very same rule! In fact, he ridiculed an ex-colleague in a commercial and publicly available book. How is that for double standards? Even though Ventura won the case, he is practically out of job since then.American Sniper is the same guy who bragged about shooting looters after Katrina. I'm sorry but bragging about it is not right.I'm aware of the popularity of the SEALs around the globe. But because of their policy to be visible in the media (they made that choice few years ago), their ugly side shines through as well. Too often they communicate and behave like stereotypes who use too much anabolics.Thank you and see you next time!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Superb love story, war story and psychological drama","American Sniper is Clint Eastwood's tour de force. This is a masterpiece in every way. The story of Chris Kyle had to be told to a free world and it had to be told to keep our world free. This is a love story, a war story, and a drama all rolled into one. Most importantly for me is the psychology behind the man. I am a psychologist and I spent Christmas day with the veterans at a local VA hospital. I lived that scene that Bradley Cooper brilliantly portrayed at the hospital. That doctor did exactly what I would have done to help Chis Kyle with the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Many of our heroes in the military suffer from this debilitating illness. One of the most famous was Audie Murphy, America's Most Decorated World War II Combat Soldier. He also worked to get better treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for all military veterans.On so many levels, American Sniper is a work of art. It shows the humanity of our heroes in the military. Chris Kyle was motivated to keep our world free. His love of children was depicted extremely well. His undying love of family was beautifully portrayed. Chris Kyle is a legend but I am sure he would want to give credit to everyone who puts on the uniform. The men and women in the military have my undying love and this movie shows why we all should.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie with a TERRIBLE ending.,"Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) directs the true story of Chris Kyle, touted as ""the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history."" Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, an average every man who after watching the terrorist attacks on the twin towers decides to sign up for the Marines. He is told he should try his hands at being a Navy Seal, which he passes with flying colors and becomes a sniper for the group. Sienna Miller (Layer Cake) plays Coopers wife, Taya. Miller does an excellent job as the no nonsense but loving housewife. I enjoyed American Sniper for the most part; it was interesting seeing Kyle return home to the mundane and adapting to family life after being told that he has had 160 confirmed kills. Having said that, there were a few eye rolling, hoorah, cliché moments but that's to be expected in most military movies. My biggest gripe was the absolutely TERRIBLE ending. It literally comes out of nowhere and feels rushed. Coming down to a simple text on the screen explaining what happened to Kyle. It's almost as if Eastwood forgot that a movie was supposed to have an ending and quickly threw something together. An ending for me can make or break a movie; this ending goes down as one of the worst for a major motion picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Controversy aside, Is this a good film, YES !!!","Putting aside the controversy that surrounds this film, I would defend it as one of the best films of 2015.My hat of to Bradley Cooper, who just gets better with every film he is in. Respect to his gym gains, to go from the tall and slender man we all know to the bulky bad ass can't have been easy and is one of the best actor transformations I have ever seen. He gets the character down perfectly, in fact, there were times I did'nt even think I was watching Bradley Cooper, I felt as thou I was watching the real Chris Kyle.The film's atmosphere was great. This probably the most intense war film I have seen since Glory (1989). There are scenes where the stakes are so high, you feel like you could faint at any moment. The film wasn't trying to make you feel anything, it just showed you what happened in the war for what it was.OK, I know the film didn't touch on certain aspects of Kyle's character but in some ways I don't feel its relevant. In my opinion, I don't feel that this man is portrayed as a hero, he is a man who felt he was doing his duty but eventually it got the best of him. Not in a sympathetic way, but in a realistic way.Overall, this is not a history lesson. Its a film, and a damn good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hold on till the end,"I must admit that the first hour and a half was a bit of a pain, and I really wasn't getting into the groove of watching the movie. I felt bored and I kept looking at my watch. For me it was just another American movie who glorifies their soldiers who are sent to foreign countries to eradicate evil from the planet. A typical American film where their soldiers are portrayed to being just and honorable under any circumstance. Yes, you could say this is not totally true as Bradley Cooper is seen shooting kids several times, which is hardly a honorable thing to do. But even then, the director manages to make the Afghans look more evil than Americans when one of their leaders kidnaps a kid and puts a drill through his head to kill him. Pretty graphic I must say.The thing is that after that hour and a half, Bradley Cooper finally comes home. Unfortunately, the war has taken a toll on him. It's hard to say whether or not he is mentally deranged, but you feel his family is not completely safe around him. For me, the last few minutes were the interesting ones (along with a few minutes where you see the ability of the Sniper in the battlefield).Without the last half and hour, I don't think I would have rated the movie with more than a 5. But since it managed to make me feel emotional at the end, I have to give it a 7, which I think is about right overall. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Little too much 'Murica,"Quickie Review:After the events of 9/11 Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who initially wanted nothing more than to be a cowboy felt the need to use his talent with a rifle to help the American army. So he joins the SEALs and becomes one of the best snipers recruited in American history. However, as the war starts to take a toll on him he is torn between his duty as a soldier and responsibility as a husband with children. There is no doubt Clint Eastwood is an excellent director, and he clearly pulled a performance from Bradley Cooper of the same caliber. Controversies regarding the real Chris Kyle aside, it is still hard to ignore some of the bias in the film. Nevertheless, the movie itself is well shot and acted, delivering some tense moments. In that regard American Sniper gains not all but some of my praise.Full Review:When going into watch the movie, I was fully aware of the controversies surrounding Chris Kyle as he was in real life versus how he is depicted in this film. However, I'm not here to judge the real Chris Kyle, I'm here to share my thoughts on the movie. That'd being said some of the aspects of the movie makes it hard to ignore the politics. Nevertheless I want to make it clear that all of my views will still pertain to the film.American Sniper is a very well-directed film both in terms of the action and the character drama. There were many moments in the movie where you feel the silent tension of making a decision as a sniper. I thought the weight behind some of the decisions to pull the trigger was captured perfectly. Even I who never held a gun in my life (except in the virtual battlefields of video games) wondered what I'd do if I were in his situation. Of course, there are some embellishment of explosions and such, but as a whole the shootouts felt grounded with some sense of consequence. Bradley Cooper did a great job in this film. He was able to portray the struggle of being veteran in a nuanced manner. The fact he has PTSD is not hammered over head for the audience. So was he Oscar worthy? Well no, I could think of two other actors that could've taken his spot in the nomination. But that is a topic for another long conversation, so I won't elaborate on that.As for the problems I had with the film, there's only one but a pretty significant one. The movie is heavily biased and I am not even referring to Chris Kyle because I set that controversy aside to enjoy the film. Not once are we shown the ""good"" guys of the other side. Apart from one translator, every single non-American in this film is either a terrorist or only share information when forced to. That can't possibly be the reality. Dare I say it, at times I was reminded of the mock sniper propaganda movie from Inglorious Basterds. I have friends and family in America, and of course I know most people wouldn't be blinded by the bias. Then again let's be honest here, there are people out there who will take this movie a bit too literally. That's why I think it's a little irresponsible on the filmmaker's part to completely ignore the Iraqi contribution to the American army in the war effort, some of which the real Chris Kyle benefited from. Imagine if we had seen a more fleshed depiction of the Iraqi people. Perhaps a family that is also struggling between wanting to help the Americans and keeping their relatives safe from the terrorists. Those parallels would have deeply enriched the movie.I recognize I did touch upon some politics here, but it had to be addressed. Yes there are moments where the movie screams 'Murica!' Still Bradley Cooper's performance and the intense action resulted in an engaging film. I like the movie overall, I just think there was a missed opportunity here to show the contribution of the Iraqi side as well.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something is scrapped and that hurts.. a lot.,"I don't understand all the negativity about this movie. It's a Clint Eastwood movie. That means that something happens and that something hurts. Inside you. Eastwood is not exactly the kind of filmmaker who delivers flat drama. A certain fact - the war this time - is presented as an excuse to present an interesting, layered character, crossing borders to transform. Well, that happens. And it hurts... We stay with this guy, this sniper. We stay with him till we feel suffocated to the point of wanting to leave the cinema. The camera is on him, without no mercy. Through his eyes we see the concept of 'defending your country' go down the drain, But without moralizing one single moment and without being disrespectful to those who believe in this concept and who go there to do that job.We just see a man, being destroyed, and that's it.A pro-war-movie.... ??

Bullets and Fake Babies...,"I'll start this review out by saying that I know people have strong feelings about Chris Kyle - some think that he was an infallible hero who gave his life for this country, and others say that he was a liar, a racist, and a serial killer. I don't care, and have no judgment about Chris Kyle - I didn't know him personally, and can only judge what I saw on screen. This is, after all, a movie review.American Sniper tells the story of Chris Kyle, the 'Devil of Ramadi'. He was a Navy S.E.A.L. who has 160 confirmed kills with a documented 255 probable kills. He's the most lethal sniper in United States history in his four tours overseas.The movie is directed by Clint Eastwood, who has made an amazing looking film. Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, and is the highlight of the film. His portrayal of a tortured man at work and home is captured perfectly. Cooper looks amazing in the movie - clearly he bulked up for the role. Sienna Miller plays his wife.Aside from the piles of insurgents, the main villain in the flick is an opposing sniper named Mustafa. Their cat & mouse game brought memories of Enemy at the Gates, and was thrilling. The war scenes looked realistic and brutal, but the scenes of Kyle back at home left something to be desired - specifically one scene that I'll touch on in a moment. The ending is also very clunky.The scene. The scene that I'll forever remember from this movie. It's not a scene where someone gets a limb blown off, or a soldier making a kill at ridiculous range...no...it's not a scene with great emotion or acting gravitas...no...it's a scene of Bradley Cooper holding a baby. Specifically, a baby that's faker than those plastic TV's that litter the inside of model homes, or a ring that you might get from a quarter machine. Could Clint Eastwood not get an actual baby? The baby he's holding is so ridiculously fake that it took my wife and I right out of the movie. Normally she doesn't notice things like props, but she picked this one right out of the lineup.Aside from the prop baby, the movie was pretty good. It had some pacing issues, and like I said, the ending is a bit clumsy, but it's a good movie. A good movie I'll probably never want to see again.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A extremely polished picture of a complex war,"American sniper is not a bad movie, not at all. But it suffers from heavy patriotism and lack of self-distance which narrows the war and it's players down to the simplest of terms: the Americans are the heroes who can do nothing wrong and the Iraqies are the villains who are wicked by nature.It's to the point that it can be used as a recruitment video for the Navy Seals, and I'm sure that many American children watching it will want to grow up to become snipers themselves and fight for the American way.One could argue though that the whole movie is seen from Chris Kyle's perspective but even so, I'm sure that he witnessed a far more complex situation with plenty of grey areas and not just everything in black and white as what we witnessed on screen.If you can look aside that it's a fairly enjoyable tale, with pretty natural acting with Bradley Cooper in a more restrictive performance than we are used to from him alongside a thick Texas accent... Was it worthy a Oscar-nominated performance? That I don't know. But it was good enough, just like the movie.American patriots will love it, while the rest of us have to take it with a little grain of salt.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cooper's Commanding Turn Secures SNIPER's Legacy,"American Sniper is a subtle emotional powerhouse packed with outstanding action sequences and anchored by Bradley Cooper's intensely realistic portrayal of a man clinging to his principles in the crucible of war.SNIPER is challenging on many levels. It demands that the viewer have a high tolerance for wartime horrors. It implores us to ignore the United States' politically ambiguous motives for invading Iraq. In fact, the film almost completely disregards the big picture in exchange for the understated drama of the individual soldier. The result is a fairly detached account of Chris Kyle's trials and successes during his four extensive tours in the Middle East. Since Kyle proves such a superman on the battlefield and unflinchingly sacrifices everything for his country, SNIPER runs the risk of being perceived as America propaganda. Even more problematic is the film's rather unflattering depiction of the Iraqi enemy, the ""wolves"" Kyle has sworn to defend his ""sheep"" against.If Eastwood succeeds at anything, it's allowing Kyle's fanaticism to linger calmly under the surface of the proceedings. By the end, whether or not we agree with his actions or code of honor, we've grown and lived with Kyle, and come to realize that the war is not a place where decent men can flourish. Kyle, indeed, is a decent and moralistic man, perhaps oppressively so, but Eastwood convincingly places him above the judgment of his audience. Although it may not be easy to come to terms with, Chris Kyle did what he believed was necessary. It's not a question of right and wrong, it's a question of what the character believed was right and wrong. Of course, some viewers will disagree with him on an ideological level (I know I did) or reprehend him for his seemingly callous treatment of his wife and children, but this does not make the film opinionated, but rather unbiased. Sure, Eastwood glosses over his reintegration into society, he mitigates some of the moral dilemma of sniping by demonizing the enemy. But that's how Kyle got through it, by making himself believe certain things just to get by.Cooper succeeds admirably at wrestling the humanity out of a man who has killed so many so unapologetically. It's undoubtedly the finest performance of his career, and definitely deserving of the Oscar nomination he received. Sienna Miller, though sidelined for the majority of the film and given precious little wiggle room by the script, also pulls her weight.It's a gorgeous film to look at; it puts BLACK HAWK DOWN to shame stylistically. Overall, American Sniper is a quietly potent film from Clint Eastwood, and though some will adore it and some will despise it, I can say from a fairly unbiased perspective that it has a universally moving quality if you can put yourself in Chris Kyle's shoes, even for a moment.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A solid, but inartistic movie","This is another great biographical film with an inspired story, exciting climax, and beautiful acting from Bradley Cooper.It offers an honest glimpse into the psychological effects of modern warfare on a man who has seen so many traumatic events; that his life at home is not the same as he returns to battle over and over.That being said; the images presented are of a dark nature, and it's not the kind of movie you watch again, let alone show your friends and family.While I don't think that the use of violence in the film was unnecessary, it wasn't particularly artistic. Where the director could've chosen more passive means of communicating the violence of war; he opted to blatantly throw it at the audience, as though trying to give the viewers the kind of psychological damage that the plot explores.Some scenes didn't feel shocking for the sake of shock value, but just lazy storytelling, something that Clint Eastwood has been guilty of before.It's a good story, for sure: but it's not well displayed. It's not something I'll ever watch again, or recommend anyone else watches. It wasn't interesting enough to enjoy, and not sad enough to cry at, just... shocking.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Poor to reality,"as far for reality the movie was far from it , i will post my review as a former military linguist , first when you make a movie on a real story make it close to it at least , in army you can never grow a beard as in this movie you can never move out for a mission as we seen in this movie the DOD guy just said let's go to the sheikh and they went out for a mission that was too far and shows the US military as unorganized army and i see it disrespecting the US Military, also the insurgents or terrorists were always like a professional military squad the US Army was facing professional street fights unlike what we seen in this movie all insurgents coming to one place, also not all the Iraqis were bad guys and its never true that a 5 years old kid can carry an RPG-7 , last thing the movie is supposed to be in Iraq so it would be a lot better if they brought some people who can speak the Iraqi accent not just someone who speak Arabic",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Cynical film,"Without coming off ignorant, I could see why this movie would be a hit but that doesn't mean I think the movie is good. Yeah, this is meant to be a black and white movie. That focuses on the a Sniper that is known for a lot of kills in combat. I don't think that makes this movie really patriotic or anything like that. Sure, the thing that stands out about this movie is how it's based on a true story. But in my opinion that also works against it as well. The acting is on target though. But when it comes the direction of it all, it comes off pretty darn cynical. I appreciate the men and women that protect and serve America. But this like I said just comes off very cynical. It's a simple black and white movie, and simple doesn't always make a movie better. The movie just seemed far from it being constructive. The movie seem to only portray all the positive aspects of Chris Kyle while shoving his negative actions under the rug.3.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Film,"My opinion is based on the entertainment of the movie. The movie was filed with emotion, action and history. I greatly enjoyed how Cooper displayed the character of Chris Kyle. Most cases are not as severe, but nonetheless, by presenting PTSD it caused the audience to think more of the trials troop may have to endure and understand the burdens some veteran's have from being in war.Overall I really enjoyed how the film caused the audience to feel such emotion, especially at the end.

Emotion often times leads to a stronger opinion and my opinion is positive for this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average movie with serious fails,"Personally I do not care if the movie is faithful to the original story or if there was a valid purpose in Iraq invasion. This is just a movie, not the real story. It's suppose to entertain and you can tell the story anyway you like. You don't have to stick to the facts. This is not a documentary. Now, the entertaining value here is very poor. The actors are not great. Bradley is not a good actor. Never was. The story is not engaging enough. You don't really care about what's gonna happen. A lot of clichés. It's almost unbearable for me to see a war movie portraying the pos traumatic stress disorder...again and again. Just too predictable. But the best (worse) scene is that one in which Bradley holds a baby in his arms. My God! Is that even possible? to make it so badly? Everybody can see that is a doll. Horrible!

Intense and powerful!!! Great way to end awards season!!!!,"American Sniper: Powerful and intense. Two words that perfectly describe American Sniper. From the moment Chris Kyle is deployed to Iraq, the intensity in the film never lets up. Without a doubt, this is the most intense film I have ever seen. I thought good action movies kept me at the edge of my seat, but American Sniper is the true definition of an edge-of-a-seat film. At some points of the movie, I almost had to stand up and take a deep breath because my heart was beating so fast. I could tell everyone else in the audience felt the same way. With Clint Eastwood's best directing since Gran Torino, career best performance from Bradley Cooper, and the most powerful scriptwriting I have seen, American Sniper excels in nearly every category.I just want you guys to know that some may find this movie biased because it calls a lot of the Iraqi's savages and seems very one-sided in it's view point of the War. This movie is about a soldier's life, and no way in hell a Navy SEAL is gonna think the work he does is not important or the men who try to kill his teammates are nothing less than scumbags. All of us would think this way if someone tried to kill our friends.The trailer for this film kind of makes it seem like the movie is a little boring, but that is literally the opposite of what this film is. All of the emotion and intensity they are able to convey behind a sniper scope and with no one talking is astounding and very impressive. It draws you into the story with those emotions and intense scenes and you feel like you are living in the story with him. The script was near-perfect as well for the story it was telling as well. I will never know how hard it is for military men to acclimate back to their lives back home, but now I at least have a better understanding of the fight they have to go through from hearing gun shots all day to expecting to be normal at their son's birthday party. It is exactly like what Taya Kyle, played by Sienna Miller, says to Chris Kyle, ""if you think this war hasn't changed you, your wrong."" The power it was able to convey in nearly every scene was incredible, the script, the music, the acting, just everything went together perfectly. The audience felt exactly what Clint Eastwood, the director, wanted us to feel. I think it might even be his best work since Unforgiven to be honest.When I saw Bradley Cooper in the trailer for this film, I could not believe it was him. He looks so different which is just a testament to how much dedication he puts into his roles. He worked for months on end to put forty-plus pounds of muscle on to play the most deadly sniper in military history. His acting was phenomenal. He has a perfect Texas accent and plays the born and bread country boy down to a tee. He definitely deserves every inch of that Oscar nomination he received. How perfectly he played not only a Navy SEAL, but a SEAL who has to find some impossible way to go back to the life he has home is amazing.This film again is extremely intense and some scenes in Iraq do get a little graphic so make sure you are ready to see this film because it is not one of those films you can just pick up and watch whenever. If you can handle it though, I highly recommend American Sniper as your first choice walking into the theater.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"if you are unable to put politics and personal feelings aside when watching it, you only keep yourself from enjoying a very good film.","American Sniper (2014) This is a biographical war drama directed by Clint Eastwood and loosely based on the memoir American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. A Navy S.E.A.L. sniper saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend. Coming back home after four tours of duty, he finds that war was easier to deal with than the aftermath. The film also receives mostly positive reviews from critics. Bradley Cooper's lead performance and Eastwood's direction received the bulk of the praise. It drew some controversy over its portrayal of both the war and of Chris Kyle, himself. It received six Oscar nominations, but only winning one award for Best Sound Editing. It was the second most profitable picture of 2014. The film is engrossing, poignant, and both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's distressing when people are critical of the film for reasons other than the acting, directing or quality itself. It's about their disagreement with its political attitude. This is a well constructed film and is very entertaining. That's a simple fact. It's a dramatic interpretation and isn't claiming to be anything else. To criticize it for things it never claims to be, just isn't fair.

So-so war film.,"Much love and bile has been directed at this film. The debate says more about the viewers than it does about Chris Kyle. In this post-Vietnam/Iraq world many desire their war films to be more Platoon or Thin Red Line than The Longest Day. Others want the exact opposite.This film is more along the lines of the traditional depiction of war with some modern touches. Whilst not as simplistic of a depiction of a soldier protagonist as in John Wayne films American Sniper lacks the moral complexity of films like Full Metal Jacket.It's a passable depiction of war. It certainly is no classic along the lines of Blackhawk Down or Saving Private Ryan.American Sniper ultimately will be known more for the furor that it caused than it's contents. The debate is between two groups of people passing judgment or giving out praise to a life they don't much understand.Americans more than ever are ignorant of war and what it means at a philosophical level and for the people directly involved in it.Some say this film is propaganda, but that is not a legitimate argument. Oscar Wilde once said that ""Truth is rarely pure and never simple."" It's the arrogance of people today that leads them to think they know the truth when all they know is what others have told them. Reading articles or viewing documentaries doesn't mean you know what went on. All it means is that you read or viewed someone else's view of what occurred. The real truth is known only by those who were there.Every other person's opinion stands is wholly dependent on the information given to them(and thus susceptible to manipulation.) It is a fool who thinks that only the government lies and deceives about war.Movies are points of view. As a result they are all biased. To label American Sniper that went all movies are intrinsically biased is ludicrous. Frankly, those who accuse it of that are simply angry that the movies does not depict their point-of-view about the events at hand.There is another issue I have to tackle that is with hypocrisy. Much has been made about the depiction of Iraqis in this film. It's been called racist and simplistic. That allegation made me shake my head. This film depicts Iraqis as every non-German World War Two film depicts the Germans in the Second World War: Simplistic one-dimensional characters. I have yet to see Michael Moore or any leftist complain about the unfair depiction of Germans in films.What it boils down to is that this film isn't anti-war and thus is being torn to pieces by those who are stridently anti-Iraq War. Conversely, those who openly support the war in Iraq love this film because it seemingly confirms what they believed. Ideological bias has impacted how this film has been received and the critiques of it have to be viewed with that understanding.American Sniper is a middling kind of movie that Eastwood every so often produces. For every Letters from Iwo Jima(brilliant) there is a Flags of Our Fathers(meh). Sniper is decidedly in the latter category.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Well Acted Propaganda Film,"Cooper plays a misguided simpleton with anger issues who runs off and joins the military to kill terrorists because he saw 9/11 on the tayvay, and he plays it very, very well. Killing terrorists and protecting 'murica gives him a purpose in life and renders him just as useless to society as he was prior to his legendary sniper status. I'm not really sure what Mr. Eastwood's angle was here, but judging from the fact that it's based on an actual memoir, the general feeling of manipulation as the viewer, and my usual ability to spot propaganda from a mile away, I can probably guess. Had it not been for all of that, I probably would've given it a higher rating, but Bradley Cooper earns this film seven stars on his own.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Controversial?,"Yes it is. But we're talking about Clint Eastwood here. And while he did talk to a chair (something I actually thought was funny as an ""act"", not so much what he was saying), he's still a good director who's able to juggle things around. And make them feel right - or as right as it is possible.Many have and will call Snipers cowards. People who are not going into actual fight that is going on, but wait and have to kill a lot of people from long distance. But we do get a glimpse into what might be going on in the head of one of those men. Bradley Cooper is once again mesmerizing in his portrayal. And while I was not aware of all real life incidents that happened, that might have elevated the whole story for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hymn to Fire Weapons,"No matter how many words I will try to find for this review, they are already outnumbered by the bullets in this movie. A requiem for an unknown soldier, who was famous for shooting countless men. men which are to be considered as the enemy, and therefore not questionable. Basically this movie succeeds in drawing a highly contrasted black and white world, where good is good and evil is evil. You won't become much headache for watching this film. Beyond its wishful thinking, I would not doubt, that anyone participating in any war is victim to PTSD, what does give me some headache. However, this wasn't subject to this movie. as questionable as the director Clint Eastwood could have been, American sniper goes astray from what could have made this film a good one. It is too shallow, too gentle, apparently double-pro-American and harmless. What Client Eastwood made was a movie giving you a traditional view on topics of today. A global confrontation of indignities and violence, which best is used a exciting scenario. No rules, no questions, just survive. Funny however, as Client Eastwood was the director, and I always thought this guy is an actor, living a fulfilled live, and not a hymn composer, trying to present us his collection of ""gun men never die"" stories. It must be hard for him, balancing himself from movie to movie, and live up only for those two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper is not as good as Eastwood's previous war movies,"The performances are good, and some of the scenes are shot really well, but the story really lacks proper character-depth and is quite one-sided in its storytelling.The way the story is explored makes it seem like a propaganda movie (like many claim). Every aspect of the movie tried to show the importance of war (without explaining the reason for them going to war in the first place) and worshiping the America's most lethal sniper as God.Though Kyle's character in the movie was interesting and empathizable, but people who knew Kyle claim otherwise; some say, he didn't even have a conscience.Even if we neglect those character aspects, the story was quite one-sided. I remember Lone Survivor from 2013, which in my opinion was more balanced. From its Christian influences to its pro-gun environment, American Sniper is not as good as Eastwood's previous war movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bradley Cooper illustrates a new career high while Eastwood still stumbles in his latest...,"Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)Demonstrating competent war scenes, along with an astounding and near unrecognizable performance from two-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper, Clint Eastwood's new film ""American Sniper"" falters on storytelling and thematic developments. Continuously going back to the sacrifice that our military men and women make, which is perfectly fine, but beating the audience over the head with the sacrifice they make is something we've seen before.The tagline of the poster reads: ""the most lethal sniper in American history."" You'd expect to see a lot more sniping that led this man to becoming a ""legend,"" which is what everyone calls him. The inner turmoil for a soldier is understood, but what more does Eastwood and scribe James Dean Hall have to say? Evidently, not much. If you're looking for a tribute to a soldier, than the film suffices. If you're looking for a good movie, then this oddly constructed, and often times uninteresting piece will leave you wanting more.Eastwood has taken on war films before with ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" One of those is gorgeously constructed and moving. Eastwood is obviously pro-soldiers, as we should all be however, the film often rings false as Chris Kyle goes from cowboy, to enlistment, to watching the twin towers fall, and wanting nothing more than to continue to serve. Surely that can be the case in real life with the real Kyle, and this is no disrespect to his sacrifice and memory, but hardly anything that is presented on-screen feels authentic.Bradley Cooper has proved his worth for the past two years with work in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle."" As Chris Kyle, this could be the best work Cooper has done yet. Unrecognizable and emulating the works of a Heath Ledger and/or Jeremy Renner, Cooper creates Kyle from the legs up, giving him beats that elevate the material. One scene in particular will rid any doubts that anyone has ever had as him as an actor. He's a marvelous wonder to behold.Sienna Miller is vastly wasted in a character that will go down as one of the worst of the year. The supportive wife equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, an overwhelming feeling of annoyance is present every time Miller shares the screen.Tom Stern's camera has finally been given a flash lens as we're finally able to decipher what's going on. A dust storm is expertly shot that helps create palpable tension. The best scene of the film.This is one of the Eastwood's strongest attempts at recapturing his magic from ""Million Dollar Baby"" but he comes nowhere within its vicinity on quality. I'm unapologetically a person that didn't find ""Invictus"" a catastrophe and that remains one of his better efforts as of late. ""American Sniper"" will have its fans but Bradley Cooper is the only take away from the picture. That's a marvel to watch. Everything else, not so much.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is not Eastwood's best movie... by far.,I would say that this is a patriotic movie with B movie hints. However the opening scene is grandiose and Cooper's performance is great. I've been impressed by the way he embodied Chris Kyle character.The movie and the way it's shoot is irregular with great scenes but not enough to compensate the lacks from others. Sometimes you can have the feeling that they were short of budget (cf. the use of baby doll and some special effects that are too obvious). It is not that important but it increases the movie's fickleness.To summarize I'd say that Eastwood has been lazy (and broke?) and that Cooper saved a mediocre movie.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role,"American Sniper is a war drama starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. I found it well acted and cleverly directed as well. Bradley Cooper gives another memorable performance in the title role.The film is a biopic about real life Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper). As a young boy, Chris learned all of his sniping skills from his father by hunting deer. Now an adult, he decides to put them to good use by joining the US Navy. After the 9/11 attacks, Chris is sent over to Iraq to serve alongside his fellow soldiers and while over there, he manages to kill 255 people, making him the deadliest marksman in US military history. However, in doing so, he ends up saving many of the lives of his fellow men and even some other innocent Iraqis. As a result, he is considered a hero by his country and earns the nickname ""Legend"". Upon returning home from the war to his wife (Sienna Miller) and two children, Chris is still traumatised about the events of the war and feels like he will never be able to adjust to normal everyday life.Bradley Cooper's performance carries the film. He was very convincing in the leading role. Clint Eastwood's direction is very good as well. He manages to blend real life events with cinema very effectively. Even though some of the war scenes tended to drag at times, they never felt forced or glorified. However, due to some of the violence, this is not a film for the weak-hearted.I rate it 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Review: American Sniper (2014) - A Powerful War Thriller,"""You can only circle the flame so long.""From the opening frame, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is a gripping Military Drama. The trailers and adverts for this film set me to expect merely a study of Chris Kyle's dual life as a loving father / American patriot ""sheepdog,"" and it does function as that (exceptionally well), but what I wasn't anticipating was the superb war cinema that it became at points. The action sequences feel inspired. They are captured with an unrivaled attention to detail. The cameras and their positioning are tailored to depict gripping, no-holds-barred firefights and movement through the Iraqi battlefield. Bradley Cooper makes the incredible transformation into Chris Kyle, ""The Devil of Ramadi,"" as Eastwood explores his anguished psyche during his time in both ""The War on Terror"" and stateside with his family between tours of duty.Chris Kyle is a character that deserved to have his story told, and it is done lovingly, here, by Eastwood. I am ecstatic to say that Eastwood has made a triumphant return to directing after some arguable lulls in his directing career (Hereafter, J. Edgar, Jersey Boys). This film isn't just Oscar-bait- it succeeds on all proposed fronts, with the panache of a unabashed war film, and the intimacy of a film strictly identifying as a character study. A delicate balance executed surgically by the cast and crew.The opening sequence is emotional and engaging, setting up the rest of the film more than adequately. A brief portion of the film near the beginning is spent in flashback, effectively and succinctly providing the motivations behind Chris Kyle's burden to become the legend he remains today. His relationship with his wife, Taya (played by Sienna Miller) is explored beautifully. From the first time they share the screen, and as they start a family with their varying circumstances looming overhead. Chris Kyle is torn between his responsibility to his family and his sense of duty to fight in the war overseas. He sees his passion to protect and help other people coupled with his skills with a rifle as almost a holy endowment.The depiction of Kyle's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and his disability to reconcile the effects of war while home from battle is done with heartbreaking authenticity. Most notably in a scene where he encounters a Marine he provided aid to whilst in one of his prior tours of duty. Bradley Cooper embodies this pain and frustration powerfully on screen. Most films fail to capture the baggage brought home by soldiers the way that American Sniper does so exquisitely. This film is a success; a masterful piece by director Clint Eastwood, and a great show of skill from Bradley Cooper, who is, with every role, proving his expansive diversity in acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper: Misses the Mark,"Like many, I had very high expectations for this film. Regardless of the high praise it was getting from critics, American Sniper looked at first glance like it would be one of the best films of the year. It had all the makings of a truly great war flick, great true story, talented leading role and a more than capable director at the helm in Clint Eastwood. With all this in mind, I went into the theater with rather high expectations and I left only to have all of them shattered. American Sniper falls flat on almost every account. I never really felt any emotional connection to Kyle. All the situations in which Eastwood creates in order for the audience to feel for Kyle; his brief and terrible childhood sequence, his impromptu phone calls to his wife in the middle of battles, his struggle with PTSD after returning from duty, all felt like a desperate and poor act by the director to get me to relate or feel for Kyle. I'm not doubting that some of these events occurred, I'm sure some of them did - but they way they were portrayed in the film were such Hollywoodized versions of real life events that I really struggled finding any shred of believe-ability in them. The movie does not even succeed in its action aspect, having battle sequences that are extremely poorly shot and generic (the few that there are). Cooper, a lone bright spot in the the film, does a solid job with what little content he has but not even he is enough to save this train wreck of a movie from being what it really is; a movie with no heart, devoid of all true emotion.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ok movie, very good Bradley Cooper","I'm not an Eastwood lover - at all - but this movie is watchable. The usually dull tone preferred by Eastwood fits with the biographical story, I mean it's ok for a biopic (while not for many other movies directed by him).
Mild boredom will still hit here and there, but it's forgivable.
The movie is 100% on the shoulders of Bradley Cooper, and he easly carries the load: though he's a good actor, he did a very remarkable, surprising work here, in what could be his best performance to date.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A VERY GOOD WATCH !!,"While widespread trail of death, destruction and displacement are the visible effects of war, its real brutality is in the less visible, or often invisible, albeit pronounced effects on the psyche of those who survive. For, it is they who have to live with the scars of war, picking up the shards of their shattered life. As against those who die and are consumed by the war, the survivors face the pain of death on a daily basis as they are relentlessly haunted by their commissions and omissions which could have made a meaningful difference.In American Sniper, veteran director Clint Eastwood narrates the real life story of Chris Kyle (an excellent Bradley Cooper), an ace marksman of the US Navy SEALs, who in his four gruelling missions during the Iraq war, is credited with more than 160 confirmed kills - the highest ever for a sniper. The film is largely set in the wreckage of Iraqi towns where the invading US marines had to engage in deadly urban combat with deadly insurgents from the al-Qaeda. The nature of urban warfare necessitates the services of snipers like Chris Kyle who is perched in a position, far and high from the battleground, keep an eagle eye to protect his mates from any incoming threats.While this setting provides for several thrilling and action packed moments, especially when confronted by an Olympian sniper from the other side, the focus of the film remains firmly on the psychological aspects of the war on Chris - Why he came to be what he is and what is he going through..? Even as he is highly effective in his role as a sniper in the battlefield and is celebrated as ""THE LEGEND"", we find that the war quickly consumes his psyche entirely. He is unable to shift his focus away from it even during his well deserved breaks away from the war zone when he is safely ensconced in the warmth of his home with a loving wife, Taya (an effective Sienna Miller) and his newborn son. The battle continues to rage on in his mind and brings on a firestorm of guilt and helplessness that singes his very soul and almost upends his normal family life which was moving on an even keel. As the distant war continues to cling on to him like an unyielding parasite and can he quell the very real threat it poses to unleash a turbulence on him and his loving family...? Check out the movie to know the answers.Despite being an one-sided narrative which does not care to focus on the other side, Eastwood's movie which has strong resonance with his earlier westerns raises difficult, yet pertinent questions about the whole idea of heroism and violence. And, in a beefed up Bradley Cooper, he has an actor who has embodied the character so deeply with all its vulnerabilities and nuances that makes this movie tick as an almost meditative exploration into the troubled psyche of a celebrated war hero.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hambor - 3B,"With this movie being probably the best of 2014, its probably my favorite movie of all time, Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood did an amazing job in the directing of this film. After seeing the trailer, it was a must see for me. In this movie a Military Sniper for the US Marines, named Chris Kyle, is challenged at war with Iraqi and Afghan soldiers.
I took a lot away from watching this movie, since I watched it when I was a little younger and didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, it inspired me to want to be like him. Yet I didn't quite understand why he was named the ""American Sniper"" when that was was supposed to be the best sniper in the world, because the Terrorist sniper, was way too much of competition for him to even hang. 
In my opinion this isn't a movie you should just ignore, its definitely one of the greatest movies in a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Sniper is an official governmental assassin,"Two of my very favorite Clint Eastwood directed films are MYSTIC RIVER and MILLION DOLLAR BABY- one probed deeply into the corruption of the human psyche, and the other celebrated the triumph of one woman's will to succeed in a world ruled by men - so I always go out of my way to see his work and hope not to be disappointed. This time I was disappointed because my heartstrings were not pulled, but on further reflection, I thought that the characterization of a ""hero"" had a complexity in the very lack of emotional ""tugs"" - which made sense telling the story of a man who is able to preserve his sanity being an official executioner, a job that needs him to be dispassionate and composed, and who becomes a champion of American values to his fellow compatriots. In war morality is abandoned.American SNIPER based on the true story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, considered the most lethal sniper in US military history - also nicknamed by his comrades ""Legend"" - served 4 tours of duty in Iraq and considered himself the quintessential American ""patriot."" This movie is a portrait of a man who puts country above all else, a man who is steadfast in the ""rightness"" of his actions in protecting the honor and citizens of the United States of America; an exceptionally skilled marksman and lover of guns, and a man who was not introspective and never understood that he was in an occupied land where the population was fighting the ""invader/savior"" whose culture was totally different from theirs.How do you fight against the major power in the world? You use the new tactics of war - guerrilla hit and run bombings, employing sniper sharpshooters and even indoctrinating women and children into the great beyond of martyrdom. American SNIPER also sets up a gunslinger/HIGH NOON mano a mano duel between two exceptional skilled assassins - each convinced that murdering for one's country and protecting one's brothers-in-arms is the ultimate reward.Bradley Cooper - beefed up to look like Chris Kyle gives a fairly good performance as a stoic, stone-faced and hardened Kyle relishing doing his job; knowing he is the best at what he does and making sure that he protects his""family of brothers"" his fellow Navy SEALS. We see him working out physically - his flesh thickening and tightening up, as does his spirit and thirst for revenge. At what point does a job become something you cannot do without - falling in love with the ""sandstorms"" of war?Eastwood also gives us flashbacks into Kyle's childhood - a father who instills a sheep vs. wolf vs. sheepherder mentality into his boys. You protect your own (sheepherder) - no matter what the cost in order to become a man. Sienna Miller plays Chris Kyle's wife - a stereotypical view of a woman taking care of the family, giving solace to her husband, and a mollifying device necessary to show the main character's ""soft"" side, but still clichéd and thinly drawn. She is background support.Marines in Humvees their breadth filling the narrow roadways with skulls painted on them, disembarking and knocking down doors where families are huddled; soldiers ill-equipped to communicate with the population that they are administering leads to strategic errors; treating your enemy like the dusty dirt of the streets invites brutal retaliation. Both sides are heinous and savage in fighting the confused and demoralized battles that were the mainstay of being in Iraq. The ""shock and awe"" of this haphazardly planned war brought home thousands of veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and placed young men and women who volunteered in the name of their land into a future filled with struggle and tragedy. It was and is shameful.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I mean... it's not that bad,"Let's face it, this is should not have been a Best Picture nominee. But is the movie complete garbage? Absolutely not. Bradley Cooper has an incredible performance as Chris Kyle as well as Sienna Miller. Clint Eastwood's direction also makes you feel like you're dead smack in the middle of this war. The problem with the film lies in the scriptwriting. It's flimsy and didn't really know what it was doing. The directing was unable to match with the screen writing. Eastwood's realistic directing and the unrealistic dialogue clash into this weird mesh of a film. However, it is definitely worth seeing for the sake of Cooper, Miller, and Eastwood.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent movie; pisses all the right people off to boot,"The only kind of people who dislike ""American Sniper"" are Leftist scum or Islamo-fascist sympathizers. I urge one and all in the decent human being world to go see it. What they will find is both an exciting war movie combined with a very human story of a life well-lived; a true American hero in every sense of the word. Chris Kyle embodied all that is best about America: courage, honor, commitment to duty, love of family. It is little wonder that this film is smashing box office records not only here but around the world. The tone is just about perfect, throughout the movie. This is due to Clint Eastwood's excellent directing. It is quite refreshing that a real American hero - not one of Hollywood's phony PC cutouts - and his time serving his country and struggles and triumphs at home are the subject of an epic such as this one. The only ""controversy"" is a contrived one by the liberal media and the scumbag American Left. Again, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The movie this country did not ask for, but needed.","Guns, patriotism, war, family, love the list goes on and on, what's not the love about American Sniper! Oh boy, oh boy, I really do not know where to even begin with this movie. It is amazing in so many ways. A memoir-based movie written by the man who lived through it all, Chris Kyle. I read the book a few years back and I was in a trance reading it and I knew I needed to see this on the big screen.
Directors and cast are award-winning stars credited to multiple movies. Director, Clint Eastwood, does a fantastic job tying the true, horrific stories of Chris Kyle to the Hollywood aesthetic of movies. Although not always entirely accurate throughout, man is this one amazing movie to watch. You're constantly on your toes. You want to thank your veterans. Eastwood balanced everything in this movie to a tee. A lot of action but did not shy away from the real world problems of war.
Bradley Cooper. I have no words for this man. He is an incredible actor and this movie is no exception. He portrayed a navy seal that was tough as nails. It would be hard to believe this wasn't just a documentary of Cooper at war. He played the part so well and his emotions captured the realism of war so much. Cooper played the part of Chris Kyle a man that came from nothing but rodeo clowning and drunk fights. He decides to enlist in the armed forces and in due time trains to be a Navy Seal. He quickly climbs the ranks and becomes a eagle-eyed precision sniper. He gets sent overseas to the middle east to fight in the war of terrorism. He records a huge sum of kills and gets all sorts of praise and nicknames. Eventually even receives a hit for his death for a large sum of money. The way Cooper is able to portray the character and the thoughts going on make him more than deserving of the MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance.
One scene stood out above the else highlighting Coopers talent in this movie. He is in the hospital and the doctor asks him a few questions about how many kills he has. He then asks Kyle if he regrets seeing anything. Cooper responds,
""I was just protecting my guys, they were trying to kill... our soldiers and I... I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took""
Chills, chills, chills. This highlights the true aspect of war and why the guys serve, they do it for their buddies and the ones back home. Cooper by far took my spot as my favorite male actor from this performance alone.
All in all this award winning/nominated movie deserves nothing less than what it has received. It is similar to other war movies but Eastwood does one thing to set it apart, highlight the human side of what happens to our soldiers. This movie makes us feel more for our soldiers. It connects us to our country. It is certainly more than just an action movie with a few good explosions.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brandley Cooper excellent, Clint Eastwood a briliant director, and a contraversal subject","First I would like to say few words for the subject.
This movie, like many others, presents the soldiers in a foreigner soil as patriots. When a soldier pass the borderline, the morality stops. And so is not cool, is not nice.
Additionaly soldiers have to deal with metatraumatic syndromes, and other health issues, not to mention the seperation from the family, and the impact to all, especially the children.
All those described in this movie, but I wish in the future remain only in movies.Beyond all the above, Clint Eastwood is an outstanding director, not only to this film. I remeber his youth movies as an actor, and never expect to be a such high quality director.

The Iraqi people were seen as evil and bad in this movie, even though they were just trying to defend their country from the American invasion. I also want to point out that this man in the movie was motivated to go fight in Iraq after seeing the 9/11 attacks. This even though Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with those attacks. I wonder if this movie would have been as great if it was from the point of view of an Iraqi sniper..Like I said, this was a great movie in terms of its story and its action. If this were a story about Bradley Cooper killing deadly aliens I might have actually really liked this movie (though I fear it wouldn't have been as loved by others as it is now).

Clint Eastwood screwed up the movie with inconsistencies....Thats a fact,"Im a man of facts. I do not say something unless I know for sure that Im right. I have heard all of all the drama about Chris Kyle being accused of lying, but Clint Eastwood screwed up the movie. Fact (1) At the beginning of the movie Chris does his Seal Training. Chris is asked by his drill instructor how old he is. Chris responds back by saying, "" Im 30 years of age. "" Fact (2) After Chris finishes his Seal training he meets that woman at the bar. After that they become a couple and she gets pregnant. After that in the movie she yells out to Chris by saying, "" Oh my God Chris, come look. "" She is referring to the planes that are hitting the World Trade Center that her and Chris are watching on the television. Fact (3) At the end of the movie is the funeral of Chris. It shows how Chris was born in 1974 and how he died in 2013. Can you do the math ? If Chris was born in 1974, and Chris was 30 years of age like he said to his instructor when doing his Seal training, then that means he did his Seal training in the year 2004. Um, the attack on 911 happened in the year 2001",,Anonymous,Biography
Intense,"Clint Eastwood adapts the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL who had the most confirmed kills in the Iraq War. The film pretty much takes the same tack as The Hurt Locker in examining how war effects a man. There's obviously a lot more combat here than in Hurt Locker, and it's very much a war action movie. I didn't find it exploitative, though. Unlike the recent turd Fury, the combat sequences are intense, not ""fun."" The violence is wince-inducing, and you're just hoping to get through it. The film does question, just a little, the purpose of the war, but the protagonist never does. He never did. He was a soldier, and this was his job, to protect his men, and he was good at it.

The film is a film about the life of a real person.,"The film is a film about the life of a real person.The film is based on the 2014 book of the same name by Chris Kyle, a notable sniper in American war history.The film is about the life of Kyle, an American soldier who killed more than 250 enemies during the invasion of Iraq.His childhood and later rigorous military training, his personal life and his life on the battlefield in Iraq are beautifully portrayed.Beginning at Chris Kyle's young age, he has been part of the SEAL team, a U.S. Army commando unit, on four voyages to Iraq and adventurous commando operations there. I really liked it, with its excellent battle scenes and realistic sound mixing.Although he has the power to kill, sometimes even the soldiers have their own chest pains.The problems in the family life of the soldiers are also beautifully presented. The last event in the movie will annoy us even with just the writing on the screen.The film was a box office success, earning six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and an Oscar for Best Sound Mixing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Profound and Unsettling,"I suspect a lot of people appreciated American Sniper for the wrong reasons.I say this because director Clint Eastwood has a long history of using violence to attack violence. It's a long time since Dirty Harry glorified vigilante justice to cheering audiences; as a director, Eastwood has chosen material dealing with the consequences of violence, and it's never, ever sugar-coated. He forces us to think about the consequences of violence, and in this American Sniper is no different.Thanks to a well-publicized trial, most of us know Kyle's life story; he grew up in redneck Texas, and after the September 11 terror attacks decided to join the Navy Seals. He racked up more dead enemy combatants than any other soldier in history, only to be murdered by one of his fellow veterans in 2013.I'm sure there were many in the audience who cheered every shot which felled an enemy combatant, but not Kyle, as portrayed by Bradley Cooper. Two of Kyle's early victims were a mother and a small child, and it's only with the greatest reluctance that he pulls the trigger. It's easy to see why Cooper was nominated for an Oscar; it has to be hard for someone in Kyle's position to keep a grasp on his humanity, and you can see the struggle reflected in Cooper's eyes in every frame. To Cooper's great credit, Kyle takes no pleasure in the chore he does so well.Even in those scenes where Kyle is home, it's clear the war has not changed him for the better. When Kyle goes to get his car repaired, for example, someone using an automatic drill spooks Kyle into thinking there's an enemy attack for a moment. Those moments are marvelous and subtle, perfect examples of the actor's art.Kudos as well to Sienna Miller, who plays Kyle's wife, Taya. In one of the most harrowing scenes I've seen in recent years, Taya and Chris are talking on their cell phones when, suddenly, violence erupts. All Taya can hear are explosions, gunfire, and yelling. Miller's face runs any number of dark emotions: fear, loss, sudden abandonment. Her terror is real. (There's also an all too brief scene with Miller in lingerie; how the hell could Jude Law cheat on that?)Eastwood pulls no punches in the war segments, and nothing is glorified. Eastwood's Iraq is at the gates of hell. The soldiers can't trust anything, and they never know when something's going to blow up, or when bullets will start to fly. They don't know if they're being lured into a trap when invited to dinner at a local's home. Sometimes sophisticated technology fails. I don't know about anyone else, but I felt as scared and uncertain as the soldiers on the screen. I shudder to think what real war is like.People will see many messages in American Sniper, and I saw a very clear one: Chris Kyle is yet another victim of America's gun culture. Played by Ben Reed, Kyle's father raises his kids to shoot and his dark and ignorant view of humanity should frighten everyone; it's no surprise Kyle became such a proficient killer with an upbringing like that.Eastwood does not show Kyle's murder, but most of us know what happened: Kyle spent plenty of time with his fellow veterans to give them the help he so often needed himself. Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield took Eddie Ray Routh, someone they suspected was mentally unstable, to a shooting range. In retrospect, it was a very stupid thing to do. Had they gone to a bar, or a basketball game, it is likely they would have survived. You don't give guns to crazy people.This is Eastwood's most profound film on the consequences of violence since Unforgiven. I can't imagine anyone leaving the theater waving a flag and cheering after seeing this film; just a deep sense of sadness and loss.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotionally driven true based war biopic,"Starring Bradley Cooper as the lead portraying real life former Navy Seal Chris Kyle, sees him performing perhaps one of his best roles and is definitely stands out and excels the film for the better.About the conceit, a lot of it is spent on Chris' battlefield exploits and traumas, from the expertise as a marksman that earned him the nickname ""The Legend"" to the death of fellow soldiers he was unable to save.Directed by beloved veteran director Clint Eastwood brings tension to plenty of those life/ death set sequences.What stands out is also the chemistry between Chris and his wife (Sienna Miller) as well as the interactions with him and his colleagues.As an action war film, the story is intriguing and the highlights are those scenes with Chris snipping from top building locations on his targets.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Guess what?! ... Arabs are terrorists,"I don't wanna talk about direction cause it's Clint Eastwood and this is a master piece of war movies. But I wanna talk about that stupid screenplay ,about what you call ""Arabic terrorists"". This movie exposes American citizens -American writers to be accurate- ignorance and I don't blame them cause I know how the American media worked hard to build that picture, it took them several years. But there is something you should know1st- 11 September attacks has nothing to do with Iraq it is all about Afghanistan but I think you will be shocked if you read wiki leaks documents as you will know that America has been warned by many countries about this attacks before it happens but simply the USA let it go!!! which makes many questions about what it was planning for? and what if all that was planned to invade Afghanistan! by the way did you know that Afghanistan is not even an Arabic country?!, if you don't know that it means you still know nothing about the middle east. 2nd- You should know too that America Invaded Iraq not for saving the world from what they called ""weapon of mass destruction"" but it is all about Oil as the American military forces didn't find a nuclear shoe right there. 3rd- what you suppose people to do when you come on their country, ruin their life claiming that bullshit. Armies have no rules they 're killing women ,children and so on. forget about the movie,Soldiers have no mercy they kill every one and every thing, but the USA wants that people to say hi from the speculum of the sniper when they're being shot so you can say now that people are not terrorists. there is no need to mention violations of America in wars and what happened in different detains wiki leaks said that too.you should either know that Arabs don't have sheep and deserts that only comes on your TV cause that idea helps your country to come on arabic countries more and more cause it gives you an impression that Arabs are retard and savages and we gonna make them civilized ,actually they don't, as ""the white power"" gonna take the oil only.Finally, I wanna say that Arab society is not civilized as much as USA but it is not retard as much as you think. you should use your mid and don't let the media come on your mind cause you will be a civilized American citizen but mentally retarded.",,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty good one....No regrets watching it ...But....,"I decided to watch this one because the ratings were pretty good and attractive.. The plot is very exciting and it should be appreciated. I suspected this was taken from a book and i heard it from here and there. maybe its true or not i dint do that much reading. OK now when considering this movie ...It doesn't take you to a battlefield that there are bullets fired ,yells and explosions all throughout the movie. This is a new angle that looked right into the war.I like this one because it shows the audience that how hard to be a soldier and serve the country and it shows us what it takes to keep being a soldier.It gives us clear image about how hard the decisions are made in the open battlefield and how effective they are.This movie shows a single soldier , who is dedicated to keep his friends safe and protected at all costs.now here comes the ""But"" .... As this movie is soo good i had some questions when looking at some scenes. Questions like, Does it give out a good picture about soldiers who had served a country (not talking about USA but any country) and so many What Ifs popped up while i watched this movie. and it gives a troubled picture about family life. like can everything can be justified ""like that""....?Get the point. so last...actually good movie.

"Not great, but good","Is this an Oscar winning movie? I don't think so. Why did it get an Oscar? Perhaps because Clint was filming it and Bradly Cooper (Chris Kyle) was actor in lead. Don't get me wrong, movie was fine, but not that great for Oscar winning movie.Bradley Cooper was great in his roll, we can see excellent acting from him. In some scenes you can't believe it's him, and just wonder what he had to get through to bring out that emotion, and how to act in some scenes. Also, it was decent story, decent shooting, but not that exceptional.I don't know what Clint was trying to do, maybe show him as hero (Chris Kyle)? I mean why, he openly admitted killing those ""savages"" as he called them and felt good about it. He, as it's shown in movie didn't feel remorse for it, at all. Also, even if movie was long, it felt like it quickly passed through story. It really could have be done better, maybe show both sides of Americas war on East while portraying Kyle as part of it.In future, please Clint, think before doing sensitive stories, as I know you can do better, because you are a great director, and actor. Keep up the good work.Che",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Only our country is expected to fight wars by RULES!!!!,"Regardless of what anyone thinks about this movie as being true or whatever....it showed me one absolute thing for sure: EVERYONE IN WAR GIVES HIS/HER LIFE EVEN IF HE/SHE LIVES. The horrors of war and the things these people must do are inconceivable. They willingly chose to give up their lives to defend our country because their belief in freedom, and what we stand for, means so much. Because they survived, they must carry the never ending burden of war horrors for the rest of their lives. How anyone EVER is able to go back to a 'normal' life to me is impossible after such an experience. Our country should be DEEPLY ashamed that there are commercials airing 24/7 imploring monetary donations to care for our military people who GAVE THEIR LIVES EVEN THOUGH THEY LIVED. Unacceptable, intolerable and completely unnecessary that this situation exists. I thank GOD and these incredible men and women who are charged with doing whatever is necessary in a war we will NEVER win. Anyone can sit back and judge a movie that is simply a director's depiction and interpretation of events, but perhaps people should look beyond that to the deeper story of what is given up so that we can have the right to sit back and judge things most of us never must face.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Too long but with surprising end,I watched American Sniper on Netflix and I needed three evenings to see until the end. I think the running time is with 140 minutes too long. The scenes were sometimes too slow paced. Apart this it was great cinema and at least you have here a true story. I never imagined that it ends so surprisingly but I won't spoil more about. The cinematography is well done and the special effects on the battle field too. It offers many emotions and psychological moments. If you like this genre of movies give it a try. But be warned there are some brutal pictures hard to digest. If you like these desert terror thrillers don't miss the other fast paced ones The Hurt Locker or Lone Survivor. 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fascinating character study,"The lion's share of ""American Sniper"" is spent overseas and on the battlefield, but it's not that war movie that really interested me. It's the scenes when Kyle is back home that the movie bears some real weight. This character is so hard-wired and mentally with his brothers-in-arms that he can't explain to those back at home why he has to keep going back to Iraq. But it's also heartbreaking to see the destructive effects on his family life. Chris and his wife started out s something exciting, but the relationship suffers when he's back home; the anxiety increases simply when they're having a marital chat.It might be that, between ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", I've just gotten bored with battle scenes in that region. The shootouts and ambushes weren't doing it for me (well-staged though they were). Not sure. But when the movie becomes (almost) anti-war is where the real tension happens. And give Bradley Cooper some real credit here; he really seems to inhabit that Texas drawl, rather than just affecting an accent. That, and the bulked physique, he's throwing himself into this role.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Don't listen to the negative, politically motivated reviews","If a review includes ""George Bush"", ""Haliburton"", etc. skip it because those fools didn't even see this film. I don't know much about Chris Kyle's history so I cannot comment on the accuracy of his story but what impressed me with the film was the accuracy of combat operations. Eastwood was very meticulous to capture every detail of team operations, uniforms, communications, equipment, vehicles, etc. I can usually pick apart hundreds of details in military films but he did his homework. I even noticed an Army NCO with a 2nd Ranger Battalion tab working with the team on a few missions. Most Directors would have just shown Seals, presuming the public doesn't know any better but SOCOM operations often include troops from multiple branches. Also, from a technical perspective, Eastwood managed to get some outstanding action footage. There were several extended, low light and varying light tracking shots that were executed flawlessly. During the whole film, I could see the meticulous attention they gave to color and light matching. Taking all of that into consideration and the performances by the cast, including non-professional actors, I think Eastwood delivered big time. For the reviews that say this film is propaganda, you should skip those too, they didn't see the film. ""American Sniper"" clearly balances the hooray moments with the inherent tragedy of war and the physical and mental damage it inflicts.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotional and full of intense action. 7/10,"Review: I really didn't know that this was based on a real person called Chris Kyle who got killed by another war veteran who was suffering with post traumatic stress. When I saw what happened to him at the end of the movie, it did touch me because he lived through 4 tours of duty and killed 160 enemies which saves many people's life's. It does seem more like a documentary than a Hollywood blockbuster, so you feel like your in the heart of the action which gave the movie intensity and anticipation. Bradley Cooper wouldn't have been my first choice to play this role but he done a brilliant job as the American Sniper who had difficulties with his personal life whilst serving his country. Once he decided to call it a day, he still had problems with every day to day life but you could see that his family life had improved. That's why the ending really touched me and I have to say that a Clint Eastwood done a great job with such a delicate story. Its only been 2 years since he was murdered so this amazing story meant a lot to many people, especially his wife and children. From an entertainment point of view, I did enjoy the film and the action scenes were shot extremely well. The love story was also put together well and it gives you many different elements to Chris Kyle who achieved so much in his 38 years on earth. Enjoyable!Round-Up: What an emotional story! Bradley Cooper was last seen in Serena and American Hustle so I wasn't expecting to see him in such a manly movie about a war hero. After watching the documentary about the making of the movie, he really did give this movie his all and he spent some time with Chris Kyle's widow, with Clint Eastwood, so they could get this picture exactly right. Judging by the money that it made at the box office, it's obvious that many people were touched by the story and it always helps when you've got Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood on board. Its hard to believe that Eastwood can still pull out major blockbusters at the age of 85 and he still has 2 movies in the pipeline. Bradley Cooper hasn't stopped working since his major role in the Hangover in 2009 and with his films grossing over 2 and a half billion dollars, he has definitely become a major league player in Hollywood. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch for its intensity and emotional storyline which has been put together well by Clint Eastwood.Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $545millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama movies about the true story of Chris Kyle who saved many people's life's on the battlefield but sadly was murdered by another veteran who was suffering with stress. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
When do they shoot a movie about the thousands of murdered Iraqi civilians?,"Very good acting, competent technical direction and boring unimpressive story about an ignorant cowboy, who thought he was fighting evil, when in fact he was fighting for oil and territorial dominance while evil was comfortably sitting home and had three names: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld.This is another republican propaganda flick, not about an hero, but about a tragic figure among so many, who was brainwashed with the most vicious and obscene propaganda into believing that Iraq and Saddam Hussein were involved in 9/11 and had weapons of mass destruction.This movie is a moral inversion of a greedy and stupid war, which caused the chaos in the region and still kills innocent people every single day.

Great acting,"Not a showy performance, but a great one nonetheless, and I think it helps to see Cooper doing a different kind of character. I don't think I nominate him, the category is strong this year, but he's somewhere in #6-#8 range 9and I have yet to see Cumberbatch or Oyelowo) and I won't begrude his nod if he's nominated (and he probably will, he's been on a roll with the AMPAS). The film, as a whole though, is another story, but I'm sure many will disagree with me on that. However, the film being nominated by the PGA... It's a solid film, pretty good even, but it really doesn't deserve any other of the big 8 nominations other than maybe Cooper. Overall, recommended, even if nothing amazing.",,Anonymous,Biography
PTSD and the toll of war on the soldier's psyche,"I went into this film with a little trepidation due to the extremely polarized reactions I saw online. Beyond that, I really wasn't too familiar with the film or Chris Kyle's life outside of the tragic way he died. Now that I've seen it, I can say that it's a good film, although its subtlety might be the reason some people read it the way they do. Far from being a pro-war statement (or anti-war, for that matter), its primary focus is in showing the toll that war takes on the soldier's psyche.A run-down of plot details isn't really necessary because you can just pick up Chris Kyle's autobiography if that's what you want. The basic structure is a series of sequences that go from Chris's home life to each of the four tours he served in Iraq. After each tour, you can see the effect that his job as sniper has on him psychologically. This is perhaps the film's best asset, although it doesn't really start to pay off until about halfway through. Before that, you have to deal with about 30 minutes of rote setup that establishes Chris's character: an all-American guy with simple values and morals. Odds are, this is what the more conservative viewers in the audience are drawn to, although to take what Chris says at face value is to miss the psychological underpinnings and point of the film.What works against the film is, unfortunately, the direction. Clint Eastwood might have been Chris's dream director (according to his wife, at least), but it's quite apparent that he was merely a hired gun. The battle sequences, which one would expect to have some flair, were competently staged but executed rather stiffly. That's not to say they were all bad, though. There were a couple of moments that really worked on a visceral and emotional level, one of which was used as a selling point in the trailers. In the scenes back home, Eastwood steps back further and lets the characters and drama unfold naturally but the whole thing still feels anonymous from a directorial perspective.Of course, given that I enjoyed the film there is plenty to give it credit for doing right. Chief among these are Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, who I feel were perfectly cast. They looked like their real life counterparts, and Bradley Cooper did some DeNiro-level character work in terms of turning himself into Chris Kyle. However, given the film's focus on war's toll on the human psyche and its effect on family, Sienna Miller did an amazing job portraying a wife who only wants to have her husband return to her alive and mentally be there. Even though it takes a while for the film to show its hand, once you see Chris Kyle's struggle to return to normal life after returning from the battlefield, all of the simplistic setup somehow feels worth it.Overall, I don't see what people got so up in arms about. No, the film doesn't question American involvement in the Middle East or the morality or war in general. It also doesn't paint Chris Kyle as some savage-killing hero/real-life Rambo. Even in the few moments where Kyle is referred to as a ""legend"" he never feels quite at ease with the designation. To him, being a sniper was a job he did to protect his fellow soldiers. Simplicity of character should not be mistaken for the film itself being simplistic. Despite the unspectacular direction (and some ridiculous CGI bullet time), I thought American SNIPER was a subtle, maybe too much so, examination of the detrimental effect that war can have on the mind of a soldier and the lives of their family.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Individual's Experience as US Navy SEAL Sniper,"This film is an excellent adaptation of Chris Kyle's memoir about his experience as a United States Navy SEAL sniper. There are some deviations from the book as well as a number of controversies surrounding this adaptation, but it does not detract from the quality of the film nor enjoyment of it. I highly recommend this movie.It is important to keep in mind not to mix up this film with the morality or justification of our military presence in Iraq and the Middle East. This is a story of an individual's experience and should not be confounded with issues bigger than what the film is attempting to address. Many reviewers are confused with this simple fact and dismiss the film over understandable ignorance.The film will, hopefully, make you think about the sacrifice our servicemen make every day to keep us safe and reinforce the rights we take for granted.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The deparment of denfense new add campaign,"I was engaged in the story throughout the film. Chris and how Bradley Cooper portrayed him fascinated me. His resolve and determination were palpable. The subtle shift in his behavior after each tours were obvious to me - which technically does not make them subtle. Then at the end we finally have a glimpse of the cowboy we first met, while at the same time see that he was changed.But I wasn't as emotionally invested in the film as I thought I'd be. Probably because the movie has a tendency to look like an add campaign for the U.S. Military. It's not promoting war or anything but it kind of looks like a nicely directed action-based commercial. Despite the intensity, the violence, and the drama in some scenes it's the archive footage that got to me. It took me by surprised and I shed a few tears.American Sniper is a war epic drama that entertains but lacks subtlety.

Fantastic!,This Movie was fantastic! I loved every part of it. I felt like I was truly watching Chris Kyle's Story. It was sad and intense and everything in between. Now I understand that they had to add in the end and couldn't fully complete the movie because of what terrible thing happened in real life but just judging the movie thats why I only gave it a 9. I also only gave it a 9 because I have heard that it drifted from the real story a bit and wasn't 100% true but that doesn't really matter as much because it was still and awesome movie and was close enough not to disrespect anyone. Bradley Cooper was absolutely amazing in this movie and really pulled on your heart strings in some of those scenes. All of the other actors were also great in this movie.

"Nothing special, bolstered by its performances if anything.","American Sniper is now one of the most controversial movies of the year but still one of the most successful. It's difficult to have a passionate opinion on either side now that it's run its course and it was typically clouded by conscious or unconscious intentions. But the film is not plagued by its politics as some feel it is. The shades of grey may not be vivid but it is also not black and white. Chris Kyle may be presented as a hero in many ways in the film, but it is not clear cut, and he is wrestling with some demons, not that showing Kyle recoil at killing people is redemption enough. Granted, the film does have some nauseating jingoistic moments - you can't end the conversation of an entire war based on the notion of protecting buddies. But nevertheless, it's an average film. The typical war film you get these days don't try any more or less harder than Sniper does. It is well done in the technical department with the sound design and editing salvaging what it can when the writing gets messy. The real highlights of the film are Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. The latter is great if underused but it's mostly refreshing to see Cooper not try to show off how much charisma he has and actually be transformative and nuanced in a way. Still, nothing special overall, only worthy of conversation because of Oscar nominations and box office.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood can do NO Wrong in my Eyes,"I'm one of Clint's biggest fans and he does not disappoint with this hard hitting direction of this biopic film.The American Sniper of the title Bradley Cooper proves he's become one of the best actors out there, there are so many scenes here that are difficult to watch.Everyone assumes Clint is this BIG All-Action figure of a Man and let's be honest back in the 60's, 70's & 80's he was, a huge Iconic American Actor & Director but he proved with 'Unforgiven' he was a thought provoking man too...this was a tricky film to take on but everyone concerned in the making of this film are to be applauded.War is NOT pretty or easy HOWEVER Good you are and this guy was incredible, he's confident, good and even a little cocky but over his different tours of duty the reality of the situations he's placed in wears him down...the scene featuring the kid and the woman holding the bomb is one i'm sure they all to sadly saw and it happens again with a young child and a rocket launcher...I can't even imagine being in that scenario.Clint's always been a good director (took good notes from Don Seigel and others) and this is a more modern direction from Clint, a marked difference from the likes of 'Play Misty for Me' I didn't even realise it was Sienna Miller at first (the wife) and she is brilliant (the look on her face at the end of the film as that guy turns up at the house is chilling) Clint doesn't even mind courting controversy as the brother finally follows his brother (Cooper) and bad mouths the USA, right now all is not good with the USA (as I write this Donald Trump still has a chance of becoming the President of the United States! what? I pray and hope the Good American People will come to their senses)This is a terrific film made by one of my all-time favourite actors & confident directors and you'd be a fool to miss it, a word of warning though, the tears may well fall by the end....EMOTIONAL Stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"American SniperThe key to being a skilled marksman is remembering to remove the riflescope lens cap before you shoot.Thankfully, the rifleman in this drama is that adroit, and much more.An accomplished shooter since childhood, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) gravitates towards a military career when he's older.In post-9/11 Iraq, Chris' skill behind the riflescope quickly garners him a reputation as a merciless sniper, not only amongst his platoon but also the al-Qaeda leaders he's been assigned to assassinate.On the home front, however, his wife (Sienna Miller) struggles to raise their children without a father.When he is home, Chris' PTSD keeps him from leading a normal life.Polarizing for its depiction of war, Clint Eastwood's adaption of Chris' biography does dip into hero-worshipping at times, but it also emphasizes the repercussions war has on its returning 'heroes'.Incidentally, post-service snipers have bright futures back home as ticking time bombs.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American PROPAGANDA,"This is not a movie! This is the new marketing strategy of the American army to get stupid people to join.Apparently Clint Eastwood was hired by the army to create a 2 hours advertisement on how ""honorable"" it is to be part of the oil wars. This a very political movie, trying to justify why America waged a war over more than one country because of the alleged action of very small group of extremest residing in these countries.No surprise that the movie had little success on the foreign market. This movie is offensive and is depicting only what is favorable for the Americans in an exaggerating way and missing the reality of the war. For convenience all the kids and women killed in the war, were extremest, endangering the lives of the ""innocent"" solders, while in reality a lot of innocent kids and women who had nothing to do with any extremest were killed. Somehow the torture prisons were also left out and the ""interrogation"" practices.In the end the movie is trying to be dramatic, showing the psychological consequences of protecting ""innocent"" solder and ""justifyingly"" killing kids and women. The reality, however, is a bit different. The psychological effects on solders were because they were killing innocent people for the greediness of other who were enjoying themselves in luxury in the mean time.I find this movie disgusting. The fact that it has been nominated for 6 Oscars, shows how objective the Academy Awards are. If you are low intelligent American, you would probably like it. If you are an intelligent American, you will be ashamed of this propaganda. I don't think I have to say what the rest of the world think about the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Bit Misunderstood,"American Sniper, the name alone will either rally your sense of nationalism or make you roll your eyes as a propaganda piece. First of all, regardless of how you view the subject matter, I think we're all in agreement that Bradley Cooper absolutely nailed this role. As far as this films controversies, I tend to lean liberal but did not view this film the same way most liberals do. I feel like much of the hate this movie garners, is because of the location the story is set in, the Iraq war. By now we've all accepted the absolute disgrace that war was to America, but this movie isn't telling the story of the Iraq War. Instead, this film is telling the story of a soldier who served in it. A soldier who sees the amount of combat Chris Kyle saw has a difficult road and inevitably develops a complex character. One scene struck me more than any in the movie, during the scenes in between his tours it often showed Mr. Kyle sitting in his living room watching film on the war, while his wife asks if he can turn it down. Further into the movie he is again sitting in his living room, we don't see the TV yet, but we hear the incredibly loud and unmistakable sound of war. As the camera slowly pans around till it ends up behind Kyle, you see him staring at a turned of TV. No more film, no more wife telling him to turn it down, because he carried the sound of war inside his own head at all times. If anything this movie should encourage Americans to not only step up the care we provide our veterans, but also make sure our leaders aren't sending them into the wrong wars. Chris Kyle made a sacrifice, his wife did as well, and his children were subjected to this sacrifice. I believe this sacrifice is no less powerful due to the mistakes our leaders made, because if they had chosen the right war Chris Kyle would have gone all the same. We can recognize this sacrifice without endorsing the war. Because this film isn't about the war, it's about Chris Kyle, and it's one hell of a film",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie was truly fantastic. Truly shocked by other closed-minded reviews.,"First of let me just say that this is my first review of a movie here on IMDb. I rarely write reviews on here simply because I'm to lazy. But reading these pointless 1-star reviews literarily made my blood boil and I found it upon myself to post an actual review of this movie.Being an avid movie watcher and in general take an interest in film. I thought this movie was fantastic. Bradley Coopers acting was terrific and (the great) Clint Eastwood directing was something out of this world. As others have said, I literarily felt as if I was watching the actual Chris Kyle. I completely forgot that I was watching Bradley Cooper act. Cooper certainly deserves an Oscar nod if not a win (although I'm kinda rooting for Eddie Raymond, tight competition this year).What ticks me off is 1.) People are writing one star ""reviews"" not on the movie, but on their personal opinion. Some of these reviews are from Italy or the UK, which frankly I don't get because their opinion has no merit. and 2.) I bet you most of the 1-star ""reviews"" haven't even bothered reading the actual book that Chris Kyle wrote. They just take what they may or may have not heard from the media and post it here. To anyone who is reading this and who is on the fence watching this movie..I ask you to please watch it. It is truly a fantastic movie. Don't let these worthless so called ""reviews"" make you not watch the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
First time giving an 1/10 on IMDb,"With great expectation on a highly Oscar-Nominated movie staring profound actor Bradley Cooper, which turned me down so much after witnessing a movie with empty perspective but only self-ego of American.On the angle of movie production, this is very old-school war movie style, there are nothing new but tedious street gun fighting in this movie. If you want to find exciting war movie elements, save your money and time, just rent ""Saving Private Ryan"" or a much better sniper movie ""Enemy At Gate"" home. The emotion part of a soldier is not touching in the movie, people would not drown a tear with this unlikeable character.And the story telling is what turned me down so much. It showed the news cut of 911, and then the army goes to Iraq instead of Afghan? What's the sense of it? Every middle-east Muslims are terrorists? The way to protect your home and family is by invading innocent people's home? The aim of the sniper is revenging over the death of friends, and the goal is execute one single sniper and then killing a bunch of armies by direct bump into their base and returned home save and sound with some scratch? How heroic and how vainly it is.American invaded Iraq twice with non-justified reason, and there are still people like Clint Eastwood evilize middle-east country and rationalize the invasion of Americans who tried to profit through making war? For God sake it took such a long way to end the second ridiculous Iraq war, stop trying to persuade people that American is always right.Please stop promoting movies which makes the world away from peace and wasting people's time. It's also disgusting that Oscar giving it a ticket to best motion picture, please don't promote the movie which tore the world apart.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good movie, Just not as great as everyone thinks.","I was a little disappointed by American Sniper. I figured that Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper were going to be a perfect combination for this movie, but it didn't reach my expectations. Cooper was great as he often is and although he likely won't win an Oscar for this performance it will go down as one of his greatest. Chris Kyle just had such an incredible and difficult background to jam into a 2 hour movie and I felt that they were trying to rely too much on the action and not enough on the drama, although there the action was overused it was displayed well. There is also no development for any of the other characters in the movie. It seems like Kyle was the only character in the movie that mattered. I was glad that they incorporated the effects of PTSD during this movie, but his struggles needed to be a bigger component of the movie rather than just portraying him as a hero who was unstoppable and invincible. The last 20 minutes were the past of the movie that were the best.",,Anonymous,Biography

You know it's going to be good......,".....when Jane Fonda praises a Clint Eastwood war movie.I mean you expect people like Mikey Moore to trash this genre, but when Jane Fonda says nice things about what is considered to be a movie with a right-leaning theme, you have to know it's probably worth seeing. Perhaps there's hope for Jane after all these years. It's telling that the most vocal detractors (Moore, et al) are also those least likely to have ever worn a uniform (well, a REAL uniform, not the moth-eaten ball-cap, Joe Sixpack uniform that Moore like to wear). Fonda compares the film to ""Coming Home"", which I was not crazy about, but I grant that it was a good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Way better than the book,"I not sure how I stumbled on the book, but I listened to it a few months before Chris Kyles death in 2013. I liked the book, but I would certainly not rank it in any top ten list. Since then I have learned a lot more about his life after the war including the help he gave other soldiers with PTSD that ultimately cost him his life. The movie gave a much better depiction of how Chris Kyle changed and developed as a person over his life that you could ever get from the book. I read somewhere that the screenwriter used many sources outside of the book to develop the script and I believe it. This is an absolute must see movie if you can handle the obvious violence that comes with modern day war movies. It grips you from the opening seen to the solemn ending. I am from Minnesota so I must add - shame on you Jesse Ventura.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
In Between The Film's Depictions of Contemporary War Is the Blah Rhetoric of the Average Stereotypical Jarhead,Now here's the thing. Due to really the people that supported it and glorified the film's real life protagonist I felt rather inclined to rate this film 1 out of 10 stars and call it a day but this regional entertainment retailer always has this great sell on DVDs and I got this movie for a dollar so I set my politics aside to honestly watch this film. One thing that always catches my eyes in a Clint Eastwood directed film is it's boring monotone lighting which is kinda present in American Sniper accept for the few (and there are few) scenes of the American sniper being the American Sniper. I appreciated the honesty of this films politics but I found a certain Life and World Changing Cliché scene to be pretty funny. But I did not feel while watching American Sniper as I do in every recent Eastwood film (with the exception of Letters From Iwo Jima) the continued boredom until the sweet inevitable credits. But in between the realism in the film's depictions of contemporary war is the blah rhetoric of an average stereotypical jar-head either listening or speaking to Bradley Cooper who is the only reason I rate this film an 8 instead of a 7. But I liked the Punisher being read and can dig all the Texas stuff.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outrageous,"They have their enemy in the cross hairs and they shoot with impunity. They are irresponsible, biased and heartless. Therefore I must give the creators of this outrage the lowest rating, a 1 for awful. These people are NOT the filmmakers who crafted ""American Sniper."" These people are the specific IMDb reviewers who have rated this film based on political dogma rather than artistic merit. They are the snipers. They are shooting from the wrong location (IMDb) at the wrong victims (the filmmakers). IMDb is not a political forum. The rated 1 reviews predominate the top of the user review list. So the casual visitor is likely to gather ""American Sniper"" is a VERY bad movie. As a result, the film is shot in the back unfairly. After all, the overall rating is 7.5. That is quite good. But the better reviews do not show up in any fair quantity until several pages into the user review list.In fairness, some of the negative reviews were thoughtful and demonstrated that the writers had actually watched the entire film. They separate the art from the message. And certainly, films with a political point of view are fair game for political opinion. My beef is with the many reviews which are undisguised political diatribe. The ones which make little or no notice of the film as entertainment, craftsmanship, or art. There are countless forums for this kind of free speech. But, in my opinion, I'd rather not see it stacked en mass here on the user review lists.As for my opinion of the film, I give ""American Sniper"" 8 out of 10. It isn't the Best film I've seen this year, but it is surely one of them. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bradley Cooper was perfect in the role giving an amazing performance. Every performance was excellent and Clint Eastwood at 84? Come on man, outstanding! So the haters can hate... somewhere else. This forum is about movies not politics.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very tough to review, I have very mixed feelings about this movie.","American Sniper was one of those films that carried a massive hype, everybody was talking about it upon its release and it seemed that everybody, other than myself had seen it. Because of this hype I was expecting an experience that was vastly above average, sadly I was a disappointed. American Sniper is a well-made movie and I did enjoy it but it was nowhere near as good as I was expecting/ hoping that it would be.Since watching this movie I have seen many negative reviews online from people who were genuinely offended by this movie. They believed it to be an insult to American Citizens and a generalization of the Iraq population, portraying them (men women and children) to be all bad and evil. Having read reviews and re-thought on American Sniper, I can now appreciate these people opinions and sadly this movie has huge questionable issues.American Sniper shows a blindly biased account of war from an American Citizen, with no real motive or intention apart from a flashback or him killing a deer as a child, getting cheated on by his girlfriend and most importantly; seeing 9/11 unfold on the TV. American Story is another Hollywood blockbuster which tries to convince the audience that glorifies war and gives another ignorant biased view of life on the frontline. War movies are always a touchy genre, they can often glamorise war and make it seem that everything is acceptable in the name of 'fighting for your country'.The plot of American Sniper states that It follows the story of his struggle to deal with real life and how returning home from war is such a difficult task. We hardly see any of this though; we don't get much story of his time with his family. There is little, if any, character development, Chris Kyle is portrayed as a killing machine, no conscience murderer, then on the other hand they give a half-hearted attempt of showing him as a family man, riddled with guilt over the war. It all feels very confused and lacks identity. The biggest positive of this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He has really developed a name for himself over recent years with some great performances and American Sniper is another great example of his acting ability. The supporting cast all do a respectable job and the direction of the movie is also satisfactory. The action War scenes are very well done and choreographed well, they don't contain endless shots of 'shaky cam' which makes for much easier viewing. When I initially watched this I didn't pick up on the negative points so much, I enjoyed the movie on first viewing, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was still a good movie. However I now cannot help but realise the huge negatives that this film contains.I knew nothing of Chris Kyle but having researched him after viewing this movie I can now agree with many of the negative reviews on here. He was portrayed as a war hero, his real life personality and actions are displayed as black and white in this movie which is simply not the case in real life.Overall as a movie: It was a decent paced war film with solid acting but lacked any depth, identity and powerful scenes. Rating this movie on the movie alone I would give it a 7/10. However having researched the back story and real life events I find it hard to view this movie in a positive light and I can completely appreciate the bad reviews and controversy that surround American Sniper.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice one,"""American Sniper"" takes aim with a 7/10 rating, hitting the target of your liking. Bradley Cooper's compelling performance adds depth to the portrayal of Chris Kyle, making the character resonate with authenticity. The film's strength lies in its intense and realistic depiction of war, capturing the emotional toll on soldiers. The film editing masterfully weaves together Kyle's tours of duty, creating a gripping narrative. However, the weakness may lie in a somewhat simplified portrayal of complex geopolitical issues. The music complements the film's mood, enhancing the overall experience. Cinematography captures both the brutality of war and the quieter moments, creating a visual impact. ""American Sniper"" delivers a poignant exploration of the toll of war on the human psyche, earning its stripes in the war film genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worst film I've seen in decades,"It's so sad to see the garbage that Hollywood serves up nowadays. To learn that this film has already made millions will inevitably lead to more of the same: American ""hero""s, everyone else the enemy, black and white, pass or fail.The only positives I could find was the taught direction, the film is never boring for example, the special effects impressive superb save for the ridiculous rubber baby (yes really), and Bradley Cooper is kind of cute, but at its core this is a propaganda film designed to encourage young males in the USA to join the military; to play a real version of a video game; to have some excitement in their lives.

The story is pretty simple which leaves plenty of space to develop a deep insight into the inner experience of the hero and his struggle. Instead, we are ""forced"" to watch perfectly filmed soldier actions and waiting for something more.
Where are the feelings, doubts, insane wishes to go back on field and leaving your sweet wife and children?In conclusion: If you liked Black Hawk Down (2001) or The Hurt Locker (2008) then give it a try. I need(ed) something more to persuade me to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece Misunderstood.,"When I saw the horrible reviews this was getting I had to write something. This movie is amazing, and clearly people are taking it as an attack when it has been written and shot in the eyes of the main character (Chris Kyle) It isn't glorifying war, or ""attacking Iraqis"". It is simply telling a story (Based on a book which is based off a true story) through the eyes of this certain American. Clearly people are misunderstanding the films views and taking offence, to then call this movie stupid and then labelling all Americans as stupid - is kind of ironic. (By the way I'm Australian) Okay now that that is out the way and we are now on a neutral page the review. The movie shows an American with a skill of a sniper going into war and how it affects him and his family. The toll it takes not only on his mental side but everyone around him. The character development is amazing and the movie is well directed and acted to deliver this. The story has a medium to fast pace and i got quite involved in the characters very short on. I rate it a 8.5/10 but it was getting so many stupid 1's that i felt the need to rate higher. It needs to be watched with an open mind and taken from a view point and not a previous stand point on war and soldiers. It is a war film so it isn't going to be pretty or for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sadly... over-hyped,"We saw this movie at 11:45 AM- the very first showing in my little city of about 100K. I was very excited for this too was a ""true"" story just as ""Lone Survivor"" was. It's also a ""recent"" war movie and I personally know a few who came back- some who came back sick and others only as a fond memory. In MY mind? This movie was trying to satisfy two types of movie goers. 1. The action junkie and 2. the ""Chick-Flick"" emotional journey movie. Again in MY mind? It failed both. Too scattered. One minute he's a child learning how to shoot the next- he's going from tour to tour and finally comes home. Inbetween? It's back and fourth between home and war, back home, back to war. I think the reason this movie is SO popular right now is because we Americans are sick and tired of being hated in our own country BY our own countrymen. Gun hate also has a role in this too. Americans are realizing- the once great and powerful United States of America- is slowly but, surely being turned into a third world country by a President seemingly not caring in the least. In fact- this movie represents the anger and dissatisfaction of where this country- the United States- is being led. And finally- in MY mind, this is exactly WHY it's so popular and profitable.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Comparable to Hurt Locker,"Like The Hurt Locker, American Sniper provides insight into how war impacts the psyche of soldiers. Although Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is celebrated among fellow soldiers, director Clint Eastwood lends as much time portraying the strain the war had on Kyle's personal life, specifically his wife. Bradley Cooper (who trained for three months to gain 40 pounds of muscle) plays the conflicted Kyle, who forces himself to develop a hatred of the enemy, referring to Iraqis as ""savages,"" so he can justify killing them. The action scenes provide an adrenaline rush, but it's the intentional moments of silence — such as when Kyle, with finger on the trigger, is deciding whether to kill a child who is holding what appears to be a bomb — that make American Sniper an outstanding movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Am Legend...,"Clint Eastwood knows how to make good movies. It's that simple. I can't remember him ever missing the mark on a film that he has directed. I'm sure there are many embellishments to the story surrounding American Sniper. Considering everything I've read about Chris Kyle's penchant for stretching the truth in his book, there's no way that some dramatic license wasn't taken. This is as it should be with a film adaptation because lest we forget, it is meant to be entertaining. It certainly was that. Kyle's story comes with all of the standard fare surrounding a soldier that has seen a lot of battle. The struggle to keep his family together, dealing with PTSD and the realization that there came a time when he had to decide to put the soldier aside. This was arguably the hardest decision for him because from everything I've heard, after serving in a war, it is hard to make yourself believe that you are wired for anything else. Unless you have served your country in such a heroic fashion, there is no way for you to understand what these patriots deal with on a day to day basis. Overall, the movie is written well, Clint Eastwood did an excellent job of crafting a great story and this is probably Bradley Cooper's best work. He fares much better when he is subtle. I didn't expect much out of this movie going in, but I enjoyed it immensely.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie offered love, romance, adventure and action all rolled into one. Upon leaving the theater, there was a man standing there saluting the screen with tears in his eyes. There was no doubt that he too has seen what our brave young soldiers have seen and have been through. Perhaps he was in Iraq and perhaps it brought back memories?

Good but I expected more,"This film tells the story of the event wars, told through the experiences of an outstanding sniper in the elite Seal unit of USA.I find ""American Sniper"" quite a departure from Clint Eastwood's recent films. Usually his films tell an emotional story that drives people to tears, touching the heart and soul like he often excels in doing. Instead, in this film he focuses on the bloody combats in the warzone. The emotional subplot is only minor, as if they are filler scenes between the intense combat scenes. The result is that the emotional side of the film is much underdeveloped, and even rushed and inadequately expressed especially after Chris congress back from the fourth tour.As a war thriller, ""American Sniper"" is good.

Solid,"Well directed and very engaging. The exploration of PTSD as a result of war was probably the part I found the most interesting. The film has a drab colourless look which I'm starting to get a bit tired of now in war films. It doesn't exactly work either with the hot and dusty streets of what are mean to be Iraq. The film does though have an awful sense of tension to it, the feeling at any moment a bomb could go off or they could turn down a street and be fired on. The film is heavy handed but unabashedly patriotic in a rare way these days. The questions though about what happens to a solider when the fighting stops were very interestingly explored. Clint Eastwood has directed a pretty solid film. The scene with the baby I won't even comment on.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The american hero,"Clint Eastwood has always expressed his devotion to his country, but probably where it becomes most evident is in 'American Sniper'.
The film tells the story of Chris Kyle, who was one of the best snipers in the history of the United States, standing out in the war against Iran. From this point on, the plot uses two narrative channels, one to tell the events of war and the other that shows the life of Chris Kyle with his family and the consequences of having been in a war. The first of these two narrative branches works flawlessly, with Eastwood even using western resources to recount the war. However, the other narrative path feels weaker in comparison. Probably because the topics displayed on screen do not have the necessary weight in the story or are treated in a slight way.
This film, like the latest by Clint Eastwood, aims to show the American hero in his purest state. He bets it all on leaving aside some themes that could have been better developed and that Eastwood himself has shown in other films of his filmography that he can do better.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

gripping portrayal of a legendary serviceman,"Intense biographical war drama based on the memoirs of Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper who became the deadliest marksmen in U.S. history while serving multiple tours of duty in the Iraq War. The film traces his early days in Texas as a hunter and failed rodeo cowboy, until the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings inspire him to enlist. A dedicated serviceman, his commitment to fulfill his duty drastically affects his psyche, making it that much more difficult to maintain a regular life with his wife and children. Like many films of this genre there's likely some artistic liberties that were taken, but the story is still compelling, more for the quiet, intimate scenes where the gung-ho Kyle wrestles with his demons, rather than the battle scenes which cover more familiar ground. Eastwood's transitions and passage of time aren't especially smooth, but they're compensated for by realistic, thoughtful depictions of post-war veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life, perfectly embodied by a transformative, tour de force performance from Bradley Cooper. ***",,Anonymous,Biography
Mixed bag but mostly a good movie by itself.,"Clint Eastwood's films are always stellar and made with a quality-driven eye. I think Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller were both great with their performances and the sequences with him in the war zone with other soldiers alongside him were noteworthy. At times it was a demonstration of conflicting emotions, complex ethics of combat, and exactly what it can do to a soldier who goes through that experience. Those were the good things.On the flip side, the U. S. should've never gone to Iraq and it was a bad war for the country, the troops, and the entire Middle East, and it was mostly the U. S. that was the aggressor since they attacked the wrong country in response to 9/11. The U. S. did a lot of atrocities over there aside from the insurgents and apparently Chris Kyle was the perpetrator of several of them, which the movie mostly leaves out and glorifies/tries to justify the U. S.'s presence there way too much. He was a much worse guy than the film portrayed him as being but it definitely showed in a few parts how narrow-minded he was. There were also apparently other parts of the plot/story that were fabricated and left out as well.Overall, well-crafted film for its production elements, but what's behind it all is pure ignorance and a one-sided view.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What this movie attempts to accomplish apparently is both an action movie and a biographical movie about Chris's wartime experiences and his transformation as a human being as a result on his relationships. While the movie does a decent job with both, it somehow misses the mark.Both Enemy At The Gates (2001) and Spy Game (2001) offer more richness and depth of the sniper experience. In Spy Game, Brad Pitt is trained in the nuances of espionage while in American Sniper, Bradley Cooper, is seen being trained in intense but more basic training. But one would expect to see more specialized training which of SEALs are well known and which supposedly is put into some use later in the movie. There are some questionable decisions or lack of both in strategy and on the ground on the part of the United States military that are explained or complained about in the movie. While there is some rationale for the one-sided portrayal of Americans as the good guys and Iraqi insurgents as the bad guys, Enemy At The Gates seemed more intimate because both Jude Law as a Russian sniper and Ed Harris as a German sniper are presented as human beings with a sort of dignity and code of ethics, who respected each other (of course, in reality it's likely impossible to know how Chris and his arch-enemy felt about each other). Nevertheless, Chris's brother's character seems underdeveloped and possibly of some important value to the story of Chris Kyle which was apparently not incorporated into the movie.As for the cinematography, there is something lacking in the crispness and intimacy of the photography that seems to distance the audience from the action. Such sharp resolution, especially with a biography, is made more potent in such movies as Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), Hurt Locker (2008), Jar Head (2005), We Were Soldiers (2002), and even Anglina Jolie's Unbroken (2014). Perhaps, an excellent portrayal of war might to found in the docudrama television mini-series about World War I, The Great War Diary (2014) As for character development, there seems to be something missing here too. Perhaps this is unavoidable, as a military man who experienced several tours of war and Chris's upbringing may have shut off his inner self from the rest of the world, but nevertheless, the intensity found in such characters as Angelina Jolie's performance in Changeling (2008) or Christian Slater's performance in He Was A Quiet Man (2007) is missing.It is understandable why this movie is being nominated for awards, especially due to its relevant subject matter, the impact of war time experience on soldiers, yet even at the end, there seems to be a lack of full awareness and understanding on the part of the audience as to Chris's experience towards life and death.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Powerful Moving Picture,"One of the most powerful, true to life productions ever to hit the screen. It is now often that a true American hero can be portrayed accurately and with this emotion. Bradley Cooper far surpassed any other roles he has performed. The interaction with his Navy Seal and Marine brothers was both moving and accurate. This movie was a masterpiece and proves that Clint Eastwood is a modern day genius of moving making!Siena Miller does an amazing job of portraying the effect on Chris Kyle's family and show the lengths a true hero will go to for his country. Cooper's portrayal of this hero, along with all the flaws and damage war does to his persona is amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Decent, I wish I could say more","Every year we get a new war movie around this time of the year, and all of them are decent but none stand out, last year we had Lone Survivor and now this. American Sniper continues this tradition faithfully, it is a decent movie which is passable has some good scenes, has some character development but excels in no department and has a bland protagonist. Chris Kyle the American sniper on whom this movie is based on was the most lethal sniper in American history, amassing a body count of more than 160 kills over his four tours in Iraq. In movie he is portrayed almost as Captain America honest soldier who cares about his country. While there is nothing wrong with this representation, real life Chris Kyle was pro war and had other controversial opinions which should have been included just to give more dimensions and angles to Bradley Cooper's representation of Chris Kyle, at least then the character would feel more complete instead he feels like a safe and non controversial all American hero. There are other familiar war tropes which appear in the film - making new army friends, losing army friends, PTSD, withdrawal from family, addiction to war and the rush of war all of which is decently done but again nothing stands out. Currently the film is enjoying a record breaking run at the box office and I am glad that audiences are enjoying quality films over the usual mindless action films. Clint Eastwood's direction is better than his previous effort - J. Edgar. Cooper is earnest and is freakin' physically HUGE in this movie I can already see Disney's Marvel and WB's DC pursuing Cooper for another boring superhero franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb Tale of the Horrors of War and One Man's Experience,"It is very rare for me to experience feelings of such emotion and thought over a film as I have over 2015's ""American Sniper"". You probably already know it's about the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. history. And you also probably know that the likes of Michael Moore and Seth Rogen have denounced the film as being propaganda and a pro-war piece. Well ladies and gentlemen, nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, it is true that the film takes place during the Iraq war, and it is also true that the late Chris Kyle believed very much that the Iraq war was justified. But folks, this is not a pro-war film; this is a film that makes a valid attempt to show the full realities of war while staying true to Chris Kyle as much as possible. Before I go on, let me just say that I was not a supporter of the Bush Administration's decision to invade the present day country of Iraq (and ancient land of Mesopotamia). It didn't make sense to me then and it especially doesn't make sense to me now with all the tragedy going on in Iraq at the time of this writing. Be that as it may, I still believe we should honor the sacrifices of all those who served in that war and ""American Sniper"" achieves this.The movie begins in the desert land of Iraq with Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper in a tour de force role) on a rooftop scouting for a column of Marines on patrol when he is forced to make a decision of whether to take out a young boy walking towards the column with a grenade or stand down? Then the film all of sudden gives us a peek into the Kyle's past, from his time as a boy to his experience at BUD/S to the meeting of his wife, Taya (the stunning Sienna Miller). From there the film provides as accurate as possible look at Kyle's four tours in Iraq and the subsequent affect they have on him and his family. Bradley Cooper, the lead man in the wolf-pack from the ""Hang Over"" films, gives what may be his best performance so far. With his Texas accent and swag, bulked up appearance, and dogged dedication to the role, he doesn't just play Chris Kyle; he BECOMES him. Indeed, when I first saw Bradley Cooper in the previews, I didn't even put two and two together that this was the same man who played the lead role in ""The Hang Over"". His performance is that good! The same can be said for Sienna Miller in her role as Chris' dedicated wife Taya. With her dark hair, Texas charm and looks, she looked every bit like the late Chris Kyle's real life wife.Directed by the great Clint Eastwood, the film doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the ugly realities of war. When Chris Kyle kills someone, the camera doesn't pull away. We see people die from his point of view, and believe me it's not pretty. Eastwood should be congratulated for having the guts to make the film in the first place and do so without trying to sugarcoat for the audience. As one can imagine, seeing this death on a daily basis begins having an effect on Kyle's mind and family life and after his last tour of duty, decides to take the step of getting help. He does so by finding solace in helping other veterans who've seen the horrors of war by taking them out to the gun range, a decision that helps many but would sadly cost the life of Mr. Kyle. In short ladies and gentleman, ""American Sniper"" is a film that anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, can appreciate if they go in with an objective mind, not one already made up. By showing Chris Kyle's experiences, the film shows the experiences of all men who go to war the subsequent challenges of reintegrating into society. A word of warning, though, the film leads up to an emotional ending in which it took every ounce of strength in me to hold back the tears. Whether you supported the war in Iraq or not, whether you are a pacifist or hawk, one thing is for sure: ""American Sniper"" is one of the most powerful films of this year and is a must see for everyone who appreciates our military and their sacrifices. God bless all those who have served and may Chris Kyle rest in peace.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
American Sniper is a Masterpiece,"Clint Eastwood is in my book 1 of the top five directories of all time. (The other 4 would be Billy Wilder, David Lean, William Wyler, and Joseph Mankiewicz).Clint Eastwood selected Bradley Cooper to portray Chris Kyle and the bit paid off brilliantly as Cooper gives a magnificent performance and should've won the Oscar.I am an army combat veteran and have deep emotional scars in this movie reflected the pain and suffering our soldiers endure protecting the United States and its allies.I cannot praise this movie in and I wept at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good war movie,"Pretty good to very good acting, nice unobtrusive direction, good photography of whatever Moroccan city doubled for Baghdad and Fallujah. The combat sequences are well-drafted and well-performed. Aside from the life of Chris Kyle, this is a pretty good, if not great war movie. Not being a super movie buff, I was unaware that this film was made by Clint Eastwood until the closing credits.Some interesting criticism here and elsewhere. Eastwood is known for making movies with a patriotic edge. But it seems that many folks feel that this beyond the pale. Why is it that no American filmmaker should EVER make a movie that is pro-America, or pro-American military? Can not a single movie ever depict white people acting heroically, and non-white people behaving basely? Do these leftists think that this reflects reality? And even if they do, is no one allowed to have a differing opinion? That is one of the problems with the American Left; their extreme intolerance toward diversity of opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Weak film, average at best!","I am really starting to believe that the Academy Awards are corrupt and they tend to nominate films and directors based on names and not based on the actual movie. still they do make some worthy nominations, but films like American Sniper being nominated really pisses me off!! OK, so i understand that its based on a real American hero, and that is nice, but telling the story was terrible here, the film fails as a motion picture to watch, yet it still gets the nomination for an Oscar for best picture. One thing i know for sure, it won't win!!the film is a series of clichés, one after the other, totally predictable from start to finish, and rips off many war films lacking in originality to the story. the whole film feels so familiar and you would seem to feel you have watched it before in countless movies and TV shows before, the whole American soldier struggling with emotions and effects of war, the PTSD, just lame and done soooo many times before, its old!I also understand that at times, you need to retell stories, and remake certain genres of movies and reintroduce them with a new twist or take, but here, the visions of Eastwood as director lacks big time and he does not add anything special or worthy to the film.Bradely Cooper does a good job, he is a good actor. but again, his role here was typical and the storyline did not help.some nice action sequences here and there, but nothing that tops a Call of duty game action scene.the whole film feels empty, it suffers from void. and despite the prolonged character development, you still don't get strongly attached to the characters, especially the wife who keeps complaining that Chris is always away, and when he is at home, he is not really there!! we really don't see her suffering, and so she ends up being a whining lame wife.A weak film, predictable, average at best.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Gung ho"" American propaganda? Uh, this movie was barely mobile actually. Try wiping the drool off your chin and breathing before you type.","This movie got an Oscar nomination but only because it was a movie about a supposed ""big"" or serious subject - America's wars - and because they increased the number of films which receive best picture nominations....It is by no means a ""pro-USA propaganda movie"" and it's quite disturbing to see the number of reviews which say that.Like with any movie titled ""American (something)"" I was skeptical that this could live up to the idea of being as grand and spectacular as America itself, or that it would give us some kind of ""insight"" into the American psyche, and what makes an American sniper so different from say, um, I dunno... a French one... yada yada... etc.And unfortunately I was right, ""American Sniper"" hugely fails most of all to give us a spectacular visual display of why he was such a brilliant marksman or soldier. We're largely supposed to just believe he was because of the way his buddies and fellow soldiers call him ""legend"". Only near the end of the film does it even attempt any visual effects (some simple slow-mo), when he's taking out his main enemy. It's not surprising that this movie was so poorly and half-heartedly made, the director Clint Eastwood was already in his early 80s by the time this came out.At the same time. his romance with his wife was not delivered really memorably in my opinion, so it failed to tug on the heart strings when she was talking to him on the phone from 1000s of miles away. None of the other soldiers make any impact as memorable characters, unlike in classic war movies such as Full Metal Jacket. Everything here is bland, mediocre and by the numbers.There is little-to-no memorable dialogue and at one time the movie just kinda forgets which decade it's supposed to be set in - the part where Kyle says something to his wife about ""people spending time on their phones"". People didn't complain about people ""spending so much time on their phones"" back in the 2000s when this guy was in Iraq. That's a 2010s complaint, which makes the movie one which seems to zone in and out consciousness much like you would if you were in the actual desert.This is a lazily scripted movie because the writers knows that you already know the story. We all know about PTSD (which was never actually covered), we've heard about it hundreds of times, and we all heard about the sniper being killed by his own crazy ""buddy"".But seriously - how could this film be ""US propaganda"" when the movie both opens AND ends, concentrating on the idea of Cooper's character pointing his rifle at children? The movie is clearly either conceding ground to the idea of, (or living in the world where) the US was a big nasty human-rights-hating bully which goes around the world killing innocent foreign kids just because eeevil Bush and Cheney felt like it.Despite being over five years old and the massive pandering that I pointed out above - lame, one-sentence reviews continue to pour in for this movie, from god knows what physical and mental locations, calling it ""FASCIST UMurriCunnn Porpppraguuurnduuuuuuuuuuurgh"" and the like, which is a lot more eye-opening than this weak movie was. Oh and Clint Eastwood continues to pump out yawnfests that take 100+ minutes to play out the opening paragraphs of famous/historical peoples' Wikipedia articles. That's probably one of the reasons why Hollywood now makes less money than the videogame industry, despite folks having to pay four or five times for a new game what they would have to pay for a movie ticket.",,Anonymous,Biography
disappointment film,It was a disappointment film to watch. Story of how a sharp shooter made it through the IRAQ war. I wondered who was right and who was at the wrong side of the fence. Are bigger manipulators playing both sides or was their fight justifiable? Validity of igniting the war in Iraq now we all know was triggered by confusing pictures that Bush and Blair drew for their own people. Those who were told Iraq had the Weapons of mass destruction. A Moslem nation somehow related to Osama Bin laden. On the other hand we had patriotic Iraqis ( some call them insurgents) who also felt the invasion of their homeland by foreign powers is worth fighting for. Two sharp shooters both protecting their own kind with so many similarities. Unfortunately apart from a few minutes of addressing the root of the problem the theme of the movie mostly was spinning around brotherhood and eye for an eye and loyalty of soldiers towards each other. In general I was expecting a better movie from Eastwood than this.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A View of American Middle-Eastern Military Intervention at the Ground Level,"Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper in an Academy-Award nominated performance) was a trained military sniper, maybe the best who ever pulled the trigger from among hidden locales, usually the rooftops of buildings. According to the film, during military tours in Iraq in the early 2000's, Kyle had 160 kills to his name, mostly males, but sometimes females and even children. Was Kyle engaging in right and moral behavior whose efforts should be applauded because he protected his fellow soldiers and helped wrest Iraq from Saddam Hussein? Or was he a brutal mass murderer, whose exploits should have brought him before an international tribunal for crimes against humanity? However, I think the point of this film is to answer neither of those questions. This is simply Kyle's story.The film focuses on Chris Kyle, an outstanding Navy Seal sniper who began as a would-be rodeo star who had experience hunting and shooting when he was young. In an interesting flashback scene, his dad claims there are three kinds of people in the world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. The sheepdogs are the ones who protect the sheep from the wolves. The idea becomes a metaphor for who Kyle becomes and the role he will play in the US military. After having failed at being a rodeo star, Kyle signs up for military service in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. To the surprise of his superiors during basic training, he shows exceptional ability in shooting targets at long distance. He's the kind of material who could be a sniper for the Navy Seals.The film chronicles four of Kyle's tours-of-duty in the Middle East. During each mission, his role as a sniper is primarily to assist his fellow ground soldiers, sometimes with them on the ground, while at other times in hidden places, usually atop small buildings. In one mission, they are assigned the impossible task of finding Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the primary heads of Al-Quaeda. In probably the most disturbing sequence, Kyle and his fellow soldiers sporting heavy-duty automatic firearms enter houses looking for Zarqawi. One older man with his family claims to have information, but for a price. Then a scene or two later, Al-Quaeda operatives, in particular one nicknamed ""the Butcher"", force the family to pay a deadly price for speaking with the enemy. Instead of receiving payment for their information, the family receives the ultimate punishment. And yet, the scenes play out such that they have no choice but to cooperate with the Americans and yet are pressuring Al-Quaeda to retaliate against them, at least from the terrorists' point of view.Another fascinating element of the film is Kyle's ""mirror"", an individual on the other side who has a similar position and/or ability to Kyle. Kyle realizes a sniper is taking out American soldiers and other combatants at nearly the same success rate as himself. Essentially, Kyle has found his middle-eastern counterpart, a sniper with the same abilities as his own, except he speaks Arabic. Kyle and the American soldiers then realize they are engaged in a violent chess match in which Kyle and his counterpart-enemy are the most deadly pieces on the board.One of the best and most poignant war films ever made, similar in style to ""The Hurt Locker"". The question which looms above the entire story is whether or not Kyle is doing the right thing. I think the film tries and succeeds to make the case that the issue is not whether Kyle was either moral or immoral. It's about the United States. Should the United States have engaged in an all-out assault on Iraq? In terms of military tactics, snipers are necessary to carry out missions. So the question is not whether or not Kyle should or should not have been sniping. The question is whether the ""powers-that-be"" in Washington D.C. should have deployed troops in the first place, which would necessitate the use of a cracker-jack sniper. It neither condemns nor applauds war. It simply shows what it's like from ground-zero.As a footnote, the film ends with real footage from Kyle's funeral procession in which people waved American flags as they passed. (Kyle was killed by a fellow soldier suffering from PTSD after her retired from military service.) Does this mean the filmmakers viewed Kyle as a hero? Not necessarily. It simply showed Americans viewed him as a hero and he received accolades for his efforts. At the same time, Kyle did the duty he was trained for. We in America must debate and elect leaders who will make the right decisions in terms of military deployment. We must take responsibility for the fact that we need snipers when we put our soldiers into harm's way.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An understandably engaging war drama,"When it comes to war in general, the concept has taken many forms for different films. Some glorify it to no end while others give their audiences an understanding of certain tragic events that occurred at specific times. Whatever the case, viewers should understand that war is an act that no right minded individual wants to pursue. However when it comes to protecting others, there are only select groups of people who know that joining the military, navy, police force, firefighters or what have you is the only way to do it. The people who join these groups are the ones who are humble enough to put their own lives at risk for the sake of others. It's these kinds of people that deserve the highest of respect because of their contributions to our safety. And for every war, there have always been decorated war heroes. Most recently the biggest name to be spoken of was Chris Kyle, a registered sniper with 150 plus kills during his time in the service. To most, that is an astounding and an unheard of record.Based on the autobiography of the same name, the movie follows the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) from buckaroo cowboy to an all out killing machine. Adapting the book was Jason Hall, the writer to Spread (2009) and Paranoia (2013). The intriguing part to this is that Hall really turned himself around as a writer. Both Spread (2009) and Paranoia (2013) were critically panned when they were released. This production on the other hand was the highest grossing film in January in many years. Perhaps it was in due part that Clint Eastwood served as the director to the movie. Either way the script has several areas to consider that prove to be why the film was so successful when it was released. What moved Kyle to joining the military was after seeing the 9/11 attacks and from there on he was determined to help protect his country and the people who shared his feelings. What's also important to note is that Hall's script includes Kyle's wife Taya (Sienna Miller). Together her subplot represented another critical issue - PTSD.For several combatants who enter the field, many do not come back the same way they entered. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is shown in this movie as a layered issue. That's an important point to make because it's not always one event that can cause it. Sometimes it's a culmination of things. This is especially compelling because of the realistic situations that are setup. Some scenes that are depicted in this movie are not what many films would dare to show nowadays. It's a very touchy topic but this is what elevates the tension. Finally after dealing with all these morbid situations, it's difficult to return home and feel the exact same way previously. This is shown properly through Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller's interactions with each other. As separate thespians, Bradley Cooper practically fully embodies Kyle and that means every aspect. Also not once does Cooper raise his voice, he's always very soft-spoken. Miller on the other hand shows how she gets concerned for Kyle even though she knows he's doing the right thing.Another interesting aspect about Kyle is the fact that he never asked for or reveled in his status as ""The Legend"" that everybody loved to call him. Cooper played Kyle as a guy just trying to do what was right. He didn't care about the awards or nicknames, he was there to protect others and that was it. There was one writing flub within the execution though. Chris Kyle's brother Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) changes motivational views on war; the character and topic is never addressed again. It seems that including Chris Kyle's brother was important enough to start out with but then as one brother develops the other fades away. If this was the plan, why even bother including Chris' brother? And this wasn't the plan, why was his character arc cut out of the final print? It doesn't make sense. As mentioned before the tension is pretty high due to the realistic imagery and violence. The kill shots are thankfully not as ridiculously outlandish as the action in other films like Sniper: Reloaded (2011). They do contain blood but it's mild and that's how it should be.Tom Stern was credited as the director of photography to this movie. Stern has also done camera-work for films like The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) and The Hunger Games (2012). For this feature, Stern has a number of wide scope panning shots that display the type of terrain and settings that veterans of the military had to withstand. Along side that are the confusing number of houses each team had to check and evacuate when it came to sectioned off areas. Stern was also able to show just how dangerous tasks like these are because of how easily hidden the enemy can be. Strangely enough one strategic element that was mainly absent through the running time was an appropriate musical score. For the 2 hour long movie there were a few synth bass and short piano cues but none of them stood out. Either the music was borrowed or composed by an uncredited composer. Either way the movie mostly works even without the score, but it perhaps could have been even more memorable if it had a recognizable theme to it. Oh well, their loss I guess.The script has one minor problem with a character and the music is surprisingly mute but in its entirety, the movie makes out fine. Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the legendary sniper is worthy of playing the veteran, the realistic war scenes are quite tense and the development of the lead is thought provoking.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Extremely moving war movie,"American Sniper tells the true story of SEAL Chris Kyle. Clint Eastwood really does a great job of truthfully telling and displaying the horrors of war and how it truly does affect the soldiers after they come back home from war. Bradley Cooper was amazing as the lead role, Chris Kyle. Sienna Miller was also very spot on with her performance as Chris's wife back home. The visuals and the war violence were very real, and really showed you how the were in Iraq really was for the soldiers, and how truly disturbing it was, not only for the soldiers, but also for their families. I was very entertained and satisfied with this film. It should've won Best Picture in my opinion, but maybe I should see Birdman before I say that. This film really left me speechless and I was truly moved and touched by not only the actors performances, but also how they portrayed the war in Iraq!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing performance by cooper.

Nerve-Wracking Portrait of Combat and Its Effects on Our Soldiers,"There has been controversy over this film. The problem with those against it is that they don't understand what this film is about. It's about following one soldier and his experience in combat and what happens to him. People are beside themselves over the ""politics"" of the film. Well, I don't see any politics. Maybe that's enraging to some just because the politics of The Iraq War are never discussed.I personally was against our going into Iraq. I remember watching ""We Were Soldiers"" with Mel Gibson just before the war started. This was another movie that was about the soldiers. The war in question there was The Vietnam War. Yet, that film didn't have any politics in it either. It was about the soldiers who fought. They signed up to serve their country. They didn't sign up for serving their country if they agreed with the war. They fought regardless. That is what soldiers do. If you have any questions about our nation deciding to wage a war, the only people you need to address is our elected representatives. They make the decision. Then, the soldiers fight. The soldiers have no say in the decision to fight that war. Once the soldiers are in the war, their lives are about doing what they've been ordered to do. And, it's about watching over each other. That's it, and that's the way it is.This movie is about Chris Kyle, and what happens to him and to those around him. That is the structure of the movie. So, if people have a problem with that, that is up to them. I don't. I understand what Clint Eastwood intended to do with this film, and I think he, his cast and crew did a tremendous job.The depiction of combat is nerve wracking. But, it is the effects on Kyle and his men that cut to the core. It should remind everyone what our men and women in the military do for their country.********* (9 Out of 10 Stars)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the better Iraq films,"I have always been a bit confused that this film was thought of mere jingoistic propaganda by a certain segment of the left. I understand how that impression could come about because of the ending/credits. The ending is the weakest aspect of the film and much more should have been made of how Kyle died and the credits are pretty overtly chest thumping. The final few minutes greatly simplified the overall film and the principle reason why I can't fully recommend this film. However, everything that occurred before that is pretty darn interesting in how Eastwood and his writer are trying to reconcile competing tensions.There is a troubling ambiguity at the heart of the film about what the film itself thinks of Kyle's military service. He is shown to be reactive and to be blunt not very self-reflective. He ends up joining the military in response to the embassy bombings in 1998. The decision comes across less because of a sense of patriotic duty than because of personal issues he was having on the very night the bombing occurred. In any case it is not a deeply felt ground project of Kyle's. Or how the film's central battle is ultimately ""won"" by Kyle only to have this Pyrrhic victory places his unit in greater danger. The film repeatedly shows the US's actions creating more insurgents. There's even a sarcastic invoking of Bush's ""mission accomplished"" in the film. The domestic scenes-especially in the car dealership-show a man deeply damaged by his experiences and he is largely unable to process it. The film is deeply paradoxical in the way it tries to square disapproval with the war in Iraq while sympathizes with a down to earth guy having the impulse to protect home and kin.I think viewing the film in the larger context of Eastwood's filmography is important. In particular, Unforgiven (in the that essentially peak American genre of Westerns) is a pretty stark condemnation of how violence begets violence. Furthermore, the Eastwood sympathies towards Kyle are pretty much the same sort of sympathy he has had for boots on the ground displayed in Flag of Our Fathers and *critically* Letters from Iwo Jima. The film is fascinating in how it tries to reconcile the various tensions embedded in its narrative.The film is technically stellar. (well fake baby aside) Eastwood continues to be one of the best restrained directors working today. There is a rawness to this film that sells the war scenes. Cooper really gives a fully engaging and heartbreaking performance. This is a film that may be too subtle for its own good.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Criticize the Iraq war if you must but judge the movie w/o the political commentary,"The movie is about the cumulative effects of combat in the Iraq war. The main character is based on the life of Navy SEAL and sniper Chris Kyle. The movie the pivotal times in his life, how the terrorist attacks on 9/11 influenced his decision to join the military, his relationship with his wife and family.What the movie captures is how he changed over the course of four 9-month tours to Iraq because of the effect war has on him.As someone who also deployed 3 times I can tell you that this was what I believe Eastwood was focusing on and not any political agenda or propaganda as some critics have suggested.I'll ask you this if you think otherwise. Was the 1978 film Deer Hunter about the Vietnam War's politics or the effect it had on it's main characters played by De Niro and Walken? In the 1953 movie From Here To Eternity was the fact that we dropped the A-Bomb a factor in judging that film? The thing that all those films, and most war movies include, are the effects of combat. They called it soldier's heart, shell shock, or PTSD. It's had over 80 names since the Civil War and it effects each soldier differently. It also effects Police, Firemen, survivors of trauma from accidents and disasters and terrorist attacks.If you didn't serve it may be difficult for you to truly appreciate the character of Chris Kyle but judge him and Eastwood's direction of the film separately from the politics of the Iraq War.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent production and acting.,"As an American, this move really evoked a lot of emotion. I walked away feeling like I sort of knew Chris Kyle. Bradley Cooper put in a convincing performance and deserved an Oscar for this one. The many one-star reviews are sadly misguided. They are nothing but political propaganda and whining by left-wing lunatics who think their soft, comfy beds and recliners don't come at a cost. Of course, a huge majority of them come from non-Americans who couldn't defend themselves if they were attacked by the Boy Scouts. Rather than reviewing the movie as a MOVIE, they based their reviews on their Sheep-like political views. I believe these types of people were mentioned in the movie.The cinematography was very good and quite realistic for the most part. The sound was excellent as well. It was the kind of film I didn't want to end. It's portrayal of war and the ugliness that takes place is quite sobering. Although Chris Kyle is an American hero and seemed to adapt to civilian life, I am sure he had many struggles in dealing with what he went through. Nobody can see what these guys had to see and not be affected by it. It's probably the best movie yet on the Iraq war.If you're the anti-American powder-puff type, then this movie isn't for you. But if you can appreciate an American hero with more courage and bravery than the entire EU, then you won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Gripping, gruelling and gritty.","After his film version of Jersey Boys failed to light the world on fire last year, Clint Eastwood has wasted very little time getting back on the horse. Based on the true story of Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. history, Eastwood's latest is flush with heart-stopping action, nail-biting tension and dread-building drama. Clint has always excelled in presenting the dark corners of humanity – see Unforgiven, Changeling or Mystic River for proof – but at 84 years of age, it's astounding how grittily authentic he can portray a modern war. His long- time director of photography, Tom Stern, must get a large portion of the praise; his atmospheric cinematography and bold camera movements are the driving force behind the unnerving suspense that underpins the entire movie. It's also cleverly edited, utilising jump cuts to take you from warzone to home front in a split second, emphasising the sharpness of Kyle's emotional frustration when not on the battlefield. Which leads to Kyle himself. An everyday Texan who enjoys rodeo, loves his country and happens to be a crack shot, Kyle is likable, grounded and just the right side of patriotic and macho, thanks to a mesmerising turn from Bradley Cooper. Deservingly amongst the awards chatter, Cooper demonstrates how wide-ranging his talent is by adding yet another stellar performance to his C.V, placing him in the very highest echelon of actors working today. A gruelling, raw and wholly compelling peek at a niche military job: American Sniper is this year's Hurt Locker.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The enemies are bad savages, the US guy is kind of an Übermensch - a modest hero who helps anyone he can, with the relationship to his wife being one pile of overemotional schmalz (grease), to use another word from my language.It's a parody of a war movie, and I can't understand how people can even seriously discuss it, let alone be moved by it.

Awesome Movie-Just Amazing,"Clint Eastwood has another GEM - he's just such an amazing director and the movie was superb!! My only gripe was that Bradley Cooper just isn't the actor I would've chosen for the lead role. I mean he's OK, and did well but their are so many other actors who could've done a better job. I'm sorry I feel this way about Cooper, he's just NOT my ""cup of tea"". Other than that the movie was fantastic and I would recommend it to EVERYONE. CLINT EASTWOOD ROCKS!!! I met him in person while he was filming ""Tightrope"" here in New Orleans, thanks to my a very good cop friend I was able to meet him in person and he was such a wonderful person and I just told him ""multiple"" times how much my dad was a HUGE fan of his (which my father is very much so). He was very nice to me and I will NEVER forget the night I met Clint Eastwood. His movies are amazing, as an actor, director, producer - well he is the BEST ALWAYS!

Full of so many lies.,"As Alan Turing points out people like violence because it makes them feel good. This movie did not make me feel good. It's full of many untruths and in fact Chris Kyle was taken to court over the lies and was found guilty of slander and a whole mess. Murder does not make a person a hero. People need to realize this movie is not true. Real heroes help the poor the people in the most need, not murder. It was full of a lot of action but that's just screenplay. The truth is far less entertaining. I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this. He should of became a politician would have been much better at the job. However, if you are looking for good show then this is OK. Just take it with a grain of salt. It's not based on facts, yet many list it as truth. I just can't understand how they can pass this off as being the truth when it is not. Emotional? Absolutely. But this man's family has made a fortune off of lies in the name of all American citizens.

American Sniper: not for those who can't join the dots....,"Very quick review: not that interested in seeing, but on long haul flight and had to fill up lots of hours....Actually much better than expected, a quiet thoughtful movie, telling the story of how Chris Kyle the sniper was made - his background, his life - in an understated but powerful manner. Turned to IMDb and was astonished to find the number or reviewers giving one star on the basis this was undiluted pro-American propaganda. As one example: a reviewer complained that Kyle killed women and children without comment.No, the movie did not tell you this was wrong. It showed you: though Kyle's hesitation, through his delay, his expression (great acting from Bradley Cooper); through his inability to adjust to normal life, through his desperately heartfelt relief when the child carrying the anti-tank missile dropped it and ran, through his post-traumatic stress disorder. What do such reviewers want, someone jumping on a soap box to make a speech telling the viewer war is wrong?Actually, American Sniper shows that even the simplest, most black-and-white patriot, convinced of his duty, can be torn apart by the horrors of what he had to do. And was far more powerful for that than any overt address for the simple-minded.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Madness of War,"Goodness must overrule absolute evil Though there's nothing worse than war.Sometimes we have no alternative option Except to kill or be killed as before.The best of plans can go amiss With uncertainties till the first shots are fired.As generals plot their path toward victory It's up to the wounded, the fallen and tired.It's not how strong or athletic you are That decides who is blessed to return.Those who survive are a product of luck And our prayers and support they've earned.War seems to peel the veneer off society Exposing our villain within.A crazy obsession to rule over others By death, destruction and sin.The mayhem of conflict is an ongoing scourge Robbing man from intended glory.The hinge of history swings in all directions As the madness of war tells its story.Tom's 800 Poems Are Free To Share!

Anti-War?,"American Sniper is,in my humble opinion,alongside with ""The Imitation Game"", the best biopic of the year. Clin Eastwood and Bradley Cooper team up and bring us a good film, well filmed, with good performances (Cooper is particularly excellent; Sienna Miller is also making a name for her,she is almost unrecognizable) and a strong and coese story based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle,the man who is named the most lethal sniper in the history of US. Although all its virtues, American Sniper is a linear forward driven film. It lacks some more deep exploration of the human relations. Don't get me wrong, Kyle's relationship with his spouse Taya is well explored but, some characters, namely his brother Jeff aren't too explored and there isn't too much depth in their relations with the main protagonist. In the beginning of pre-production, Steven Spielberg was attached to direct, but then Eastwood stepped in. Well,not depreciating Eastwood, I think that Spielberg would have given that depth and would have helped to make this film something bigger. In spite of all that, the film is worth watching and the Oscar Nominations talk for themselves. When I left the theater one question echoed in my mind : What is the movie message? Go to war? Is War a demonstration of power and strength? Of course it is. Do not go to war?War is the worst human creation. Well, I think that Eastwood didn't want this to be a Pro-War movie, he wanted to depict the horrors of the war seen by a Sniper perspective. However, in the end, the message was not that straight. It was standing on that thin line. This happened because of the portray of Kyle. In the end, he was a patriot fighting for his country. He wasn 't a neutral person. I really believe that the message wasn't a Pro-War one, but, shamefully, it wasn't a Anti-War one either. That's because Chris Kyle can be considered a war hero by some, and at the same time, a cold blooded murdered by others. He lived is life in the grey zone. Because life isn't just made of black and white.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Propaganda leaves a bad taste.,"This movie, while it may have been an excellent film if it were completely and utterly fictional. The fact that it is based on a true story and is suppose to be a biography of sorts makes it seem you will get a more real view of everything. Not be left with the feeling they are trying to make a war criminal look like a hero.There are good people out there in the army, in every army in fact. However, the particular man this was about was a liar and a monster. Let's look at his ""kill count"" to start. He has said that he killed people after Hurricane Katrina during looting from atop the super dome. The problem with that is the fact that no one was reported as shot by sniper rounds, a soldier or any good person would not kill anyone over looting and he would have been seen atop the dome by somebody. Self claimed unrealistic kills begin to paint the picture of a liar.He has also said that he'd have killed anyone with a Quran if he could. That is not something a hero would say. More like a terrorist.Mine and many who've seen this film all agree, our problem is not with the movie its self, it's a decent film. But it has been based off of a ""true story"" with a very skewed view in the form of propaganda. He was no hero and it should have not tried painting him as so. So because it is supposed to be a biography film of sorts that did nothing to tell the true story, it gets a very poor rating.(Note to anyone who would say this review is not helpful: Stop being a patriot for just a moment and realise that this film is nothing but propaganda and for the genre they made the movie, it falls short of the truth).",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great film, somewhat tainted by political and philosophical perspectives","I have to say, straight off the bat, I loved the acting in this movie. Bradley Cooper is excellent, completely different to any of his previous roles. There's a lot to be said for a film with the quality of acting on display, and I personally believe it deserves the awards it received.Storyline: Very well done, the style and back-and-forth portrayal is really appropriate, I ended up feeling like the story was well- nurtured and that I really got a chance to get to know Chris Kyle throughout the movie. I hope the portrayal is true to the man.Action: Excellent. Very well shot, fast-paced without being blurry or confusing, really crisp sniper shooting scenes, and tense moments, along with some big decisions that as a viewer I found myself ""along for the ride"" with.Cons: The on screen rapport between Cooper and Miller feels a little forced at times. It's not a deal breaker though, it just doesn't feel like they have a great connection.Overall feelings: Really enjoyed it. I'd definitely recommend the film to anyone who wants to see a good action film, with some strong human and moral elements. I sat entertained for the entirety of the movie, and I think Clint Eastwood has shown his ability to make a great movie yet again.On an aside, I think anyone viewing this from the perspective of political or philosophical terms is really running the movie into the ground. It's a humanistic story, about an interesting and significant person, who you get invited to know throughout its telling. He deals with human issues and it shows you that journey. This isn't a film that stands on a pedestal and seeks to preach to people as to the ethical implications of war. It isn't trying to make a political statement, it's just telling a soldier's tale accurately. I'm not American and I don't feel any allegiance to the country or its actions or political stances, but I did greatly enjoy this story and the portrayal of the main character in it. I wouldn't agree with everything that character stands for or the things he would say or believe in, but regardless of that, he's a very real character and I appreciate that aspect.I give the film 10/10 because its pacing was superb, it never drags, the action is great, and the acting is top-notch. A really great film that I'll definitely watch again in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good film about a soldier and the psychological effects of war.,"This biographical film describes the military trajectory of Chris Kyle, a member of the SEAL's, the US Navy special operations unit, who was considered the most lethal sniper in American history. Over several service commissions in Iraq, he killed about 160 people, always in situations where he protected his own life or that of other American military personnel.Personally, I really liked the film, I think it made a faithful account of the most important events in the life of the person portrayed and used the original material well, present in Kyle's autobiography. It was expertly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was perfectly capable of recreating the dangerous environment of the war, as well as the facts of Kyle's life. Being a film about a soldier more than about war, Eastwood focuses on his character, the portrait he wants to make of a man of integrity, brave, eager to help and make a difference. Eastwood gives us more than enough material to create a strong link between the audience and the main character, and that gives strength and sustains the film until the end. Another thing that the film shows are the psychological wounds that Kyle is having due to the war, to the point of emotionally distancing himself from his family. The film reasonably balances the portrait of a today's ""war hero"" with the intimate account of the secret inner pains and complexes of a man who feels that he has seen evil in its purest form.Bradley Cooper was competent in the task of bringing Chris Kyle to life. As far as I was able to understand in the readings and research I do when I want to see a film I don't know, Cooper got to know Kyle and respected him a lot. It was certainly a project that he did with special commitment and affection, and this was reflected in the quality of his work. Technically, the film is flawless. Good special and sound effects, excellent sets, costumes and touches of authenticity in everything we can see. In addition to this, an excellent soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Today in America many of us have become sheep, following whatever the","Today in America many of us have become sheep, following whatever the media tells us. Much like hippies in the days of the Vietnam war we criticize violence but do nothing to help anyone.Let me start by saying that it's sick to see how many people are insulting a man who not only put his life on the line for his country, but also died while trying to help people in pain. Chris Kyle never ""loved"" killing as people seem to think, or he would have been one of the soldiers we've heard about before convicted of war crimes and he would not have left the service. The fact of the matter is the people Kyle killed were confused individuals raised on violence who would have killed American soldiers at any cost which likely would've resulted in them killing themselves. It should be noted not all of the Iraqis were depicted as savage killers, for example the family in their home clearly suffered from the violence of those around them.People love to talk bad about the military but are never appreciative of the fact that without the people we have, who chose to serve in our military, we all would not have the freedoms we do today. This country was built by patriots not afraid to fight for what is right. Today we enjoy the comfort that our military gives us and constantly complain about the government. Of course the government isn't perfect but everyone just can't be jumping on the band wagon and disrespecting our soldiers. If someone doesn't agree with a war, that is perfectly fine. But don't disrespect people who would die to keep you alive because you won't do it yourself. Many countries force military service, but our military consists solely of those who genuinely want to serve.The word ""Murder"" needs to stop being used in this film because just because someone doesn't like something that happened in a war does not make it murder. When someone lets a bomb off to kill civilians or does what the Nazi's did that is murder. However when an armed soldier kills an armed opponent that is not murder. It is terrible that Kyle had to kill a child, and Kyle felt terrible about doing it. But if he had not done it others would have died. That child was raised on a skewed idea that all westerners are bad and should die, and this thinking is not just about soldiers they want death for all of us. That child's death is on his parents hands. It would be different if our military was sent there to kill everyone like for example what occurred in Bosnia with ethnic cleansing. Then people would have reason to kill military occupying their country. But there was never any direct threat to civilians so they have no right to attack soldiers.In regards to the film as a movie Clint Eastwood gave us a masterpiece as usual. And Bradley Cooper may have given his best performance yet. Not to much violence where it was just an action movie, and a good depiction of human emotion. It should be noted families with someone in the service have always faced difficulties, and this film does a good job of depicting that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good Book,"Chris Kyle was born on April 8, 1974. He was raised up in a ""Country"" family. Later on his parents had another child. Chris became an older brother and looked after him. He got his first gun when he was nine. He loved to guns, horses, and really anything Cowboy-ish. As he grew older his passion for horses and cattle grew. He got so good with riding horses that he tried out for some local rodeo tournaments. He had thought of the going into the military when he had finished high school, but ended up going to college. While going to college he worked on a ranch, a big one. Riding horses, feeding cattle, and doing anything his employer wanted really. After awhile he had thought of the service. He went down to the recruiters office and him and all the recruiters talked. He liked the Navy the best. He went in to sign up, got everything checked out, before he could get really into the navy they found out that he had a bad accident when he was younger. When he was younger he rode horses, the horse tripped and fell on top of Chris. Cracking his ribs, completely obliterating his wrist, and some other minor injuries, are what occurred. Since his wrist were almost obliterated he had to get steel rods put in them, and since he has steel rods in his wrist, the Navy wouldn't allow him. Chris finding out this, went back to work at the ranch again. Not long after the Navy recruiter call him up and told him he could join. Chris went through all the trainings and test, passed them and started to take on more stealthy trainings. He was deployed many times during his first 4 years of the Navy.I think the main strengths are in the emotions mixed in with all the war Chris has been going through. Chris brings you through his journey and what he experienced. Yet, he spills his emotions out. Generally people think "" Oh, you're in the navy. You don't really have feelings."", But in this case it's the exact opposite. Chris opens up and shares his feelings, emotions, and thoughts.I think the author's message is mainly about war. He wants to bring notice to how war really is. This is a valuable book, if not the most valuable. It teaches lessons that everyone should learn. One incident that I thought was important was where Chris and Taya had their second child and Chris still went back to defend his country. That scene was really emotional.I would recommend it for high schoolers, it;s best for males and females. I would recommend i for people looking to join any branch of the service. Someone who is afraid of war or doesn't like war shouldn't really read this, after all this is based on war. It is generally a book for all.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bradley Coopers depiction of Chris Kyle is accurate and he steals every scene he's in from Kyle's thick Texan accent to Kyle's view on war. The Battle scenes are raw and very authentic and to a certain point very realistic.

"American Sniper maybe a distortion of reality, but it will have you on the edge of your seat.","DISCLAIMER No matter what anybody says, American Sniper is still propaganda at its core really well-made propaganda. It is my personal belief that no one movie (or anything for that matter) should ever have a significant impact on your beliefs or values. For example, anyone who claims to be knowledgeable about JFK's assassination because they saw Oliver Stone's JFK should probably be ignored. Be smart and do your own research.I'm going to review American Sniper solely based on its merits as a film, and nothing more.SHORT REVIEW:Clint Eastwood's direction is great as always (the film is incredibly realistic). Jason Hall's script suffers from a lot of pacing issues and weak character development. You'll really believe you're in the middle of battles as the editing and sound design are top-notch. Bradley Cooper is fine early on in the movie, but his performance gets better as his character's PTSD worsens.VERDICT: See it in theatres if you can look pass the propaganda and blatant lies.LONG REVIEW:American Sniper will probably stand as one of the more memorable war films of this decade for years to come. Although this film is nowhere near the complexity and quality attributed to Letters from Iwo Jima (another Eastwood film), Eastwood still puts his best foot forward in recreating the streets of Iraq with as much intensity and realism as he did with the battlegrounds of Iwo Jima. Unfortunately, Hall's script prevents this film from reaching its prime as it suffers from severe pacing issues and weak character development for the supporting cast (even Sienna Miller's character seemed one dimensional). I also didn't like the fact that Hall played the 'child' card whenever he needed to raise the dramatic tension (although all these situations could have very well happened in real life) – it was just overdone and felt like a cheap trick after a while.Despite this, I believe very few people will have any problems keeping track of the story's plot-points and who the central characters are. If there is one thing that Jason Hall can be applauded for, it would be the penultimate scene of this film.Eastwood's regular team of collaborators (cinematographer Tom Stern, editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach, etc.) shows no shortage of effort in bringing their A-game to this film. As well, the sound department did an exceptional job in making me believe that the crew somehow managed to find a way to turn back time and shot the film as the Iraq War happening.Bradley Cooper's performance as a young Chris Kyle eager to join the Iraq War is fine, but it gets progressively better as his character makes the rounds with each passing year. By the end, you no longer see an actor in combat gear – but instead, a father, husband, and soldier who has truly suffered the consequences of having participated in such a war. Although it would have been interesting to see another actor take on the role (Cooper wanted Chris Pratt), Cooper made a valiant effort in portraying Chris Kyle as a conflicted and sympathetic figure.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful film!,"I just saw American Sniper last night with a close friend of mine. At first I wanted to see it when it comes out in DVD but then my thoughts changed and decided to see it in theaters. OK let's talk about the film. I know it got some controversial reviews from left and right, but that's because it's treated more like a political thing than just a biography that our hero wanted us to know about. Chris Kyle was a legendary sniper who killed more terrorists than any sniper in the 21st century. A respected man by the military and a feared warrior that earned him the name Devil of Ramadi by the Islamic terrorists. The movie does not only portray him and his career, it also portrayed him as a loving husband and father. His struggle with PTSD gave him a new mission: to help other vets who also struggle with PTSD. Bradley Cooper did a fabulous job at portraying our American warrior along with Sienna Miller who plays the beautiful Taya Kyle.

He is brainwashed by the idea that he is protecting the greatest country in the world and he has to do some killing on the other side of the world to accomplish that.Then they try to make us sympathize with him by showing us how he save some soldiers and how the war is leaving scars on his mind and behaviors. He tries to kill his own dog in front of kids and other people but he is fine and he doesn't needs treatment, he just have to go to the war and do some killing again and he will be just fine.To me is a no go.

Bradley Cooper is almost unrecognizable, having completed a morph into muscle as a true military representative. I have seen most of Clint Eastwoods films and it is clear with this feature that he has developed into one of Hollywoods greatest directors.. Much to the chagrin of many of the Hollywood elite.

There's always those people...,What a fantastic movie. Went to see it in the theater when it came out and it's the only movie I've ever been to where people stood up and clapped at the end. It's a gripping TRUE story of a Navy Seal who saved many lives of his fellow soldiers during his time in the military. All the haters cannot begin to believe what he's done and sacrificed for this country. You people that left 1 star have no clue what you're talking about.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant direction and Cool shots!,"Pardon my knowledge on real life Chris Kyle but in terms of movie, this is awesome. I'm not from america and don't know more about the ""man"" Bradley portrayed. Bradley did and amazing job as well others. Sniper shots are directed brilliantly.If you're not around from america and don't consider yourself letting in politics, chances are high that you will enjoy this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

There shouldn't be this much hate. Its astounding,"This is the greatest war movie of all time. Clint Eastwood does it again with American Sniper. This movie has all of the heart-racing action that makes a good war movie, and suspense. Its the movie for all movie lovers it has action and romance and it shows the amazing life of Chris kyle, the most lethal sniper in US history and it shows his life from when he was a kid to when he was deployed. This is a movie all Americans need to see to remember an amazing soldier. Bradley cooper has the best performance in his career in this movie and is obviously actor of the year. no, actor of the decade. no wait make that actor of the century. This is a must see for all Americans and don't listen to those who say otherwise, this is the greatest war movie of all time!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not for entertainment! Participate if you like Propaganda!,"Hell ya! Invade a poor country just because they don't like you! Kill them like savages and make movies to glorify your crimes. Prove that everyone in your enemy country is a daemon including kids and woman, kill them before they even try to protect themselves and Listen! Our highly trained ASSASSINS (although they are equipped with lethal modern gadgetry) are the real victim, after killing hundreds of (innocent) Kids and women now their blood pressure level is high. Movie also tries to connect 9/11 incident with Iraq war, like we don't know history! This shows how this country is killing people since ages be it Red Indians, Germans, Russians, Vietnamese or now Arabs. Their quest to retain world power will never stop, they justify their war crimes with movies like this but please don't raise your voice else they question your Patriotism, Word ""Patriotism"" is the most misused term in current time. I am Completely disgusted after watching this movie and feeling sad for all innocent souls.Please God (if you are really there) save the humanity!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
an interesting look at PTSD post combat,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you the reality and doesn't sugar coat the fact that soldiers develop PTSD from things they see or have to do in order to survive war. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are both incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic movie about soldiers who give their life for their country,"One of the best movies i've watched! Based on true story by Chris Kyle.""Great way to fight a war - be prepared to defend yourself for winning.""""There's no reason someone who has fought for their country should be homeless of jobless.""""I'm proud of my service, but I sure as hell didn't do it for any medal. They don't make me any better or less than any other guy who served. Medals never tell the whole story.""""We went back for a few days to work with the Marines when they took down a hospital north of the city on the river. The insurgents were using the hospital as a gathering point. As the Marines came in, a teenager, I'd guess about fifteen, sixteen, appeared on the street and squared up with an AK-47 to fire at them. I dropped him. A minute or two later, an Iraqi woman came running up, saw him on the ground, and tore off her clothes. She was obviously his mother. I'd see the families of the insurgents display their grief, tear off clothes, even rub the blood on themselves. If you loved them, I thought, you should have kept them away from the war. You should have kept them from joining the insurgency. You let them try and kill us—what did you think would happen to them?""Quotes by - Chris Kyle",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good movie that is worth the accolades it received. I did think Enemy at the Gates was a better sniper movie though.,"""You can only circle the flames so long."" Chris Kyle (Cooper) is an elite sniper. The deadliest sniper in American history. His feats have made him a legend. When he returns home from battle it is harder to adjust than he expected. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof. Millions have seen it, everyone else has heard about it. I was late in seeing this so I had all the hype behind it in my mind before I even started this. I will start by saying I am not a huge Bradly Cooper fan, but this is by far his best role. This is the first movie I have seen him in where I thought he was a very good actor. The one downside of this movie is that I wish there was more sniping scenes. There is a lot of war scenes but the actual sniping isn't really a focus. All that said this is a very good movie that I enjoyed, even with all the hype behind it. I didn't think it was as good as I have heard, but my son also said this is the best movie ever...that may have had something to do with it. I do recommend this though. Overall, a very good movie that is worth the accolades it received. I did think Enemy at the Gates was a better sniper movie though. I give this an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stop with the inglorious basterds references please,Actor Seth rogan made that comment after this film first came out and he apologized for it . Figures that trolls would take it and run with it . This film is in no way shape or form similar and it is completely bizarre for someone else to say it . Bradley Cooper did a fine job playing this role . Chris Kyle was a hero and it's a disgrace to even compare this picture to a fictional movie about killing nazis and a sniper who is also fictional by the way and is portrayed as Fredrick zoller and in basterds it doesn't even show him sniping except in the movie within the movie . Some people need to get their facts straight . Clint Eastwood did a fine job of directing this . This is a great film and I saw it when it first came out . I just recently watched it again. It's a tough film to watch but very necessary. The part when he works with the amputees is very touching. To my knowledge he did this in real life . It sucks the tragedy that some evil would shoot his own fellow military men. The guy who did it should get the death penalty. Plus he shot Chris and his friend in the back like a coward and this dude Ex marine. My grandpa and father both served in the military in the army and the navy . People need to understand that the politics side isn't because of the soilders people need to blame the politicians . My point is I support war veterans adaptation into civilian life . I don't judge them they are just men and women doing what needs to be done .,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent film that reveals a Warrior's commitment to his Brothers in arms,"I usually don't write reviews about films but was moved to in this case after reading some of the negative reviews posted by those who have obviously never been in combat and so have no idea what being a Warrior is. The action scenes were very realistic and the way that the director portrayed Chris Kyle's selfless commitment to his Warrior Brothers was moving. If you are a Military man you will love this movie and will be reminded of those relationships that you shared with your battle buddies in a most profound way. I also found the coming home scenes to be very accurate as often readjustment to life in the materialistic culture of the western world is hard to do after what combat operations put you through. This is a movie for those happy few, that Band of Brothers, enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
