The best rom zom com ever! A loving satire with lots of British humour.,"Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this quintessentially British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) to realise anything's wrong is priceless. Director Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the film with Pegg, also demonstrates that there's little difference between glassy eyed commuters and their undead brethren.The plot rips along beautifully and parodies both the romantic comedy and zombie genres, while at the same time remaining true to them. Hopefully a new genre, the romzom com, has been born  incidentally, that's where you can go to find out more about the movie  romzom.com. The fabulous supporting cast includes Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as Shaun's supercilious stepfather, Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls) as Shaun's absent-minded mum, Dylan Moran (Black Books) as Liz's snooty housemate David and Lucy Davis (The Office) as wannabe actress Diane.Shaun of the Dead was partially inspired by the classic zombie flick, Dawn of the Dead. Its creator George Romero was reportedly so impressed with Shaun of the Dead that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are taking on cameo roles in Romero's latest instalment, Land of the Dead.Shaun of the Dead is one of the best comedy of 2004 and a must-see for all rom zom com (romantic comedy with zombies) afficionados. ****½/***** stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Fried Gold!,"Some 5 years before the making of this film the same team behind it wrote and directed series (season) 1 and 2 of an offbeat UK sitcom named ""Spaced"". Massively overlooked at the time of broadcast yet with a hardcore fan base of loyal devotees a third series was long overdue but never did materialise.Shaun of the Dead is the continuation of what went before; of a similar format yet in a completely new setting, with new characters, plus new cast members and for the first time a feature-length run time for the big screen. So how does it play out? Even with such a departure from the original setting, the history of TV to cinema adaptations is a dodgy one to say the least. Fortunately for those of us who already fans or (more likely) if you've never seen the series before prepare to be impressed.The style is all it's own. With inventive direction and editing making the visual impact which fans will instantly recognise, to the writing which importantly is firstly genuinely funny, interspersed with references to popular culture of the past two decades, always with a self-knowing grin, a wink to the viewer rather than a pretentious nod. And of course several self-references and in-jokes of the TV series all fill in the gaps between the tastefully presented killings. There is blood, after all this is a ""rom-zom-com"" or ""romantic zombie comedy"" - a self-proclaimed new genre and rightly so. This is as about as original as it gets. They actually manage to pull off humour, violence, decapitations, action, romance, suspense, sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutes!This is the best film I've seen in ages, and a real credit to British film, we already knew about ""Fried Gold"", now the rest of the World can see it too.

A Killer Comedy-Horror Mashup that Will Leave You Dying of Laughter and Terror,"Shaun of the Dead is an incredibly entertaining and cleverly crafted film that seamlessly blends horror and comedy genres. The film follows Shaun, a dead-end retail worker who finds himself battling an undead horde in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. The humor in the film is top-notch, with hilarious one-liners and perfectly timed jokes that keep the audience laughing throughout.What makes ""Shaun of the Dead"" so unique is its ability to balance the humor with genuine moments of heart and emotion. The film is a perfect blend of witty banter and heartfelt character development, making the audience genuinely care about the characters and their journey.Director Edgar Wright's sharp direction and clever editing style make for a visually stunning film that is as entertaining as it is visually impressive. The performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are also worth noting, as they bring a level of chemistry and humor to the screen that is unmatched.Overall, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a must-watch film for anyone who loves horror, comedy, or just great filmmaking in general. With its perfect balance of humor and heart, it's no wonder that this film has become a cult classic and remains one of the most beloved comedies of all time. It deserves a solid 8/10 rating for its ability to make audiences laugh, care, and come back for more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The original zom rom com.,"The first of the Cornetto trilogy, sees Shaun, his mum and a small bunch of friends battling a hoard of flesh eating zombies.I'm staggered to see an IMDb rating of 7.9, what on Earth have some people seen, that I haven't, it's an out and out classic. Shaun of The Dead is an absolute riot, a mix of horror and comedy, with a very British flavour.It's one of those films that simply doesn't get tired, it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, it is just so appealing.Can't decide what the best bit is, there are so many contenders, but final encounter in the pub, and zombie girl in the garden, there are a hoard of moments that can be chosen.Zombie comedies had been tried before, and have been tried since, but none even come close to this, Pegg and Frost nailed it.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Instant cult status.,"Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.Simon Pegg, both the joint writer and the main star of the film, has been a comedic force for some time, most notably in the fantastic BBC2 series 'Hippies' (which inexplicably bombed in the ratings) and the cult Channel 4 series 'Spaced'.  Both programs hinted at Pegg's saliently dead pan comedic manner (and writing skills) which comes to full fruition in 'Shaun of the Dead'.In a nut shell, this film is a romantic comedy with zombies (or zom-rom-com) who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered).  The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant.Pegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film.  And not in the 'American' form of: 'I am a loser but I work in TV and have Jennifer Aniston as my wife'  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as 'Bruce Almighty' or dozens of other US 'loser' films.  Pegg's Shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too, he's an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing - and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film.  There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop.  The first time Shaun plods semi-comatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser.  However, by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on!  The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! Not that this film is subtle however, there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles `28 days later' - see if you can spot it!The only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film.  All I can say is that I cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laugh-out-loud moments. It was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that I can never watch this film for the first time ever again - every viewing will forever be a repeat viewing.Shaun of the Dead is not very everyone though - the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film (in the UK). This film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films. It will also be enjoyed by teenagers (who filled the cinema when I viewed this film which was terrific, as they laughed loudest).  Finally, I do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie.  Black Book's (channel four) star Dylan Moran seemed a bit wasted and so was Martin Freeman (from BBC2's The Office) - who would have made a terrific zombie!  Also, did I spot Matt Lucas (from BBC3's 'Little Britain') in this film? I am not sure as I was laughing too hard maybe!These problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven.  My suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give Simon Pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the UK papers have suggested as his next project - `From Dusk 'Till Shaun'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"When there is no more room in hell, Shaun will walk the earth and...","...He'll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""Armed with a cricket bat, razor-sharp wit, and an attitude, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is perhaps the last guy that you'd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated, as this is a running gag here, that we're all dying slow deaths, so it's no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living, Shaun couldn't be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.You may remember the character of ""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.It's pretty obvious that ""SOTD"" was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action-mayhem ""Dawn of the Dead"") and 2002's ""28 Days Later"" (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.Granted ""Shaun of the Dead"" is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy, but it's also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you'll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"First half great, second half meh","The first half of the movie was great and very enjoyable. There were many laughs and you really think you are in for a great comedy film due to its unique style of comedy, however the second half of the movie was no where near the same standard as the first half. The jokes and the comedy really fell off. There jokes were no longer funny and the film got fairly boring and a shadow of the first half of the film. The first half of the film was an 8/10 but the second half at best a 5/10. Overall I would give it a 6 out of 10 and I would honestly say it is a fairly overrated film. If the standard of the first half continued, it would be an 8/10!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The best comedy of the year!,"Here in the States they don't show too many foreign movies, even if they are from the countries like UK. When they show them, however, they tend to outdo some of the American movies in the box office. Although the British movies are rarely shown here, they're a guaranteed success - do you recall the popularity of the last year's ""28 Days Later""? Well, this movie is even better - it's a hilarious combination of comedy, social parody, tragedy and drama, spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. Some references are pretty slim, though - for example ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" is a reference to ""The Night of the Living Dead"" - a reference that many people (including George Romero!) didn't get. Most of the actors are unknown to an average American, yet they played great! I hope that movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" will make big wigs in Hollywood realize that there are many great foreign movies, and that integrity is always better than crude remakes which the States are so notorious for... I encourage everybody to come and see SOTD - the best comedy of 2004.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Shuffling into theaters September 24th. A romantic comedy. With zombies. Ever felt like you were surrounded by zombies?. In a time of crisis a hero must rise...from his sofa. Bought coffee. Called Mom. Dodged zombies. This September, aim for the head.An amusing and funny film about a Zombie invasion including thrills , chills , violent events, lots of humor with tongue-in-cheek, guts and blood. This English film of Terror Zombie is a parody with some romanticism and large doses of black humor well directed by Edgar Wright who comes from the world of television and who wrote the script together with his friend, collaborator and protagonist of the film, Simon Pegg, with the one who would join forces in subsequent films.Packed with film references , the picture mines most of its laughs from the collision of the naughty bunch of friends and the village inhabitants ways , a backwater of English naffness that suddenly experiencing in crescendo of Zombie attacks, disarmingly incredible chase secenes and violent fights . Forming a trilogy: ¨Shaun of the dead¨,¨Hot Fuzz¨, ¨The World's End , director Edgar Wright and actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost teamed up to parody classic film genres . If the first combined romantic comedy with terror and the second was a parody of police genre , this last of the stupendous trilogy is an acid apocalyptic comedy . With a script like the two previous ones by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg , the film is magnificently performed by an ensemble cast in which the actors who give life to the unfortunate roles stand out. Simon Pegg's straight-faced acting -amid high-calibre cast comedy stalwarts and legit luminaries- holds the plot together while reflecting the movie's essentially respectful attitude towards the action movie . Joining them are great actors , such as: Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Penelope Wilton, Bill Nighy, Matt Lucas, Rafe Spall and brief appearance by Martin FreemanThe editing is sincerely frenetic and the violence , though sometimes ridiculous , strong and bloody . Evocative ambiance and appropriate settings , excellent special effects , enhanced by the brilliant and colorful photography carried out by a good cameraman: David Dunlap. Being shot in The Gardener's Arms Public House, Letchworth , The Cork Public House, Welwyn Garden City, The Peartree Public House, and Parkway Bar, Welwyn . As well as exciting and nail-biting musical score from Dan Mudford and Pete Woodhead . This is an acclaimed and notorious film from director Edgar Wright who delivers the goods with skillness and aplomb enough . Edgar is an English filmmaker , screenwriter, producer, and actor . He is best known for his comedic Three Flavours Cornetto film trilogy consisting of Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013), made with recurrent collaborators Simon Pegg, Nira Park and Nick Frost.

May be the best comedy-horror mix of recent years,"Shaun (Simon Pegg) is in the midst of a lousy patch--he hates and is embarrassed about his job, he gets no respect from other employees, one of his roommates is on his case about the other roommate--a slacker friend of Shaun's, his girlfriend is on his case about the fact that all the ever do is hang out at a pub, and he hates his stepfather, who is also on his case about doing something nice for his mum. As if that's not bad enough, suddenly, everyone is turning into a zombie. Shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same time.Shaun of the Dead is a superb blending of horror and comedy ala An American Werewolf in London (1981), Idle Hands (1999), Frankenhooker (1990), or the Evil Dead films (beginning with the 1981 original, although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series). It manages to successfully both pay homage to and spoof a number of classic zombie films and horror film zombie mythology in general.The film begins firmly in very British comedy/drama territory, with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996). The horror material enters gradually, beginning with a couple background gags, then entering Desolation Boulevard territory via another Boyle reference, this time to 28 Days Later (2002) (although that itself was basically a version of The Last Man on Earth (aka L'Ultimo uomo della Terra)(1964), based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend). This arrives in the guise of Shaun crossing over to the corner store to buy his morning soda. He doesn't notice the deserted streets or store because he's so hung over from the night before.Before long, our ragtag bunch of heroes is in the midst of a full-fledged zombie apocalypse--of the traditional, slow-moving zombie type. Acknowledging the cultural differences that strict gun laws bring about, they have to use their wits to commit the requisite head busting, enlisting unwanted LPs (after some debate over the merits of each), cricket bats, shovels and other items for the job. Of course it would be easier if any of our heroes were the slightest bit athletic and had any aim, but they get the job done. More or less.Furthering genre-fan fun, director/writer Edgar Wright and co-writer Pegg insert a lot of references to other zombie films--especially when it comes to explaining the source of the ""epidemic"". The ""scientific"" explanations given in Resident Evil (2002), 28 Days Later, all of Romero's Dead films--beginning with Night of the Living Dead (1968)--and possibly even Romero's The Crazies (1973) and then some are all mentioned in the background, but resolutely cut off before they're finished. Part of the reason might be that usually, the explanations were pretty ridiculous, and we didn't really care--we just wanted to get to the cool zombie stuff, such as limbs being torn off, guts being eaten, and brains being blown or smashed out of skulls.Wright and Pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films. Shaun looks and walks like a zombie when he's waking up. We see zombie like office workers, retail workers, and so on. There's also an amusing nod to filmic attempts to study and tame zombies, as well as organized militaristic defenses (both very prominent in 28 Days Later, but present in other films as well). There are interesting, more subtle and original zombie subtexts in Shaun of the Dead, also, such as the ""mirrored"" scene where Shaun and his crew meet up with Yvonne and her crew.As long as you like outrageous comedy, somewhat gory horror, and you don't mind mixing the two, Shaun of the Dead should provide an enjoyable ride. Although it is the most fun when you're very familiar with the source material it is spoofing and referencing, it is still a great comedy-horror film if viewed with fresher eyes, and not so much as a spoof.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

The power of the movie is in its professionalism.,"This is the best mix of beer and blood I have ever tasted. ""Shaun of the Dead"" has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.Visually the movie is really good looking. Its not like many other British movies and has a good looking use of cinematography and lighting. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks.You might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) but its really more than that. The movie is good and creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof. All of the characters are well written and are funny in their own way.The acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.Basically this is a very good looking and professionally made movie that also is funny and hilarious at moments.

Flesh-eating fun for all the family,"The great British sit-com has undergone something of a revival in recent years. Galvanised by the new wave of smart, sassy imports from the US, the Brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland, identikit dross of the late eighties and early nineties.One such series is Spaced, a wholly original and delightfully quirky comic bagatelle which has built up a small but dedicated following in the UK. Now writer/actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright have teamed up once again to give us Shaun of the Dead which is, in a nutshell, a feature-length episode of Spaced (with added zombies). Happily timed to coincide with the Hollywood remake of the 1978 classic shocker Dawn of the Dead, Shaun is the perfect antidote: Irreverent, warm and very funny.Shaun (Pegg) is your stereotypical sit-com loser: An ineffectual slob in a dead-end job, he is terminally afraid of commitment and spends all his time with his flat-mate Ed (Nick Frost, also from Spaced) who is an even bigger loser. After his girlfriend dumps him, Shaun and Ed seek solace in their local pub the Winchester - a good old-fashioned English hostelry with warm beer and pork scratchings which is infamous for its lock-ins. They stagger home in a state of advanced refreshment, unaware that the dead are now walking the earth. Indeed, it takes Shaun a little while to work it out the following morning despite interacting with a few of them (one of the recurring themes is that most of us go through the drudgery of our daily routines in a trance close to inertia).When the penny drops, Shaun resolves to rescue his mother and his (ex) girlfriend and generally stand up for himself for the first time in his life. There is not much more of a plot than that. The film, like Spaced relies on a flawless script, observational humour and the theatre of the absurd. Pegg has perfected this in his writing but he is also a surprisingly good actor. It helps that he has surrounded himself with the pick of the British comedy fraternity who seem to have been lining up (literally in one scene) for a cameo. The stars of similarly acclaimed series' such as Black Books, The Office and Little Britain are all on show here as well as Jessica Stevenson, Pegg's Spaced co-writer, who plays a jolly-hockey-sticks human vigilante with a stiff-upper lip and can-do attitude ready to give those nasty zombie's what-for.Veteran support comes from Penelope Wilton (a sit-com stalwart from a bygone age) as Shaun's curtain-twitching mother and Bill Nighy as her fearsome second husband who performs one of the most dignified and poignant descents into zombieness ever caught on camera.Despite all the high praise, it must be acknowledged that Shaun of the Dead is still a spoof - a comic tool that you could argue is as low a form of wit as sarcasm. But where it scores highly is in its respect for the original material. Most spoofs (the Scary Movie franchise, for example) are vicious lampoons that unmercifully mock the films they are taking off. Shaun of the Dead gently pokes fun but doesn't lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying, it must have some merit. Pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own - there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the light-heartedness, there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gore.What is most encouraging is that us Brits have started playing to our strengths. It took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an English version of Friends is doomed to failure (in the same way that The Office will not work with an American make-over). We should celebrate the Britishness of this film, laugh knowingly at the in gags, and be proud that it doesn't take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema.8/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Like Spaced...with zombies,"In a London suburbia, Shawn is almost 30 and hasn't really achieved much in his life. He comes home from his mundane job each day, and goes to the same pub (The Winchester) that he always has gone to. He shares his flat with an ex-student friend, and his lifelong slob of a friend. On top of that, his girlfriend has had enough of him. Oh.and the dead have started walking the earth!Hot on the heels of recent remake Dawn of the Dead comes Simon 'Spaced' Pegg's black comedy zombie spoof, in which Shawn must save his friends, mum, and ex-girlfriend from the masses of lumbering dead by, erm, going to the Winchester! Unlike recent zombie-fests, these dead-ites are pretty lame, lumbering monstrosities, much like the ones from the older zombie films. This is used to simple comic effect throughout as the 'heroes' seem to have plenty of time to think about things before being attacked.The film balances the humour excellently with a decent zombie-story, and the array of characters within are not there just for laughs, there are plenty of poignant moments scattered throughout. Issues of family, love, and friendship, along with growing older and accepting responsibility are contained within the script. Much in the way that TV series Spaced managed to play the absurd with the serious, so does this film. It is easy to compare it to a 'big screen Spaced' episode, but that doesn't sell the film enough. It is much more than that, and is the perfect homage to zombie flicks, and social satire too. Watch towards the early stages of the film to see that most of the population could be confused for zombies anyway, and as for the end scenes of the film.well.suffice to say it will keep you laughing right to the end.With a cast pulled from many cult British shows (Dylan Moran from Black Books, Matt Lucas from Little Britain, and nearly everyone from Spaced), and an excellent appearance by Bill `Love Actually' Nighy, there isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks.This is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. The only drawback is that if it catapults him to international stardom he may never get around to making that final season of Spaced!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Just didn't click with me,"I was really looking forward to enjoying a quirky, English comedy but from start to finish I just could not get into Shaun of the Dead.It should be noted that I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. The genre has always seemed to focus on gore, effects, and thrills over plot and innovation. But I didn't think this would be an issue since Shaun is a spoof.But it's not a spoof. Or at least not entirely a spoof. Shaun is a conglomeration of spoof, satire, horror, thriller, fantasy, romance, and of course comedy. Very rarely do I enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously. The only similar movie I can recall for comparison is Mars Attacks! (1996).I had some laughs, but overall I could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though I desperately wanted to. At times it was clever and creative by placing average Joes in bizarre zombie situations. But at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller movies.In short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters. One reason I don't care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons. Shaun himself was no exception; he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations. His mother is a cross between senile and dim-witted. Ed is borderline retarded.Truthfully, in real life, I can't stand people like Shaun. They are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them. They have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments. The characters just don't seem to behave realistically, which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like Monty Python, but it's not.All in all, I give Shaun of the Dead a 6 / 10, still worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Why can't there be more British comedies like this?,"Shaun of the dead is in a word, brilliant.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and it never gets old, makes me laugh at each viewing. Having seen Dawn of the Dead, i was expecting just another spoof (as the name implies) but was pleasantly surprised to find a completely original story with some great comedy moments and superb acting all around (not to mention buckets of gore).

Unpopular opinion,"I know this is a fan favorite, cult classic, whatever you want to call it. I've never been a fan. I even gave it another chance all these years later and still feel the same. It's pretty funny early on, but there are almost no laughs in the second half. There's a bunch of unnecessary and annoying relationship drama (not the family stuff, that was good). And there are a bunch of really stupid parts. Overall it's not terrible, but it's not good either. (about 3 viewings, 8/6/2022)",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The best horror comedy in existence.,"When it comes to horror comedies Shaun of The Dead holds the number one spot and all others pale in comparison. We get it - you wish you had made Shaun of the Dead.I can never tire of watching this film. Each time you watch it you pick up on something new.The acting is brilliant, the special effects are brilliant. There is nothing about this film that is sub par.The thing I love about Wright's films, well the trio of Shaun of The Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End, they all have little tie ins.The soundtrack for Shaun of the Dead is also amazing. This film stands alone just as a zombie film and definitely a reflection of society today.If you haven't watched Shaun of The Dead, what are you waiting for??",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun Of The Dead,"Shaun Of The Dead was an absolute comedic treasure. From the punny name itself (poking fun at Dawn of The Dead) to the beginning and then to the end, this movie was an absolute laugh and masterfully written. There's so many funny one liners throughout and an actual story line behind everything. Every time I watch this, I notice new Easter eggs of funny or witty things included. The whole movie is just the perfect blend of humor and an actual story line with drama and suspense. There's never been such a success movie before that's done what this movie has done. Absolutely recommend this movie to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
HALLOWEEN 2022 - TIME FOR SHAUN OF THE DEAD!,"HALLOWEEN 2022 - TIME FOR SHAUN OF THE DEAD! Probably viewing number 13 for me.I am not a Zombie fan, but I cannot resist this one. Simon Pegg and his merry band of guys and gals are always a treat to watch. The only other two zombie movies I have liked are Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth (1967) and, believe it or not, 2016 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, with Lily James. (The only thing I like her in.) BUT! Shaun of the Dead is the only one I watch as often as I can.If you are not a Simpon Pegg and Company fan, it may not be for you. How sad for you. The are just so silly. Like giant sized children who slowly form into adults. Maybe.It's a great escape. And a great way to celebrate the second best holiday of the year (first being Thanksgiving, of course).If you've never given it a go - do. You have nothing to lose.

Didn't expect the film to turn out to be this. Haha.,"I've seen a lot of Zombie movies, a subgenre that I think has been overdone but I keep going back to it to see how different can your storytelling be?I'd always heard good things about this movie and finally got around to this 'cult classic', and I see it's got that status. This was a zombie movie like none other, you've got to watch it to find out why.This, as the card says, is a romantic comedy with zombies. Didn't think you could introduce romance and humor in zombie movie without making it a ""Scary Movie"" but huh, they've done it, and have ended up making a very deep movie out of it, with all sorts of social commentary.If, like me, you've been sleeping on this movie, don't.

An Invigorating Blend Of Comedy & Horror,"An invigorating blend of comedy & horror that breathes new life into the zombie apocalypse subgenre with its fresh perspective, witty treatment, welcome tributes & sharp commentary, Shaun of the Dead covers an eventful day in the uneventful life of its titular character and is an endlessly fun & wildly entertaining ride that will delight both casual viewers & genre fans.Co-written & directed by Edgar Wright, the simple premise & quick setup sets the main plot into motion right away while its energetic pace & dynamic flair keeps the interest alive from start to finish. Wright's brand of comedy isn't for everyone and though most of his attempts at humour do hit the sweet spot, there are moments where it feels overdone or is ineffective.The kinetic camerawork, breezy pace, clever use of incorporated songs & numerous nods to zombie classics of the past add flavours of their own into the mix. But the film's real strength lies in the smooth interplay & seamless chemistry between its leading duo. Both Simon Pegg & Nick Frost make the most of their roles and expertly complement the performances of one another.Overall, Shaun of the Dead deftly merges horror, comedy, homage & parody into a pleasant, delightful & enjoyable extravaganza and packs as much heart as it exudes humour. Crafted with heartfelt honesty, executed with unbridled passion and steered by a fantastic cast, this wicked, hilarious & refreshing horror comedy is a genuine crowdpleaser that promises loads of fun and more than delivers on it.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Snatch-Like Brit Zombies,"I guess you could call this a combination of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Snatch,"" the latter used as a comparison because of it's modern-day dark humor, That's what this film is: a combination of irreverent, modern-day attitudes and profanity from young Brits and a re-make of sorts of a famous horror film.Here, we these these 20-ish types fighting a mob of the ""undead"" as zombies roam neighborhoods devouring everyone. Our hero (Simon Pegg), a shiftless bum who has just lost his girlfriend due to his ineptness, winds up being the productive guy who saves the day and gets his girl back. Along the way, we get a number of laughs and a number of gross-out horror scenes, and a lot of f- words and the like. Nick Frost, as Simon''s best friend, provides the best and most disgusting of the low-life characters, which are unfamiliar over here.This is dark humor, to say the least, and would would appeal more to younger people although I like dark humor and I'm an old fart....but others over 50, beware. It was good entertainment in a crude way. My only complaint was trying to understand some of the sentence and British phrases of the day.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"To quote the British, Brilliant","Here is another movie that I discovered purely by accident, and could not be happier that I did. One lonely night, looking through the shelves at Blockbuster, I happened upon this and rented it.
This is the story of a lovable loser named Shaun, his ever present friend Ed and his girlfriend Liz. As Shaun tries to be the man Liz needs, while staying the man-child friend Ed needs, he keeps screwing up his relationship with Liz. This leads to her dumping him. The next day, resolved to win her back, also happens to be the beginning of the Zombie apocalypse. The hilarity ensues as Shaun tries to get his mom, Ed and Liz to safety.
What works about this movie is everything. Simon Peg is a huge horror nerd, so there are many outright, the movie title for one, and even more tongue in cheek nods to what came before in the genre. There is also a great social commentary that runs through the movie, where you can see they are trying to show that the human race has become little more than zombies already. This is a perfect fil for anyone that has a sense of humor and likes zombies/horror movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun of the Dead,"""Shaun"" (Simon Pegg) shares a house with his lazy old pal ""Ed"" (Nick Frost) living a life of mundanity. His girlfriend ""Liz"" (Kate Ashfield) is getting a bit fed up with his haplessness, and eventually decides that she is just too bored of their evenings in the local boozer. Suddenly, there start to appear reports on the television reports that there's some sort of plague going on. The two men are fairly oblivious to this until they discover strangers in their garden who seem impervious to shouts of abuse and latterly having things chucked at them. Quickly they repair indoors and realise that flesh-eating zombies have taken over the place. Quickly, the two men decide that they have to rescue ""Liz"" and her mum (Penelope Wilton) and try to find safety, ideally in their usual fortress-like watering hole - the ""Winchester"". Can they survive the throng of marauding creatures to gather everyone together? Then what? Can they live on crisps and beer for the rest of their lives? With panic setting in and tempers flaring, it's down to this intrepid bunch to stop from being munched upon and facing a fate worse than death. It's it's very normality that makes this work. Ordinary people, thinking on their feet, dealing with a catastrophe whilst simultaneously coping with the daft problems of day-to-day, turbulent, relationships. The writing is quickly paced and frequently quite witty, with engaging and cohesive efforts from the two at the top of the bill, but also from the briefly used Bill Nighy and the always reliable Wilton who has considerable skill when it comes to comedy timing and accompanying facial expressions. I can't say I've ever seen a collection of vinyl LPs used as an offence weapon before, and that sets the tone for the entertainingly spoofy daftness of the proceedings that isn't maybe the most original ninety minutes of cinema you'll ever have seen, but it stays the right side of slapstick and is good fun throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The Pros and Shauns,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a movie that accomplishes quite a bit in its modest runtime.The movie can be sweet and heartwarming. Hidden in throughout this movie are some really touching moments. Simon Pegg has some acting that would be considered for an Oscar reel if it weren't in a movie that the Academy sticks their noses up to. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great chemistry together, I completely believe them as best friends. The fact that this movie is so genuine, is what makes all the other aspects work.Other times it can be action packed and suspenseful. The fact that these characters are not skilled in survival skills does make things funny. But it also makes the action moments more thrilling. These characters are not invincible. The feel human, they feel vulnerable. Any minute of this film they might get killed just from the fact that they have no idea what they're doing.And of course, this movie can be hilarious. The zombie movie genre is ripe for satire and this movie executes things in a very clever way. The writing of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is very witty. The editing by Chris Dickens needs to be highlighted as well, he makes a lot of these jokes work, and makes sure the movie has no extra fat.There are some characters that do not work in this film. Likewise, there are some moments of character drama that feel a bit forced. Sometimes the incompetence of the characters is more frustrating than it is endearing.But outside of those problems, I highly recommend this film. It has a little bit for everyone. Grab a group of friends, hunker down and don't leave the house until its done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

The best rom-zom-com ever!,"This was my introduction to Edgar Wright, someone who would quickly become one of my favourite directors, and I was shocked by how clever of a film this was.Shaun of the Dead follows Shaun, a slacker who lives an uneventful life. When zombies begin to attack, Shaun must save his friends and family from the apocalypse.I had never heard of Edgar Wright or Simon Pegg before I saw this film but I realised how talented they both were, not only as a director and actor but also as writers. What would be the first of three collaborations between the two, Shaun of the Dead is essentially a parody film and ridicules the serious nature of zombie movies. This film is completely self-aware of itself and that's when the comedy kicks in to full effect. The dialogues in the film are some of the funniest I've ever heard. Not only are they hilarious but there's a surprising amount of wit and cleverness to them as they also convey a lot about the personalities of each character. Wright loves to sprinkle jokes in many parts and even after multiple rewatches, I'm still picking up on new details and jokes spread across that makes me appreciate the humour and level of thought that went into each and every element of the film. The filmmaking itself is unique with Wright's signature style of direction. The pacing is very fast due to the exceptional editing. Wright loves to have fast cutting and close zooms which not only brings out his unique voice as a director but makes the film have a sense of individuality.The acting is superb by everyone involved. Simon Pegg is incredible here and portrays the traits of his character so well. Another longtime collaborator of Pegg and Wright is Nick Frost who steals the show here. He's absolutely hilarious here and plays a great companion to Pegg. Kate Ashfield is great as Liz. Despite being a comedy, the romance is a major part of it and works really well with the overall tone.I'm not sure how many times I've seen Shaun of the Dead but I'm still not bored of it. It's parodies many zombie films of the past and does it incredibly well with entertaining characters and situations. There are so many subtle details in the visuals and comedy which I love discovering each time I watch it. Shaun of the Dead is easily the best rom-zom-com I've seen and is something Edgar Wright and everyone involved in the project should be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
This has everything I love about zombie films,"A super funny, excellent example of what a horror comedy and zombie film can be. There's a lot of symbolism in this film and it's placed in such a way that you can pick it up easily and doesn't feel pretentious. The humour is clever yet understandable and placed in so that it doesn't interrupt the story. I also like how British it is, it's self deprecating and honest about how these people live and doesn't sugarcoat any of it. The casting is also really good as the actors have really good chemistry with each other. The movie is well paced and a strong start for the Cornetto Trilogy.

Shaun of the Dead is a slice of fried gold,"Shaun of the Dead is one of my all-time favorite films. This horror comedy manages to parody the zombie genre while still standing solidly within it. The story is creative, the humor is quick and clever, the characters are memorable, it's endlessly quotable, and it also manages to generate some real fear and genuine emotions. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg created a special kind of magic with Shaun of the Dead. Simply put, this movie is a slice of fried gold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A romantic comedy. With zombies.,"A zombie movie that is a horror comedy directed by Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, there is a lot from this that can bring a great fun movie; this movie was a fun and entertaining time, and for the people who have not seen it, you should watch it. Shaun of the Dead (2004) was fun, entertaining, very funny, and was directed very well by Edgar Wright; what makes the movie great is the lead stars who are great together, and both are very funny for a movie like this. Also, the movie has a romantic comedy element in the movie, and I thought it worked well with the horror comedy vibe of the movie, with it also being funny on how it plays out.The main character Shaun played by Simon Pegg was great as this character; I liked how his life is standard and boring along with him having issues with his girlfriend and friends, until this zombie outbreak occurs where he must go save his girlfriend and friends with his best friend Ed, and Simon Pegg was very funny in the movie landing a lot of jokes and some physical humor at times. Shaun's best friend Ed played by Nick Frost was also great in the movie; he is someone who has been living with Shaun for a long time and likes hanging out with him at a place called the Winchester Pub, until he goes with Shaun to save his girlfriend and friends and he was also very funny in the movie, doing a lot of humor involving certain jokes in the movie and how he acts to everyone or certain things around him.The whole zombie outbreak was well done with it being subtle as it starts, but as the movie goes along, it increasingly becomes the focus as the movie goes on; the look of the zombies is simple, but they have well done make up and effects to them where it looks cool. The comedy in the movie is very funny, and the actors do an excellent job during a lot of funny moments that happen in the movie, along with them doing certain stunts and quick action scenes that were also well done. Plus, the cinematography was great with wide shots, stylized quick cuts and transitions during scenes, and effective uses of certain songs in the film, along with some emotional moments that were also good.Shaun of the Dead (2004) was a great horror comedy that is very funny and entertaining with great actors doing excellent jobs; there are a lot of people who have seen this movie, but if you have not, I would recommend checking it out. Edgar Wright did an excellent job directing and writing this movie, giving it that stylized feel like most of his movies, and it makes the movie fun to watch and makes it worth a rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"Funny and really entertaining, even if it is a one-joke concept it is one that works","I thought that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be my style, I seriously thought I would hate it. But no...I loved it. Some parts do drag, especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going, but I loved the film's deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror. If you love blood and gore, you have found your match with Shaun of the Dead, and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match. The cinematography is innovative and unique, the music just adds to the atmosphere, the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast, Simon Pegg is just wonderful, and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip. Overall, just a great film, although it is a one-joke concept it actually works. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Fun for the Whole Family,"My son dragged me to see this. I've gone with him to his comic book movies, his other zombie movies, and on and on. So I was set for one of those Dad-is- willing-to-give-up-a-day things. This utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the get-go. There are so many sight gags and pop culture references, so many goofy encounters, so much character to the undead, I really enjoyed this. I see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities. It also has a really fine cinematic sense.

Not really THAT great.,"It's time for a serious, level-headed review of Shaun of the Dead.This movie is one of the most over-hyped of the year. I'm tired of everyone calling it an instant cult classic. This phrase doesn't make any sense. A cult classic is a film that no one sees by has a small but loyal following. Shaun of the Dead was a big hit when it was released her back in April and it seems like it will do the same when it's released in America thanks to the alarmingly widespread positive word-of-mouth. Everyone seems to be caught up in the off-centre comedy to realize that the film is heavily conflicted and doesn't add up.First of all, this is not a romzomcom, or whatever. There is no romance, just a guy who wants to make up with his girlfriend while zombies get in the way. And to call it a comedy would be totally wrong, anyone paying the slightest iota of attention would see this film is not a comedy! Some funny moments, yes. But not all the way.Like most other zombie flicks there is no explanation to why Britain is suddenly overrun by the undead. The plague slowly trickles to life from the odd zombie stumbling around to full-blown hoards of them. Amidst this Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (the great Nick Frost) make fun of the undead and go about dealing with the holocaust in their own silly way.There are some pretty hard scenes of heavy emotion is this film (I want say what, but some characters do die) that totally contradict the 'comedy' label it's been stuck with. And despite some scenes of graphic violence this is NOT a horror film. It's not a comedy, a romantic comedy a spoof or homage. It simply doesn't know what it is.Many people believe they got a breath of fresh (or should that be old) air when it was revealed the film would have slow zombies and not the faster ones like in DOTD 2004 and (the dreadful) 28 Days Later. I personally do not understand this overused moan. Slow zombies are not scary; there is no threat from them.Shaun of the Dead starts out very stupid and slow. The opening scenes of people doing the repetitive things day in day out are not subtle at all and hammer the point to the audience way too forcefully. Then when the zombies first appear the characters and the audience don't fully realize/appreciate the danger until the last five minutes when the film finally becomes exciting and then that's when we get REALLY ripped off. The film ends way too quickly and conveniently. What a let down after building up so much only to collapse back into the stupid tone the film began in.Horror buffs will like the zillions of in-jokes and references to other horror movies. To the casual viewer, they will go right over your head. It's about the only thing that's consistent throughout the whole film.Don't listen to the word of over-excited reviewers who are inexplicably giving this film 5 stars. It is in no way the classic they are making it out to be. Good, yes. Entertaining, yes. The best movie you've ever seen/best zombie movie ever/yadda yadda yadda, definitely not. Shaun of the Dead has great potential come from inspiring sources, but the end result is not what the hype is telling you.Already out in UK, the DVD has great 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound and zillions of extras including Audio commentary from actor/writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, Audio commentary from actors Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Dylan Moran, Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis.

Tiw shaun of the dead,"Today i watched Shaun of the dead for like the 8th timeI really love this movie, its very excellent for a zombie film. It is effective in many departments. I enjoy the soundtrack, the action, the acting is pretty good, and the drama is very very effective.I honestly dont have much to say about this film actually, its just a very fun experience that is incredibly well done. I could watch this film over and over.There was maybe 3 times when I thought an element of the film could have been improved, but to be real, i cannot remember what those even were. I remember being annoyed about lighting in one scene. You could probably even chalk that up to a stylistic choice for that area of the film. This film is just very solid on all accounts.After watching edgar wrights other horror movie i was very happy to watch this film again, it is still very good and dont watch last night in soho it sucks that film is high 4/10.Overall a very funny, yet kinda sad, yet kinda romantic, yet sometimes even spooky film.

Shaun of the Brain Dead,"I am a big fan of what I would still call pulp and others would call pulp fiction. This is because good pulp can say more than pretentious literature or cinema can even aim to say.Shaun of the Dead tells the story Shaun, an ordinary guy who lives life is a dead end, and when his girl friend dumps him his best friend tell him it is not the end of the world. But he is wrong, it is, because the dead have started to walk the earth and feed on the flesh of living.What we get is basically a funny little comedy involving Zombies. On one hand I can argue that pop-horror works because it takes itself seriously and uses humour to cover the lack of budget, so Shaun of the Dead turns horror completely into a comedy missing the point. On the other hand, I don't know any movie that has ever really delved deeply into Zombies (while other unspeakable evils, such as vampires, werewolves and lawyers have all been suitably looked at). So Zombies are always good for a laugh and treating a zombie movie as a comedy makes more sense.That sums up the movie, good for a laugh, never rises above that. It contains over 10 times your daily requirement pop culture references and with the best ending to a Zombie movie that I have seen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Best Zombie Comedy?!,"Edgar Wright has made a fantastic comedy with zombies through Shaun of the Dead. It's a fun comedy to watch with the right amount of thrills and blood, but not so much that it would be a horror movie by any means. This movie spoofs the best of zombie media and the tropes associated with them.Simon Pegg (Shaun) is the title character who is working at a department store and is struggling to maintain his relationships. While this is happening a zombie apocalypse starts causing Simon, his friend, his ex, and his parents all to come together with the common goal of survival.The movie is hilarious and has a unique sense of comedy which is expected of British humor. The comedy just hits so well and is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen that has this much blood. The movie does get quite bloody at a few points with one of the characters stomach being pulled apart and eaten by a group of zombies.The characters are designed quite well in that your truly invested in their characters and the subplots regarding the relationships have you interested. The acting is what really sells this angle.Seeing multiple spoofs of this film in various media had me a little less blown away than what others described. But honestly I genuinely enjoyed this movie and it convinced me to finish the rest of the Cornetto trilogy on the same dayOverall, this is a fun movie which generates some great laughs and spoofs the tropes regarding zombie movies quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Partly successful attempt to blend styles that are hard to blend.,"Okay, even though I surely don't regret having watched this film, I won't be joining the other reviewers around here who all claim it's a hilarious movie and/or the best horror comedy in decades. The intentions of cast and crew are good, there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless, there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey, banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job, nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back, a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing, Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually, the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies, but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy, The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans, it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall, this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
why is this movie getting good reviews???????,"I am completely nonplussed why this torture of a movie seems to be everyone's favorite. On top of that its inclusion in the top 250 is bloody outrageous, not once did I laugh or even crack a smile in this movie. On the other hand I was getting irate by the second watching all of 'em on a nonsensical plot. Simon Pegg was an unexpected nasty surprise in this movie as I did not expect that type of dull performance from the brilliant actor. And the way they handle the situation with his mom is absolutely rubbish.Poor, very poor. Go for zombieland which should take this one's place in the top 250.

"""Shaun of the Dead"" Review: A Hilarious and Heartfelt Take on the Zombie Genre","Shaun of the Dead is a horror-comedy film that manages to strike the perfect balance between scares and laughs. The movie follows Shaun, a slacker who is stuck in a dead-end job and a failing relationship. When a zombie outbreak occurs, Shaun must step up and take charge to protect his loved ones.One of the strongest elements of the film is the performances. Simon Pegg gives a great performance as Shaun and is able to bring both humor and heart to the character. Nick Frost also delivers a great comedic performance as Shaun's best friend, Ed. The chemistry between the two actors is undeniable and they make for a great duo.The film also excels in its ability to blend horror and comedy together seamlessly. The movie never takes itself too seriously and is able to make fun of the zombie genre while still delivering some genuinely terrifying moments. The special effects and make-up used to create the zombies are also impressive and add to the overall sense of dread in the film.Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a clever and well-executed horror-comedy that manages to be both funny and scary. The performances are strong, the pacing is spot on and the film is able to make fun of the genre while still delivering some genuinely terrifying moments. It's a must-watch for fans of horror and comedy alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Cult classic,"There are so many zombie or zombie-inspired films and television series out these days. It's become pretty tedious. They haven't really reinvented the genre, but this film is timeless and original. It's a zombie film with some heart but a lot of laughs. It's nuanced and funny and of course, Simon Pegg helps deliver this masterpiece. There's some slightly cliched moments inherent to this kind of film. There's a typical disaster flick formula that plays out, but despite all of this, it still has more originality than I've seen in a long time or since then. Despite the laughs, don't be mistaken, there's a lot of horror and violence to be found here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Horror Comedy Done Right,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is just hilarious! It has countless references to horror classics, a genius script filled with social parody, horror movie tropes. dark comedy and even with some drama mixed in. The cast is just perfect headlined by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, while the directing of Edgar Wright is fast, creative and fun. One of the best comedies to come out of Great Britain in the 2000's and the first of the well received ""Cornetto Trilogy"" all of which feature Pegg, Frost and Wright. A must watch for all British comedy fans out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

One of the greatest comedy's of all time,"Ahh, Shaun Of The Dead. Where to begin. This movie is a masterpiece of multi-purpose proportions. It's a great movie with a very non- professional feel to it, which was intentional. Edgar Wright's classic style of fast montage esc hard camera cuts fit well with the overall vibe of the movie, A light toned movie with doesn't take itself seriously. That makes it an enjoyable watch for just relaxing. You don't need to be looking at every frame one by one and analysing every picometer of your screen. Just sit back grab a bucket of popcorn sit down on the couch and just watch the movie. Complements aside there is just one minor in perfection... We don't want to see Shaun's mum die. The straight up comedy of this film isn't shoved down our throats and the movie isn't injected into your eyes and is just Infront of us. Overall it's a great movie 9/10. Shaun Of The Dead deserves a R13 age rating. And is must watch. Just watch it man.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Over the top and very funny,"Since everyone in the world here has seen fit to describe the plot of this movie in excruciating detail, I'll skip all that and just let you know that this was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. The understated, bemused reactions of Shaun and Ed to all that's going on around them at first (""Are they out there?"" ""No...Oh, wait, there they are"") sets the stage for life-and-death struggle against the undead (or,as they will be known in Reality TV,the ""Fun Dead"") that will forever be remembered as Z-Day. There is no subtlety here-the zombies are everywhere and the noise is constant, which is one thing I might have changed. It gets quite tiring to watch all this activity over fully the last half of the film. Still, it's hilarious without being mean-spirited (even though folks being are being gobbled up and ripped apart throughout.) Who needs a superhero to save the world when we've got Shaun?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Despite the story being used a million times, this is a very funny film","My cousin had called me from London a few months ago and told me about this film. She also asked if there were any trailers or release dates in the states, I didn't know. I never even heard of the film, but it sounded hysterical. I did see the theatrical trailer a week later, but I was saddened that there was no theater around that was playing this flick. Finally it came out for rent, and I grabbed it immediately. I'm glad I did.The things that got me about this movie, is that it reminds me so much of my friends. If there is a huge crisis, I'm so much like Ed, I'm just calm and with whatever goes and my best friend is so much like Shaun, it's scary how her and I could relate. These boys are so hung over from the night before and their reaction the first zombie in Shaun's backyard is priceless. ""Oh, my god! She's so drunk!"" and Ed getting a picture when she attacks Shaun because he thinks that she's just hitting on him! LOL! The references to past zombie movies were great ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"". Priceless. I love this movie a lot!This movie is so funny! Even though Dawn of the Dead(2004!!!!!) was a great movie, this movie brings up all the sarcasms of the original, along with any other zombie movie. I would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh. The ending is the best part and highly touching... don't ask. Good job, UK!!!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
how did this get good reviews?,"I'm really very anxious to know how this got good reviews. I didn't find this movie remotely entertaining and would have shut it off immediately if I had control of the television at the time. This was an awful movie. I can appreciate the idea of a spoof on zombie films, but at least do it properly! The attempts at ironic humor and sarcasm were very dry and weak. It was neither laugh worthy nor relatively clever. I wasn't too fond of the acting or the use of a Queen song in the soundtrack. Queen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, please do not defile their music by featuring it in something as awful as this. All in all, I thought this film was very stupid. If you are looking for a horror movie spoof I highly recommend Army of Darkness, but don't bother with Shaun of the Dead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun of the Dead,"Shaun of the Dead is one of the best parody movies ever made. The fact that it is a parody but it is still made with such perfectionism and professionalism by everyone involved is a test to the character of good quality of this movie. The premiss in itself is a parody but they manage to put elements of comedy in such a sincere and not-expected way that you can't help but laugh in the face of the zombies. Also, the elements of comedy are there with a purpose, its intentional and that doesn't happen often with horror movies where you end up laughing by how awfully made they are (not all of course). I truly recommend you go see it, even if you are a sensible person who doesn't like horror, it can be for you too!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
One of the best horrors ever made!,"I absolutely love this movie! I remember seeing this movie when I was just a kid and since that day it has never ever got old. I still watch it regularly and I will never not love it. It's not only hilarious throughout the whole film it's also a great horror and has some amazing horror moments, the gore is so well done and really reminds you that this is a zombie film. The cinematography is so great aswell and a typical Edgar Wright film. I must have seen this movie over 50 times and it is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are some of my favourite actors and their chemistry in this movie is what makes it so hilarious and so memorable. This movie will always make me smile and I will always recommend it to anybody. I love it so much!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"The best Z-word--movie ever, closer to you than it ever was!","Some movies just perfectly fit one genre, so that they finally overwhelm it...This is here the case, just as ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is more than just the best western-movie ever... ""Shaun of the dead"" uses the symbolics of the zombie invasion as it was used in the first Romero's : we're all already dead folks, as far as modern life is concerned(OK, I promise I won't talk about symbolism anymore...)...Thus, plus the fact that all of this is done in a really funny and genre-respectful way! Shaun is something like an impossible crossover between the Z-movie and the 30like sitcom, with a 30like yo hero stuck in a store selling TV sets alongside with dull acneic teens thinking (and telling) he's a loser...By the time he realizes the world is being invaded by man-eating zombies, his girlfriend drops him out, which seems to be far more uneasy for him to accept than the rest... If you add the fact that it's always flipping between the rawest comedy and the harshest drama, things are beginning to get really good for you viewer, as the more you laugh, the more the characters get sympathetic, and the more you get really touched by what happens to them (as opposed, for example, to the fact that we don't give a f*ck about whatever happens to Neo in Matrix...).This is a brilliantly efficient way to keep you concerned and surprised from the beginning to the end. Another trick used to get you wondering what you might do might it happen to you (and yes you wonder, even if you rationally know that this won't happen...) is what I call the proximity-FX, having a hero so ordinary, his best friend selling weed and playing VG all day long, and a goal twisting between avoiding to be eaten alive and getting the girlfriend back...In this category enters something you in the US probably won't feel as much as we do in Europe: you're used to see your streets filled with Dodge and Chrysler exploding while being chased by crazy-machine-gunslinging choppers (this is America, I saw it on TV!), but we're not! And I admit that seeing anyone trying to flee away from a zombie-horde in a red renault Megane definitely gives me the creeps, as this is one car I may actually use if I ever have to do it myself! Go and run to your video-store if you had'n't seen it yet as anything in this movie is perfect: the whole cast (the dead-in-his-heart employee-of-the-month, the Bigbie-like best friend and his invasive weed business and laziness, the very touching mother and father-in-law, all of the team following Shaun and the mirror-team following his ex-girlfriend,the girlfriends' friends looking like a grown-up and boring Harry Potter and a living Barbie doll...)as they all fit perfectly written characters, the filming (watch for the double and mirrored sequence shot in the beginning or the plans to get the girlfriend back!), the twisted yet classic scenario illuminated with instant-cult-scenes (you don't know yet but a vinyl of Sade may actually save your life!)... All of these make this movie an absolute must-see!go and get it,buy it, rent it or steal it, buy popcorn, sit well and enjoy alone,with your friends,girl/boy-friend or dog or grandma or anyone you want to have with you when you have a real good time!Shaun rocks!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over","This is hands down my favorite comedy ever made.Sorry Hot Fuzz but I prefer this one over you..

The camerawork is great, the acting is spot on, it's funny as can be and it even gets scary when it needs to. Near the end I stopped laughing because I was genuinely concerned for the characters and their well being. This movie is very quotable and it have some amazing one liners. And Even 20 years after it's release I still can't stop laughing at the fence jump scene.

Gold Standard of Zombie Spoofs,"""Shaun of the Dead,"" with the title itself imitating those of George A. Romero's zombie films, such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), is a pleasant diversion from more serious fare in the subgenre, especially when, if like me, you've been viewing a bunch of zombie and other apocalyptic dramas during, as of this posting, the pandemic. The parallels between the yawning protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg, also co-writer)--working a dead-end job, returning to the same pub night after night and playing mindless video games with his best mate Ed, much to the frustration of his girlfriend, who seeks more culture and varied experience--to thoughtless, slow zombies is even played purely for laughs instead of as some sort of social commentary along the lines of that with materialism in ""Dawn of the Dead.""It's amusing, too, how Shaun's obliviousness to his surroundings is largely reflected in our understanding of the story. While there's some dramatic irony when the outbreak initiates, as the spectator will surely pick up on the escalating population of zombies surrounding Shaun before he realizes it, any explanation for the events remain elusive. Humorously, Shaun's first news of the epidemic on TV is cobbled together by his changing the channels, with words and phrases from each show adding up to a report on the undead. We hardly get a look at the newspaper accounts, either, and as soon as the TV is about to tell us what caused the outbreak, the boob-tube is shut up. Contrast this with, for instance, the rambling of talking heads about radiation from a Venus satellite in ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). There's also a funny reference to ""28 Days Later"" (2002), where the outbreak's supposed origins to rage-infected monkeys is dismissed.The point is that it doesn't matter where the zombies came from or that they're an analogy for some real-world problem; ""Shaun of the Dead,"" regardless, is going to do the same thing that's been done over and over again, whether it be drinking at the pub or being yet another zombie movie, to make light of it. If you're so bitten, like me, to have binged on numerous zombie movies already, such a sentiment is easy to appreciate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The most heartfelt zombie film,"Shaun of the Dead broke new ground in the year 2004 by portraying a zombie film where the heart of the film is in bumbling everyday characters who are going through a comedic crisis. Bolstered by brilliant performances by Simon Pegg and his cast who seemed to be just stumbling throughout their lives, the film's story deftly interweaves the threat of a zombie horde with the emotional stakes of a romance gone wrong. The numerous little moments and callbacks throughout the film add to its charm - the attack with the music records, the peanuts in the dark and the morning trip to the dairy. However, the most memorable parts are simply the heartfelt moments when the protagonist messes up and tries to pursue every harebrained scheme to get his girlfriend back, showing the emotional core within the blood and gore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Not to mention the dialogue and back and forth banters that take place are top notch while still managing to have a feel of how ""regular people"" if you will interact and deal with their issues. The film has a simple set-up and doesn't over complicate the story, keeping you entertained and full of laughter throughout.

Not a parody,"Honestly not as funny as I remembered, but still a solid action-comedy and refreshing take of zombie apocalypse movies. Full or references but not necessarily a genre parody, it actually manages to add a more modern touch to Romero's social allegory (Shaun is initially completely unable to distinguish zombies from humans). Edgar Wright's visual comedy style is already recognizable here, but, as with most goody British comedies, the verbal jokes tend to be hit and miss.

shaun of the dead,"He Good, the Bad, and the Undead I recently watched the movie ""Shaun of the Dead"" and I have to say, it was a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I appreciated the unique blend of comedy and horror that the film attempted to achieve. The idea of a zombie apocalypse being the backdrop for a comedy was definitely intriguing and had a lot of potential. The film had its moments of genuine humor, with some well-executed jokes and witty dialogue. The chemistry between the main characters, played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, was undeniably entertaining and their comedic timing was spot on. I found myself laughing out loud at certain scenes and genuinely enjoying the humor that was presented. However, there were also some aspects of the movie that fell flat for me. While the comedy was certainly present, I felt that the horror elements were lacking. The zombies themselves were not particularly scary or threatening, and the film didn't really build up any tension or suspense. It seemed to rely more on the comedy aspect rather than delivering on the horror front. Additionally, I found the plot to be a bit predictable and formulaic. It followed the typical zombie movie tropes and didn't really offer anything new or innovative. The characters were also somewhat one-dimensional, with little development or depth. I didn't feel particularly invested in their journey or their outcome. The pacing of the film was also a bit off. There were moments where the story seemed to drag and lose momentum, and then suddenly pick up again. This uneven pacing made it difficult for me to fully engage with the film and stay invested in the story. It had its moments of humor and entertainment, it fell short in terms of delivering a truly compelling and well-rounded film. It had potential, but ultimately failed to fully capitalize on it. If you're a fan of zombie comedies, it might be worth a watch, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Bridging Genres Brilliance: Simon Pegg's Cinematic Symphony,"Undoubtedly, Simon Pegg has proven time and again his prowess in the realm of filmmaking, and my admiration for his work might be perceived as biased. Nevertheless, I cannot help but declare that his latest cinematic endeavor stands out as one of his most exceptional creations.The film, in question, seamlessly weaves together a tapestry of genres, captivating the audience from start to finish. Pegg's ability to infuse humor, drama, and suspense into a cohesive narrative is truly commendable. This cinematic masterpiece not only showcases his versatile acting skills but also highlights his proficiency as a storyteller.From the opening scenes to the climactic moments, the movie maintains a consistent level of entertainment. Pegg's charismatic presence on screen is enhanced by a well-crafted script that expertly navigates the delicate balance between various genres. Each element, whether it be the witty dialogue, well-timed comedic sequences, or intense dramatic moments, contributes to the overall richness of the viewing experience.One aspect that particularly deserves acclaim is the film's adept handling of character development. Pegg's portrayal of the protagonist is layered and nuanced, allowing the audience to empathize with the character's journey. The supporting cast also delivers stellar performances, adding depth to the narrative and creating a cinematic synergy that is both engaging and memorable.Furthermore, the film's production values are noteworthy. The seamless integration of special effects, cinematography, and sound design enhances the immersive quality of the viewing experience. The meticulous attention to detail in the visual and auditory aspects elevates the film to a level of cinematic excellence.In conclusion, this Simon Pegg masterpiece not only reaffirms his status as a versatile and accomplished actor but also solidifies his standing as a force to be reckoned with in the film industry.

Brilliantly Observed Comedy,"This may sound odd, but what makes this comedy about Londoners fending off zombies with vinyl albums and cricket bats so terribly funny is that it's so utterly believable. Every character is someone you know; every interaction is something you've experienced; every emotion is one you know. Except with flesh-eating zombies.A brilliantly observed comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead' makes shrewd points about the nature of mass media and consumer culture, the banality of everyday life, love, friendship, fear, and heroism. It also pokes fun at traditional zombie movies, with the undead moving so slowly that Shaun and Ed have time to go through their album collection to determine which records are too precious to be slung at their shuffling assailants. The humour is occasionally gross, but always funny; the observations about how real people would react to an entirely surreal situation are spot on.An instant comedy classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Awesome zombie horror-comedy,"Shawn of the dead is a great spoof of the zombie genre which is funny and a breeze to sit through. Perhaps the best way to describe the film's comedy is to call it ""British humor."" Don't expect a gag-a-minute affair like Scary Movie, or a TV sit-com approach. Shaun of the Dead's niche is much closer to the one occupied by Evil Dead 2 (and its sequel, Army of Darkness) and Tremors. Those movies understood what makes a good horror movie, then had some fun with the premise, neither taking it too seriously nor utilizing contempt in its ridicule. Shaun of the Dead is a movie that one might not expect to work at first glance, but, for those who don't mind a little laughter with their zombies (or perhaps it should be the other way around), this is an unusual source of entertainment. If you are in the mood for some zombie action, I suggest you watch Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the dead in succession. This is great entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Shaun plots a plan to rescue his mother and Liz and bring them to the Winchester, but his sanctuary is surrounded of zombies and things do not happen as planned.""Shaun of the Dead"" is a funny parody of ""The Night of the Living Dead"" with potential of cult-movie. The story has a British humor, and some situations are really funny, since the two heroes are authentic morons that recall Beavis and Butt-Head or even the lazy characters of ""Idle Hands"". This film is recommended for specific audiences that liked the black humor of ""Braindead"", ""Frankenhooker"" or ""Idle hands"", just to mention some examples.

Hilarious!,"When my family told me they wanted to see ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I was less than thrilled. I thought it would be just another spoof/satire on all the zombie/horror movies that have previously been released.Was I in for a surprise. Although the first 10-15 minutes of laying the foundation of the movie seemed to be the typical droll, dry Brit humor (and I do mean dry)and very unimpressive, the movie took a turn. During this first 10-15 minutes, I was thinking of reasons why I should leave my seat and do ANYTHING - go to the bathroom, get popcorn, etc. However, I was helplessly stuck, as I had already powdered my nose and had a hot dog on my lap.All of a sudden,the movie picked up rapidly when Shaun and his hopeless roommate find a little ""drunk"" girl in the garden (zombie), and the poor guys came to the realization she was a monster. This was the turning point, when matters turned from severely dry to utter hysteria!!!!The plot was exceptional, when you think of two average (and less than average) Joes trying to deal with a zombie in the back yard. When they tried to throw kitchen utensils and, yes, a toaster at her, the whole theater was roaring! I especially loved the old record collection that Shaun frantically used to throw at other zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums he wanted to throw and which he wanted to keep!The ways in which this average town first of all overlooked the zombies (just another day in town, ho hum) and then, dealing with them and at one point, trying to blend in so they could make their way to the Winchester Pub (I'm laughing even as I'm typing) was hilarious! Just walk like a zombie, don't say a word, and they won't know the difference! Too bad Shaun and his ex-girlfriend had to get into the inevitable spat and blow their cover!This was an unexpected treasure of a movie, with fresh and innovative writing. I would recommend this movie to all moviegoers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
No Ones Gonna Save You From the Beast About to Strike,"So what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker? Well if you are British, you get Shaun of the Dead. The movie starts out following Shaun around his mundane life. He's still working at a computer store. He still sits in front of the TV flipping channels with his buddy Ed, who is a bigger loser than Shaun is. But his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him. Oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies, not that Shaun or Ed even notice. That's until Ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden. This gives Shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back, sweep her off her feet and take her to safety. But Shaun and Ed are no Will Smith and Bruce Willis so hilarity ensues.The major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary. With a movie that mixes humor with gore, there should be a least one going on at all time. Another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a British film. While I was watching it, I wondered out load, ""Why would Shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that?"" Someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat. And there were a few places where the British slang just went over of my head.The DVD extras include the usual trailer, documentaries (extremely boring), deleted and extended scenes (good choice taking these out), and blooper reel. One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story. No if only every movie did this. Also, during the film, Shaun and Ed flip through the TV pretty quickly, so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with Coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the British version of Jerry Springer.With everything that had be popular oversees, I predicted we will get an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead (spelled Shawn instead)within five years with Stifler as Shawn, Jack Black as Ed, Kate Bosworth as Liz, the nerdy dude from The O.C. as David, some token hot chick as Dianne, and Burt Reynolds as Phillip. And in hopes to rejuvenate his career, Michael Jackson will don the Thriller makeup one more time to be the head zombie that leads the other zombie in a zombie dance. Just make sure Shawn grabs a baseball bat out of the shed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Hilarious new take on zombies,"Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to get out of his rut. He needs to pick up his game with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He needs to connect more with his mother (Penelope Wilton). His slacker friend Ed (Nick Frost) is annoying his other roommate. He's a meek appliance salesman. It's another bad day in his life, but things seem to be happening all around him. It's the zombie apocalypse and he doesn't notice at all. After Liz dumps him, he has an all night drinking session with Ed. In the morning, the clueless duo come face to face with the walking dead.It's a little slow at the start. It takes awhile to lay down the foundations. Once they start fighting the zombies, the movie is hilarious. Nick Frost is crazy funny.

A little smile - not a TOTAL waste of time!,"I think that it's too bad that Shaun of the dead is the film that Simon Pegg is most known for!

This is how to make a great film.,"Like a veritable color wheel of human emotions, Shaun of the Dead is a comedy that covers all the ground and then some. I was simply stunned how moved I was by a movie that made me laugh this hard. This is no over-hyped special edition DVD movie the guy at Blockbuster says changed film. This film shoots neither over your head nor under it. That isn't to say it's low-brow, it is sublimely clever. But it isn't smug and content with itself as a film, and yet it doesn't desperately attempt to entertain. It comes across not like watching Jim Carrey, who always tries to be everything to his audience, but instead is like Bill Cosby. Cosby could hold hundreds in an auditorium captive with laughter for hours, and you might find yourself in a similar state after watching Shaun.Am I over-hyping this film? What I've said above is like somebody saying ""Mozart was just a musician"". The absolute greatness of this film cannot be overstated. Is it gory? Hell yes. Is it bleak? At times. Is it British-style humor? Yes, and with a ""U"" if you really want to be accurate! This movie is everything it wants to be and more. You may find yourself crying at this film, you may find yourself laughing uncontrollably. You may be frightened to your core. It is really, really, really good. Best ever? No. But guaranteed not to disappoint.**********(10/10 stars!!!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A tribute to the zombie-genre,"I first encountered Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright when a friend of mine introduced me to the English cult-series; ""Spaced"". It's clear that these crazy fellows make movies, just because they love it. It's the kind of ultra-referential meta-manic intertextual stuff that any moviefanatic loves. Almost every scene is a reference to another movie, and the real sport is guessing what movie it comes from.""Shaun of the Dead"" follows the same tradition, but with Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as their main-inspiration. Anyone who tried to analyze Romero's work should know that it's not just about people coming back from the dead to eat the brains of the living. It's a critical comment to the modern zombie-culture one sees when entering a shopping mall. The zombies are consumers, and the are us.Pegg and Wright has certainly not abandoned this idea, however the zombies are not just mallrats. The zombies are lazy, unemployed, couch-sitting playstation-junkies. The zombies are our TV-culture. Keeping the idealistic ideology, add humour and a passion for movies. - There you have; Shaun of the Dead is funny, original, interesting and quite gory. It's the best tribute to the Zombie-genre I've ever seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Good but not Great,"Hearing so much about 'Shaun of the Dead' built my expectations high. 'Shaun of the Dead' is a parody of zombie movies with ever day life; any generation Xer will get the factory/service industry humor. Xers live a very left out, hard paced, brain dead Zombie existence. I can relate to this humor with my job, and the people around me. Over educated Xer's expect more, and have seen a depressing decline in the quality of life, while parents and other generations sometimes do not understand us; the family part of the movie explains this perfectly. Life seems pretty bad after college were one makes all their contacts. There is a lot of social humor about gen X in this film. Many people who live in such situations need a childish friend like Shaun has which Shaun needs for stress releases. No one else understands why Shaun hangs out with his loser friend, but this friend keeps Shaun sane. The Zombie humor would not work if done on this side of the Atlantic; the British have a flair for dry(in a good way like dry red wine) foolish humor. The she's drunk scene was great, along with the dad turning off the car radio. Comedy is hard to do, and the film's makers got away with making a funny movie with such a hard concept. Worth renting the DVD over the going to see it. 6 or 7 out of 10, but I probably buy the movie. I love dry humor. One part of the movie that surprised me is how similar the service industry is marketed with North American style Best Buy and Wal-Mart shops.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"US, UK, you'll enjoy it just the same","I'm not from the UK (live in NJ), and not a fan of horror movies, but I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead thoroughly. I first saw it on DVD, and watched it twice plus all the additional material, which is rare for me. I'm sure that a few jokes were missed on me (for example, I only found out about the original, Dawn of the Dead, a few weeks after I've watched it), but the greatness of the movie lies not in any one-liners or comedic material. Movies that rely on this are rarely enjoyable when viewed more than once. No, this movie belong to the same category as Spinal Tap: its appeal is in the off-the-wall characters and situations, and in the absurdity of it.And this, in a nut-shell, is what this movie is: a theater of the absurd. You have people who desperately try to maintain a normal life-style while all around them is chaos; who try to patch up relationships while being attacked by flesh-eating zombies. In one of the best scenes, the main character, Shaun, has his first heart-to-heart talk with his stepfather of 20 years just as the old man turns into a Zombie. In another, Shaun tries to prevent his best friend Ed from throwing an AC/DC record at a zombie in self defense because it is a first edition. And not to mention the laid-back Ed himself, who decides to take a call on his cellphone just when it is imperative that he pretends to be a zombie to avoid being attacked by their kind.But the movie isn't just a mindless comedy. There's good directing and acting, and the timing and pace are excellent throughout most of it. The plot is very strong and even the TV broadcasts which are intertwined with the movie are entertaining. One word of advice, though: don't show this to small kids. While less terrifying than your average horror movie, there are still some gory scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Kevin Smith lite,"Shaun of the Dead"" is a Brit flick comedy romp which gaggles together a motley bunch of stereotypical young adults including a klutzy schmuck (the hero), his babe girlfriend, the required gross fat guy sidekick, etc. and then plunks them down in the middle of a zombie flick. The film conjures a mix of droll and outrageous humor which wears thin quickly and then turns into a bloody Zombiefest which seems as endless as it is pointless. With few lol's to offer but the same sort of obvious tailoring for the irreverent and unsophisticated young adult crowd as a Kevin Smith (Dogma, Mallrats, etc.) flick, ""Shaun of the Dead"" manages to clunk along with good production value, a meager story, and some cult appeal.

An Average Sarcastic Zombies Movie.,"This movie is kinda the start of non told series of movies which is the result of cooperation between""Edgar Wright"" and ""Simon Pegg"" , The next movie in the series is ""Hot Fuzz"" and then ""At World's End"".It's better not to compare any of the movie in the series with each other, because they are separated story wise.

But the good thing that they kept everything simple, the idea is simple, the make up and eye lenses of zombies are simple, the killing scenes and the places included are simple, so everything was clear to the point.Finally, it's a good comedy zombie movie that can get you out of a bad mood although it has some points that may get you bored.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Through its clever writing, inventive direction, and thought-provoking themes, ""Shaun of the Dead"" delights audiences with its infectious humor while offering a nuanced exploration of societal apathy and the human condition.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to seamlessly merge comedy and horror, resulting in a unique and captivating viewing experience. Edgar Wright's expert direction and Simon Pegg's brilliant screenplay effortlessly transition between gut-busting comedic moments and genuinely tense and thrilling horror sequences. The film expertly plays with genre conventions, paying homage to classic zombie films while injecting its own brand of clever humor, resulting in a refreshing and engaging cinematic cocktail.The success of ""Shaun of the Dead"" hinges upon the incredible performances of its ensemble cast.

Pegg's comedic timing and genuine vulnerability make him a relatable and endearing protagonist. The supporting cast, including Nick Frost, Kate Ashfield, and Penelope Wilton, add depth and charm to the film, elevating it beyond mere comedic fare.Beneath its zany humor and thrilling zombie encounters, ""Shaun of the Dead"" cleverly explores themes of societal apathy and the monotony of everyday life. The film serves as a biting commentary on modern society's tendency to drift through life in a state of complacency, oblivious to the larger issues around us. Through Shaun's journey of self-discovery and personal growth, the film invites audiences to reflect on the importance of human connection, resilience, and the need to break free from the mundane routines that often define our existence.Edgar Wright's directorial flair is on full display in ""Shaun of the Dead,"" as he infuses the film with his signature visual style and innovative storytelling techniques.

Right up there with Evil Dead 2 and Dead Alive!,"British humor, how I love it! ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is full of it. Let me make clear right at the beginning that this movie can also be watched by people who are not into Zombie and horror flicks at all. This is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine. There's a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, some horror and, as I said, LOTS of humor! It's easy to tell that the people behind this project have a great love for the Zombie genre. What separates them from geeks like Peter Jackson, is that they don't live exclusively in their fantasy world, but that they have a sharp eye for people's motivations and their way of dealing with everyday problems. Where ""Dead Alive"", ""Bad Taste"" and even ""Evil Dead 2"" drew their laughs from extensive use of blood, guts and over-the-top violence, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is funny because of its debunking look at the lives of average Joes. Somehow the movie follows the tradition of Romero's flicks by unmasking people's weaknesses, but it does that in a much warmer and - again - humorous way.Shaun is one of us, an everyday guy, who has everyday problems, and keeps having them even in the most bizarre situations. Simon Pegg nails the character. He creates a new Anti-Hero à la Ash without being a pale rip-off of that character. Each cast member has amazing timing and knows how to bring the humor of the script to life.The only little beef I have with ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is that it gets a little too serious in the end, which is a little inappropriate considering for the rest of the time the viewer plies between grinning incessantly and roaring with laughter.Anyway, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is an instant cult classic and will gain a huge fanbase. It was about time someone took the throne of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are definitely worthy of that legacy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
We always knew zombies were funny!!,"At last, someone has taken the only logical step with a zombie movie: made a comedy out of it!! We always laughed at the campiness at Dawn of the Dead and other such flicks, the filmmakers have made the natural progression to romantic zombie comedy.For zombies are not incredibly scary. Yeah, they eat ya, but you pretty much have to be nailed to the floor for them to catch you.Shaun of the Dead has taken this approach with the zombie flick, and has done it to tremendous applause! This film is funny, satirical, a bit tender at times but very entertaining. It is the best approach to a zombie film I have ever seen.It also shows that comedy is not dead, it's just American comedy that's dead.

Really Goood,"'Shaun of the Dead' is a romantic zombie comedy and one of the first films of Edgar Wright. This British film shot in 2004. Actors who are starring in this film are Simon Pegg and Nick Frost well-known by films like 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Paul'. Release date is 9 April 2004. The protagonist, Shaun Riley, is a 29-years-old manager at an electronics store. His employees don't respect, he can't make relationship with the girl and her friends condemn his lifestyle. He, standing in line at the bus stop at the supermarket on the way home from work like usual man, strongly resembles zombie. Shaun is an ordinary man. But while Shaun was thinking about his gap with the girl there was a real apocalypse in the world! The first extraordinary thing he saw was a woman standing with a stick protruding from her belly! Comedy mixes very closely with a horror. The film features the director's good work and very convincing cast. Although there are few feeble jokes this film will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the production. This is phenomenally funny scary film you would have ever seen. I think that this film is fabulous in all respects.

Truly one of the best horror comedies ever made.,"There is so many great things you can say about Shaun of the Dead. This film is funny, scary and at times heartbreaking. The cast and director really played every angle perfectly. They gave you characters you actually gave a damn about, and a story that was entertaining.I have truly never laughed so hard in my life, and the comedic genius of both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is outstanding, not too mention how well they play off each other. Having been a fan of British comedy for 10+ years I had always thought there would never be a film to come close to funny as Holy grail, now here we have Shaun of the Dead and it is as funny if not funnier than any of the Monty Python stuff out there.I will say I am ashamed to admit I just only recently watched this film, and it was only because I found Hot Fuzz to be a really great film and the poster mentioned it was from the guys whom did Shaun of the Dead. Well After seeing Shaun I can safely say Shaun is definitely the better of the two films, but Hot Fuzz is very enjoyable.I am not a spoiler type person, but I highly suggest you check this film out and if you don't get any of the three emotions I mentioned above then you are a shut-in whom should be banned from ever watching another film in the history of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

horror comedy works...Hollywood take note!,"First came Abbot and Costello Meet...Then came Young Frankenstein...Then American Werewolf in London...Return of the Living Dead... and now...Shaun!The history of horror comedy if filled with gems and this takes the cake. Not only is it consistently funny, gory and filled with Romeroesque social satire, it far out does any of the mass market slapstick Will Ferrell/Jack Black comedy and the endless output of predictable copycat horror that American studios keep shoving down the public's throat. Shaun of the Dead digs at everything from the zombie genre to the zombie-like existence of the general shuffling public. Shaun may be a loser in some sense, but when you really look at the film, most men will find that at some point in their lives the could be the character. In fact, Shaun is the epitome of the twentysomething, working class male of the 21 century. Come on, how many of us would not like to be ably to hang at the pub, down pints with our long time pals and play video games all day. Don't forget the hot girlfriend and the drama that comes with that. Throw in the opportunity to bash the skulls of some zombies and play the hero of the day and you've got the perfect existence, right?That's basically what you get when Shaun rises from his couch to take on life. Shaun and the assembly line existence of the service industry level emplotment that forms the majority of the working class are already zombies, they just don't see it as illustrated by Shaun's daily routine at the beginning of the film. What differentiates Shaun from the rest is the dormant motivation he possesses to change that which consumes the rest.The zombies are a great allegory for the challenges of growing up, maturing and the demons we all must overcome in order to salvage our lives from the mundane. You either sit back, make no moves and become a zombie or you fight back and make the changes in order to succeed and rise to the top of the pack. Shaun's struggles are no different than our own and it is fun to watch from the safety of the theatre or your own couch with the DVD playing in your PlayStation as the zombies attack.What makes this clever RomZomCom different from the films in the comedy and horror genres of recent years is that the setting is not a fantastic world or an upperclass suburban white neighborhood filled with movie star beauty. It is a real place that exists in every city, populated with realistic people making it easy for the average person to relate to. The humor is sharp and intelligent instead of being in you face vulgar and mindless. There is not attempt to capitalize on the trends of mainstream comedy to rake in the bucks. The horror is not reliant on expensive yet obvious CGI effects or recycled masked killers that are as outdated as 80's style high bangs and leg warmers. This movie goes straight to the gut, whether for laughs or repulsion. It is worthy of the films it parodies and makes fun of. You will have fun picking out the minor characters from the beginning of the film after they have become zombies. Notice that other than the craving for human flesh the undead versions of the individuals is not much different than their pre-zombie lives. Shaun of the Dead is a gem that will hopefully make American studios take notice of and explore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A matter of life in death,"Slack-jawed, vacant stare, lurching, staggering gait ... I'm not talking about the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"".

People for whom life is never anything more than working 9 to 5 in a dead-end job, then coming home to spend the evening as couch potatoes in front of the TV or video games. People with no soul or spirituality. People for whom there is no heaven or hell, no thought of survival after death. People for whom mere survival in life is about as much as they can handle.People of whom John Cougar Mellencamp sang, ""Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.""As it turns out, the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"" are creatures of habit.

Suitable for a Lazy Afternoon,"""28 Days Later"" is still my favorite British zombie movie. I know that ""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't quite the same product so it's an unfair comparison, but I thought that would be a good opening line.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is an unambitious young man with dreams that don't extend beyond visiting Winchester, his local pub. He has a loafing, leeching, loser best friend named Ed (Nick Frost) and a girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) who's just about done with him. He was living his life on a mundane loop until the zombie apocalypse happened. That became his time to take action and take charge even if it wasn't something he intended.SOTD was humorous and mildly entertaining.

"Great concept, subtle twists, a bit drawn out at times, but a classic, for sure","Shaun of the Dead (2004)Clearly ridiculous, and clearly funny. For some it doesn't get much more comic and hilarious, both exaggerated and subtle (actually). By luck (good or bad) I have seen several British movies with the same comic team (the same actors, namely Simon Pegg, but also some background people like director Edgar Wright) and there are more similarities in the plots and funny moments than you might expect. Which means fewer ""original"" laughs.The main culprit is ""The World's End,"" which is also a good time, but there is the pub at the center of things, and the zombie/androids in both, and a feeling of friends helping friends fight the evils. It's funny once, but be careful twice. (Or, I'm sure, if you think one movie is stellar, you'll possibly love the other.) These two, and another called ""Hot Fuzz"" which I haven't seen, are officially a ""trilogy"" and so are naturally overlapping. Such is success.This is the classic, and the first, and has its own reputation that goes beyond just another zombie movie. (See also ""Zombieland"" from 2009 which I liked even more, also a spoof.) The funniest aspect of ""Shaun"" is the sense of not noticing the zombies, then the kind of normal approach to having a zombie in your yard, or in your house or car. Or finding that your best friend, or mum, is a zombie. Etc. It brings it away from the horror film genre almost completely. Even when there is chaos and near annihilation, there is also a feeling of hilarity. There is always a ray of hope. And there is love, sort of, that constant rescuer in films of all flavors.The zombies are terrific—they stay to what I think of as the necessary Romero styled zombie style, with the rules of walking and acting a certain way (unlike ""World War Z"" which was hyped up in that sense). If you worry about zombies entering your world, and want to know what to do, see this one and see of course the very original from the current era, the archetypal ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which as some quality of perfection that can't be ignored. Here of course it makes fun but it does so in a way that says it's all for real, too.See it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Excellent-One Of The Funniest Films I've Ever Seen,"I watched it again last night. It must be one of the funniest films ever made. The partnership between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is great. And really helped Nick Frost with his career. I was also great to see all the famous faces pop up even if it was for a few brief seconds. Dylan Moran brought back his style of acting which he had mastered down to a tee, quite similar to his Black Books character to be honest. A congratulations must go to the casting director as all who were in it were excellent. And also congratulations to them for choosing Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis because not only are they funny and great actors, but they are also hot. Congratulations again and may more movies follow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Beautifully done,"I really didn't want to hype myself up at how good this film might be before I watched it, because whenever I have done so in the past, they've all turned out to be dire. But this film was brilliant. No two ways about it. The simple reason behind its success in knowledge. From the comedy stable of Pegg and Wright of S P A C E D fame, these two have always made it clear that they have a passion for classic Zombie films, so getting the chance to create their own must have seemed like music to their ears. The result is a classic - simple plot (in as far as the zombies and their disposal), but also a deep soup, into which the viewer can wade about in: the film plays like a Wheres Wally of extra stuff; some of which you don't realise until to hear the commentary! - It really is a top filum, and all because the writers had the knowledge and the passion for what they were making.

This is supposed to be hilarious.,"This is such a forgettable little film that I forgot I ever even saw it until I read the movie's title on IMDb's ""top 250"". So why is this watchable but unfunny comedy/horror movie there? There are several explanations for this strange occurrence.1) The usual explanation: that most movie-goers have zero taste. 2) A bunch of Brits gave it high marks for patriotic reasons. 3) There was a computer or human error in averaging the votes/ratings.The gags are cheap/obvious/predictable, the movie's comedy consisting mainly of a bunch of average actors clowning around. If this movie is supposed to represent the ""British revival"", I don't want to know what would represent its downfall. A far cry from Pegg's later comedies.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Hilarious. And I don't care if it lowers your opinion of me,"Shaun of the Dead is hilarious stuff. From the onset we are in a world of self-obsessed pithy London twenty-something brats who are too pithy and self-obsessed to know that a Zombie Holocaust is taking place just outside their doors. And even when they finally do realize the situation, their pettiness, personal conflicts and jealousies refuse to give ground. They are who they are until their respective ends.Written by star Simon Pegg, directed by Edgar Wright, the film's tone is precisely right. Never so horrific that we fail to laugh, but never so far from horrific that from time to time we are not .... horrified. Even scared. Add smaller roles by the always excellent Bill Nighby and Penelope Wilton and a standout performance by Max Frost as Shaun's best buddy Ed, and you've got yourself a cult classic. And yes, I know this is high praise. And yes I know the meanings of 'cult' and 'classic'. Yes I do know 'Rocky Horror. I saw 'Harold and Maude'. Many times. ""Reefer Madness'? That too.One last note: On IMDB the possibility exists that a viewer or two might inquire into the system to read my opinion of all those films I've reviewed. And my raves for 'Shaun', and its rating of '10' might - to them - cause me to appear 'suspect'. Childish. One whose opinion should and must be overlooked. Not likely, I'll admit. But possible.

Too much jokes for a zombie film,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a quite hilarious British bloody comedy that is successfully making fun of Romero's zombie film in an appropriate manner. The script undeniably delivers few laughs which is the purpose of the film and duo Simon Pegg-Nick Frost are fit to make that happen. Unfortunately the movie falls short with non-serious issue and idiotic character. Everything in this movie is only for jokes, nothing more than that, even they solved the ending also with illogical jokes. Shaun character is like an unnecessary hero that drag all his relatives into zombies invasion while Ed character is too dumb and sometimes annoying. Overall, Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" makes a zombie film less painful than ever with some smart and funny lines. But strangely the movie troubled with the joke itself, it's too non-serious for a zombie film even for a parody and some jokes aren't placed in a right time that makes it still few steps behind ""Zombieland"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Never taken a short-cut before?,"Shaun is a loser. Of that there is no doubt. He shares a North London house with Pete, an uptight professional, and a total slob called Ed. Ed is his best mate from school and Shaun feels very protective of him. Shaun works as a sort of team leader in a branch of an Electrical shop where he suffers the daily tedium we have all felt when you work in a job you don't really like. His girlfriend, Liz, is dragged along by him every night the The Winchester, his local pub. As Shaun always brings Ed along, ""Ed doesn't have many friends"", so Liz brings along her flat mates, David and Dianne. After being dumped by Liz (For forgetting to book a restaurant and for trying to give her flowers destined for his mum), Shaun and Ed proceed to get massively drunk in the Winchester and head home to play loud music (annoying Pete in the process). However, the next morning and with huge hangovers, Shaun and Ed begin, very slowly, to realise that this is not a normal Sunday. It doesn't matter if you dislike horror films, romantic comedies or if you aren't a fan of British humour. This film will raise a chuckle at least, and have you roaring with laughter at best. George A Romero is a fan, as is Quentin Tarrantino. High praise indeed. My favourite moment? Well there are so many to choose from so I have to narrow it down to three. 1) Shaun's Sunday visit to the local shop where he fails to notice Zombie Nelson at the back of the shop, the bloody hand print on the drinks chiller and what it was on the floor which he slipped in. 2)In the lounge after their battle with the two Zombies in the back garden, where they are deciding on the best course of action; Ed: ""So what are we gonna do now?"" Shaun:""Have a sit down?"" 3) When they are in the garden next to the Winchester, Shaun checks that the coast is clear by climbing up the steps of a child's slide. Superb comic timing! Shaun:""I'm just going to check that the coast is clear"" (Climbs up few steps leaving us just with a shot of his legs and shoes on the rungs, pause for a few seconds, climbs back down into shot) Liz: ""Well, is it clear?"" Shaun:""No."" David:""So how many are there?"" Shaun: (Sounding like he's going to cry)""Lots.""Great film, I urge you to watch it!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

One of the best movies ever!,"Back in the day Fangoria sent me and my friends to an advance screening of this in NYC.

We laughed, screamed and cried and when the lights came up to out delight a handsome Simon Pegg and Nick Frost greeted us when we were leaving and signed some posters. They were truly the nicest guys and the movie still holds up perfectly. It's so funny and witty with great makeup and truly amazing performances.

A film that defies genres and exemplifies comic genius.,"After stumbling upon this film on HBO one night at home, I have become an instant Simon Pegg fanatic. His and Edgard Wright's brilliantly creative and comedic styles really stand out in every aspect of 'Shaun of the Dead'. It's very rare for me to discuss this picture without gushing about its genius. This is a film that can be watched over and over again, and each time you'll notice a new, subtle, yet stunningly clever detail that you missed the last time. The swift pace is consistent throughout the entire film and there's never a dull moment.The delightfully engaging cast of characters is brilliantly portrayed by an assemblage of marvelously talented young actors, along with veterans Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton (who plays Shaun's adorable mum, Barbara).One of my favorite characteristics of the film is the parallelism between the first segment of the film leading up to the zombie invasion, and the second segment during the crisis itself. It's difficult to explain without revealing too much about the film, so watch it first and see if you can point it out on your own. The idiosyncrasy that sets this apart from any other picture I've seen is that while the comedy aspect of it really is hysterical, the zombies themselves stay true to the horror genre.'Shaun of the Dead' is destined to become a cult hit and I look forward to enjoying future works from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"""You've got red on you.""","FILM: 8.0
My re-watch of Shaun of the Dead was an absolute blast. Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg are like a dynamic duo, and their collaboration only gets better with time. Adding Nick Frost to the mix from their series Spaced was a stroke of genius, and their chemistry is off the charts.Wright's knack for capturing snappy banter and Pegg's talent for sharp writing make every scene crackle with energy. In 2004, when zombie flicks were all the rage, Shaun of the Dead stood out by blending laugh-out-loud comedy with heartfelt drama and just the right amount of gore.It's irreverent, it's grotesque, and it's hilariously funny. Pegg and Frost make the perfect duo, with Pegg's lovable but somewhat clueless Shaun playing off Frost's obnoxious and lazy Ed to perfection. And they're backed up by a stellar cast of British talent.What I love most about Shaun of the Dead is how it manages to be more than just a comedy. Wright cleverly uses the horror genre to parody tropes while also holding up a mirror to modern society's quirks and flaws. Plus, it's got its fair share of fart jokes, because why not?Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a rollicking good time that never fails to entertain. It's a perfect blend of laughs, scares, and social commentary, and it's just as enjoyable now as it was when it first hit the screens. If you're in the mood for some zombie mayhem with a side of British wit, look no further than this comedy classic.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

"Amusing, not classic","This is a zombie film spoof, and there have been plenty of those before, but this one is a bit different. It's different in the sense that it's not quite as ""goofy"" as others (like the notable ""Evil Dead"" series and Peter Jackson's excellent ""Dead Alive""), this one is played with a pretty dry sense of humor. Shaun is a pretty regular guy who is supposed to lead this whole group of people to safety in the face of a zombie invasion. There are some funny gags; I especially liked when Shaun left his house and walked to his car, not even noticing the zombies (""sorry, no change""). The plot involving several girlfriends works well enough to propel the story, though it isn't really explained why all these other people join him in his strange quest to get to the local pub as if that represents safety and security (Shaun resembles Homer Simpson in this respect).I think this one will be remembered by a small group that loves it, but for most people this will pass in one ear and out the other.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Absolutely hilarious,"Shaun of the dead is a must see film, it's hilarious, Shaun and Ed (his fat friend) are very well played, the story/adventure is brilliant and it is never boring.

Shaun of the Dead,"This great comedy, amusingly described by the poster as ""a romantic comedy. With zombies"", comes courtesy of the crew who also gave us the excellent TV series Spaced. To be honest, the film can feel like a TV episode that has been stretched out, and this would probably be a problem if the film wasn't so damned funny! It may be low-budget, but this is a film which is to be watched for the gags, almost as if the zombies were mere coincidence in the story.With the simple premise that Shaun is a loser who is virtually a zombie stumbling through his life and who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, suddenly finds himself the only one capable of saving his (few) friends when zombies take over. There's a fantastic scene where Shaun is walking to the local shop and back, whilst in the background you see the zombies taking over, all the while without Shaun noticing. It's simple, yet remarkably effective. The story is all in the writing, and it certainly shows. Shaun's first reaction to seeing a zombie is priceless (""Oh my god she's so drunk!""), and his best friend Ed (Nick Frost) is definitely worth a mention as the only person who is more of a loser in life than Shaun.The film does begin to stall whenever they attempt a ""serious"" bit, but the jokes are flowing like the beer in the Winchester Pub they are trying to reach. It's not a particularly gory film, only in one scene towards the end does it get a bit bloody, but the film succeeds so well because it proves that it doesn't have to be gory to get attention. This one is definitely worth a few viewings  you will not be disappointed.Rated: 8.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun of the Dead,"Shaun of the Dead was, in mostly every way, perfect. It was hilarious, it was creepy, at times frightening, and the jokes never got old. Shaun, (Simon Pegg), is a 29-year-old electronic store manager who must deal most nights with a problem: spending a good night with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) without having his best friend and flatmate (Nick Frost, in an awesome role) there all the time. The result is they are always having a night at the local pub, the Winchester. Ed loves it there, Liz hates it, and Shaun is stuck in the middle. This sets up a roller coaster ride of insanely funny accurances as well as some minor, scary jump scenes. The performances in general are good (especially Pegg who is always on the spot with his great comedic abilities), the writing is well crafted, and the director is well done.

Abbott & Costello meet Romero & Jackson  Cult Classic in the making.,"SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2Horror and comedy have been going hand-in-hand ever since Abbott & Costello met Frankenstein over 50 years ago and this latest installment of the you've-got-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter genre splicing from the Brits is a laugh riot shockfest the likes not seen since George A.Romero's 'Living Dead' films and the early splatter fests of Peter Jackson.Set in a rural London burg of overcast skies and proletariat listlessness the film begins with our unlikely hero and slayer of zombies in the pasty skinned form of Shaun (Pegg who resembles Mike White, Jack Black's roomie in 'School of Rock'), an electronics store clerk who seems stunted at the age of 29 going on 13, or so his out-of-his-league pretty girlfriend Liz (the fetching Ashfield) feels as she confronts him one night in his fave pub hangout The Winchester. Liz's long-suffering has come to a head and more-or-less expects some drastic changes if Shaun is to be part of her life, namely his pot-smoking lifelong chum and flatmate Ed (Frost who resembles fellow countryman Mark Addy of 'The Full Monty') whose only talent seems to be video games and taking up space. On hand for this revelation is Liz's pals Dianne and David (Davis and Moran, respectively her girlfriend and her unbeknownst would-be lover), a couple of acquaintance, who provide some moral support for the put-upon Liz.Cut to Shaun's next morning ritual of sleep-walking thru his daily trek to his dead-end job making his rounds to the local bodega and taking in the equally dank and depressive working-class enclave. Unknowingly in the background are some tell-tale signs that something is amiss in the form of an unsettling plague suddenly overtaking the country with out-of-focus TVs in the background showing scattershot footage ofwell you knowShaun forgets to make dinner reservations for Liz and himself and winds up on the skids with his lady love. Depressed he and Ed go to their watering hole for some soul searching and youth rekindling as they get pissed and rap to 'Whitelines' (in one of several truly funny sequences) as they head home.The next morning Shaun goes thru his gimlet-eyed routine but there is definitely something wrong and what's so dead-on (puns more to come!) is director Wright (who makes a fine big-screen debut from a career in BBC TV programmes and co-wrote the scabrous ingenious screenplay with Pegg) accurately showing just how brain-dead life can be in the numbing daily constitutionals we take for granted replacing the monotony with monstrosity as a horde of zombies from some unknown viral infection spreads quickly as Shaun and his friends soon realize it's the end of the world as they know it!Sprinkled with liberal amounts of humor  both scatological and witty in-the-know as well as slapstick  with horror (good amount of biting and one  of many  homage scenes to Romero involving a truly nasty buh-bye a la 'Dawn of the Dead') but not exactly wall-to-wall viscera (although the blood is by the buckets) but shares in spirit more closer to Jackson's 'DeadAlive' with its gonzo-style mix of murder and mayhem and a few echoes of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' Ash character and even Mike Leigh's too-true working stiffs of his oeuvre and Richard Curtis' smart veddy proper British romantic comedies a la 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.Simon and Frost make a fine comic duo of not-so-dumb and dumber in their bonking on the beans of the undead as well as fine able ensemble including the pretty Ashfield as the slightly-believable gal pal (come on Shaun you're one lucky slag!) and Nighy , late of 'Love Actually', as his stepfather who endures some painful confessions.The collaborators all have had some significant success across the pond and clearly have the chops in this valentine to the previously mentioned genres (Shaun's blithering mum is named Barbara a nod to Romero's heroine in 'Night of the Living Dead').The film is riotously funny with sharp editing (lots of montages of items being quick-pan slapped about purpose) and a few startles prior to the onslaught that totally sets the mood of this cheeky and scary horror comedy with a surprisingly sweet chewy center.

They are quite hilarious. Comedy is good, but it's not something you'll laugh out loud at.

"I liked it, but unfortunately after a second viewing it would still be filed under 'O' for overrated","Shaun is a late 20 something male who takes his girlfriend Liz for granted and seems more content with his care-free lifestyle and odd bromance with his loser friend Ed. However, things come to a head when Ed and Shaun bear witness to a zombie apocalypse and become the most unlikely of anti-heroes...It has been a number of years since I watched Shaun Of The Dead, but I did hope that the passage of time would make me more receptive to the film (given I now have more of a flavour and understanding of Edgar Wright's sense of humour), but alas it didn't improve for me, but the good news is that I enjoyed Shaun of the dead the first time round and still enjoyed it after a second viewing...I personally feel that the beginning of the film is where it is at its strongest; the development of Shaun, Ed, Liz and some of the minor players is carefully handled and well-constructed (and I have to admit by the halfway point it was starting to get to the point where I did start to care for the characters), but oddly enough for me this careful character-building came to an end in the first half and, perhaps unintentionally, the film comes to something of a dead end. There are moments of humour in the final third, but in reality, the only moment in this entire section which made me laugh was the Queen 'Don't stop me now' montage which thankfully did, at least, take up a decent amount of time.It also has to be said that the early stages of Shaun wandering round the streets completely oblivious to the apocalypse is something that is a wonderfully British observation (man or woman being so completely absorbed in their own world that they fail to see the bigger picture developing around them). This is perhaps more prescient in today's day and age (with the youth being dependent on their mobile phones and social media, but this film perhaps gave an insight into this sub-culture before it became a bigger problem.)I did like the way Shaun became the unlikely hero towards the end and the idea of a group of Brits flocking towards a pub in order to gain some kind of refuge is a mainstay of British society which the film does cleverly poke fun at.I enjoyed Shaun of the dead, but like a lot of Wright's later films it's a little too niche and the jokes probably won't resonate with a larger audience. As for me, I enjoyed it, but on the same note I'm not blind to some of its failings either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Surprisingly, it's actually a bit scarier than your average modern zombie film because it takes the time to develop its characters and make you feel for them. The screenplay is actually human and smart instead of just being a loosely connected series of gore scenes. Zombie films are, and have been for over 25 years now, for the most part simply meaningless gore scenes attached to each other. Remember when Romero was out making films that genuinely horrified you? Remember how terrifying even the dated ""Night of the Living Dead"" still is, and how its sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a wonderful, edgy satire with some truly horrific moments? Sadly, those movies just aren't around any more. With the exception of a couple of gems like ""28 Days Later"", zombie movies are now nothing more than extremely violent action films with a slightly supernatural feel.It's a simple movie really, Pegg's character Shaun has lost his girlfriend and realizes that his life is going the wrong way so he vows to get his girlfriend back. Unfortunately the day he does this is the day when London becomes 'populated' by the living dead, but Shaun soldiers on regardless armed with only a cricket bat, attempting to save his family and friends. The film doesn't work as well for someone who is unfamiliar with the sort of film that ""Shaun"" is simultaneously making fun of and paying tribute to because it is after all a fan film, jam-packed with references to other films both in the script and visuals (the zooming and quick cutting is directly taken from Raimi's latter two Evil Dead movies). It helps if the viewer is familiar with those films.At times during ""Shaun of the Dead"" one forgets they're watching a comedy and feels genuine horror and sadness. There are only two or three extremely violent scenes, but the sense of dread, particularly when combined with the generally fun mood of the film, is effective, and when major characters die, you actually do feel a bit sorry for them, which is a lot more than I can say about most zombie movies that have been made recently. The script doesn't focus on making fun of the zombie genre, or more specifically ""Dawn of the Dead"", instead opting to create both an effective satire on the zombie genre AND on our society, much like ""Dawn of the Dead"" did in 1978. Of course, ""Shaun"" is a lot funnier and much less gruesome than that film, but they are so similar in the sense that they were more about people and society than about zombies. Zombies themselves are hardly the most intriguing creatures, they're dumb and slow and really not all that menacing, they lack the creepy sophisticated cruelty of vampires or the pure cruelty of regular human villains.Edgar Wright's direction is superb, and the scene with the zombie in the pub involving Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' is both an excellent bit of comedy and an involving piece of cinema- well-staged, well-shot, and well-acted. The last half hour of the film is less light-hearted and more serious than the rest of the film and includes some genuinely dramatic moments. It is not my intention to make ""Shaun of the Dead"" sound less funny than it is, but it is absolutely, unequivocally necessary to point out that this is hardly just a random spoof of the zombie genre, it does mock the genre in areas, but it is more of a loving tribute to the genre films of past than a heartless spoof of them, which makes it in a sense similar to ""Young Frankenstein"". ""Shaun"" is also a brilliant satire on society, much like the best of zombie films. Actually, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is truly one of the greatest zombie films ever made and an instant classic.8/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Not that good, to be honest","Shaun of the Dead has a big problem. The writers love their horror films. Sadly, they love their horror films just a bit too much and spend most of it ripping ideas and scenes from flicks such as Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and dropping in references to other characters and pictures. As a result, you end up with a VERY British hotpot of something 20% original, 80% remake.The premise is good, the acting is pretty decent and locations and sets are spot on, but when everyone is called Ash and shops are called Landis and posters on the walls are Japanese flicks, you begin to grow tired of the cleverness of it all. Throw in a few ""SPACED"" in-jokes for good measure and you have one of the most geeky monster films ever made.The good news is, if you grow tired of spot the film reference, you can always play spot the comedian/rock star not-very-funny cameo game instead.I picked up the DVD of this expecting more. Instead I got in lesson in how to make 15-year-old boys laugh (Using the c-word in the first five minutes should have set the alarm bells ringing).It's okay if your drunk and eating a pizza but there are better movies around.

A Low Budget Cult Film That Inspired a Lot,"Shaun of the Dead is a very important piece of cinema due to its impact on satire, comedy and zombies cannot be understated. It uses its low budget setting as the basis for the comedic jokes inside the film, with the pub, our protagonist's girlfriend's house and his own house as the basis for the film. The reason this film has aged so well is because it was arguably the first true Zombie satire film that was still horrifyingly gorey and hilarious. The things that Shaun of the Dead inspired cannot be understated Shaun of the Dead was a revolution for the zombie genre. Moving on from that Edgar Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy became a cult classic which didn't do so well at the box office but literally everyone has seen later the trilogy is definitely worth buying on Blu-Ray. The pub scene finale and the actual ending subverted my expectations with a plot twist nobody saw coming. I don't drink but the alcoholic parts were hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Horror-Comedy Bliss,"Sometimes a director's style can overtake the story so much that the film suffers for it, and that was the case with the more recent The World's End, in my opinion. But Shaun of the Dead is just too dang fun and filled with cliché bending humor that Wright's style proves to be the best thing about this Horror-Comedy.The first of the Cornetto or ""Three Flavor's"" trilogy focuses on a world in the midst of a zombie outbreak, and two loser friends who don't really do anything with their lives. Buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play the duo, and brilliantly so. I much preferred their bro-mance to the romance between Pegg and Kate Ashfield, who plays his girlfriend Liz.The enjoyment here is clearly with the fact that if a zombie outbreak ever did happen, I would act exactly how these characters did. I don't watch the news and rarely care to people watch when running to the store, so I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't realize there was a Zombie-apocalypse going on either. Or even the gag where Pegg struggles to shoot a shotgun. These are all real-life scenarios put into a horror film, and thus the comedy works better than expected.It doesn't feature an Oscar winning script or world class actors, but it is loads of fun with a kicka** soundtrack paired with amazingly timed physical gags.

Easy adolescent wink-wink frat-fart jokes and situations are so abundant in this film, it's just sad to see that people still laugh at that z-grade sitcom crap...The pacing is ridiculous such as the zombies'. They attack whenever the characters have finally completed their lines, and other zombie rules are simply overlooked for the sake of the script's advancement.Imbecile characters for an imbecile audience.

More than the expected,"The movie does a great job of balancing humour with a respectable zombie plot, and its cast of people isn't just there to make you laugh-there are many moving moments intercut throughout. The script deals with themes of friendship, family, and love as well as ageing and taking on responsibilities. This movie accomplishes a similar job to the TV show Spaced at balancing the ridiculous with the serious. Comparing it to a ""big screen Spaced"" episode is simple, but it doesn't adequately promote the movie. It is much more than that, and it is the ideal tribute to both societal satire and zombie films. See how the majority of the populace may be mistaken for zombies in the early parts of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
will go down in British history,"Shaun of the Dead is one of those movies that you will find funny even after multiple viewings. It's packed full of laughs that just keep on coming. Simon Pegg turns in a fantastic performance along with other well known British that appear alongside him. If you look closely there are other famous Brits in small cameo roles such as Matt Lucas (little Britain) and Tamzin Greig (Green Wing). The movie has a brief run time of just 93mins which makes it pass surprisingly quickly. Although this film makes for great viewing it's not for the faint hearted as the gore can sometimes be...well...very gory.

Not Bad...,"SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a decent movie with some comedy and horror elements, but personally I feel that this film is pretty over-rated.

Ed is his slovenly ""partner-in-crime"", and when the town becomes over-run by zombies, Shaun scoops up his girlfriend Liz, and they all head to the bar (!) to ""hole-up"" and defend themselves.Definitely some good humorous scenes, but very lacking in the gore department. After all the hype this film received I have to honestly say I was kinda disappointed. A pretty fun and funny horror/comedy, but I'll stick with Peter Jackson's far superior BRAINDEAD. Anyone who has seen SHAUN but not BRAINDEAD should definitely check the latter out. Far more hilarious and tons more gore. A generous 7/10 for SHAUN",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

One amongst the better Zombie Comedies,"""Bash em in the head...that seems to work out""""Shaun of the Dead"" is fun, it is quirky but at the same time, it has surprisingly got some emotional baggage carved deep inside its narrative, the same can be observed in the third act as the screenplay becomes quite intense there, especially in those climactic segments. I'm in no way an expert in this field nor had I witnessed a significant amount of Zombie comedies to come to a fair judgement over here, yet from whatever little knowledge, the limited experience I have accumulated so far, I can safely tell, that this should sit amongst the very best this genre has had in its offerings up until now.Without a doubt, it's one of those rare instances when a movie was equally appreciated from a professional critic's standpoint as well as from an ordinary viewer's perspective! Even though my statements on the film may not sound as pleasant as the others did; yet, I do wanna confess that despite having some scepticism and disagreements with the script and about how this execution had gone into effect, I still somehow managed to have a pretty good time in here.Now I would be blatantly lying If I say this was one of the finest comedies I have ever laid my eyes on, no that is not the case. However, I did appreciate whatever little time I had with it. The humour works fine and I also took a liking to everyone's performances. Even though it's the bromance between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost that kept me entertained more than anything else! Every time these two were in the frame, they were more than able to put a smile on my face; and God knows how much I needed that today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Shaun of the Dead in Review,"Of all the many horror film subjects, zombies are arguably the most popular. These resurrected, flesh-eating, stiff-limbed, groaning fiends who stalk the earth in search of living bodies to devour are constantly captivating viewing audiences, and haunting the dreams of the more impressionable. Zombie films range from the deadly serious and scary, such as Dawn of the Dead, to classics such as Night of the Living Dead, to series films like Zombie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Some series regarding the walking dead begin seriously, but quickly degenerate into ridiculous parody. Such was the case with the Evil Dead trilogy, a cult classic loved for its outlandish last installation. These parodies are the inspiration for other parodies, the latest of these hailing from the UK. Shaun of the Dead, directed by Edgar Wright, and obviously playing off the similarly-titled Dawn of the Dead, is a completely hilarious zombie parody, replete with dry British humor and flesh-eating fests.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

As the years pass the majority of zombie flicks become unwatchable and fade drastically. SOTD will always be a classic and is just as good today as it was during its year of release.

A Funny Romantic Comedy,"Listen I know how it is. Sometimes when you go out to the movies you wanna laugh. Sometimes you wanna watch two nice people fall in love, and if you're like me you wanna watch zombies rip people apart. But sometimes when you go to the movies don't you just long to see a romantic comedy in which Zombies rip people apart? Fear not reader, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is the film for you.SHAUN OF THE DEAD follows our hero Shaun (Simon Pegg, 24 Hour Party People) on journey to win back his girl Liz (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office), make amends with his Mom (Nicola Cunningham), and to fight off a small London Suburb of Zombies. Shaun enlists the help of his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost, TV's SPACED), and Dianne (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office) and David (Dylan Moran, Notting Hill) Liz's two best friends, who don't seem to like Shaun Very Much, but they follow him anyway cause Liz follows Shaun. It's all very complicated but once you let the characters take hold, this film is a trip.Director Edgar Wright (TV's Spaced) has crafted a silly and yet surprisingly rich film. Full of characters worth rooting for, gore that harkens back to a simpler time when it was okay to disembowel in horror flicks, and conflicts that enlighten our characters with humanity. It's a film about how mundane and Zombie-like our lives are, and about our search for that hero inside. But more importantly the film is about being funny. Laugh out loud, gutt-busting, funny.Pegg's Shaun hits the right chords as a guy who wants more out of his life, but is drawn back into his slacker existence because he doesn't know any better. He's every Tom, Dick, and Harry who looks at themselves 10 years after graduating from college and wondering, 'how did I get here?' That's easy he's been sticking up for a buddy who has as much drive as a broken down Ford Pinto and that's what makes him a great hero, he's empathetic to a fault.But most are probably wondering what about the Zombies. SHAUN OF THE DEAD works because the screenplay loves the material. As screenwriter's as well,Pegg and Wright don't allow the material to become mean spirited. They love the Zombie movie. I'll bet they sat up many late nights watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD over and over. There's even a small wink at 28 DAYS LATER won't fall on deaf ears. They know the material well and walk the thin line between spoof and homage, to a nice degree.The best scene in the film concerns one characters death, by being bitten by a Zombie. Nobody wants to shoot that character (who will eventually become one of the undead) and they're torn on both sides. A showdown of broken bottles and a corkscrew, tests the characters will, and in the end brings them closer together. The scene works because there is real tension. Although this is a comedy, these characters are in peril. It was exhilarating.The film's only major flaw is that it takes far too long to get started. The first twenty minutes drag on like they were being paid by the minute. The laughs at the beginning seemed to be forced and if I'd left before the Zombies begin to show up I might have panned the movie as boring. But once the Zombies show up the film comes to life with really good laughs, and even a few good scares chucked in for measure. SHAUN OF THE DEAD would have done well to have had the early moments of the film re-imagined or shaved a little. But I'll forgive the film this one small flaw. I really liked it.At the end of the day though the most surprising thing about SHAUN OF THE DEAD is what its not. It's not a Horror film. It's a Romantic Comedy, turned on its head and it works almost flawlessly. In fact my wife called it 'FORCES OF NATURE with Zombies (instead of weather).' I don't know if I'd go that far but I will agree that there is a little romance for the lady in your life.If you're looking for something a little different, if you're looking for a silly movie with heart, or you like to watch people get ripped apart limb from limb. SHAUN OF THE DEAD does not disappoint, I promise you'll like it.****1/2 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

However, Frost's character (Ed) can be extremely unlikable despite adding humour. It can be hard to understand why Shaun let's him ruin his life, but adds to Pegg's character once he stands up to him.The makeup and effects are very timeless and will probably never age.

"""Don't Stop Me Now!""","Shaun Of The Dead (2004) -This was actually far funnier than I remembered. I found it really pathetic when I first watched it and I just didn't like the humour, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy it at all this second time, but the jokes seemed to hit differently this time.Maybe Zombies held more interest for me since watching 'The Walking Dead' (2010-22), or maybe I was just in a strange mood when I first watched it?It wasn't what I would call laugh a minute, although I definitely had a few laugh out loud moments, but it was just one of those to smile at, as the silly background elements amused me. It wasn't a film I could watch whilst playing on my phone, because I would have missed so many of the funny bits put in for observant viewers. And they really did put a lot of thought in to the throwaway comedy of the supporting artists, as Shaun and Ed tried desperately to get safely to The Winchester pub.I think that a large part of the point of this film was that it was hard to tell the zombies from everybody else. It was easy to feel that they were calling us all out for becoming a little bit mindless sometimes. Zombie slaves to our devices, consoles and goggleboxes.I liked Simon Pegg in this one, but I'm just not sure I could get along with Nick Frost. I think that he might have been what annoyed me about the film the first time around. For me, he played such a deeply unlikeable character and I struggled to separate that from the actor.Rafe Spall however, my God he had a glow up didn't he? I nearly didn't recognise him. It was actually interesting to see all of the people that featured in a smaller role that have since gone on to be huge stars in their own right. It's a veritable spot the star, which I'm sure could be made in to a drinking game.I wish that I had watched it again sooner in order to see that I was just in a bad mood the first time and how much fun it really was.

A zombie comedy of hilarious proportions.,"Shaun Of The Dead (2004) :
Brief Review -A zombie comedy of hilarious proportions. Night of the Living Dead (1968) made people restless by showing proper footage of zombies back in the late 1960s. People were familiar with the idea due to a couple of iconic sci-fi horror films from the 50s, but seeing zombies like this must have been a spine-chilling experience in the 60s. Who would have thought that this scary genre could have been turned into a hilarious comedy? The chances were obviously there since cult horror characters like Frankenstein and Wolf Man had been used for parodies and horror comedies. Shaun of the Dead would have made those Dead of the Night zombies laugh (if they were alive in 2004). This film is like your 90s buddy comedy with campus-driven characters and youth-driven dialogues, until the zombies enter the game. They enter from the beginning, but the takeover only happens after the first 30 minutes are over. Despite the danger, the two buddies aren't really serious about it, and as expected, only the hero and close ones are safe (until he meets them). Things get predictable afterwards, and we see the hero losing his parents and friends one by one, but the cliche of ""love"" or ""heroine"" still lies there-all dead, I guess. That conversation over love triangle, jealousy, and reconciliation was pointless since the situation demanded more serious scenes than this love and hate crap. Yet, we have some surprises in the end, and they are totally hilarious. Shaun of the Dead is unapologetically funny and cross about making fun of everything it sees, except the hero and heroine. I would have loved to see the hero shooting the heroine dead (since she had dumped him) and then him getting a new girl. That would have been a really cool move, I guess. Nevertheless, a solid entertainer.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Better Movie After a Few Years Off,"Pay attention to how things are before the zombies, and it then makes perfect sense that they react so calmly.

a pub and an end of the world,"How many times have you said 'It's not the end of the world!' lately? Next time you do, be careful, because there might even be a version of the end of the world happening beyond the walls of the room you're in. This is what happens to the characters in the British film 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004), directed by Edgar Wright and written by him together with Simon Pegg, who also plays the main role in the film. It's a slapstick comedy, - which is the only formula in which I could stand a movie with zombies -, a parody and homage to 'classic' films of a genre that is far from my comfort zone. Still, I enjoyed and thoroughly enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead', which was just the right movie for my Halloween night.Five young Londoners are the heroes of this film. Shaun and Liz are a couple, but Liz seems to have had enough of the lack of ambition and intellectual mediocrity of Shaun, who doesn't know better than to spend every night at 'The Winchester' pub, named after the shotgun hanging above the bar. Dianne and David, a somewhat more 'normative' couple and Liz's roommates encourage her to break up. To top it off, Shaun's roommate Ed is a goofball incapable of anything other than making bad jokes, playing video games, and lounging on a couch. A kind of end of the world is happening in London, but these TV sitcom-like heroes notice nothing for a couple of days being too absorbed in their own conflicts, and not realizing that the behavior of those around them it's a different degree of zombification than usual. When people begin to be devoured, their only escape plan is to take refuge in the pub that is the center of their Universe. The Winchester rifle will also play a role.The themes of the pub as a fundamental institution for his heroes and that of the end of the world will be explored by film director Edgar Wright together with his accomplice, the actor Simon Pegg, and in a film made almost a decade later - 'The World's End'. The success has several reasons. First of all, the characters in the film are real and familiar. Real and familiar, not necessarily like our neighbors, but certainly like TV sitcom heroes. Each character is well-defined, the pace of the story and the jokes flow freely and there are almost no dead lines in the film. The horror side is treated with humor and an indifference to political correctness that makes any excess acceptable. Even the creatures called zombies are filmed in such a way that they become flags in the comedy slalom and not obstacles to entertainment. The confusion between their world and the 'real' one is a nice social commentary. I saw 'Shaun of the Dead' on Halloween night, but I bear witness that it's a delicious movie any day of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Destined to become a cult movie.,"Yes, it was refreshing to see a non-Hollywood movie. Particularly as this one doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. I admit to having my doubts, especially when I heard that FilmFour was involved. In the past I've either hated or loved films that they've had a hand in, wioth no middle ground. And, on balance, I tend to hate them more than I like them.However, in SOTD's case I loved it. I can imagine that some of the humour will go over the heads of non-Brits, as the comedy in SOTD is very British. However, that doesn't stop it from being a fun movie throughout.It was also nice to see the affectionate homages to classic zombie films of the past, such as Day of the Dead et al. There were probably more little nods at the genre than I noticed but the two ones that stood out to me were the entrail-ripping scene and, right at the end as the credits roll, the music playing is the music from Dawn of the Dead (original) as the zombies enter the mall and go shopping.As I note in the header, this one is almost assured of becoming a cult movie. It has all the right elements and none of the wrong ones. Watch it and see what you think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Nothing bad!,"""Shaun of the dead"" is a great comedy-zombies movie, also being a great start to the ""Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy"" and here we can also see how great is Edgar Wright at directing, and also here he defines his style. Like for example, in the scene where they beat a zombie in the bar, that follows the beat of Queen's ""Don't stop me now"" and that is funny, since they beat the zombie to the beat of the song. It's a great zombie movie, great to see it in a weekend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
An original and thoroughly amusing take at horror parodies,"At a time when idiotic, unfunny, and offensive horror movie spoofs à la Scary Movie were in prime bloom, who would have expected a genuinely amusing parody to come along? Well, probably nobody, and even less so in the case of it making fun of the zombie sub-genre. Against all odds however, the hilariously talented British comedy trio Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost took a try and did exactly that with the applaudably original Shaun of the Dead.One reason for that is the gory fun refusing to be a stereotypical cinematic spoof and zeroing in on an at least mostly viable plot, a storytelling trajectory with an actual start and finish, and a realistic and relatable protagonist. Yet, the less positive side of these three arguments also includes that there are a couple of instances of over the top weirdness, spontaneous digressions in the central part, and clichéd supporting roles providing for nothing but laughs and that you wouldn't mind to see served as a midday snack for the undead lurking behind every corner. What makes Shaun of the Dead worth watching in the teeth of all these flaws is its dark and referential humour, even if the gags don't come at minute intervals and rarely are laugh out loud ones as they in return are subtle ones and sure to maintain their amusement at a repeated watch. In addition, the film is, quite surprisingly, superbly made on a technical level, making great use of quick and long shots, different camera angles, multiple forms of lighting, and believable bloodshed.Shaun of the Dead is far from perfect, even when regarded as nothing more but a comedy, but has something exciting up its sleeve on every level of filmmaking – the pub shoot-out accompanied by Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" is a truly masterful application of music as a means to improve a scene, for example – and is lethally entertaining in every one of its 99 minutes of running time.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Surprisingly good zombie comedy,"Zombie apocalypse as joke material is really nothing new. In broad daylight the slow and mumbling undead are actually pretty pathetic sight as long as you don't let them get too close. I still don't think that the subject matter has ever been approached quite this way. Because when you really look at it, in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies aren't the source of the comedy, they're actually a credible threat to the everyday joes that inhabit this film. Rather most of the humour in this film stems from the sheer stupidity of mankind. Because let's face it, many of us wouldn't make it for a day if the gates of hell were to be opened. But there would be some individuals, who against all odds would survive through sheer dumb luck. And that's this film.The director, Edgar Wright, along with the two main actors, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, would later go on to make Hot Fuzz, one of my favourite comedies of all time, and a lot of the same ideas show up in this film. The same bland non-interest in the face of danger, bizarre circumstances happening in the background and the absolutely brilliant interaction between Pegg and Frost are the saving graces of this film, along with the usual zombie jokes that you'd expect from a film like this.This isn't Hot Fuzz, however, though it's still rather good. What I think it misses are likable main characters. The main characters in this film are really, really urban and bland. They're so boring and so lost in their everyday lives, not to mention the zombie apocalypse, that it's hard to root for them. I found myself cheering for the zombies occasionally when some of the more obnoxious characters were killed. Whether or not this was intentional, I don't know, but it does the film no favours.That's my personal interests interfering with my viewing experience, though, because I've never really liked these kinds of characters that are so helpless and so socially awkward that even the local computer nerds pick on them. Some might find them hilarious, however, so I can't really call it a flaw of the film. It's just not something that appeals to me.Aside from that grievance, the film is very good. The plot twists are very unexpected, but in a good way, the action scenes are not bad and the story, while a bit weird in some parts, manages to work, for some incomprehensible reason. Any fan of zombie parody should definitely give this one a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A Great Start,This may be my least favorite of the Cornetto Trilogy but it's still one of the best movies I've seen.

I'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing,"Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 romantic zombie comedy that follows a London electronics salesman who is caught in a zombie apocalypse with his loved ones.Starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost with directing duties from Edgar Wright, Shaun of the Dead is an excellent example of how to make a comedy mixed with horror elements. The characters are genuinely likable with a brilliant cast behind them, and it doesn't rely on the same old cliches you see in some other comedies with a horror premise. Pegg and Frost are terrific together and make the perfect comedic tag team.

One of my favorites,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of my favorite movies. As the film is English, I had never seen any of the actors in it before. This film introduced me to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and led to me watching the other 2 movies in this trilogy. This was a surprisingly well done comedy that was full of things I hadn't expected going into it the first time. It was a good laugh with some interesting choices while still treading along familiar zombie movie beats. It's definitely worth a watch even if zombie movies aren't your thing. The characters are interesting, the story is well written and it's probably something comedy fans would enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
One of the funniest best horror movies ever!,"I'm American. Saw this in NYC at a screening set up by Fangoria Magazine. Now, to set up this review, I have been a fan of Britcoms for years from Python to Black Adder to Fawlty to father Ted to Black Books to Young Ones...etc....So needless to say, I enjoy the dry, dark humor mixed perfectly with slapstick and sarcasm. And I have been a fan of horror movies since I was first scared s***less watching Halloween home alone. (stupid thing to do.)I simply just loved this movie. At first, like some shows from England, I had to hear the verbiage (they speak quicker than me and have an accent obviously).. but once I found the pacing, I was drawn in as usual.Clever doesn't do this justice. It blended all the zombie movies I loved with some members of the Office and Python sense of humor. Not many movies can blend them. Fright Night, Lost Boys, Fearless Vampire Hunter, and esp. American Werewolf in London are some of my fav blendings. There were some hilarious moments. Even when people are dying, there were some laughs.And, at the screening I was at, there were some HUGE jumps from the screen. It's cool to be in the middle of the theatre and see hundreds of people jump in fear at the same time.Anyway, I digress. Last year, zombie movies were revived by 28 days later (A truly scary and intense movie), and Dawn of the Dead..(A kick ass fun ride.) This cements the humor blend. Don't think anyone could do any better from Hollywood. (Although I would have thrown the Sade album without thinking.)Anyway.. would have loved to see these slacker gits tackle vampires and such instead of Van Helsing. But, thank God, this movie had plot, deep characters, and a fun sense of style and spirit.Thanks for a refreshing happy moment here in America, Britian. I certainly needed the charge to my creative life and the sense of fun again in my movie pleasures. :)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"brilliant comedy, but a bit too zombieish for me","Shaun of the Dead is an interesting creature. A movie as clever as it's title, the best part of this stylishly filmed movie is it's sly first half hour, in which the film makers taunt the audience with a series of goofy take-offs on standard zombie film making. The movie takes its time to get to the Zombies, starting by involving you in the lives of the characters, but while this was the flaw in The Birds and Jurasic Park, it works great here because the non-zombie scenes are lots of fun.The movie slides from relationship/buddy comedy to horror movie as it goes along. It's a nicely done slide that takes you deeper into the more suspenseful part of the movie without being jarring and it never loses its sense of humor, but one scene was way too gory for me (if one scene were toned down I would probably give this an 8) and the attempts at drama tended to be flat. But while I wouldn't call it a perfect movie, it was a movie of perfect moments, and well worth watching if you can deal with a little gore (very little by the standards of the Zombie genre, but a fair amount by the standards of the buddy picture.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Shaun of the Dead: The 20 Year Plan,"After viewing ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) 20 years later, it still has a lot of humor and action to satisfy another generation. George A Romero's living dead films (""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", etc.) inspired this zombie romantic comedy or ""Zom-Rom-Com"". This film was pioneering before that specific genre became popular later with films: ""Zombieland"" (2009), ""Night of the Living Deb"" (2014), etc..Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg wrote this cleverly-crafted storyline that features ""Easter eggs"" referencing Romero's living dead films. From ""Were coming to get you Barbara!"" (from ""Night of the Living Dead's"" opening scene: ""They'll coming to get you Barbara"") to ""Foree Electronics"" reference ""Dawn of the Dead's"" actor Ken Foree.This film can suggest ""video nasty"" nostalgia-era (VHS-home entertainment formatted films like ""Dawn of the Dead"" that were temporarily banned) for Brits to remember but for US viewers recognize the Romero's obvious influence. Story revolves around ""Shaun"", (Simon Pegg) and ""Ed"" (played by Nick Frost) - two young adult Brits about to combat a city of living dead.This film works as a comedy since ""Dawn of the Dead"" also had off-beat humor amongst an ultraviolent, nihilistic situation. Here written by Wright and Pegg have woven a love story into the violence, all bittersweet. Full of different characters from ""Shaun's"" family to his girlfriend's friends. It also features soundtrack of ""Dawn of the Dead"" music bits plus pop songs from Queen and others.Wright's direction of camera angles, pacing, etc. Is on point delivering action, gore, and humor. Moreover, Wright would continue afterwards with two more films connecting this one as the ""Three Flavours of Cornetta"" (referencing a popular sweet confection ice cream cone). Each film had Pegg and Frost reappeared as different characters/scenarios. It's been said that the late George A. Romero personally likes this parody of his living dead film works.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Repetition used the best its ever been!,"The movie follows Shaun, a loser in his 30's who lives a comfortable but unfulfilling life that he coasts through like its on autopilot and how he becomes a better and more happy man thanks to the zombie apocalypse and its downfall. The film uses repetition to convey that using cinematography, for instance, identical long takes of Shaun going to the milk bar and back, one time before, and one time after the zombie outbreak happens.
In a way, the entire setting of the film reflects Shaun, he lives with his two roommates, Ed, (Nick Frost) who's been his best friend since a young age, and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) Who he's known since college. These two characters are the two sides of Shaun. Pete is the responsible adult who has his life together. Ed, on the other hand spend his life on the couch playing video games. These two roommates make up the two sides of Shaun, the lazy and irresponsible man who just drifts through life without dreams or a purpose, and the responsible but boring man who goes to work, gets paid, goes to sleep and repeat. And through these characters is where we find the theme of the movie. Repetition. I've already discussed how the director uses the camera to convey this, as well as characters but he also uses plot and the zombies to convey this message.
The zombies are a metaphor for the average life of the towns people, and just people in general. The opening scene and the scene right before the outbreak conveys this perfectly, the opening scene is a montage of London commuters, all looking bored and identical to the rest of them, like a zombie. The scene before the outbreak conveys this even better, Shaun is wandering around after work, and we see people all around him, and its impossible to tell which have been infected and which are just bored. It's an extremely clever way of communicating to the audience through visuals. Near the end of act one, Liz (Shaun's girlfriend) dumps him, due to him never living life, and just dragging her back to the same pub every night with Ed. And when the whole entire town is finally zombified at the start of act 2, it's up to Shaun to rise up and become someone who is brave and responsible enough to fight back against the zombies and grow up.
At the start of act 2, Shaun and Ed take a car down to Liz's apartment, and we are introduced to the other 2 main characters. Dianne, (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) Lucy is probably the character with the least going on, but for the most part is a good supportive friend to Liz. David on the other hand doesn't like or believe in Shaun, he ends up making situations worse due to his distrust, and though near the start of the film, he seems like the voice of reason, due to Shaun's incompetence. but as we grow to like and trust Shaun we grow to distrust and dislike David, he is also seen facing away from the other characters in the film deepening our distrust of him. Another way of using visuals to tell a story instead of just outright telling the audience to be wary of him.
A big part of the film that I haven't touched on yet is its main genre, it pulls from horror and character drama, as well as romance, but, it's mainly, a comedy and it uses the medium of zombies to tell funny and clever jokes constantly, and use the medium of comedy to foreshadow future events, for instance telling someone: ""You're dead"" as a threat, but then you'll see them in the background as a zombie, or foreshadow the zombie by showing it on the tv
The movie is extremely clever, and every single piece of dialogue is brought up again or referenced in some way later In the film
What really makes the film in my opinion is the editing and screenplay, as well as cinematography and acting. The film is quickly edited, using loads of match cuts and other smart editing tricks to make mundane things exiting and thrilling, parodying over the top zombie movies of the past, but replacing the insane over the top gun-tooling montages with someone brushing their teeth or getting ready for work, adding to the comedic genius that is this movie.In conclusion, this movie, though not my favorite Edgar Wright movie, (that award goes to Hot Fuzz) is extremely witty, tightly written, well shot, well-paced, quickly edited, funny yet bittersweet and British.

A dead loss,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsShaun (Simon Pegg) is a selfish,unmotivated loser who lives in North London.He has badly let his girlfriend down once again and is trying to make amends with her.However,as he goes about this,he fails to notice that the world is in the grip of an invasion of flesh eating zombies and suddenly finds himself forced to fight back.I started to watch the new version of Dawn of the Dead on Thursday night,only for the DVD to mess up about a quarter of the way through.However,I feel I was still able (having seen the original three NOTLD movies as well as the more recent 28 Days Later) to be able to judge the type of movies Shaun of the Dead was parodying.And it was quite an idea and one I'm sure was executed to the best of the ability of all concerned.Unfortunately,Shaun of the Dead just doesn't rise to the mark for me.As appealing as the jokes are,it's rarely funny (and I stress the word 'rarely' as,admittedly there were one or two scenes that made me chuckle quite a bit),not to mention overlong for the type of film it is.All the best spoofs from the likes of Leslie Nielsen and Jim Abrahams never rised above the hour and a half mark (if that) and this just verges over it's boundaries a bit.There's also an unexplainably,inexplicably serious,heavy-handed nature to the film in certain parts,i.e. when Shaun is forced to kill his mother that detract from the silly fun element of the story and appear at odds with the rest of the film.I see that the film is to be released in the States pretty soon.Given it's good box office takings over here,it's got admittedly pretty good chances of doubling it's success over the pond.I certainly wish it all the best and hope that a different audience can derive some fun from it that I never did.But then,given 'the dead' wasn't a British franchise to begin with,maybe the yanks will be able to see it and go one better.**",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
an amusing slightly bloody Brithish spoof,"This basically follows the guidelines for other zombie films. Once bitten you turn into a zombie. But this one is for laughs. The zombies move slow and have weird looks on their faces and moan in a silly way. Our heroes, Shaun and Ed don't seem to notice the chaos going around until they get up one morning. In one funny scene, Shaun goes to the store to get his usual drink and doesn't notice blood on the door or people dead in allies. The two spot a zombie in the yard and turn on the TV and find out what's going on. They try to bash the zombie's head in a series of funny events. They contrive a plan to pick up Shaun's mom, girlfriend, and head over the local pub. So, we get more silly zombie encounters. When the step-dad turns, they just leave him in the car instead of kicking him out and taking the car. But it doesn't matter because the zombies are too slow. They make it to the pub and there is a fast conclusion just when you think they have no where left to run.FINAL VERDICT: Comical horror spoof, much better than the Scary Movie spoofs. I recommend this for anyone who can't miss a zombie film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The mixture of British humor with Romero-style horror is indeed a winning combination.,"I had Shaun of the Dead pegged as one of those straight-to-video movies that pops up every once in a while, featuring a clever lampooning of something popular in movies at the time. In the wake of a spectacular remake of Dawn of the Dead, it was not hard to come to this conclusion. But not only in Shaun of the Dead more than a straight-to-video sideshow hoping for a few minutes of attention, it's a tremendous installment in the horror genre that shows that romantic subplots can indeed have a place in scary movies. What is truly amazing is that Jerry Bruckheimer can screw up romantic subplots in movies that seem to demand romance, and yet Director Edgar Wright is able to make it work in a gory zombie movie. This is outstanding!The best parts of the movie are the gradual evolution from a romantic comedy and into a horror film that takes place over the first third or so. The movie opens in a serious conversation between Shaun and his amazingly beautiful and adorable girlfriend Liz, in which they discuss how unhappy Liz is with the way their relationship is going. They each complain about the other's friends, all of whom are sitting right there listening. Shaun's inability to find anything else to do other than hang out at the same pub, the Winchester, and work at the same dead-end job have led to Liz issuing an ultimatum. Change things, or she's outta here.I love that the movie is so effective both as a horror film and a romantic comedy, while at the same time going significantly out of its way to make fun of those two genres. My favorite is the way the sound is manipulated early in the film. Horror films constantly manipulate sound to create scares and tension (such as the Screeching Cat scare), and this movie makes fun of that tactic, giving extreme close-ups and vastly amplified sound for things like brushing teeth and spreading jam on toast.As Shaun goes through a typical day the day after his conversation with Liz, he notices things here and there that seem out of the ordinary, like lines of massive military vehicles rushing past his workplace, a man obviously terrified running past him at full speed, and a staggering man across the street who picks up a pigeon with the intention of eating it. If you think about it, most of the more well-known zombie movies start out in the middle of the crisis. They don't take the time to show normal society, they just start out focusing on a small group of people, the last survivors in what is by now an almost complete decimation of the human race, which has consumed itself, you might say. Here, everything is normal, and the movie takes the time to show what it might be like for the average person if the walking dead started eating people and turning them into walking dead as well.There are frantic news reports that offer vague theories as to what is causing 'the crisis,' but like the military vehicles and other strange things that Shaun noticed, he always gets distracted before he catches on to what is going on, which allows room for some of the most memorable scenes in the movie, like when Shaun and his best friend Ed, one of Liz's major complaints, leave the Winchester that night, pleasantly intoxicated.In the morning, Shaun wakes up and walks across the street to the corner store, like he does every day, and doesn't notice the chaos that has erupted overnight. When he gets back, there is a hilarious scene where he and Shaun find a zombie stuck in their backyard, apparently unaware of where she is or where to go. This is a perfect example of where the movie most sharply departs from the traditional zombie movie. Shaun and Ed don't react like actors in a gore movie, they react like normal people would in such a situation. When the zombie girl turns around, they look at her shocked, and then laugh at how drunk she must be. When she falls and suffers a significant injury, only to get right back up, the looks on Shaun's and Ed's faces are absolutely priceless.From this point, the movie turns into the more traditional horror film, but it maintains its originality and romantic comedy portion by stopping occasionally to remind you that the other plot has not been forgotten. There are times throughout the movie where the characters are surrounded by zombies and stop completely to argue about their personal differences. At one point, they are literally surrounded by hundreds of zombies only a few feet away, and Ed stops to sit casually on a nearby bench and talk to someone on his cell-phone. Shaun smacks it out of his hand and essentially tells him that that's exactly the problem with him.I think that where Shaun of the Dead is most successful is in the blending of these two seemingly incompatible story lines. A lesser movie would have tried to mix together a romantic comedy and a horror movie and ended up screwing them both up, trying to please everyone and ultimately pleasing no one. Shaun of the Dead, however, tried to please everyone and succeeds because it doesn't disenfranchise anyone. It doesn't start as a romantic comedy, then turn into a horror movie that solves the romantic comedy because Liz fell back in love with Shaun, who in the course of the horror portion had become a hero. That's how you screw up a movie with a premise like this.Instead, the movie weaves this tapestry of horror and romantic comedy, each infiltrating and playing off of the other, becoming in the process a success in both areas and something truly unique. And even if it had done nothing but make a zombie movie unique, it would have been a success, but there is so much more there. Don't miss this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Gory, but has a certain charm!","Minor British pictures quite often turn out to be little gems and here's another contribution to that fine tradition.Simon Pegg turns in an assured performance as the hapless Shaun, a loser in a dead-end job who knows how to hang on to useless friends, like Ed (nauseatingly well played by Nick Frost), but can't keep his attractive girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because he can't manage a simple thing like reserving a restaurant table. Then he really finds himself as London is subjected to a plague of zombies.Difficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged, but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners. My favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of Shaun's everyday life and a later scene where Shaun's party, seeking to find refuge at a local pub, encounter a party led by his ex-girlfriend.

Very good but not great,"Romantic comedy/horror film (taking place in England) about Shaun and his friends trying to stay alive when the dead come alive and eat the flesh of the living.Yep--it had to happen eventually--a comedy about flesh-eating zombies. Surprisingly it really does work. This is one of the few movies that successfully mixes horror, comedy and drama. The only other ones I can think of are ""The Howling"", ""American Werewolf in London"" and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"". Not all the jokes work but about 95% of them do. And the dramatic moments actually are well-worked into the plot. And this movie has PLENTY of blood and gore (for an R rated film). If this had been done seriously the ratings board probably would have demanded cuts.Now I DID like it (and was laughing out loud more than once) but it has some minor problems: most of the characters are extremely unlikable (especially Shaun's best friend); the film has its share of dead spots and some scenes are way too tragic for a film like this. Still, that aside, this is a very funny, gory movie. A must for horror fans. Try to see it with an audience--it really comes alive that way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Review from a Comedy Snob,"By way of explanation of this review, I should say that I've never been that in to comedies. My wife makes me laugh, my friends make me laugh, even a book can make me laugh, but for some reason the number of movies that make me laugh are very few and far between. 'Shaun of the Dead', for all the hype as being one of the funniest films in years, was amusing throughout, and on several occasions did, in fact, make me laugh, which from this reviewer, is very high praise indeed.The story is pretty simple, with Pegg's Shaun leading a who's who of British sitcom actors through zombie infested city streets to hole-up, Romero-style, in a local pub. The zombies are never very scary, and there's never really much of a sense of real peril. The script contains genuine warmth and affection and Pegg and Frost are great, possessing comedic chemistry and timing, but judging from the out-takes, you wish that they would allow themselves the indulgence of diverting from the script, as their improvisational skills are often far funnier than the finished dialogue.A last act disemboweling is the movie's only real nod to the visceral and messy violence of the genre, as can be judged from its 15-rating in Britain. I feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that England is able to finally produce popular movies without pandering to an American audience, but the lavish praise that has been heaped on this movie seems a little over-the-top. But what can I say? I've just never been that in to comedies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Much better than Dawn!,"This is what the zombie movie genre should have been. A comedy. I really disliked the original DOTD. I can see that it started a trend, but why is beyond me, since it's so appallingly bad. Not only is the setup a bit silly(slow-moving brainless easy to spot zombies taking over the world? Yeah, right) but the movie takes itself so seriously, and the fans even more so. Shaun of the Dead doesn't, and that's its strength.The movie starts as a normal relationship comedy, and Shaun is our regular loser. The whole problem of the dead walking begins just as any problem; something you hear on the news but ignore because you have worse problems. People's reactions to the zombie plague (Don't say the ""z-word""!) is actually pretty realistic and also funny.The movie uses gore in a good way, and doesn't indulge in it, like the 2004 DOTD remake. Since this is not USA, the Londoners have to use cricket bats and umbrellas instead of shotguns and colts. The classic mall is replaced with a pub, and when Shauns mum tells him she's been attacked on the phone, she refers to the zombies as ""a tad bitey"". It's very British, and I love that.The cast is good, especially Pegg, who shows a great range o emotions. The two usual zombie movie emotions, fear and expressionlessness, are nowhere to be seen. The supporting cast is good, and the zombie extras are great.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombie movies, and to other people too. Unless you have a weak stomach, this movie is good for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
brilliantly funny and gory and also touching,"i hired this movie (and now own) when i heard my friends talking about it often for quite a while. this movie is just brilliant.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a guy with a lousy job, shares a house with two friends. Ed, who is an immature man who does not seem like he is ever going to grow up and has no job and Pete, who works and is absolutely fed up with Ed.Shaun has one last chance to make it up with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because she is sick of having to go to the Winchester (pub) every time they go on a date, and she feels as though Shaun is not being committed. Shaun, Ed, Liz and her two friends Dianne and David (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) are always together when they go on these 'dates' at the Winchester.well it doesn't work out with Shaun and Liz and they break up. Ed takes Shaun to the Winchester and this is when people start noticing some strange things.the next day the outbreak of zombies is revealed and Shaun devises a plan to rescue his mum and kill his step dad (Bill Nighy) and rescue his new ex-girlfriend Liz and wait the zombie epidemic out.there are a LOT! of funny scenes in this movie, i am not even really going to start because i won't stop.there are quite a few touching moments as well, especially when Shaun's step dad apologises and another one later but i don't want to spoil it.anyways this is a really funny movie, and some of the gross gory bits are actually made funny because of the atmosphere created. its a romantic comedy with zombies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
you've got red on you,"I LOVE THIS FILM. it is one of my favourite films of all time. I've watched this film A lot of times and I'm still not bored of it. for zombie film fans (like my self) , this film is full to the brim of references to so many amazing zombie film , wick makes it even more enjoyable. it is, in my opinion, (to spite what the haters say) is very well scripted. the acting is excellent, the editing is spectacular, and its laugh out loud funny. this also has elements of a Rom-Com too, giving the film a perfect balance of horror, comedy, and romance, making it a good all-round film.the two main actors work well together Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are an extremely funny comedy duo. the film is directed by one of my favourite directors, Edgar Wright who has worked with Pegg and frost many times now, on thing like the TV show spaced and the film hot fuzz (witch I also love)the only negative thing I would say is that some of its brilliance mite be lost, for people who don't get the references, but do not lit that stop you it is, even with a lack of prior knowledge is a great film, also this is a cult film so this would be, to be expected. worth a watch, if you love classic zombie films or not. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"A Very ""British"" version of a classic.","From the opening credits with Goblin's music I had somewhat high expectations. I knew it was going to be a comedic spoof of Dawn of the Dead. What I didn't know was that it was going to be a stupid comedic spoof with British punchlines. It was also very slow moving and I couldn't believe for one moment that a guy like Shaun who was so ""anal"" about his life (The dry erase chalkboard on his refrigerator and the way he ""coached"" his employees at the TV store) didn't notice all the chaos occurring all around him. Practically every TV station in England is showing dead bodies and widespread sickness and Shaun and his bumbling roommate are changing the channel to play video games. The rest of the movie reminded me a lot of a Guy Ritchie film with the camera angles and scenes shooting back and forth like lightning. I think that the next time George Romero sanctions anyone to do a remake or spoof of his classic he should do the final edits and ask for more money. By the way folks. Nothing against the British.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Overall, a very good satire that not only pokes at the zombie genre in a very humorous, unique way, but is social commentary on how zombie-like the mundane real-world routine really is.Direction: Good to Very Good
The direction on a macroscale is very good as he used a distinct style to build a satirical world on the Zombie genre; the direction on a microscale is good as the interpersonal scenes are where both the comedy and themes come out; has a very distinct storytelling style that satirically mocks both the zombie genre while simultaneously making comments on mundane life; he builds tension in a comedic way to both elicit fear and make fun of the zombie genre at the same timeStory: Good to Very Good
The concept is a nice satire on the zombie genre as it makes fun of both the genre and mundane life; the plot structure is pretty standard for a satirical horror movie; character writing is good for Shaun as it shows how Shaun feels like he is stuck in his routine of life, even though he really wants moreScreenplay: Very Good
The dialogue is fresh, entertaining, and surprisingly profound for a low-budget horror satire; the humor is good as it helps move the satire forward and makes the movie funny overall; the symbolism is surprisingly present as the movie makes fun of how zombie-like the mundane, routine real world really is; the foreshadowing is goodActing: Pretty Good
Simon Pegg: Good (Played the titular character very well and is able to have other characters bounce off of him to help build jokes; also, he is able to show different ranges of emotion pretty well)
Kate Ashfield: Pretty Good (Plays the female lead well and has good chemistry with Pegg)
Nick Frost: Good (Plays the comic relief character pretty well; has great chemistry with Pegg)
Dylan Moran: Decnet (Plays somewhat of a standoffish character decently well as he makes the most of what he can)
Bill Nighy: Pretty Good (He is an experienced actor and shows this tension as he creates it with Pegg)
Penelope Wilton: Decent to Pretty Good (Plays the motherly figure well)
Rest of the cast: Decent (The movie really is about the main cast, and they do a good job playing off of each other)Score: Pretty GoodSoundtrack: Pretty GoodCinematography: Good

Full credit for taking a subject like zombies and making it more fun than it ever has been in the past.

Tacky but entertaining English comedy horror,"Described as a 'British' comedy-horror, this is a very 'English' film, complete with English-style pubs, English silly humour, a generous splattering of gore, and the sort of fish-and-chips romance that goes with English sitcoms. Shaun is caught amidst a growing epidemic of zombies - presumably sparked of by genetically modified crops. Attempts to save his girlfriend and mum (and various others) result in an ill-conceived plan to hole up in the local pub. Humorous references to people with 'dead-end jobs' abound, and also to the attempts by Shaun's girlfriend to get him to 'live a little' rather than hanging out down the pub with his dead-loss mates. The joke is carried even further when the group have to impersonate zombies so as not to be noticed, even to the point of practice auditions. Cerebral stuff it ain't, but Shaun of the Dead, although its joke goes on for a little too long, makes a reasonable stab at breathing new life into a dying brand of horror movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Hilarious & Scary,"After hearing all of the buzz online about Shaun of the Dead and seeing the Dawn of the Dead remake earlier in the year and enjoying it (though it had nothing to do with or was nowhere near as good as Romero's Dead films, including Land of the Dead), I had extremely high expectations. Needless to say, it far exceeded my expectations. Shaun of the Dead is a fantastic movie.First off, you will enjoy the film more if you like British humor, like Monty Python or Mr. Bean. This is not saying you won't enjoy it if you don't like British humor, but you may not find some of the jokes funny.The characters are great. Simon Pegg is perfect as Shaun and looks good sporting the white shirt and red tie. Nick Frost is laid back as Ed and pulls it of wonderfully. The always useful Bill Nighy gives a great supporting performance as Shaun's step-dad. All of the other characters are perfect in their roles as well, especially Liz and Pete.The comic genius of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright is exactly that: genius. The film has so many hilariously funny parts, especially whenever Shaun and Ed encounter zombies. The way they deal with them is gut-bustingly funny. There's great dialogue between the characters, especially between Shaun and Ed, who are obviously friends in real life. I won't give away any of the jokes, you've got to watch it for yourself. The likable characters play off of one another so well that it makes the film ten times better. The film also has many amusing and much appreciated nods to Romero's Dead films. When they talk to Shaun's mom on the phone, listen to what Ed says before they hang up. Being a big fan of Romero's Dead films and horror movies in general, I was laughing at things most people didn't get.Once the dead rise, Shaun of the Dead becomes an effective zombie movie, but still retains its comedic elements. The zombies themselves are very well done. These are the 'shambling' zombie variety, which I prefer because I find them scarier. The scenes when Ed and Shaun are driving through London are excellent, displaying chaos and lots of zombies (I loved the ambulance zombie, very clever). My favorite scene in the entire film is when Shaun walks to Nelson's shop after the zombies have risen. The movie showcases some top-notch gore, with some chunky zombie bites, messy headshots, and a scene where one character gets ripped in half and eaten. If you're a gore-hound like me, you won't be disappointed. Yummy!Finally, I loved the music. Edgar Wright utilized some of Goblin's original music from the original Dawn of the Dead throughout the film. It worked well with the film and was a nice nod to Romero. The music through the rest of the film ranges from British pop/rock to Queen and it works perfectly.The Bottom Line:A side-splittingly funny zombie movie with some nice gore and excellent nods to George A. Romero. Shaun of the Dead is the perfect Rom-Zom-Com (romantic zombie comedy).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
One of the most seamless blends of Comedy and Horror ever!,"I know, I know... I've barely started this review and I already fear it smacks of hyperbole, but I can't help myself... I have such love for this film, I can hardly contain my geeky joy.I am a lifelong fan of the Horror movie in all of its forms; from atmospheric and creepy classics to the most exploitative and gory grind-house flicks. My second favorite type of films are Comedies, from cheap scatological humor to the driest British wit. I only mention my tastes here to point out that this movie satisfied me on pretty much every level.Horror and Comedy are like two sides of the same coin, and yet very few films have really blended them masterfully. I would say that the short list of those which have includes An American Werewolf in London, the Evil Dead trilogy, Dead Alive (Braindead)... and now, Shaun of the Dead.I found the horrific aspects of this film wonderfully executed and effective. The scares run the gamut, from quick-cut BOO! shots to subtle, ominous dark shadows to full-out, body-rending gore. And the humorous aspects were likewise varied, from crude bathroom humor to clever puns and pop-cultural references.Not only does Shaun of the Dead juggle laughs and scares with surprising skill, but this film turns out to have a heart, too. Billed as a Rom-Zom-Com, the fantastic elements of this film are kept in check by the affection of the characters for each other.The underpinning of this tale of Zombie madness is the everyday life of working-class schlub Shaun, his long-suffering girlfriend Liz and useless slacker buddy Ed. The relationship between these and other characters is really the main story, with the undead plague providing a backdrop for much better dialog than I've come to expect from a Zombie movie. By creating characters that the viewer can care about, SOTD achieves an emotional depth between the gags and the gristle. The last frame of the film is truly a moment that made me laugh and cry at the same time.Obviously I have nothing but praise for Shaun of the Dead. For me, it was an instant addition to my Top Ten list. I highly recommend that you see it, often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Remove the head or destroy the brain.,"This has to be a one off film as i don't think i have ever seen anything quite like it. Those expecting a spoof expect to be disappointed as this is a witty original comedy.The idea for this movie was when Simon Pegg wondered what zombie films would have been had they been set in Hackney, and the results prove they would have been hilarious.The plot is simple, Shaun is a loser!! After losing his girlfriend the end of the world is nigh, unless he can save them and kick some zombie butt. The cast are all superb in this film as it wallows its way through London to try to get to the pub.Pegg is excellent as Shaun, our have a go hero, yet he still kept most of the best lines for Nick Frost (Ed) Peggs real life best friend. The other cast members all do great jobs too, Kate Ashfield (Liz) plays a straight role to a likable enough degree, Dylan Moran (David) is excellent with his sh*t eating grin as Liz dumps Shaun. Lucy Davies (Di) also does a great job with you feeling such sympathy for her just for the look on the girls face. Last but not least Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are as excellent as ever, as i think we all expect from them, as Shauns Mom and Step Father.The film pays homage to lots of great horror films with slight references to everything from Halloween to An American werewolf in London. But what impressed me the most with this film was the way it stuck to the George Romero zombie flicks, without ever trying to dull it down. The gorefest is exactly what you expect from a zombie film and even though this is a comedy it stays true to the zombie genre. I was also happy that the zombies moved like zombies and not like the running idiots from the dawn of the dead remake, i feel that the slow movement gives a creepier edge to the zombies that modern zombie flicks have lost.I feel that the hard work of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright deserve to go down in history as a zombie film you should not be ashamed to own.An instant cult classic Happy Viewing",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"Mediocre Comedy , Bad Splatter , Good Overall","I just watched Shaun of the Dead and i have to say I'm a bit disappointed cause it had a 7.9 IMDb rating i did expect a bit more from a movie which is rated so high but anyway, it's not a bad movie at all. It starts a bit boring when the main character (Shaun) is introduced but as soon as the Zombies come into play it gets fun. Shaun turns into a hero ( like Lionel from Peter Jackson's Braindead ) and the movie turns into a amusing Splatter - Comedy. Another point which is to be mentioned is that there aren't that many splatter scenes in this movie, i mean if you compare it to other Zombie films you're gonna know what i mean.

Overrated.  Over-hyped.  Underwhelming.,"I haven't seen a movie fail to live up to the hype this much since The Blair Witch Project. Remember how it was supposed to be the scariest movie of all time? Then do you remember sitting in the theater cheering for the witch to kill off the three crybabies who kept fussing over a stupid map?Well, if you go into Shaun of the Dead expecting one of the funniest movies of the year and a masterpiece in the spoof genre, then you're going to be very disappointed as you stare at the screen and wonder when the humor will start. Please don't believe any of the reviewers claiming it's ""a laugh-a-minute."" The only way that would be possible is if you're referring to the trailer. It took almost 30 minutes before the FIRST laugh ever came.That's not an exaggeration. About the first 30 minutes of the story are spent showing us how much of a slacker Shaun is and how irresponsible he is in his relationship with Liz. I guess this is all supposed to make us like him more when he decides to save Liz and everybody around him from the zombies. Doesn't work. I was just sitting there bored out of my mind waiting for something, anything to happen.The best I can possibly say about this movie is it's merely OK. I think a viewer's enjoyment will be largely based on his perception going into the movie. After watching the trailer, I was expecting an all-out comedy/parody. And there are a few funny moments (for example, Shaun and his friend act somewhat nonchalantly towards the zombies at first as they use cricket bats and old LPs to do battle), but most of the humor can be found in the trailer.The main problem with Shaun of the Dead is it has major identity conflict. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It spoofs the zombie genre for a bit, but then we have to sit through emotional moments that put a damper on everything. I thought this was supposed to be a comedy, so why do I have to sit through a scene with Shaun crying while trying to make decisions about what to do to certain people who have turned into zombies?And then you have some pretty graphic moments that make it seem like the movie wants to have a legitimate horror movie feel. This doesn't work because the movie isn't the least bit scary. The result is the movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. For that reason, I think the mainstream American audience won't connect with it.The people this will connect with the most are the coffeehouse artsy types who'll love discussing the social commentary. But for me, the social commentary is about as effective as shaving with a rubber band. Exactly. Way too much time is dedicated to trying to show us that we all live zombie-like lives. We sit glaze-eyed in front of the TV playing video games, we all follow our own little cliques, we head to work in the same routine every day. Yeah, that's great. You could've expressed that point in a single sentence.There are a handful of funny and clever moments (particularly the end), but I would've liked to have seen more ""shock value"" moments played for laughs. Unfortunately, Shaun of the Dead looks to be throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. Plus, the film makers are apparently in love with repetition. I hear the wedding is in April. For example, the camera pans up from someone's feet as he stumbles about. We see the figure yawning and making a weird sound. Oh, it's Shaun. Look, he's acting like a zombie! How cute. Apparently a critic somewhere must've laughed insanely during a press screening, so they decided it'd be great to repeat this gag. ONCE WAS ENOUGH!And please don't tell me I just don't understand British humor. Folks, I get the joke, it just ain't that funny. If this is the best the British have to offer these days in regard to comedy, then I've never been prouder to be an American.THE GISTI have no desire to see this again, and I certainly won't recommend it. If you're looking for some good British comedy then I highly recommend checking out John Cleese's Fawlty Towers. But if you're in the mood to chuckle once or twice during a movie and then fight the temptation to fall asleep, then Shaun of the Dead will fill that bill. Let me put it as bluntly as I possibly can: Don't believe the hype.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"A Classic - Absolutely brilliant!,","Shaun of the Dead is a great film, no questions asked! Its very funny and has great HORROR,a great story and has some excellent acting! The first thing i like about this film is how amazingly funny it is! Although this film may not be that amazing to people who haven't watched any of George A Romero's zombie films as most of the jokes in this film are 'spoofy'. But even if you didn't find this film funny it would still be a great movie, not all great films are comedies! The second thing i like about this film is the acting. Almost everyone who has an acting part in this film has played parts in BBC/ITV dramas or comedies (Casualty and programmes like that)! And in Shaun of the Dead they really do their job well! The films set in the 'rough areas' of a 'rough area' of England so their are no American actors putting on a stupid English accent and all the actors play their parts very realistically, especially Ed (Shaun's best friend)! The story is great in Shaun of the Dead, its very clever the way they seem to place Shaun and 'the gang' in the same situations as the characters off George Romeros films and slip in little jokes! You might of watched the film many times before you notice some of these little hidden grenades of laughter! And if your a fan of zombie films (which you must be really if you want to get the best 'Shaun of the Dead experience') then there is also some violent scenes too! So overall this isn't just great film its incredible, funny, smart and probably the best film of 2004! If you haven't seen this film then don't just watch it but buy it, and buy Dawn of the Dead (make shore its the 1970s version) and watch that before watching Shaun of the Dead. This will help you to understand all the jokes! (This is also a pretty good DVD, there are loads of extras for a single disc edition)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Touching Homage to the Zombie Genre,"Shaun of the Dead is a zombie comedy-horror movie directed by Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the team behind the TV series Spaced and the movies Hot Fuzz and The World's End which together they form the Cornetto Trilogy.The movie stars the titular Shaun, a man who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He doesn't like his job, he has problems with his girlfriend and his family, and must always stand up for his lazy, housemate, jobless friend, Ed. All those seem to be the least of his problems when apparently there's a zombie apocalypse taking place outside. Edgar Wright does a brilliant job directing the movie and proves to handle with great touch both humor, drama and action. In the beginning of the movie, we are presented with lots of tips and imagery that the zombie apocalypse is impending, however, since Shaun has to deal with all his personal problems, he barely notices all the signs. There's even a scene where all the news channels talk about this problem, but he just flips the channels carelessly. It's a great comedic touch considering how much it takes for Shaun and Ed to realize there are actual zombies invading.Shaun of the Dead is clearly an homage to every zombie movie ever made, especially George Romero's movies. The script, written by Pegg and Wright, is full of references and tributes to classic zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead and so on. The trio of Pegg, Wright and Frost really treat the genres of movies they love with lots of respect. The same can be said about Hot Fuzz, which is clearly inspired by buddy cop movies or The World's End, who has it's roots in classic science-fiction stories.If you're a hardcore zombie fan, this is the movie for you, but it also works great for a casual viewer, who maybe is more interested in the comedy aspect that than the horror. The movie combines excellent touches of humor with some powerful drama. There are a few strong, full of impact scenes that are clearly needed, so that the viewer will know that this is not just a silly parody. It's a real, solid movie with great performances and a funny, clever script. Clearly worth a watch, 8 out of 10!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"The funniest zombie movie, hands down!","I loved this movie! Zombie movies are fun enough when they are serious and scary, but this was laugh out loud funny. It is, however, not just a parody of zombie movies, but a funny romantic comedy that gets many of its laughs from the relationships between characters. If every instance of walking dead people were excised from the film, it would still be a fine film. The main character, Shaun, experiences much that is familiar to young people who have gotten too old for school but have yet to settle down. He has a girlfriend who wants more out of life, a couple of roommates who alternate between slovenly and uptight, and a boring dead end job. His girl doesn't get on with his best friend, and he isn't exactly fond of her friends. He is determined to resolve all of these differences, and still tries, even when it seems that the dead have risen and start to terrorize the living. If you've ever had a dysfunctional family or a fight with your girlfriend or boyfriend, you will relate to the characters. If you like zombie movies, look for the constant, though sometimes very subtle, references to every zombie movie that has ever come before. Highly recommended for fans of British comedy, romantic comedy nuts, and devotees of zombie cinema!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
What a lot of FUN!,"My son made me watch this camp take-off, and I'm glad he did.A wonderfully funny homage to George Romero, its got more zombies, blood, and gore than any movie I've ever seen. Though thin on plot, it's a well written and well directed film, more than could be said for any of Romero's films. Great cinematography with long traveling shots, well developed characters (and I do mean characters) and a very subtle build up to the introduction to the first Zombies (though we all know its coming).If you are looking for some good, bloody fun and are a fan of camp, check out Shaun of the dead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Intelligent Mix of Genres,"Anno 2004: talented director Edgar Wright already proved himself rock solid, having made ""Spaced"": a hilarious TV show that never got the success it deserved and ran from the (very) late 90's to 2001, starring most of the same actors you'll see in ""Shaun of the Dead"". But enough back story: the question awaiting the release of this movie was of course if Wright had enough going for himself to provide the wit his TV-series had for the length of a full-feature film. And he sure did. Shaun (an insanely sarcastic Simon Pegg) and Ed, two immediately likable slackers who also happen to be best friends, live together in a house they rent, find themselves face to face with a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus, right after Shaun's girlfriend broke up with him. Long story short: Shaun's sole target is to get the girl and save his friends and family, while still maintaining his charming sense of humour. I could ramble on and on about how much I love this movie for all it has going for it, but you'll just have to discover for yourself. Think: your typical zombie-movie, with entertaining yet humble personalities and laugh-out-loud, typically British humour. This is the world's first Zom-Com, and believe me when I say it's an absolutely blast.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Though this might be a comedy it did delivered some very gruesome and horrifying images and death than Dawn of the Dead and other horror movie does.Anyway the movie got a great pace and is definitely not even bit boring making it a joy to watch.Recommendation: Tried to watch it couple of time.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Don't forget to kill PhilipShaun of the Dead,"Anticipating the release of Hot Fuzz has made me want to see the Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright career works. Having heard how great the UK series ""Spaced"" was, I bought an import from Britain and just recently finished it. The show was great, pop culture abounds, hilarity from start to finish, and much like ""The Office,"" they knew when to stop and not let the show take a fall with filler and repetitioncoughUS ""The Office""cough. What better segway from those two seasons then to go right on to the crew's first feature film, Shaun of the Dead. Now, I own a lot of movies on DVD, and as a result don't get to watch them often, and in some instances have never seen them yet. However, I must have watched Shaun four or five times in the past three years. I find the humor great and the characters well fleshed out and just having a blast with each other. It never gets tiring for me.Director Edgar Wright shows the ability to appropriate camera shots from other films, like he did with the numerous homage moments in ""Spaced,"" and also a deft handling of the medium, especially with the long one take of Shaun walking into the convenience store, (both times). The way he was able to recreate shots and moments from the beginning of the film, to later on is effective and funny. It's good to see that he has kept a working relationship with writer/actor Simon Pegg because the two go together brilliantly. Pegg co-wrote and starred in ""Spaced"" with Jessica Stevenson, (included in Shaun with a small role). Pegg is naturally charismatic and has perfect comedic timing throughouthelped I'm sure by the fact he is usually playing against, best friend in real life, Nick Frost. The thing with Simon Pegg is that he isn't your usual comedian trying to show range; the guy really can act. He plays the serious moments with the right amount of emotion and reality, and his expressions are always true to the moment. Sure the physical comedy is there, but his characters always work so well without the gimmicks, that when the slapstick comes, it actually works.Wright and Pegg have definitely stamped themselves all over this film. Using their influences and love of the horror and comic genres, they have created a monster that stands all on its own. Equal parts spoof and real zombie scare-er, Shaun of the Dead is a genre masterpiece, breathing new life into a type of film which has been stale and redundant for the past decade or so, (besides the great 28 Days Later, which has a shot taken at it here). Besides the need for survival amongst the living dead, though, we also have Shaun's quest to become a man and sort out his priorities, the most important being getting his girlfriend Liz back. The fusion of this common romantic comedy plot device and its polar opposite, with horror, works surprisingly well both in the script and the acting. Whereas most horror films just make you bide time as each character is taken out one by one, we are treated here with a group of friends that truly care for each other and meet fate together rather than alone. These people know the genre and never stupidly go into a situation to conveniently be killed.The humor could never have been as successful as it was without some spectacular actors. Kate Ashfield, as Shaun's girlfriend Liz really adds depth to the film, playing the straight character to the many goofballs running around. I'm not familiar with anything else she has done, but I would assume it is mostly serious stuff as she is one of the few here not playing for laughs. Penelope Wilton is perfect as Shaun's mother and Peter Serafinowicz once again shows how he excels at playing pricks, (like his ""Spaced"" character). Also, like so many films of this ilk, we need to have the token serious actor to give it some credibility. Bill Nighy is that person here and he definitely adds professionalism while fitting in naturally with the crazy cast.While this is Wright and Pegg's film, they never could have done it without the help of Nick Frost. For being a regular guy and best bud to Pegg while he was starting out in the industry, Frost landed an integral role in ""Spaced"" on the behest of his friend. Pegg wrote into the series a character based on one of Frost's personas that he would do to get laughs. Knowing no one could do the role better, he got Nick into the show despite him having no acting background whatsoever. It was a fantastic move, because he is a natural and in Shaun shows the maturity and growth he has undergone. The guy is a full-fledged actor now and steals every scene he is in, while never being just a copy of his TV role. Frost has range and one of the best deliveries for comedic gems. The few times when the film started to lull, Frost was always there to save the day. Having a familiar rapport with Pegg also helps us believe their relationship and understand the two and where they are coming from. I can't wait to see what the Wright/Pegg/Frost trio can do to the buddy cop genre with this year's Hot Fuzz. If the trailers have anything to say about it, it should be on par with ""Spaced"" and Shaun, if not exceed them both.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
You Will Laugh Till you Die,"I have never seen a movie that is more quotable then Shaun of the Dead. I watch movies, quote movies, and let them impact my life in many ways but very few have a greater effect than Shaun of the Dead. The title spoofs Dawn of the Dead but this is nothing like it. A zombie movie, yes, but this is an Edgar Wright film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This trio has made some great movies but this is the one that put them on the map. An idiot and his friend try to survive the zombie apocalypse by going to their favorite pub.The best part of this movie is the little details any fan of the movie can appreciate. From the opening credits to the very end, everything is connected. In the opening credits there is a girl at a cash register and a black guy checking his phone. These people return later in the film as zombies. Maybe you noticed it, maybe you didn't but I noticed everything. Snake hips, John, his wife, the other old lady, and even Nelson. Characters we see for three seconds or have two lines come back in some way. Every line is on purpose and everything is connected. The 17 year old kid is the same kid who is frequently calling Ed. I know everything about anything in the Shaun of the Dead universe. For the record, dogs can look up.I quote movies all the time. I have never seen a movie that I quote more than Shaun of the Dead. I probably say ""you got red on you"" at least a few times a week. When I was 17 and somebody asked how old I was I would say 17 just like the kid in the movie. In fact, whenever I say 17 I say it like that kid in the store. Every scene has something funny in it through the script. The chemistry between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg drives this movie. They comedically play off each other all the time. ""There's a girl in the garden."" That entire scene is a riot. The throwing of the albums and kitchen objects was great. The zombie tackles Shaun and Ed goes in the house to get a camera. I laugh every time. Since I have seen this movie I call my mom ""mum"" instead of ""mom"" or"" mama"" that is the effect this movie had on me.The cinematography and camera angles are also really good. The beginning where the camera bounces back and forth between Shaun, David, Liz, and the other girl was great. The scene where Shaun and Ed are trying to come up with a plan was even better. It is little things like the teeth being brushed to the toilet flushing to the pinning of the Shaun name tag makes this movie great, that and the constant laughs.Every character in this movie was great. I love Ed, sympathize for Shaun, understand Liz, hate David, and am annoyed with Shaun's mum and the other girl I can never remember the name of. The story is at times obvious, like David being in love with Liz and that causing a love triangle between Liz, him, and Shaun. Now throughout the movie I wanted David dead. He was so obnoxious, all he does is complain and be an idiot, but that poor guy did not deserve what he got. Ed is obviously the best character with laughs from beginning to end. He is a guy I would easily get along with and as dumb as he is the friendship he has with Shaun is real. They have a real brotherhood and I love every second of it.Bottom line, this is a zombie movie. A very funny zombie movie but still a zombie movie so that means a few things. The zombies, the gore, and the endgame. The zombies in this movie look fantastic and the gore is great. When the zombie goes through the pole and her guts go everywhere was unexpected and disturbing, but also kind of funny. I really hope somebody laughed other than me. This movie did get serious as well and had some really emotional moments as well. There is one scene that is just so hard to watch and that is the climax with Shaun vs. David. That scene was so well done and watching the chaos was so entertaining. Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs but I guess I need to address the big question of is it better than Hot Fuzz. No. Plain and simple. The reason, Queen. That scene when Queen comes on the jukebox is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Shaun Ed and Liz are beating the bartender with pool sticks. The zombies are trying to get in, the fire extinguisher going along with the song, everything in this scene worked. I can just see the writers laughing over it as they write it and Edgar Wright directing it with a huge smile. Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs. There is not a single thing I don't like about this movie. If I had to choose it would be that it is a British comedy and the accents can be too much and some of the language is hard to understand, but who cares. It never slows down, the laughs never stop, and I could watch this every day. I watched this movie countless times with an old friend and I suggest you watch this with as many people as possible. I have never met a person who has not liked this movie so it has to get the WillyT Seal of Approval. When Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright are together expect a seal of approval.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
An undead ringer for a dead funny film.,"What do you do when Zombies attack? Throw Sade records at them, of course. If you can't kill them, at least you'll put them to sleep. So begins the first line of defense against the undead in Edgar Wright's sometimes cheeky, often sentimental zombie flick, Shaun of the Dead.The film stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a loser who decides it's time to take control of his life and relationships just as the world happens to be suddenly overrun by the living dead. It also stars Kate Ashfield as Liz, his girlfriend who wants more than endless nights at the local pub, and Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's long time best friend whose crude nature rightfully annoys those around Shaun.The story begins with Liz expressing her concern over her relationship with Shaun. They spend their evenings at the Winchester, a local pub of questionable repute. Liz is ready for Shaun to grow up a little, and for the next phase in their lives together. Shaun fails to prove his commitment to change and Liz decides it's time to move on, just before zombies overrun the world. Heartwarming hilarity ensues as Shaun begins to finally show his resolve and rescue his close friends and family from the undead.Thematically, one of the film's central insights shows that those who resign themselves to apathy may as well be dead (or in this case, undead). This theme is particularly evident in a climatic scene where Shaun and the remaining members of his group are barricaded in The Winchester. Shaun's mother, Barbara, reveals that she's been bitten by a zombie and dies. David, Shaun's antagonist and friend of Liz, berates Shaun and cruelly tells him to kill his mother. His apathy enrages Shaun, who punches him after killing his zombified mother. The director, Edgar Wright, uses a high angle shot to catch David's reaction further emphasizing David's cowardly and low nature. Before David has a chance to fully come to terms with his apathetic nature and apologize to Shaun, zombies abduct him, illustrating the theme of apathy being a kind of death. Wright employs other film elements throughout the picture that may support this theme as well. For example, prior to the zombie invasion, Shaun and Ed say, ""you're dead"" or ""the next time I see him, he's dead"" in a you're-a-goner manner to several other characters in the film who each turn into zombies later. This small ironic motif may be Wright's way of further illustrating Shaun's perception of others' apathy.Of course, this review would be remiss without mentioning George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, a cult classic that also makes similar social commentary as zombies roam the American shopping mall in search of flesh, brains, and the best sales in town. While Wright's Shaun is a more tongue-in-cheek approach, the similarities are clear, and there are numerous subtle references to Romero's work throughout.Shaun of the Dead is not a typical horror parody, nor is it a typical romantic comedy. By utilizing different film elements, Wright actually makes a clever social commentary. Defying the horror genre by incorporating elements of comedy and romance, Shaun of the Dead proves many times over that apathy is perhaps the most unfortunate living death.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Day after day it's the same, dull existence full of trivial disagreements and nonsense.One day, as Shaun sleepwalks through his life, things are changing drastically around him.

"Witty, funny, dramatic: Shaun of the Dead is very enjoyable and undoubtedly worth watching","I saw this not to long ago, and I can safely say that it is not funny, but hilarious! Shaun of the Dead is an excellent parody of Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead. Shaun is your average British guy who lives with a friend that mooches off of him (Ed) and a girlfriend who just broke up with him (Liz) and a mom who has a very distant relationship with him. (Barbara) During one odd day, Shaun and Ed notice that the townspeople seem to be staggering and groaning. Weird. It becomes weirder when they start biting and even weirder when the news starts warning people to stay inside their houses, because the townspeople have turned into zombies.The film is well-known for being funny. Apparently, Shaun's dry wit of the situation makes the viewers able to laugh. My friend and I had to re-play the scene where Shaun encounters a zombie and makes a bit of a song with him. It was that funny. The other scenes aren't as funny, but still worth a decent laugh. Shaun certainly provides the silliness needed to pull of big laughs. I also thought the sense of irony made it funny.David: (while Shaun is off fighting zombies) ""And what's Shaun's big plan? Sitting around in the dark eating peanuts?"" Shaun: (perhaps ten minutes later) Would anybody like a peanut? Aside from that, the film is also a good horror and thriller. Yes, it is a comedy, but it isn't a comedy so silly that it messes up the story line, just to get a decent laugh. The story is the same as Night of the Living Dead, except perhaps a bit sillier. Who says parodies can't be thrilling? I also thought it could qualify as a drama. Various scenes of death and revealed secrets make it fairly emotional. Zombies eating and killing everybody doesn't exactly make you feel good. The characters slightly fall apart, as emotions take over logic, which causes the characters to need to pull together and fight harder in the situation.There were two main flaws in the movie. The first is that it may be WAY too gory for some people. Yes, it is a zombie movie, but is viewing somebody's insides fully necessary? The second one is that the film lessens as a comedy and becomes more of a drama during the part when the group enters the pub. It takes away some of the light-hearted tone, and takes a more serious tone. I do like drama, but that was kind of disappointing for me, because I really loved the witty comedic moments Shaun of the Dead had to offer.None of the jokes are over-drawn or too stupid to prevent a laugh. They come by the minute, each one funnier then the next. It really made my day.8.5/10Good: Funny, light-hearted, witty, and makes a decent horror, thriller and comedyBad: It's pretty gory, and seems to put an emphasis on horror and drama halfway through the film, which decreases it's comedic level.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Best zombie build-up ever,"Yes, we all know about how terrific, original, creative, funny, etc. this movie is, but there is one aspect of ""Shaun of the Dead"" that tends to be overlooked. One thing that - to my knowledge - no zombie movie has ever pulled off as well as Shaun, maybe because of the expectations an audience has of a zombie comedy as opposed to a flat-out zombie movie, and that is the zombie build-up. Think about it: Night of the Living Dead had a zombie show up to motivate the plot within the first five minutes; Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead both started ""in medias zombie,"" and even if the zombies weren't actually on screen for the first fifteen or twenty minutes, they were the driving force behind the plot. I liked 28 Days Later (which was, in form and execution, a zombie movie with slightly modified monsters), but I was a little disappointed that they skipped over the 28 days of chaos after the Rage virus emerged. Let's face it, nobody deals with the day-to-day mechanics of a zombie invasion. Until now.By using the romantic-comedy element of the movie, the filmmakers were able to move the movie from the start without using zombies; you have twenty minutes of relationship comedy with weird elements in the background, and you get to watch as the world slowly collapses into zombified chaos. Now that's brilliant. The characters aren't ""zombie movie"" characters, they're romantic comedy characters who suddenly have to fight the undead; again, that's brilliant. Let's face it, we don't live our lives like a zombie movie. If there are lots of police sirens going off, or people running down the street in a panic we figure there's lots of crime and people are morons. That's what makes zombie movies so effective; it's not like these are aliens conquering the earth. Zombies are just like us. ""Shaun of the Dead"" plays zombies for laughs, but at the end - as in any good zombie movie - whatever we're laughing at is really, truly terrifying.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Near-perfect homage,"This is often marketed as a parody to Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"", but it's so much more than that. The clever writing makes this a movie with many layers.

It's been three days since I watched this movie and I'm still unbelievably amused by ""We're coming to get you, Barbara"". Then, it's a straight-forward laugh-out-loud comedy. My favourite moment in the entire movie is when they try to kill a couple of zombies by throwing LP's through their faces. That scene was already in the theatre trailer, so I must have seen it countless times by now, but it still gets me every time. Surprisingly, this movie also has some good straight-up horror value. I really didn't expect this to be so gory, the cartoon violence is definitely a plus and fits right in. I also liked how I actually cared about which characters lived and which characters died for a change. That's pretty rare in recent horror efforts, so it was unexpected to find this quality in of all things, ""Shaun Of The Dead"". Long story short: ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is effing awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
hmmmm.....watchable i suppose,"i am sure that whilst the tongue in cheek, jump on the zombie genre bandwagon, appeals to a wide audience...it misses a great opportunity to have been as big of a cult film as They Live & Army of Darkness. these are remembered decades after their release...i say here and now in 3 years people will say Shaun who?always a great supporter of Brit flicks, i really wanted to enjoy this, there were great moments, but like eating a Chinese takeaway you are never fully satisfied.nevertheless a rainy night with nothing to do this film will suffice, but look for more comedic moments in a Christmas cracker might prove more fruitful...!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Shaun, Liz and Ed: Killers of Undead","Shaun of the Dead. Oh, isn't it great? Well, if you haven't taken a shortcut before, SOTD is a British romantic comedy with zombies, or a zom-rom-com. So, kill your stepfather, and bring your friends, mum, ex and her friends to the Winchester, have a nice pint of beer, and wait for this review to blow over.Our story begins with hero... sorry, I mean, broke salesman Shaun, as he has to go to work, and stops at the shop for a drink. He breaks up with his girlfriend, gets drunk with best friend Ed, and the next day, heads to the shop to buy a drink and a Cornetto. However, there appears to be... something wrong with the streets on London, but Shaun doesn't notice. Back home, he turns on the news to find panic on the streets of London, as reports state people literally being eaten alive. With the attackers, who are dead excited. However, complications arise, they make a plan, take some shortcuts, and they're at the Winchester. I'll stop to avoid spoilers.A great film! Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have made a great film. On your first watch, just sit back and enjoy the show. On many other watches, look in the background for other jokes, including The Who zombies! George Romero's opinions even state this as a great film. It got cameos from Pegg and Wright in Land of the Dead as zombies.A must watch comedy: With high reviews and great expectations. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm dead excited for my date at the Winchester, but first, to wash my shirt. There's red on it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Good Zombie Comedy,"The zombie comedy film is a subgenre that has been around for virtually as long as the zombie film itself. A lot of people love them. Usually I do not. I had head that this one was good so I decided to give it a try.Immediately I noticed the good production values and strong humor.

No complete story,"As with Hot Fuzz, these directors had the same problem in this earlier production, which most story writers have the hardest battle with: to create a story line with all the strings tied together into a complete movie with a good ending.Although Hot Fuzz turned out to be a real story mess, Shaun of the Dead feels like it is able to stay on track the longer, mainly probably because the story line in a typical zombie movie is so easily predictable to copy.With that said, I can only say that Shaun of the Dead follows the now typical pattern of a great start, with a ""meh"" ending.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Zombies Can Be Funny? WHAT?,"I was very surprised by how much I loved this movie. Throughout the past few years, every once in a while, something by Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost (others including Spaced and Hot Fuzz, which I will see very soon) caught my attention, but never enough to make me buy it. Since I saw it for a very low price, I took a chance I'll never regret. This movie was a terribly fun homage to zombie flicks (mainly the Romero trilogy) and horror films in general mixing in a very unique brand of comedy only these people could make. This movie easily takes a twist from a horror/comedy, to a drama/horror, and back to a comedy (less of a horror). This may sound like a very harmless horror flick, but some violence gets very graphic, one of which is a homage to both Dawn and Day of the Dead. Overall, watch this movie, for it's a LOT of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

This is not a stupid movie, as it knows what it is doing and does it well.

A stunning film that lives up to all its promise,"Shaun of the Dead is superb. Simple as that. It is clearly targeted at fans of Spaced and university students. It will entertain both. The script is razor sharp and loaded with jokes. Nick Frost excels in particular as Simon Pegg's co-star. Most of the big names from the current crop of British comics make an appearance, if only fleetingly, in a film that is perfectly paced and a joy to watch. There is nothing pretentious about this film, which is refreshing to see in a world of schmaltzy Hollywood blockbusters. There is a good dose of comedy violence, well played out, and adding to the film immensely. Simon Pegg is rapidly becoming one of Britain's national treasures. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold. Long may it continue!!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"Not as good as sequel, Hot Fuzz, and a bit dull","I watched ""Hot Fuzz"" before this movie. Watching ""Hot Fuzz"" made me want to see this movie really bad. I loved ""Hot Fuzz""'s original style of humor (British comedy !!!) and its great acting, along with intricate plot. The camera work from Wright was different from any American films I've ever seen and made the film much more comedic and hilarious, and not stuck in 'one situation.' Hot Fuzz was one of my favorite movies of 2007. But when I watched ""shaun of the dead"" I was not laughing, and the plot did not get me involved in the movie either. The jokes were lack-luster compared to ""Hot Fuzz"". Much of the comedy doesn't fit in. The acting is what got me through the movie, the expressions on the main character (Shaun)'s face actually had me laughing more than the jokes themselves. Watch this movie for the acting, not the jokes and plot/acting (there really is not a plot) but if you don't like this movie watch ""Hot Fuzz"", you'll definitely be laughing at that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Convincing British effort, which is so much more than mere pastiche as it integrates class comedy and character study-alike rather well.","Filmmakers and writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, in tandem, prove they're more than adept at producing a high on energy levels; high on laughs comedy material in their 2004 film Shaun of the Dead. Their film is a big on fun, big on smarts comedy-romance piece about a clash of classes and a man going through somewhat of a midlife crisis just as the end of the world, in the form of the dead coming back to life so as to feed on the living, arrives into the world. The film is a merciless series of rapid punchlines and in-jokes, entertaining and effective in equal measure without ever feigning to be anything more; a piece made by two people whom have here shown they have the comic timing and the subtly required to take on the kind of material they do. Take, for instance, the scene in which certain characters are trapped inside a locked car because the rear door child-locks are on. It was established five minutes ago that they were on, but such a gag works thanks largely to Wright and Pegg's ability to introduce something; place it on the back-burner and then execute the joke when required to around all the other stuff in the form of character, more immediate gags that are going on and great peril which is unfolding.One casts one's mind back to David Zucker's 2003 film My Boss's Daughter; a comedy free freak show whose comic timing awkwardly consisted of someone, in Ashthon Kutcher, inept and cack-handed placed in the delicate situation of looking after a pristine home and charged with looking after the pride and joy of its owner in the form of a pet owl. The sounds of the gears of an automobile being incorrectly changed as it approaches a speed began to sound pretty early on, sure enough, everything goes down the pan in an as limp manner as possible in what was an excruciating feature. The team on Shaun of the Dead set a joke up; mix it in with a couple of others; have you momentarily misplace it before effortlessly executing the punch-line minutes later amidst everything else that's happening. In comparison, it is a bravado display of both comic timing on top of entertaining material. Another example might be the anger levels reached by one character, whose berating at others stems from the fact the front door is persistently being left open overnight; the gag of which is set up, placed on a back-burner and then pulled off with aplomb when the time comes.It is Simon Pegg playing the titular Shaun, a man in his late twenties working in a high-street electronics store whilst supervising the more younger employees. He lives with part-time drug dealer but the generally unemployed Ed (Frost) and whom we're led to believe is a high-flying businessman in Pete (Serafinowicz), both of whom Shaun have known for many years. Shaun's relationship with Liz (Ashfield) is on the rocks, they sit in a public house named The Winchester with some of her friends and discuss where they stand. The pair of them clash in profile, Ed's more centralised figure as he works a slot machine and spouts one-liners distracting us from what Liz has to say. She wants more out of life and wants a better relationship with Shaun in which they do more together rather than just go to the pub. The parallel between their disfigured connection to that of David (Moran) and Dianne's (Davis), Liz's friends, relationship is clear in that their's is sturdier and have interests of a 'higher' nature such as the going to theatres. This is precisely where Liz wishes to be, in terms of status, with Shaun. The earlier clash in profile has David and Dianne sit on Liz's side, effectively a clashing of classes, as Shaun's accomplice Ed comes over and alienates everybody with his demeanour.Shaun and Ed appear so tuned out of their lives that they appear to have missed the apocalypse. Two sequences that mirror one another show Shaun, in one long tracking shot, walking from his home; down the street and into a local shop before coming back again. The items of a kid playing football; a local washing his car and those in and around a local corner shop reoccur in both sequences, the first time Shaun ventures there everything appearing rosy and functioning in a supposedly Utopian world of the working class and of terrace housing. Later on, a similar sequence post-epidemic is provided with the same route taken with similar elements along the way thus suggesting a link between the two existences or 'worlds'. Shaun's inability to tell the respective worlds apart is quite biting, while the zombie-like people plodding to work on board a bus very early on suggests alienation and disenchantment with their functioning lives; an overlying sense of the Western world in the form of seemingly happy kids playing football in the street amidst terrace housing and the working class and their cars already well on its way to ruin.The film scores points for moulding in the epidemic of the coming of the zombies with the drama going on between partners and housemates as well as it does. This isn't a film as interested in delivering horror genre frills involving zombies as much as it is interested, for the most part, in dealing with character and story. The film is effectively Shaun's shot at proving his worth to Liz, the winning of her back by way of proving his worth to her and ticking off all the more minor items which plagued the development of their relationship before, specifically the inability to fabricate a meeting with Shaun's mother and the threat of competition from David whom it is established is attracted to Liz. The film is a really enjoyable, expertly pitched piece full of heart and genuinely funny – the likes of which ought to be embraced.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
I don't understand...,"Hi everyone, I'm french and i like movies a lot, i watch like at least a movie per day. I watched Shaun of the dead last night with two of my friends and we thought the jokes were ridiculous and we would all give this film a 2.5. I won't develop on how bad the acting is etc... but I just want to know what did we miss. For example I read that Phillip's speech was very moving and i hope it was sarcasm. The point is so far I trusted IMDb a lot. IMDb was my reference and when a film had more than 7.5, I knew it was going to be good and now my friends make fun of me because of this film I made them see because it was High rated. I'm very frustrated, are there other people who felt the same way ???p.s: don't tell me I don't get British humor I'm fan of monthy python and I like it when people go crazy doing weird stuff and abstract jokes but sorry nothing like this in Shaun of the dead.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"A Laugh Out Loud, Fond Satire of Zombie Movies","""Shaun of the Dead"" is a delightfully funny satire of ""28 Days Later. . ."" specifically, and of zombie movies in general.Taking place simultaneous to ""28 Days,"" but in a more suburban location, it both spoofs that film and provides yet another alternative, and much more amusing, ending, just when you think the joke has played out and writer/director Edgar Wright has literally backed his characters into a corner.Not only is the script laugh out loud funny, but the comic actors produce giggles on sight as they play their slackers completely straight and cheerfully well-meaning and foible-consistent throughout as they learn something about themselves, even as it pokes fun at this genre that usually has a nebbish rise up to be a hero.The loud musical choices add to the ironic merriment, even if some are used as complicated background set-ups for one-liners.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
An thoroughly enjoyable romp,"First let me say that generally I do not find Simon Pegg funny generally. I tend to rate most of his comic characters only slightly above ""Mr. Bean"". But, having said that, this film is a very refreshing comedy-horror flick. It is like an updated Hammer House of Horror (though with fewer heaving breasts). There are a whole bunch of little visual jokes that really make this film, as well as the character interaction.I would recommend this film to everyone over about 15. Yes there is quite a bit of comic violence, but what you just have to have it in this sort of flick. It was not a film that made me laugh out loud very often, but it definitely kept me entertained. I am just glad they did not remake it in the US (yet) with a baseball bat substituted for the cricket bat - although either would be equally effective!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
This film should be the staple of any movie-goer.,"As a normal movie-goer, I feel as though it's rather difficult to find a quality modern horror film. A lot of the films you buy tickets to watch today lack originality, they don't grip you like some of the classics would, they feel void of meaning. ""Shaun of the Dead"" blasts through all of these barriers, providing its own unique approach to the genre, engaging you in the plot, and provides a meaningful theme that even a lot of classics don't have.It's hard to sustain anything other than adrenaline when the focus is on horror alone. This is why it's not uncommon to see horror films paired with comedy -- it induces a little thought into the movie. ""They Live,"" ""American Werewolf in London,"" and the Holy Grail of the combo (at least for me) ""Army of Darkness"" all employ this tactic successfully. Extreme cheesiness the likes of which we see in ""Re-Animator"" sometimes works out great, and one might expect that in a self-described romantic comedy-horror. Strangely enough, the cheese is absent. So what does ""Shaun of the Dead"" provide that is unique? The Pegg-Frost force plays out great, and the subtlety, the one-liners, the goofiness, all fit together perfect and complement the horror. The movie delivers on its promise. It is a >romantic comedy< with horror coming second. You'll get a kick out of the way the issues of basic survival take back seat to the characters' concerns for their relationships.It is these relationships which illustrate the characters above the two-dimensional. It is a contradiction. As a horror movie, you're waiting for these characters to be food for a ravenous horde of zombies. By the end, you're on the edge of your seat to see how the characters' relationship problems work themselves out. It's not enough to scare the crap out of you (wouldn't be very funny if it was), but it is enough to keep you concerned.By the end, you can see how the plot works full circle. It speaks to the mundaneness of life. The main character was not fond of the cycle (implied by the banal routines of himself and those around him) he was trapped in because it was pushing him away from the person he loves. Small changes did not help him. It required a huge change in order for him to break this routine and possibly reestablish his relationship, and this change is practically forced upon him by the disaster he and his friends experience. This is true for all the characters, as they are able to speak their minds and resolve conflicts in relationships as the movie carries on. In a parallel fashion, we can look at ourselves and find aspects of our routine that we dislike and can't seem to break out of. Maybe you tried to quit smoking by smoking fewer and fewer cigarettes each day. Did you fail? Try quitting cold turkey, taking up exercising, and reforming the relationships you have. Keep those routines that you are fond of, and move away RIGHT NOW from all of those which bother you.""Shaun of the Dead"" is an excellent, funny movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you're seven years behind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A fun horror movie.,"Shaun of the Dead is a British import, and apparently was a big hit overseas. It's tag line is ""A Romantic Comedy. With Zombies."" and I think that about sums the movie up. It's not necessarily a spoof on zombie movies like I had expected but a homage to George Romero and horror movies in general. In a recent Fangoria article, the director even admitted that the movie should take place in the same universe as the Romero trilogy of zombie flicks - and that this was a representation of what was happening in Great Britain at the same time. There is plenty of humor but at the core it's a love story. I think it's a great date movie actually if you and your loved one dig horror. I can't say it's my favorite zombie movie (Dawn of the Dead wins that honor) but it's one of my favorite comedies this year. It's just a good time at the movies, and if you hate hard-core horror this is a good alternative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

I had wanted to root for his character, until I realized that HE wrote the script.

An amazing zombie flick with humour and gore,"I'll kick off this review by saying... Simon Pegg and Nick Frost work so well together! If a film has these 2 actors in, it's bound to be great!This film is totally epic. It's a mash-up mainly of 3 genres: Action, Comedy and Horror... But with some elements of Rom-Com and Thriller.The action is extremely over-the-top and gory (full of blood, guts and brain splatter). Also it has some VERY funny scenes (including the 'Don't Stop Me Now' bar scene) but also some very sad character deaths.Simon Pegg-as usual- gives a great performance as Shaun, a 29 year old loser with a dull, easy life and a job in an electronics store. When he's not working at the electronics store, he lives with his goofball best friend, Ed (Nick Frost- who also gives a great performance!), in a small flat on the outskirts of London where they mainly mess around and eat Cornettos. But his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), wishes desperately for Shaun to grow up and be a man. When the town is overrun with zombies, Shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both Liz and her friends and his mother (Penelope Wilton).It has some very good acting performances and funny dialogue, but also some very sad scenes. Overall it is a great mash-up of genres and it all works and comes together to make one hell of a movie.So I give 'Shaun Of The Dead' a 9.75/10 or 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"Great,British comedy!","What a film. Truly one of the funniest British comedies ever made certainly the best rom-com-zom I have ever seen. There are many reasons why it is worth a watch. One is the broad range of humour as it combines witty intelligent humour with simple slapstick comedy to make a wide spectrum of humour also meaning it is harder to get bored or find the humour less powerful. Director Edgar wright stylistically gives us a false sense of security as well as the humour. Surprisingly whilst it is a comedy and one of my favourite funny films off all time and some moments of the film are daft it is more profound than at first glance. The power struggles within protagonist Shaun's life are underrated and it is all about him. Mainly the relationship with him and his girlfriend Liz showed how he struggled in everyday life to cope with keeping her romantically interested with the pressure of his kind of friend David. The relationship between him and David shows that he is a decent character, as they both wrestle psychologically for Liz even though David is in a relationship with Dianne. Whilst the disaster of the zombie outbreak causes his David's character to surface in a negative and he becomes weaker and more resentful Shaun's character emerges in a more positive way as he steps up to become the leader and hero of his gang. The relationship which put most strain on the Shaun was his with Ed as well as Pete. Shaun struggles to defend Ed who is almost blind to what Shaun has done for him, which leads to Shaun doubting his own friendship with Ed when Pete asks aggressively about why they are so close as friends. But the funniest relationship of the film which gave the film a distinct sense of character was the hilarious relationship between Ed and Shaun's mother Barbara there was a tentative nature from Ed showing his child like mentality and there was something endearing about it as well as it being funny and because she is so funny. Barbara is the embodiment of the typical British mother so concerned about everyone else as she ""doesn't want to cause a fuss""; in a stereotypically British way she offers a different character ark to the usual characters in a zombie film someone so oblivious to what is going on. Although the lack of response from anyone is also funny, particularly the scene when Shaun goes down to his local shop and is completely oblivious to the carnage around him and in a typically London argent way goes about his business. Edgar Wright's sense of direction can easily be forgotten but the way he plays around with our expectations of this genre by using mise-en-scene and sound to make us both scared and make us laugh. The media are cleverly employed to spell out to Shaun and Ed and add their own brand of strange humour and the montage bit it is a clever part of the film to address the zombie issue. Overall it lacks significant development in plot as well as enough technical features to be considered an absolute classic but still it is a pioneering film which brings a unique and quirky brand of humour. With intertextual references to The Deer Hunter, Reservoir Dogs and the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers add extra humour to this awesome film and should be watched by all fans of film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun of the Dead-If U like Romero/Python Pick This Up,"This was one of the best movies I saw in the last year or two. The acting was good, the plot was fairly well thought out, and it was very funny. It helps if you are a zombie movie(i.e. G. Romero)fan and enjoy British type humor(like the Monty Python troupe), but if you are neither it will not stop you from enjoying this movie. It is a weird mix of several genres(coming of age, buddy movie, comedy, love, horror)but it definitely works on all levels. The main characters(Shaun and Ed)will definitely remind you of some slacker you knew(or know) The facial expressions, dialogue, and general behavior of these two make for some of the best scenes in the movie.

It's so funny to watch this movie and see the irony of all the lines before the zombies really start to be a problem (Next time I see him, he's dead; or what I will say is this: it's not the end of the world) and also, the fact that everything, and I mean everything in the movie repeats itself (at the start, Shaun is watching Ed play 1st person shooter on PS2 and says top left, reload, nice shot, and then in middle in Winchester, Shaun is shooting a rifle, Ed says top left, reload, nice shot), (Shaun is talking to Liz about their r relationship and she says ""if I don't do something..."", Shaun says what do you mean do something?, then in front of Winchester with zombies all around, Shaun says if I don't do something..., Liz says what do you mean do something?), (Would you like To A Wonderful Mum or Pow! Supermum Uh the first one, You want the girl or the bloat Uh the first one). It's just really cool to see all that, and each time you watch it you notice something more. Also, it has plenty of references to Romero movies (we're coming to get you, Barbera) along with all the jokes and funny situations. And adding some intense violence couldn't hurt either. It's just a great movie all around and I would recommend it to anyone who pays really close attention to the dialog and the radios in the background or TV's because that's where most of the jokes are and otherwise you won't find it very funny. Best part: The part when Shaun tries to take a shortcut over the 20 garden fences.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Don't forget to kill Phillip,"At last a successful British Comedy that doesn't involve upper middle class people falling in and out of love (see love actually, Bridgette Jones, 4 weddings etc.) The film is manic and a little surreal in places but thrown in are some slower dramatic moments which compliment the comedy superbly.It is pretty much what it says on the poster a romantic comedy with zombies, there are some nice touches that comment on the modern style of living. The laughs come thick and fast top scene goes to a memorable zombie death by vinyl LP's. A class act we can only hope they'll team up again for another film, with them all being big star wars fans who knows Darth Vader as a zombie anyone?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Golden middle,"I'm reading reviews and trying to find golden middle with no success. Audience considers this movie either the best or the worst British movie of the year. British have an unusual and for the rest of us often incomprehensible sense of humor. If you're used to Hollywood this probably won't entertain you. I suppose that most of the lowest ratings came from USA. At the other hand, I think this movie is overrated and that most of the tens, that pulled it to an average of eight, came largely from Britain. From my point of view, this is solid movie for one watching. I wouldn't call it a comedy. It is horror adventure sprinkled with lots of humor, British humor that tries not to be too British, but to adapt to the wider audience. And in that attempt lies it's biggest issue. Also, it is very difficult to mix genres, especially if there's too many. Although this movie somewhat succeeds in that attempt it didn't quite shine. Still, we have to acknowledge this brave attempt to make something unusual. All together, if you're not a fan of recent British film don't even give it a try, but if you are able to slip into British state of mind I think you'll enjoy this flick. I surely did.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Over-Rated,"I watched it today on the insistence of many other zombie film fans that stated it was somehow 'one of the best, if not the best zombie film' and definitely feel cheated during and after watching. Which can only lead me to say, that it's highly overrated.It fell very flat to me and I didn't find it amusing at all, nor special in any way. Not to say it's bad, it's perfectly acceptable - but I certainly didn't think it was worthy of this 'cult classic' label that people give it, and the high rating it has here on IMDb.com and all the talk it gets about it.Honestly, I have no idea why people recommend it the way they do. I get that humor and what people find entertaining is subjective - but I just don't understand the appeal here.There are definitely better zombie genre films, with better stories, and better characters, out there to enjoy compared to this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

An Instant Classic!,"It has been nearly 10 years since the release of one of the greatest zombie movies ever made. This film started the infectious zombie craze that still lingers today. I'm taking about Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. A cult fan boy film from the start ""Shaun's"" mix of dry British humor and graphic zombie violence has made it's claim as one of the best. Its a romantic comedy with zombies. It's a buddy picture with zombies. It's many things to many people, but above all it's just a fun movie.Simon Pegg plays Shaun, a regular guy who likes nothing more that to spend time with his friends at the local pub called The Winchester. His best mate is Ed an overweight and crude but harmless schlub who has been friends with Shaun since primary school. Liz is Shaun's way to hot girlfriend who is fed up with there stale and predictable relationship. Shaun also lives with his older and more put together brother who tells him to ""Get your s**t together!"". Shaun works as a supervisor at an electronics store with a bunch of unmotivated chowder heads who don't pay any attention to him or what he has to say. To round out Shaun's circle of people is his kind but spacey mum and cold and stern step father Phillip, played by Bill Nighy.After a long night of drinking at the Winchester, Shaun's usual surroundings start to look a little off. Unknown to him and Ed it seems that the zombie apocalypse has struck. It's kind of hard to notice these things when everybody acts like zombies in their everyday lives. Shaun and Ed finally come to the conclusion that something is not right and hatch a plan to rescue their friends and family and find a safe place to wait out this annoying apocalypse thing. The premise is simple but extremely well done. The script is packed with several memorable one liners and gags that make it fun for multiple viewings.With their true to life characters and the smart insightful dialogue, filmmaker Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, seem to be channeling Kevin Smith and his debut film ""Clerks"". Along with 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"" and 2013's ""The World's End"" these three film created the ""Cornetto Trilogy"". A Cornetto being an ice cream cone something like a Drumstick, that appears in each film. If it isn't already obvious ""Shaun"" is a movie that should be bought and watched regularly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Watch Between The Shots! ♦ 80%,"There is more fun in the backgrounds and the foregrounds of the sequences of this movie than the original screenplay. This has to be the single reason why it is a great piece of cinema in its new genre.Comedy & horror rarely go together unless it is some blown-off horror flick which tickles your bone. But, Shan Of The Dead is different as it directly jumps into the scene. What follows is the survival strategy of a group who are not in good terms with each other. Human emotions galore as zombies try to eat the sapiens.Very strong cinematography pumped with good music makes this a good comedy. With all the gore involved, the horror is lukewarm. Performances are absolutely stunning, especially by Simon Pegg & the girl who played his girlfriend. Zombies did great, too.Although, towards halfway, the plot does slip into monotony and carries on to induce ennui for some time. But,t hat's forgettable.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended because there are not many movies like it. 8/10!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"Hollywood, pay attention to this film!!!!","Because THIS is how it's done. As the world's first ever romantic comedy with zombies, 'Shaun' excels in every facet of its story. Want a decent enough romantic comedy, it's here (although the comedy outweighs the romance). Want graphic moments of zombie carnage? They're here.Plot line is simple enough, a down on his luck electronics salesman loses his girlfriend after blowing an important date, and after hearing the occasional snippet of news about a returning satellite, wakes up the next day to a zombie nightmare. He then snaps into action, going to rescue his mother (Barbara, played by Penelope Wilton) and Liz and takes them to the local pub. Coming along for the ride are Shaun's college roommate Ed (Nick Frost), who hasn't quite gotten out of the slacker mode, and Liz's roommates David and Dianne (Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis).Great British humor lines practically every frame of the film, the romantic aspect is there, but never tries to overwhelm the film, and when the film kicks in with the zombie aspect in the last third, it packs quite a horror wallop.Everything balances perfectly in the mix, and while the comedy does tend to be very prevalent, the references to its zombie (but don't say that word, Shaun doesn't like it) past is obvious. Many situations are closer to Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' than the obvious 'Dawn of the Dead' reference in the title would have you think.Acting is top notch from Simon Pegg on down to the zombie extras. Nothings forced, nothing comes off as silly or corny, this is a perfectly crafted film.Best of all, this isn't even one of those homage type films where you have to look to catch the references, they just pop out at you in a groanless glory.Best film of the year, hands down.5 out of 5",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Solid first feature from Pegg, Frost and Wright","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a smart, funny homage to zombie movies while also maintaining its own identity instead of relying entirely on genre clichés. This film marked the first theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright and is a mostly solid affair. The performances and directing are all handled well, but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I was expecting. Maybe it's because British humor isn't something I 100% get. Still, I thought that the gore was well-done, tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that I cared what happened to them. For me, the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horror-comedy. Overall, it's one of the better horror-comedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Hilarious!,"Shaun of the Dead is a movie that would please both comedy and horror fans. This film had me laughing my brains for the duration of the film. There were also some creepy moments as well. This movie is the first movie in the trilogy starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This is the way to start off a comedy trilogy.This film is pretty much about some guy, his best friend, his family, and his girlfriend trying to avoid zombies.Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great chemistry. They were totally hilarious! I was surprised to see Bill Nighy. He also delivered the goods in the film.Overall, this is a hilarious ""horror"" film. But be forewarned, most Americans will be surprised at the British humor in the film. But, I'm sure they will get used to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Funny in places, but not as good as most people say...","I am a big fan of the Spaced series, and Big Train, so I was familiar with Simon Pegg and his excellent writing and acting. I went to see this film at the cinema with a mate who introduced me to Spaced. When we left the cinema, my mate was still buzzing off the film. I was fairly quiet about the whole thing, thinking to myself that the film really could have been a lot better.Sure, they've taken on the zombie movie genre, highlighting the numerous faults with the premise, and along the way they've made us chuckle along. However, this film fails in a number of ways, and could really have been an absolute classic, in Airplane terms.The primary factor that spoils the movie is the unrealistic nature of Nick Frost's character, and how a friend like him would not be a friend were he to be like he is all the time. He was just too annoying to be accepted and taken as a realistic character. Pegg essentially plays the straight man to Frost's funny man. The biggest contributor to Frost's annoyingly poor character has to be Frost's poor acting, when compared to the rest of the cast. This could be a reflection of the script, which also could have been better, or even a reflection of Edgar Wright, and how he isn't quite there yet with his art, but is close.Frost spoils the film for me, and for that reason, this film is not in any way a classic. It's worth watching a couple of times, but to be mentioned in the same breath as films like Airplane is something people are too quick to do. It's decent, but not as good as it could have been, with a bit more tweaking and the replacement of Nick Frost with a good actor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"What exactly is ""Spaced""?","I've read a lot about how ""Shaun of the Dead"" borrows a lot from a TV show called ""Spaced"". I have to admit that I've never heard of ""Spaced"". But even so, this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it's sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it, and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I'd never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing ""SOTD"", but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline's wife in ""Cry Freedom"") and Bill Nighy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Hilarious, entertaining, enjoyable, but has an obvious plot","Mix horror, romance, a big dose of dark British humour  and you get a deadly concoction  you get Shaun of the Dead.Spoof movies so often fail with me, especially the Hollywood variety, such as Scary Movie, where you see the humour flying out at you from a mile away. I have to admit, I was a little hesitant about watching this movie. I only did so because my brother had it on DVD and insisted that I saw it. I also remember it being released in UK cinemas about the same time as the remake of the 70s zombie thriller, Dawn of the Dead, which I found disappointing and put me off watching zombie movies for a long time. But with Shaun of the Dead, I was pleasantly surprised.It starts with Shaun, the protagonist, played by screen-writer/funny-man, Simon Pegg. He's twenty-nine, stuck in a dead-end job, his seventeen year old colleague makes fun of him, he has an awkward flatmate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), he hates his scrutinising step-father Philip (Bill Nighly), he has issues with his mother Barbara (Penelope Winton), his lazy best-mate Ed holds him back in life (Nick Frost), he gets dumped by his girlfriend Jenny (Kate Ashfield) and he spends all day in the Winchester Pub. Yes, Shaun is in a bit of a rut. Then one night, without ever really knowing why, Shaun's locality becomes 'neighbourhood of the living dead'. He is at first oblivious to it all, suffering from a hangover, but soon he realises that zombies are after his blood and he has to buck up his ideas quickly to survive. For once in Shaun's life, he has a plan. With Ed as his side-kick and armed with a cricket bat, a spade and a box of old records (which, by the way, make amusing ninja weapons to fend off zombies), and he goes to save his mum and Jenny in Pete's car. Where does he plan to take them to safety? That's right  the Mecca of Shaun's life and the focal point of the film - the Winchester pub. On the way, Shaun picks up Philip and Jenny's house-mates David (Dylan Moran) and Dianne (Lucy Davis).The film contains what you expect from a horror, British comedy and romance (kind of); blood, gore, action, slapstick, sarcasm, a witty script, a love interest and, sadly, an obvious plot, but I will talk more about that later.It has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Shaun and Ed realise the first zombie they meet isn't actually a drunk girl, but a dead person who wants their blood. And when the group pretend to behave like zombies so they don't bring attention to themselves from the living dead. You will learn there is more than one use to a garden swing-ball. The end is also charming, but I don't want to speak about that.The acting is convincing for a spoof movie. Especially the lazy, rather obnoxious, Ed, played by Nick Frost, who decides to have a friendly chat on a mobile phone with a mate while surrounded by zombies. He plays your annoying fat mate who slows your life down, but is full of clever quips every now and again. He would also go off on hilarious rants with Shaun about, well, not a fat lot. I wouldn't say there were many outstanding performances or Oscar nominations in the movie though, but the movie was not made for awards. It was made to make you laugh, which is what you will undoubtedly be doing. So therefore, the co-writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (the same team who made the comedy TV-series Spaced and the new movie the Big Fuzz) have certainly achieved their aim.Now back to the plot. For someone who is not a big fan of spoof movies, the storyline was so obvious, I only had to glance at the title of the movie to guess what was going to happen, and without wanting to ruin the movie for you, I was right. I can't decide if it was a spoof movie of Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, but that's of little importance, the plot is too similar, for my liking anyway.I'm not the prude sort, and I think when violence, blood and expletives are used correctly, it can make a good film. I don't think Shaun of the Dead was over-run by it, but I do think it maybe should have warranted more than a 15 certificate. I do not think the film is everybody's cup of tea. The sarcasm and the wittiness I particularly liked, and the fact it was a fun, chill-out film to watch. But British humour, especially the sarcasm, and the violence and the swearing, can be hit and miss with many people. I also think more can have been done with Bill Nighly's, Dylan Moran's and Martin Freeman's characters. They are great actors and had relatively small roles than what their reputations deserve. I think Martin Freeman only had two words to say in the whole film. Maybe the actors only wanted small roles, I don't know. But I felt they were wasted, only a little as there was much more talent in the film that made up for it.There might be something else that you unexpectedly take away from this movie. The film may motivate you, to give you a 'kick up the posterior' and change your life. For Shaun, it took a town full of zombies to make him do this. I certainly hope it takes considerably less than that for the majority of you.To conclude, as I said before, I'm not a fan of spoofs, due to predictable plots and story lines, but this is way above its contemporaries. It's British. It's different. And it's dead funny; so funny you'll be laughing beyond the grave.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

A comedy you can take a bite out of,"'Shaun of the Dead', directed by Edgar Wright presents us the tale of Shaun (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the script) who is an Average Joe, living in London who has your normal, run of the mill problems. He has an unsatisfying job, girlfriend troubles, no one gets along with his best friend Ed (the hilarious Nick Frost) and zombies are hunting him. He not only has to try to survive the day being surrounded by them, but has to protect his friends and some of his family while trying to defeat the living dead. For a guy who is very content to live his life in a rut, this proves to be quite a challenge.Luckily the jokes in 'Shaun of the Dead' are a hell of a lot funnier than my summary line for this review. I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard and so much at a film that didn't have anything to do with the Coen brothers. Not only is the humor in 'Shaun of the Dead' about as dark as it gets, but there are such witty moments that I was left shaking my head at the brilliance of the script. There are several moments where the humor is subtle, yet uproariously funny. A good example is when Shaun wakes up the morning the zombies have taken over, and, incredibly hung over, walks in a daze to the corner convenience store, he doesn't notice that there are huge bloody hand prints on the cooler door then suddenly slips on something the audience doesn't see, but assumes is some kind of blood or gore. This could have gone two other ways  either he wouldn't slip at all, or we would see what he slips on, but the way it was presented made it one of the many times I found myself crying from laughing so hard. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are also absolutely brilliant as best friends and our main protagonists. Their fantastic and natural acting, coupled with the 'real' feel of the dialogue made for some truly standout performances. I am not familiar with either actor, but if they are not already stars, this is surely their breakout film.The only criticism I have of the film is something that I may have even missed with all of my laughter  I have no idea why there was this sudden plague of the living dead. For a film as entertaining as this one, however, that kind of explanation is something that really isn't necessary; something that I am normally a stickler for. There were also some unexpected poignant moments that seemed out of place, but none of these criticisms diminished the overall effect the film had on me. I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that it is disappointing to say that this is not a film for everyone. Make no mistake, 'Shaun of the Dead' is at times extremely violent and quite gory, and it's blackest of black humor is not going to appeal to many, but if you want to see a brilliant comedy that is going to make you cringe while making you laugh out loud, this is your movie. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Funny zombie spoof...but not quite as funny as it could have been.,"This movie offers plenty of laughs for the most part and is a very enjoyable zombie spoof movie. Not quite as good though as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"", it still offers plenty to the viewer to see and laugh about. This movie is about a guy going through romantic problems, and other problems as well such as a dead end job and two other roommates that are on opposite ends of the spectrum causing headaches for our hero. While all these mundane things are going on there are numerous reports of strange happenings being announced, but our hero just switches the channel or ignores it and is completely oblivious to the fact zombies are going on a rampage. It is a bit of a slow set up, but it is funny watching him totally unaware of the fact people are being killed. Then the zombies attack in full force and the movie really picks up. Unfortunately, some times in the movie it seems to be an ""Airplane"" type spoof then in the next turn it gets a wee bit too serious for its own good. These scenes just don't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. However, it does not deter from the movie all that much and in the end it is very much a comedy first, romance second, and horror a distant third. Some rather nice zombie effects here and there as there is a scene where a zombie falls on a pipe, and another person gets pulled apart, but for the most part it is not a gore fest. In fact, in scenes where people do get killed it seems a bit out of place seeing how light hearted the movie is at times. Worth a look and worth more than a couple of laughs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Funny, gory ,perfect",This is my review of Shaun of the dead. It is a horror/comedy that is very enjoyable to watch. It mixes my two favorite genres together to make a very laughable blood fest.This movie is about two friends (pegg and frost) who live together. They live boring lives until one day a zombie outbreak strikes. Of course like any other zombie movie it does not say how the infection started it just kind of appears. They do their best to survive the infestation they face by rounding up friends and going to their favorite pub.This movie is filled with laughs from pegg and frost (very good actors in comedies in my opinion) and it is also filled with lots of blood and gore to keep to the traditional zombie movie style.This movie is definitely worth a watch. I kind of think they should make another movie with the same characters but make it a vampire comedy and call it from dusk till shaun. What does everyone think?,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A bit overrated if you ask me,"This movie was OK. But the thing that I didn't like about it was that it didn't have very many LAUGH-OUT-LOUD moments in it.

I prefer to go ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!"" rather than ""heh-heh"". Also, this movie has an IMDb score of 8.0/10. Come on. It wasn't THAT good. I've seen way better movies. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Rain Man"", ""Clerks II"", ""Ghostbusters"", and ""Jackass: The Movie"" just to name a few. Even motherf***ing ""Toy Story"" is better than this!!! The acting in this film is alright and the script is creative but the jokes really aren't all that funny.

Good British comedy,"I'd been meaning to watch this film for a while and was slightly disappointed in it but it is quite funny.The idea of a comedy zombie film set in suburban england is a good one and there are some very funny scenes.The film is based around typical British institutions such as the local pub, male bonding, the deferential British mammy and this leads to some good lines.Familiar faces such as Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy appear along with newer faces such as Simon Pegg.I thought Hot Fuzz was funnier though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Family friendly comedy horror with bite.,"I must be honest, I've never really been interested in seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', as trailers depicted the film as a slapstick comedy. (I detest slapstick comedies!!) I decided to watch this after seeing the Norwegian horror comedy 'Dead Snow 2' about zombies - a film I thoroughly enjoyed.'Shaun of the Dead' is so much better than expected, and is actually not slapstick. The humor is effective and really funny - some in a creepy way, but still funny. The make-up and visual effects are very good. This film is a family movie compared to 'Dead Snow 2', though. It is not as graphic or gory and the zombies are rather passive. Simon Pegg is excellent as a bit of a hopeless guy, who becomes the film's hero. The rest of the cast were also very good. Bill Nighy, off course, is brilliant in everything he does.The photography and editing are fantastic. The film is fast-paced and exciting from beginning to end.

Weakest of Simon Pegg Trilogy,"This was 2004 - the first installment. And the cheapest, which is obvious, and the weakest of all three. I like good films with excellent and sparkling humor here and there, I like brilliant sketches and funny gags. This films has almost nothing. Nothing. Just a blatant remake of American zombie flicks, with a typical Englishness added to that - London streets, beer (I'd hate beer after watching it so much in three parts), pubs, horrible dry English accent and tons of silly profanities that add nothing, mean little and bring even less. Simon Pegg and Co do some decent job here and there, but in general, this is a very boring, overrated and unfunny film with all unnecessary gore, blood, violence and shooting added to the broth.

Not just better, Shaun of the dead is one of the best comedies I have seen in quite some time. It's both very smart done and brilliantly funny. It perfectly knows what to put the focus on. The story is nothing that really matters much, there is one but it serves only the purpose of holding it together. Still one never gets the feeling that it is to thin, because you quickly into it get the picture that the story is not what will hold this up. I love the kind of humor this film has but it's not jokes and that kind of fun. An example when some are sitting talking and all seems normal but then the camera slightly turns. Much of the humor works kind of like that first everything is normal and then quickly something unexpected and funny is revealed. Sometimes music is used brilliantly funny in the same way. The film is violent but not as much as Hot Fuzz where I felt it became a bit overdrawn. Here it's used just enough. Like the story it's always over the top, unrealistic and extremely funny to watch. Impressive how great characters they managed to create, this being a comedy and not that long. Shaun of the Dead is not just a comedy like others, well of course somethings are but this movie just makes every aspect massively better than the usual stuff. Just lean back and be just as entertained as impressed. Shaun of the Dead is brilliant and a pleasure to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
It knocked me dead!,"A very funny British comedy and funny parody of the Dead Trilogy. It's unlike Scary Movie or Student Bodies but it is funny nonetheless. The title itself is a pun on Dawn Of The Dead, the film is about an average English worker who is trying to get his girlfriend back and making things right with his parents, until for some unknown reason, the dead begin to walk the earth, and Shaun together with his buddy Ed decide to find their friends and Shaun's mom and girlfriend and get them to safety. It had many funny moments, like the day it started, Shaun and Ed are very oblivious despite news broadcasts that the dead are taking over, and the part when they pretend to be zombies just so they can get past them. The film itself became very impressive to everyone including George Romero himself! I haven't such hilarious stuff like this since Student Bodies. Now, the guys behind this film, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are now given cameos(possibly zombie cameos) on Romero's forth upcoming film of the Dead movies(they should've brought Nick Frost in it).

The British Add Something New to the Zombie Genre,"A man (Simon Pegg) decides to turn his moribund life around by winning back his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield), reconciling his relationship with his mother (Penelope Wilton), and dealing with an entire community that has returned from the dead to eat the living.What makes this film atypical of most horror films is that it is not a horror film at all, but a romantic comedy... only it is a romantic comedy filled with zombies and head-crushing action. We follow Shaun, who fights to win his girlfriend Liz back... fights zombies, that is.The humor is distinctly British, and some of the humor relies on a familiarity with the show ""Spaced"", which is probably not well known to the general audience. Much of the jokes are also obscure references to other horror films. But most of the humor is universal, as we all probably know what it is like to have a bad day, have a bad job, and have things go wrong with a great woman (or man, as the case may be). And all too many of us know what it is like to live with a deadbeat roommate.The zombie effects are pretty decent, though not as gory as in many films. The humor outweighs the scary obviously. The scenery is great, and many of the scenes are so derivative of ""Dawn of the Dead"" that it is hard not to like this film. (Some scenes, some music and even some dialog is lifted directly from Romero... such as news broadcasts and the classic ""We're coming to get you, Barbara."") I enjoyed the multiple times a character was told not to call the zombies ""zombies""... because it calls to mind the great difference between horror movie characters and horror movie viewers. (Horror movie viewers know Romero made zombie films, but the word ""zombie"" is not used in those films... even the ""Dawn"" remake never once calls them ""zombies"".)I do not know if I would make this a must-see movie, but it is one of those films that everyone has seen, so you probably would not be a true horror fan unless you have seen it, too. And the way it went on to influence zombie films and zombie comedies over the next decade is incredible, culminating in the nearly-as-good ""Cockneys Vs. Zombies"", that any ""Shaun"" fan should be sure to see. Stephen King proclaimed it was ""destined to be a cult classic."" He was right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Pulling no punches (or LPs for that matter),"This is seriously funny. Offensive in every way, but funny nevertheless. A camera tracking shot that gets repeated is just a showcase of both humour and expertise. But it doesn't stop there. Meant as homage to George Romero (the title of course referring to Romero's Dawn of the Dead and therefor the undead being nothing like the ones from the Dawn Remake), this little movie is pure genius.One of the references, involves a phone conversation with ""Barbara"", which made me laugh out loud in the cinema. And I was the only one laughing. I almost felt bad about it, but then again, even Romero himself didn't get the in-joke (if you're a filmmaker you'll understand, that certain things are more precious to fans of the movies, then they are to you).But it's not only that. It's the fact, that this movie goes all the way (no pun intended). I was surprised how brutal it was (I didn't know the rating back then, it was shown in a sneak Preview). If you can stomach it, this will be one movie you'll really enjoy (even without getting any references)!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The best zombie movie ever - because it's more than just a zombie movie.,"Zombies are boring. They're not scary, they're not intimidating. They move slower than a snail, and all they can do is eat you. I suppose in the early days there was more of a thrill to them, but that was lost as the years progressed. George A. Romero captured the fear in his original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and used the zombies as satire of American commercialism in his overrated sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but by the time his third film came around  the forgettable ""Day of the Dead""  the zombie genre had been ruined by the outpour of Romero rip-offs, all of which lacked the brains of his first two movies.""Shaun of the Dead"" understands how lame zombies are. No one responds to the monsters. People carry on as if it's just a bad day or something, and tomorrow everything will be back to normal. When Shaun (Simon Pegg) runs through a crowd of the undead and swings a cricket bat at them, totally unfazed by their presence, it's one of the film's cleverer scenes. Because director Edgar Wright and writer Pegg know zombies and zombie movies suck.""Shaun of the Dead"" is the best modern zombie movie ever. It's the funniest, most entertaining, most emotionally captivating and, surprisingly, one of the darkest, too (lots of blood was used here).Pegg plays Shaun, a down-on-his-luck Brit who lives with his friend Ed (Nick Frost) and is about to be dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield). When the zombies begin to attack, Shaun immediately uses their presence as a way to scheme his way back into his girlfriend's heart. It's the perfect excuse for him to go over to her apartment.There's more heart and understanding of the human condition in this movie than most dramas. It carefully balances the physical pain with the heartache  Shaun's cruel stepdad (the always reliable Bill Nighy) gets bitten by a zombie, and as he bleeds to death, he apologizes to Shaun for his behavior over the years and explains that all he ever wanted was to be accepted as a father figure. It's a touching scene at a totally unexpected place in the movie, and makes the zombie attacks more than just random acts of comedy punctuated by blood-letting  it makes them human.This is a romantic comedy about forgiveness, broken relationships, estranged parents, accepting your best friend's flaws, recognizing your own, andzombies. What a concept.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Hilarious and horrifying,"Although not inaccurately billed as ""a romantic comedy with zombies,"" Shaun of the Dead is, at its heart, a horror film with the same underlying hopelessness that typifies the zombie movie genre. To stave off some of this inevitable darkness, this well constructed, very funny film features not only a witty script full of clever parallels and outrageous situations but also plenty of over the top, implausible gore.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Fun with zombies!,"Shaun of the Dead does for zombie movies what Hot Fuzz did for cop films. It wasn't quite as successful at it as the movie that would come afterwords, but it was a fine way for Simon and the gang to hone their craft in preparation for their epic buddy cop spoof.The entertainment value here comes from the humor and the characters, and it succeeds in being better than many of the serious zombie movies that have been released in the last few years. Not much has to be changed in order from zombies to be transformed from horrifying to hilarious.There's  lots of in-jokes and foreshadowing that makes repeated viewings just as fun as the first. Trust me, watching a zombie being rhythmically beaten to a Queen song never gets old. Plus fans of the UK Office get the pleasure of seeing Lucy Davis (in a hilarious role) and a few other welcome cameos. Add all that to the pleasure of getting to see Simon Pegg being Simon Pegg, and what more could you want? Zombie fans will love this, plain and simple.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
*the* most inconsistent movie ever made,"OK - first off, American here, though I LOVE British humor.Shaun of the Dead has to be THE most inconsistent move I've ever seen. Its low points were so low, and so bad, that I actually mulled getting up and walking out of the theater, something I've never done, or even felt during a movie before. Its high points, however, were so funny, that they rank among the top ten of the funniest scenes/lines I've EVER seen in a movie.HUH?!Without giving anything away, I can say that Shaun of the Dead starts slowly. PAINFULLY slowly, as if nobody would notice if they didn't really have an intro. The filler scenes which depict the theme of the movie were WAY too forced, as if the director and writer were making the movie for cretins. And then - the zombies start coming out, and there are some of the best scenes I've ever seen (in terms of humor, NOT horror) in a movie.Then... it died. And died horribly. The movie, throughout its length, is part real zombie film, part spoof, part comedy, part British-situational/occupational-comedy, and the problem is that the parts not only didn't mesh, but as single units, they were awful. There were attempted jokes, most of them incredibly poor, and attempted British situational humor, the type of which nobody outside Britain would find funny. (and I LOVE British humor!)And then... it resurrected itself! The ending was brilliant. Again, some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a film. Just... stunning.Shaun of the Dead is two movies, one with a rating of 5, and one with a rating of 10, violently fused together. It should not be missed, nor should it be watched, as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Worst movie. ...... Ever,"A friend of mine recommended this film to me as IMDb rated it at >7. So I went to see it, which was the worst mistake I could possibly make. Although I appreciate British humour, this film just did not do it for me.Maybe it was the audience that was laughing hilariously at every scene, or maybe the film was just plain bad. It even got up to a point where I left the theatre to make a call. When I got back 5 minutes later, I did not even feel like I missed a part of the film.The only good thing was the way the camera moved around shaun on his way to the grocery store; that was brilliant. However not brilliant enough to push this film above a horrid 1.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The first good parody movie in years,"Since Mel Brooks' days of satire, parody as a genre has been just about limited to the mass-produced ""from the makers of Scary Movie"" films - in which scenes from the films they parody are re-staged, but with groin kicks and fart jokes.Shaun of the Dead, rather, brings parody back to life by playing around with the genre it parodies. In this treatment of the zombie movie, the main characters barely notice anything's changed - why would they, when there's issues with the landlord, the girlfriend, and the stepdad? It's only when someone's about to have a bite taken out of them that anyone reacts to the oncoming apocalypse.The reason Shaun of the Dead works is that instead of just looking for holes in movies to make fun of, it presents itself as just another one of the movies that it parodies. And with the comedies Hot Fuzz and Spaced under their belts, I can say that Edgar Wright, his cast, and crew are the most competent satirists of the past decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"British horror fans, and Horror fans around the world, can thank Mr. Romero...","Discussion of what albums can be sacrificed, such as the soundtrack to Batman, are just one of the many hysterical segments in this film.Unlike the typical, Pace-fading tempo, British films are used to dishing out to their viewers.... this one actually gains momentum as it ""Knocks-off"" character favorites along the way. This film should please fans of both, Mr. Bean / Monty Python pun humor, and the ""EEWWW! That was GROSS!!!"" humor as well. Also, I love how the Winchester Pub gives Shaun and Ed new goals, aside their current content for life, which is: Killing Zombies and Drinking Beer.British horror fans, and Horror fans around the world, can thank Mr. Romero for capitalizing on the low-budget horror industry...... which spawns this creative and insightful comedy....

Wonderfully entertaining zombie/comedy.,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is easily one of the best zombie flicks I have ever seen.Simon Pegg stars as a Shaun,a young British guy who sells home electronics.His life is bland and repetitive,revolving around the local pub,his lazy pot dealing best friend Ed,and his girlfriend Liz. One day Liz dumps him.Soon the entire city is over-run by bloodthirsty zombies.Shaun's response?With Ed in tow go pick up mom,then over to Liz's and whisk everybody off to the safety of the local pub.""Shaun of the Dead"" perfectly blends comedy with horror elements.The acting is excellent and the characters are well-written.There is also a nice amount of blood and gore.It's nice to see all the references to other films sprinkled throughout-fans of ""Night of the Living Dead"",""Dawn of the Dead"",""The Evil Dead"" or ""28 Days Later"" will be pleased.In short, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the sort of film horror fans will see over and over.Check it out as soon as possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
absolutely brilliant,"I'm not particularly a fan of British humor but I am a fan of zombie movies and I thought this one was a unique and entertaining example of the genre. On the surface this is a funny movie that plays on all the conventions of the zombie genre. There are lots of inside jokes and references to other zombie movies from Night of the Living dead up to 28 Days Later (with a news caster commenting about ""Rage infected monkeys""). On a slightly deeper level there is a lot of social commentary about how the citizens of the modern, industrialized world are increasingly difficult to tell apart from zombies. But even the social commentary in the movie comes across as very self conscious because it is commenting on the same themes that Romero did 20 years ago. On a technical note, I think the lighting was very effective for a lower budget movie and the editing was exceptional (especially the intro sequence with the seamless wipes across the screen from one shot to the next while Shaun goes about his morning routine). Overall I would say that any fan of zombie movies will really enjoy Shaun of the Dead but it's also entertaining enough that it will appeal to people who aren't fans of horror, zombies or British humor.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Fairly Funny Romantic Britcom with Zombies,"Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead hybridizes Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days After, then infuses them into a British romantic comedy. This improbable combination of elements is nicely blended due to a solid script and very good directing.Just as pathological loser Shaun is dumped by his beloved girlfriend, an outbreak of zombification occurs in London. Inspired to show his true colors, grow up, and take the bull by its horns all at once, Shaun and his shut-in room-mate Ed develop a plan to rescue Shaun's mum, step-dad, girlfriend and his best friends by locking down in the pub which inspired the break up.Most of the laughs result from gender stereotypes epitomized by Shaun and Ed and typical horror-comedy stuff. Though this is a relatively low-brow comedy, the characters are sympathetic and real enough to carry the story. Directing and cinematography are A+ and, like the script, very British.Highly recommended for horror-comedy fans. Recommended for comedy fans. Weakly recommended for horror fans. for everybody else - this is a good movie night film for a relaxing evening with friends, booze and popcorn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Absolutely hilarious,"I had never seen this movie until two days ago and if YOU haven't I suggest you do. ""Shaun of the Dead"" tells about a man named Shaun who works in an electronic goods shop. He spends his days with his unemployed friend Ed either playing video games at home or drinking in a local pub ""Winchester"". Shaun is pretty much what you could describe as a ""loser"". He has a girlfriend, Liz, who suddenly after 3 years of being together has had enough of Shaun's attitude towards things, never having an adventure or basically anything different. This of course leads to a break-up. Suddenly almost the whole London catches sort of an epidemic and everyone starts to turn as the living dead, zombies. Shaun figures out that he has his life's biggest opportunity to prove his ex-girlfriend that he is not a loser. Things lead to another and well, it's done in a way that won't give you time to stop laughing.One thing that surprised me a lot is how well the whole movie was made. I mean, it's a comedy after all and it's not every day you see a comedy where they've really put some time and effort to make it. The whole world and the zombies are done like in any other serious movie, so believably and so realistically. This already gives the movie something that keeps you interested throughout besides the story, which in its parodied way is also surprisingly well written. Although the zombie -thing working as the main story in the movie, you could imagine the movie as a romantic comedy as well. The movie takes a while before the zombies even kick into the plot and the best thing is that the things before that moment is not even irrelevant in any kind of way. It kinda evolves the story, builds up the characters and the whole main theme, letting the viewer inside the actual story. Brilliant in a way I'd say.The one thing where the movie has its definite highlight is the humour, which is absolutely hilarious. To me as a fan of the British accent (although to be exact I especially love the cockney accent) the movie's jokes were top notch. You just can't say some things in another accent than the British one and to be honest when I had my Finnish subtitles on I really didn't even pay attention to them as some of the jokes are just so poorly translated they loose their purpose and meaning completely. Although the movie being a total laugh packed ride, the jokes sadly start to repeat themselves and it does get a bit repetitive. When you think about that it's a really hard thing to prevent really. When it comes to parodies they usually stumble in that way towards the end, so it's a very common problem. Despite it this movie doesn't do it so much you could imagine, so it's a real achievement. The film also includes so called ""long jokes"" which aren't so funny at the first time but when repeated they eventually get funny and when they're done in places where you wouldn't expect them at all they have their moment and it's magnificent.Although the movie being a parody all the way through I was also surprised how good the acting was in it. It does have drama in it too, yet done in a satiric way. The brilliant Simon Pegg as Shaun, Nick Frost as Ed, the always hilarious Bill Nighy as Philip the stepfather, Kate Ashfield as Liz and Dylan Moran as David, the whole cast is carefully and very successfully chosen. When it comes to comedies like this one the acting is usually done over the top to make it funnier. Well, the acting in this movie also goes over the top, but it's done so unbelievably well by amazing actors/actresses and in a way I've never seen before. Usually when the acting is meant to be over the top, it's usually funny at the first time but you get bored of it very quickly and it gets so unfunny and (I can't believe I'm saying this) unrealistic. Though it is actually meant to be unrealistic, ""Shaun of the Dead"" does the unrealistic so realistically and the unbelievable so believably. Now that's what I call a huge achievement, very nice indeed.""Shaun of the Dead"" is all in all a great comedy. It has a surprisingly good storyline which keeps you interested throughout, including humour which just makes you laugh so hard, even giggle after the actual movie has ended. It's silly, but it's silly in a good way. They don't make comedies like this so much and when they do it's a great achievement. It's always a real gem for the comedy film industry and you just have to give your two thumbs up. The movie sadly suffers from already mentioned slight repetitiveness, but when it comes to the end it really doesn't matter so much, but that's what also lowers my final rating of the movie. If you want to laugh, seriously, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a movie for you. Great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Romance and zombies.,"Hands down this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. From the part where Shaun and Ed throw records at the zombies in the back yard to the part where Shaun and Ed plan out their mother's rescue (and step father's demise) this movie is sheer brilliance. The movie starts off where Shaun and Liz are discussing each other's friends and how they just don't like them. A day or so later, on their anniversary, Shaun and Liz break up. Another day later and the town is infested with zombies. Shaun overall is just having a bad day and in addition to that is oblivious to the fact that the town is infested with zombies. As the movie goes on we can't help but realize how a craving for beer and love can over take the fact that there's a group of zombies outside waiting to eat Shaun and Ed. I'd overall recommend this to British humor fans, zombie fans, horror/comedy fans, or people who are just in the mood for a good romantic comedy with zombies. This is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
quite amazed at the response this film got from people,"Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.You may remember the character of ""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.It's pretty obvious that ""SOTD"" was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action- mayhem ""Dawn of the Dead"") and 2002's ""28 Days Later"" (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"Not Great, but One of the Best Spoofs Out There","There are movies like Army of Darkness that poke fun at themselves and get some laughs along the way. There are movies like Scary Movie that pretty much play out as a long sequence of gross jokes. But then there are the very rare films (like Shaun of the Dead) that belittle entire genres of movies while still showing life of their own, creativity, and a kind of weirdness that can't help but entertain.Shaun of the Dead gives us Shaun, a hero of all heroes, who must save the world from zombies that bite people to turn them into zombies themselves. Shaun's tragic flaw is his friend, Ed, who pretty much sits around all day and does nothing, but he and Ed need to rescue Shaun's mom (and stepdad) and Shaun's ex-girlfriend (and her flatmates). None of the performances are especially dramatic, but all actors, in both major and supporting roles, do quite a good job.Everything is done in jest, with kind of an obviously feigned seriousness that makes the film all the more hilarious. Also, a brilliant comparison near the beginning of the film gives it creative flavor and strikes interest with the viewer. The characters' reactions to the zombies, especially the reactions of Shaun and Ed, are very similar to the reactions of regular characters in zombie films, but satirical enough to draw many laughs. There are some specific scenes that stand out as especially creative and bizarre, but they must be viewed for full effect.The direction, then, by Edgar Wright, isn't earth-shattering, but it's adequate for the subject matter, and I, personally, enjoyed the non-original music selections at place in the film. The film's strongest point is its screenplay, but it does contain some confusion for the viewer. For instance, there are certain points in the film that approach the realm of the sentimental, and the viewer cannot figure out whether what's on screen is meant to be viewed jokingly or meant to evoke sympathy for these brilliant characters. And even though the film is very, very funny, there are lines, especially those that make use of scatological humor, that are very not funny and leave a sour taste in the viewer's mouth.Yet this movie entertains almost to its full potential. Don't watch if you're looking for something profound or classic, but definitely take in a viewing of Shaun of the Dead if you're looking for a comedy that's pretty smart and often hilarious and creative.Final Grade: B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

I cant understand why someone wouldn't enjoy this film, its great fun from start to finish and really easy to watch. its the kinda film u watch on a Sunday lead on your sofa rough. the narrative is really easy to follow but is still effective. mt favourite part of this film is when Ed has to pretend to be a zombie, absolutely hilarious. the only way someone can dis this film is if they aren't British because its humour is very British.It also rips dawn of the dead and other zombie films to pieces and makes us all realise how much of geeks people are who are into these kinda films. if you ask me, Shaun of the dead is spot on and is must watch for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun is Brilliant,"A movie that brings perfect comedy into the zombie world brings topnotch perfection from outstanding perfection as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost take the screen. Shaun and his trusty bestfriend Nick are without a doubt the best duos on film on screen.I loved this movie with all my heart because its a classic,I can watch every single day that it will never get old. Drinking beers, killing zombies, and watching TV is a good way to go. Even the other cast members were pretty good. I was surprise of how violent this movie was. Their was blood gushing out, zombies with intestines hanging in place, and a whole lot of biting! Every zombie lover in the world has to love Shaun of the Dead for its brilliance. I don't think their will ever be a movie like this anymore but that's okay cause this movie is gold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Just a great flick,"This is one of those ideas that is so obvious you end up hitting your head, wondering why you didn't think of it yourself: combine 28 DAYS with the British genre that's most famous nowadays, ""overgrown adolescents learn to accept responsibility and get lives"". In England, Shaun and his going-nowhere best friend are living lives of quiet desperation, until his girlfriend dumping him and, incidentally, a zombie uprising, causes Shaun to get a clue.I really liked this. This is almost a perfect blend of humor and seriousness: some people have knocked the film for this but I think it's just right, so much so that I actually got a little misty-eyed toward the end of the movie, and I can't say I've done that with any other release this year. Particularly funny is Shaun's early cluelessness during the outbreak.The movie does post-modernism proud, as it's both a play on genre conventions and a celebration of them: this is an extremely tough thing to pull off, but they manage to do it with style. Because it's mainly a riff on established conventions, not something unique, the movie does suffer from a certain diffuseness: early on it looks like the theme will be ""modern society creates zombies by itself"" ala DAWN OF THE DEAD, but that soon gets abandoned, for instance, as there's too much other stuff to refer to. Still, the characters believe in what they're doing absolutely, which helps a lot in these sorts of things. Jokes aren't funny if the deliver is sniggering as he delivers them.This is the sort of thing KILL BILL was trying to do: I liked those movies but they never really congealed into more than the sum of their parts, the way this did. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is essentially a goof, an inside joke (in some ways the definition of post modernism) but it's a very good example of it. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A decent enough of a movie - worth a watch,"Shaun of the Dead. Hmm... where to begin. Well, it is a horror movie spoof - of the zombie sort - with clever comedic moments and a solid storyline/plot. It's not very scary at all.Shaun is a decent guy that you want to root for. His buddy Ed is an idiot so you end up liking him, too. Shaun's romantic interest, Liz, is a good gal as well so you end up rooting for her. Finally, this is a love story, and, as a viewer, you want the 3-year love affair between Shaun and Liz to work out (their relationship is on the fritz).So, all-in-all, I'd say give this movie a shot. There's comedy, likable characters, love, and a few zombies to boot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The single best zombie comedy ever made.,"As a living dead fan of 20+ years I tend to not care for films that spoof my beloved genre, however, Shaun is not a spoof in the sense of the word. Shaun is basically an intelligent horror comedy film based in reality. All zombie films are fantasy based, but 9 times out of 10 the settings or characters seem a little unrealistic or focuses on an expertly trained group of soldiers. Shaun does non of this and is probably the first zombie film since the original Night of the Living Dead to bring back the every day man and his struggles during the start of a zombie outbreak.What separates Shaun from the other dead films is the script. Sharp humor interjected into everyday living situations and everyday living situations played out during a zombie apocalypse make for fantastically funny moments and great entertainment. Plus you have Edgar Wrights own social commentary in how we as a living breathing human race aren't far off from our undead brethren in how we execute our daily routine. This makes for some of the most fabulous story telling in film, period.Shaun of the Dead pays homage to all of George A. Romero's zombie films and even spoofs some of his most famous death scenes from his 1985 film Day of the Dead. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play off each other perfectly and the remaining supporting cast fit well and sell the story with ease.Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest British comedies to come out in the last few years and will rank up there with such classics from guys like Monty Python and company. This film is a must have for any DVD collection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Simon Pegg's Zombie Comedy with Blood Guts & Gore.,"Having been derided by my mates down the pub for not having seen this one, I decided it was time to bite the bullet. Now, I have seen some of Simon Pegg's more recent works, Hot Fuzz (2007) was pretty good, as was Run Fatboy Run (also 2007) and How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (2008). He's now making the big bucks in America, but I was quite interested to see how one of his earlier works turned out.Shaun lives with two flatmates, Ed and Pete, in London. Ed is always taking Shaun down the local pub, The Winchester, to the disgust of Shaun's girlfriend, Liz. She, and her friends, Dianne and David, want Shaun to break away from Ed and straighten himself out. Unfortunately, Shaun is very attached to Ed; they've known each other since they went to school together. This comes to a head when Liz dumps Shaun and he ends up going out and getting drunk with Ed. As we see them going about their lives we get an inkling that something is not right, people are starting to behave strangely. The morning after, it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong. News reports confirm that Zombies are loose on the streets and it's not safe out there! Shaun decides to go and rescue his mum, Barbara, and his step-dad, Philip. Then go and get Liz and then go to the pub. So, they have a plan, but there's a lot of Zombies out there! There are a lot of pretty funny bits in this film, I particularly liked the LP scene and the 'Queen' fight scene in the bar. If you've seen the film you'll know the ones I mean. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Simon Pegg as Shaun, Kate Ashfield as Liz, Nick Frost as Ed, Lucy Davis as Dianne and Dylan Moran as David. Honourable mentions also go to Peter Serafinowicz as Pete, Bill Nighy as Philip and Penelope Wilton as Barbara.So now we come to the nitty gritty, did I enjoy it? Well, it had parts that made me laugh, but as a whole it didn't really bite me on the neck. I found the character of Ed really annoying, he's stupid and very selfish. Yes, he does have a couple of good one-liners, but that doesn't make up for him being an idiot. So over all, it's a pretty dumb comedy, something to watch when you've come back from the pub. I don't think I'll be going out of my way to watch it again, but if I'm late back from the pub one night & it's on TV who knows? My score: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Bargain Basement Horror,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a cheap and cheerful Zombie Brit Flick. With the accent firmly on ""cheap"".It looks and feels as if it was hastily conceived by a group of six form students on a media studies field trip. More akin to ""Carry on Screaming"" than ""An American Werewolf in London"".Which is a shame really, because the horror genre has plenty of comic mileage left in it - if you can get the balance right.And that's another thing. Is it obligatory these days for British film directors to include at least one (or in this instance two) unemployed actors from TV's ""The Office""? OK it was a very funny series while it lasted, but it's been flogged to death and I'm bored with it now.Let's face it, Lucy Davis was hardly a barrell of laughs in this film was she?",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Excellent Zombie Film,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a brilliant blend of comedy and horror that redefines the zombie genre with its sharp wit and genuine heart. Directed by Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg as the titular Shaun, the film follows a group of slacker friends who find themselves facing a zombie apocalypse in their ordinary London neighborhood. Pegg's portrayal of Shaun as an ordinary guy reluctantly thrust into heroism is both relatable and hilarious, while Nick Frost provides excellent comedic chemistry as his loyal yet clueless best friend, Ed. The film's clever script is packed with clever references, witty dialogue, and memorable moments that seamlessly transition between laugh-out-loud humor and genuine tension. Wright's signature visual style, characterized by quick cuts and inventive camera work, adds to the film's kinetic energy and comedic timing. Beneath its comedic surface, ""Shaun of the Dead"" offers poignant insights into friendship, responsibility, and the mundanity of everyday life. It's a cult classic that continues to delight audiences with its infectious humor and clever homage to the zombie genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
An underrated masterpiece,"The fact that Shaun of the Dead has gone largely unnoticed by the masses is the biggest sin in the world of cinema to this day. Shaun of the Dead is renowned director Edgar Wright's best film to date - his passion of storytelling, intricate detailing, exciting direction, character building, world building, everything is at its most apparent here.I think I've seen Shaun of the Dead more than any other movie and I still find things in it that I failed to see on the other viewings every time. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's screenplay is nothing short of masterful and quite simply one of the best screenplays of all time. Nearly every line of dialogue, every shot, every action, acts as foreshadowing, or as part of a before/after structure that shows character growth and story progression. Every second of film here is put to good use, and there isn't a hair or screen-time you could remove - everything is made integral in the most tight-nit story I've seen to this day. Edgar Wright's direction makes everything fun and entertaining, from his visual comedy, to adding flare to the most mundane tasks such as making toast and tea.Not to mention, every character is superbly written to be consistent and show growth, or provide the tools for growth in the other characters. Shaun has to be in my top 50 protagonists of all time for being incredibly relateable, likeable, and proactive even while being an Everyman. The performances help so much too, with Nick frost being the standout as he makes a character that could easily be annoying if not played right a charming and hilarious addition to the cast. These aren't your usual zombie movie stereotypes, there are characters the film makes you care and root for.Speaking of the zombie genre, I believe this film is the best example of how to do a spoof of a genre, as while conventions are somewhat mocked and poked fun at, the story is still intense, the characters are human beings and not over the top caricatures, and most of all the threat is still very real - I first saw this film when I was 7 and some of the zombie moments haunted me for a couple years before I was brave enough to watch it again.Charming, indescribably clever, and just simply a masterpiece - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg deserve ALL the oscars for this triumph of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Good but not excellent,"The filmmakers really played on the fact that British people are often impossible to good effect within the parameters of this movie. Unfortunately the way in which British people are frequently impossible is not always something you can forgive, and that element makes this film good but not excellent. That someone could be every annoying thing and not be also considered a form of evil is maybe what this film is mocking, so maybe it is further ahead of the curve than I am giving it initial credit for. Good acting from the team of actors that also made the film Hot Fuzz, which is the better film to me. I found the annoying traits that are played upon in this movie to be a bit much at about the one hour point, but like I said maybe they are trying to make fun of just how irritating people can be, as they are in effect personifying evil by having so many traits that are supposedly there to ward away evil. That nothing is ever said about anything is pure England, and is like dealing with the just deceased in a way, and that the continuous counter reaction of everything is fine, when it most definitely is not, has the ultimate effect of destroying every scrap of possible good in a situation. Good zombie film, funny in places, with an interesting and intelligent sardonic sub text.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Pretty funny, but nothing special","Considering that the British tend to have a pretty good sense of humor, I was a tiny bit disappointed with this movie. It was pretty funny, but most of it was in a drawn-out, understated way, which is not a bad thing, but here it wasn't really very clever, either. For me, there were only a few laugh-out-loud moments. The joke factor was no more than so-so.As usual with these movies, it's the characterization of the main characters that is the interesting part, and in this movie there were some nice elements of that, too, but it was a too obvious second-fiddle aspect, because ultimately everyone but the ""hero"" and his girl died. I hoped that David would end up with Liz and Shaun with Dianne. Oh well.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
surprisingly good,I wasn't expecting much seeing as i'm not a big fan of zombie movies apart from night of the living dead (1968 version) but I was pleasantly surprised. Basically Simon Pegg plays loser Shaun who lives with his flatmate Ed and has been dumped by his girlfriend. A plague of zombies are attacking the town so he decides to hide in the pub with several (near) friends. This film has a star studded cast (well in my opinion) with the likes of Matt Lucas (little Britain) Bill Nighy ( guest house Paradiso pirates of the Caribbean 2) and Dylan Moran (black books). This movie was funny and slightly frightening as well and had a bit of gore to satisfy the hardcore Romero fans so if you're a fan of zombie films or just a fan of Simon Pegg then watch this film you won't regret it!,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Shaun rules,"Not since Anton Maiden(a funny little man with no talent for singing who sings Iron Maiden songs to midi tracks of their songs, hilarious but sad at the same time)has a spoof been so fantastically sad and funny at the same time.

He has a complete life with a deadbeat friend in his home, a work place where he gets no respect and a girlfriend who is way to good for him. But it is all all right because he has THE WINCHESTER.

Real life with a bit of excellent comic scripting makes excellence,"After his girlfriend dumps him, loser Shaun (Pegg) must get his life together, only Britain is subjected to an outbreak of zombies that is threatening life all over the world.After the success of TV series Spaced in 2001, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright would continue their rise to the top with the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy with this 2004 release the first instalment to the frankly brilliant saga so far that takes the concept of horror and love to a whole new and tantalizing level.Britain it is fair to say has created sound astounding horror flicks over the years. Danny Boyle's 28 Days later portrayed a horrifying prospect of a country subjected to a rage virus and the director created some breathtaking scenery by deserting the capital for atmospheric purposes. Even Stanley Kubrick's the Shining was filmed partly in Britain and that is perhaps one of the most renowned horrors today, along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The last couple of years we have seen more teen horrors than we need from The Hole, to Donkey Punch and recent release Tormented, we get the general picture of teen angst juxtaposed with some blood thank you and so, here, we have a brand new vision, horror with a wonderful spurt of comedy.Shaun of the dead is a rarity, the comic pairing of Frost and Pegg will never be appreciated enough and the quick, very quick, montages of Edgar Wright's bring astounding appreciation to the viewers.The release brings around a wonderful collection of justification to a variety of meaningful topics such as relationships, parenthood, friendship and survival with a wonderful inspirational get your life together ideology. The fact the scripting is hitting hard at some important issues, it would seem hard to cram in any type of comedy, but behold the marvel of the pairing of Pegg and Wright.From throwing classic records at zombies, to the imitations of the dead, this is a comic gem that will consistently make you smile.Pegg and Frost have become one of Britain's best comedy duos with this film the marker in which they hit the big screen in groundbreaking fashion. From Frost's ape impressions to Pegg's likable loser antics, we can sit back and enjoy the partnership and playful banter between the two actors.Wright's direction breaks boundaries with the montages but there is a skillful approach to the handling of the zombie attacks. When outside the Winchester there is a very well handled approach to the way the dead are acting and Wright's sublime setup helps adds a chill and a sweet comic touch.This picture is simply the beginning of the trilogy with Hot Fuzz establishing the actors and directors on to bigger and better things but what a hit Shaun is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
easily my top 10 films of all time,"Probably no one will read this, but I am a product of gen-x and narcissistic enough to write a review anyway. Let me start at the beginning. This movie made me laugh uncontrollably and sit on the edge of my seat when I was a young idealistic student. Now that I am an old, cynical hag, I still find this movie very entertaining and not just because of the obvious laughs. I really think this movie is the perfect movie of my generation. I think it has been said before, but still, this movie is somehow one of the most truthful, existential commentaries on post-modern humanity. I won't say how it happened because I don't know and I am too lazy to do the real research, but I know an existential masterpiece when I see one. This movie by using the subtext of a zombie apocalypse , taps into the deepest questions of what it means to be a post-modern adult and the extreme angst that many of the generation x have felt in the disintegration of a family unit and an identity after being raised on such ideals as Happy Days and The Brady Bunch. And I think it was one of the firsts to tap into that whole zombie apocalypse angst which is now common fodder. These characters are so identifiable and lovable that you can follow their journey of discovery and ultimately find hope in the future.

It's a lovingly crafted film about love, all kinds of love and it's meticulous script, counter-culture references and influences, it's fresh young talent involved, and its reinvigoration of the horror comedy genre makes this a perfect movie.
An already excellent film that is infinitely better if you were part of the Spaced movement, which I was.

Should have been compressed.,"The cast attracted me to this DVD. Simon Pegg and Lucy Davis in particular were the names that shone from the DVD case. When I read the other cast names, I knew this was going to be something special.And it didn't disappoint. The cast is fabulous. The direction is great and is a clever blend of UK blandness and comedy genius. Residents of the UK will recognise so many of the cast members but those outside of the country will still appreciate their abilities.Zombie movies in the past have been numerous and predictable and Shaun Of The Dead is still very predictable. This is a good thing - I found myself looking thirty seconds into the future and I was usually correct. Not a bad thing though - it almost immersed me into the film.My biggest criticism is that this whole movie could have been (and maybe should have been) shortened into something like an hour special. There are a few scenes (additional to those included on the DVD extras) that I felt could have been excluded. When you see the deleted scenes you realize the reasons why they were deleted, but also pick out other scenes that probably should have been left out too.The story was always going to be pretty basic. The characters are great and they all have their particular relevance in the film. The seamless inclusion of Sky News footage of the outside world is great and is a brilliant touch and adds more UK-ness to the whole thing. Without it, the movie would have been missing something. American disaster movies always try to insert CNN footage to intensify the effect and Sky is the obvious UK alternative.The reasons behind the zombie infestation is never revealed and I like that. It would have made the plot far more complex. It didn't really matter while I was watching the movie why these zombies had appeared and the characters didn't really dwell on it either - it was always about survival.It's a great Saturday night post-pub movie that requires you to turn off your brain and switch it to funny mode. It's funnier if you are British because of the music references and a few of the actors, but it's still completely universal (no pun intended). Never take it seriously.I enjoyed it. I'm giving it a seven out of ten. It's missing more points because I found a few scenes particularly unnecessary which makes me think that it could have been shortened to an hour for a TV special rather than a feature film, but I'm glad that Simon Pegg is attempting these projects and have always enjoyed his material. Everyone involved in this movie is destined for more, so remember their names.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Excellence in originality,"I'm still reeling after wasting 9.50 to see that god-awful remake of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" which soiled not only the good name of the original movie-which is, for my money, the most frightening American horror film ever made-but the reputation of Mr. Ed Gein. That affront to Mr. Gein's good name was the straw that broke the camel's back: After sitting through the horrible likes of ""House of a 1000 Corpses,"" ""House on Haunted Hill,"" ""House of the Dead,"" and ""House IV,"" I had finally accepted the fact that horror peaked in the 1970s and that any scary movie made for a large American audience these days was going to be nothing but crap.And that's what the trailers for ""Shaun of the Dead"" made it look like: a retarded, platitude-filled mess of awful humor. What's worse, every review I came across (granted, I didn't read them too carefully) made sure to mention in the first sentence or two that this was a ""parody"" of zombie films. Goody, I thought, the British version of ""Scary Movie 3."" There was no way in hell that I was going to watch it.But then I was lucky enough to catch a few episodes of the British comedy ""Spaced"" on Trio one evening, and I loved it. During commercial breaks the announcer was sure to mention that the people who made ""Spaced"" had also made Shaun of the Dead, and then they'd show the trailer for the film. This confused me. How could the makers of such an original, funny program be responsible for what looked like a horrible film? Could it--could it be that TV was lying to me? Or was the distributor of this film somehow trying to dumb down its image to make it more palatable to the simple tastes of American middle-schoolers, that all-important demographic that 99.9% of all Hollywood films made in the last five years have been geared towards? It was all too confusing; I had to find solace in drink. When I woke up there was a copy of Shaun of the Dead on DVD lying next to me. I popped it in and was blown away.The humor is original. I cannot stress that enough, as I cannot remember the last time I saw anything bordering on original humor in a horror film. The plot may be middle of the road but it's saved by its refusal to stick to the usual zombie film contrivances in which five of ten character archetypes (tough guy, sissy guy, sassy black woman, et cetera) are pitted against zombies in one of three different situations.Even if the plot for Shaun of the Dead were as clichéd and moronic as ""House of Wax,"" the characters would have made it an enjoyable film. They don't stick to pre-determined roles (aside from Dylan Moran's David), and are actually well-rounded and *gasp* charming. The gory special effects are wondrous, the pacing is great, and the Spaced-like cinematography transfers perfectly to the big screen.My sole complaint is with the character David, played by ""Black Book's"" Dylan Moran. Moran's Bernard Black, a surly alcoholic who owns a bookstore, is one of the funniest characters I've seen imported to America in years. Moran's talent is wasted as the 2-dimensional foil to Simon Pegg's incredibly likable Shaun; he does a tired job of whining his way through his lines and doesn't garner a single laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"average, not that great.","It was a funny movie, but IF you haven't seen any zombie flicks recently/are not a fan then you are not going to be as amused as some others have posted here. I have seen zombie movies a couple of years back and I like them though since it was too long ago I probably missed a lot of inside jokes which would make this movie great, so to people not in the know of zombie movies I would say: go out and see more of them before you go see this movie or it will not be as great.the Zombies where great: slow moving and only really dangerous in great numbers or when they surprise you (as they should be).",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
One of the best British romantic zombie comedies ever made,"As a lover of sublime sitcom Spaced, like millions of fans waiting for Shaun of the Dead, i never imagined writer and star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright could repeat their magic for the big screen. Thankfully i was wrong. SOTD is one of the freshest, most enjoyable British films i've ever seen and boasts more inventive one liners and set pieces staged for a low budget British movie. Pegg is on fine form as the hopeless electrical store salesman who finds his authority threatened by a surly teenage co-worker, his love life is on the rocks and he doesn't get on with his step dad. His housemate is a loveably offensive drug dealer who spends all day lounging around the house playing computer games, while Shaun's entire social life seems to consist of going to the pub. When zombies appear in London, Shaun rises to the occasion and leads his band of friends and relatives in a full on battle again the living dead. Familiar faces from Spaced, the excellent Nick Frost, Peter Serafinowicz, Julia Deakin (in a brief cameo) and some from Black Books (also a Nira Park production) Dylan Moran and Tamsin Greig, make this a delight while Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman from the office also appear. Bill Nighy has a short but memorable appearance as Pegg's screen stepfather Phillip and while the first half of the film is hilarious, the second half turns into a genuine horror film as Shaun and friends tackle an army of excellent zombies. An instant cult classic which some will find disturbing. However, despite the modest budget, Wright and Pegg have done a fantastic job of delivering one of the best films of the year, and indeed the decade. The fact that i couldn't wait for it to finish so i could watch it all again is testament to its quality. More soon please. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Pretty funny,"This movie was 'bloody' well done...no pun intended. I went into this film not knowing really what to expect but maybe a dark comedy which is why I came out very happy. While I was right about it being funny, it's also an excellent zombie film going on in the meantime. Believe it or not there weren't as many comical moments as I thought there was going to be but some instances were just downright hilarious. The acting was superb and I could tell it must've been an extreme challenge for them since they'd have to go from comedic to dramatic to tragic in what was sometimes probably only a matter of seconds. I definitely gave a big thumbs up to the cast after I noticed this. Even with the apparent low-budget I think the zombie's were effective and looked just as real as in most other movies. Overall a great movie and I highly recommend it to take your mind of life's boring subtleties.Final Review:Movies: Worth every cent of the ticket price.DVD Purchase: Yes, there is a very good chance this might be the start of a series.Rental: If by no other means then absolutely!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Refreshing movie to end the summer,"I caught a sneak preview for the American release-- a week after seeing Resident Evil, no less -- and have to say that I was extremely impressed. Contrary to claims that Americans won't ""get it,"" the humor is quite easy to understand (and honestly uses a lot of the same slang we use here in the States). The dialogue was a bit tough to hear at first (possibly a theater speaker problem), but otherwise accents are easy to understand.For the zombie movie fan, it's a treat. Lots of little references to the original Dead films and even a couple amusing references to 28 Days Later. It has the perfect blend of intelligent wit and downright silly humor to make it a fun Friday night popcorn flick. In my top five for the year.8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Good British horror satire,"If you appreciate tongue-in-cheek humor in horror films, British movies, and well drawn characters you'll like this movie.This film is really a love story between Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Liz (Kate Ashfield). Shaun is going nowhere fast as a temporary manager in an electronics store. Liz is his long time girlfriend who has just dumped him because his idea of a date is to spend time at the Winchester Pub. Shaun has two roommates. His mum is remarried and Shaun dislikes his step-dad. Shaun also has an ex. Shaun is a zero and his life is going nowhere. When the zombies appear Shaun gets his chance to lead.Simon Pegg does a good job as Shaun. He is unknown to US audiences having worked mostly in British TV series. But it is Nick Frost who steals the movie as Ed the lovable, slobby, somewhat dimwitted roommate. Kate Ashfield is also good as Liz. Look for Bill Nighy as the step-dad (burned out rock star Billy Mack in Love Actually.) Some of the ways in which the zombies are defended against are funny, including a cricket bat and Ed's record collection. As a horror movie it's fairly tame, not at all like the Evil Dead or Day of the Dead. There are a few gory scenes but they aren't excessive. In fact, if those scenes were cut this could probably play on British TV. The special effects are simple, understated but just right.

Shaun of the Dead,This and the re-make of 'Dawn of the Dead' has re-vitilized the Zombie genre in many ways. I think 'Shaun of the Dead' has done this in the sense that it has helped the Zombie movie attract more fans! I am no big Zombie movie fan... and I'm also not a big fan of British (even though I'm English!) movies of late but I certainly enjoyed this movie. It's funny. Simon Pegg is good on television and has made a good step up playing Shaun. I'm almost sure Hollywood agents are knocking on his door these days!Funnier than most films I've seen on first viewing. Though I must say I watched it again and wasn't near as good on the big screen!I recommend it to all!,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Non-stop hilarity, absolutely brilliant","Meet Shaun. He's kind of stuck in a boring job, his best friend's a bit childish, his girlfriend is on the verge of leaving him, and he's not his father... sorry, *step* dad's biggest fan. Oh, also, the walking dead(we don't use the zed-word!) just attacked where he lives. In this pastiche of the horror genre, there are actually proper scares, terrifying sequences and well-established creepy atmosphere. The laughs are the main point, and this does garner a ton of them, with cleverness, black and/or British humor, *incredible* subtlety, silliness and satire. This moves a mile a minute, with excellent pacing, never overstimulating, and slowing down here and there, occasionally including some impeccably genuine, true and heartfelt drama and back-story. The characters are credible, well-written and fleshed(pun intended) out very nicely. This is dense with detail, and warrants re-watching. The actors have definite talent(nearly every performance is flawless), in addition to being *extremely* funny. Pegg, Ashfield, Frost, Nighy, etc., all of them, astounding in both respects. I'm rather impressed that the transition from television(I have not yet been able to catch any of Spaced, but I certainly am intending to) went so smoothly and perfectly. Almost everything here works out. The editing and cinematography are marvelous. This is so packed with references to, and spoofs of, stuff in the flicks that inspired it. I implore you, make sure to have seen the George A. Romero's trilogy concerning the subject, as well as the three Evil Dead movies before this. Reservoir Dogs, too. The dialog is magnificent, well-delivered and utterly quotable. This has a great plot that develops well throughout. The special effects are amazing, completely convincing. There is frequent strong language, some disturbing content and a lot of bloody violence and gore in this. The DVD holds a commentary track by Simon and Edgar(do note that they cuss, and are in general... outspoken, in it) which is absolutely worth the time, deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts behind cutting them, featurettes(a couple of them have pages here on the site, and I will review them there), outtakes, make-up tests, a SFX comparison production, trailers for the film and photo galleries. They're all well-produced. I recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies with zombies. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"""David, kill the Queen.""","The ""zombie"" first appeared on film in 1930's with White Zombie. Still, they did not become horror staples until Night of the Living Dead (1968). Over the years, zombies have morphed and evolved from slow walking chumps into ravenous hell hounds. For over 70 years, zombies lived on solely within traditional horror. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright changed that notion forever with their breakout comedy, Shaun of the Dead.Shaun (Pegg) is a droll waste of human existence whose mediocrity is only surpassed by his flatmate Ed (Nick Frost). After his girlfriend dumps him, it seems only the apocalypse could make life worse for Shaun. To viewer delight, that is precisely what happens. Armed with a sturdy cricket bat, a scraped shovel, and childish enthusiasm, Shaun and Ed set out, vying to survive. There is a sense of familiarity in these protagonists which warmly draws the viewer. We feel Shaun's worthlessness after the breakup. This is in part due to long tracking shots as he accomplishes his daily tasks. Furthermore, as Shaun grows to be a champion and a leader, the shots quicken and character movement grows exponentially.Between laugh out loud Brit humour and animated gore, there are honestly sweet moments that further beg us empathize with Shaun. And that is the sign of a geat film. A film should grab hold of the viewer, place them in the hero's shoes, and excite them until the credits roll. For those reasons alone, Shaun of the Dead remains a cult classic worthy of praise seldom offered horror films or comedies. It defies two genres wholeheartedly while making no enemies along the way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Classic!,"This film is brilliant! sorry but it is. I went round a mates to see it an i just wanted to watch it again and again. That was about 10 months ago an i've got it on DVD and i must watch it a lot. Why? This film is really clever, it somehow manages to mix romance and horror an sadness an happiness and.....zombies together in one 2 hour session of fun. Its clever because all the tag lines are impeccably timed throughout the film, Ed gets the best lines not just because they're really funny anyway but because of when he says them. E.g in the pub, "" could get a round "" when they are really scared. I think the character of Shaun is really well done and Simon Pegg pulls of a performance which is what a lot of nearly 30's are in. Girlfriend in a mood, losing money, bad job. His character is believable because lots of us know people in the same situation as him.The camera work in this is good as well quick shots an panning round rooms and ""look behind you!"" shots are all good and can make you jump sometimes to.The actors are all great in this. the person who cast them in this film should be knighted or something My verdict- fried gold!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Christmas turkey,"Having consumed Our 2nd jar of Quality Street this festive season, my girlfriend and I decided to venture out to the pictures to enjoy what promised to be a movie with a difference - Shaun of the dead - which spoke boldly of being a romantic comedy.......with zombies. Sadly,this title is somewhat misleading inasmuch as there is little,if any,discernible romance,no comedy value of any description,and the implication that there may be some ""horror"" content is surely just a comment on the witless plot,wooden acting and utter pointlessness of this whole sorry debacle. This film, has, I'm afraid, got as much going for it as Simon Pegg's previous masterpiece,The Parole Officer,and will sink without trace only to be found in Blockbuster's bargain bin 6 months or so from now.

Trying not 2 pee self,"Shaun of the Dead is the first movie in ages to actually have me rolling around on the carpet, trying desperately not to pee myself laughing for fear of having to run off to get showered and changed and miss any of it-and that's with the DVD at home! The combination of dry Brit humour, very relatable-to drama and well, the living dead is contagiously hysterical. And to add to this, Shaun of the Dead is a movie that is instantly gettable, but also grows on you with each viewing. I especially love the humour relating music and violence...hmmm., reminds me of a very out-there seventies director actually. I am finding that some younger people I try to pass the good word onto concerning what I consider to be a new comedic gem, just seem to miss the point. Regardless, I will never look at the faithful cricket bat in the same way again!Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A Zombie movie with heart.  And guts.  Lots of guts.,"As forceful in its emotion as it is in its comic bits, this movie tells its story with a genuineness that is unexpected. The seriousness enhances the comedy and vice versa making it fulfilling intellectually (if one accepts the Zombies as just being there) as well as comically.Easy to appreciate for someone not generally interested in horror movies, it is just gory enough to satisfy those that are. Characters to care about in plentiful supply, even those briefly met. Shot in an interesting style that gives an oddly horrific focus to everyday activities.The ease with which the film maker introduces the viewer to life in suburban England adds poignancy to the strange goings on that are the major draw of the film.

Dead Man's Party,"Ever watch a Romero flick and wonder, ""Why is it there's always some heroic and noble character in there? What would happen if you stuck real life people in this situation?"" Shaun of the Dead answers that question. Actually, it answers that question with such precision that it's quite disturbing. With my luck, I wouldn't be stuck with expert marksman and all-around badass Roger from Dawn of the Dead. Hell no. With my luck, I'd be sitting in the dark eating peanuts with Shaun.I love the approach the creators took to the film. Instead of a relentless and mindless bashing of the zombie genre, Shaun of the Dead is actually quite affectionate towards its inspiration. As far as the zombies go, Shaun of the Dead is every bit as legitimate as George Romero's movies; what makes it a comedy is the characters and how they deal with the situation. In Dawn and Day of the Dead, you have military personnel trying to survive in a place they can fortify. In Shaun of the Dead you have a guy sitting in the dark eating peanuts as he waits for the whole thing to go away.This approach, I feel, is infinitely superior to the whole ""Let's make mindless jokes that appeal to the lowest common denominator"" method. The humor isn't always insultingly spelled out and shoved down the audience's throat--freeze-frame and flash ""laugh now"" on the screen why don't they (see Scary Movie 3)? I like how the humor in Shaun stems from simple observations about zombies, how they resemble drunks, and when you have a hangover you really don't notice them. And I really like how some jokes will only register with horror fans (A restaurant named after Fulci? Heh, I'll pass, thanks.) The cast of misfits is fun to follow, and possesses a degree of depth that's vital for good comedies to work (granted purely silly characters can work when they're the exception and not the rule.) Bear in mind, I'm not talking Scorsese-deep characters but these aren't purely goof-ball caricatures a la Monty Python (when done well) and Scary Movie 3 (when done poorly). They have their moments of glory, moments of trauma, and moments of despair (I mean, end of the world zombie infestation can become quite depressing when you think about it.) But through it all, the film is still funny, still a comedy . . . a black comedy, but a comedy none-the-less.On a separate note  I think it's funny (for the wrong reasons) that Shaun of the Dead is one of the first zombie films to show a death scene reminiscent of the master Tom Savini's Dead effects since . . . well, Tom Savini's work on Dawn/Day of the Dead. ""Choke on 'em!"" Anyway, Shaun of the Dead is a film for zombie-genre freaks made by zombie-genre freaks. Everyone'll get something out of it, but the genre fans will watch Shaun with the satisfaction that this project fell into the hands of people who actually ""know"" the genre instead of someone who simply ""knows of"" the genre.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A little Overrated,"I find this movie overrated, don't get me wrong here this movie is really really fun, but it's in the freaking top 250 !? To keep it simple, this movie is a zombie movie with a British comedy twist. And I find the first hour very good. You get to see some zombies killed, get some laughs and have a smile on your face. Specially with Ed, played by Nick Frost. His character is just mighty funny.My complaint with the movie is that when the gang lock themselves up in the pub, the movie loses my interest. The ending is pretty dull to. I say again, this is by no means a bad movie, it's pretty darn good. But not good enough for a place in the top 250. It could have been so much better if they made this movie like the first hour and stick it full with cool zombie encounters, and not let it end with the pub scene.Kudos for the acting and comedy.

"Awesome, funniest film for a long, long time!","First things first... There have been negative comments about this film, on IMDb and other film discussion boards, because people think it's terrible that a film has been made spoofing George Romero's excellent ""...of the Dead"" trilogy. These should be ignored. Totally. This film does them no injustice whatsoever, but takes the well proven zombie formula and injects some home grown humour, while still retaining the tension and jump-out-of-your-seat scary moments.It should be seen as a compliment to Romero's films.

More than a parody; this is a homage that really works,"If ""Shaun of the Dead"" looks like an extended episode of, or a pilot for, a British TV series then that is no bad thing since those involved have mainly cut their teeth on television and this is the kind of thing that television does so well. ('Alternative' comedy on British television has always been so much better than anything the Big Screen has given us in recent times). It is, of course, a homage to and a pastiche of Romero's Zombie movies as well as being formatted in such a way as to pay tribute to the best of the Comic Strip creations.It's genuinely funny but it works because it also takes itself seriously; in this respect, it is vastly superior to Danny Boyle's misguided zombie movie ""28 Days Later"". Of course, you need to be very clever indeed to pull off a lampoon of a genre that has become somewhat self-consciously a lampoon in itself. There is only so much you can do with putrid, decomposing corpses that won't lie down no matter what, ('Go for the brain', is the advice given here), and with each succeeding movie the fright factor diminishes, so if 'Shaun' never hits a perfect ten on the terror scales it comes reasonably close where pity is concerned. The skill of the film-makers is in creating characters we believe in and whose fate we care about, no mean feat in what is essentially a gross-out comedy. But then the British have always been good at this sort of thing, applying an intelligence to the proceedings that American can only dream about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Yeah, boyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!","If you see only one zombie romantic comedy, this should be it. It's a perfect complement to (or substitute for, depending on your outlook) 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, the two most recent zombie movies.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a salesman at a small electronics store. He lives with flatmates Ed (Nick Frost) and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and hangs out with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) at the local pub, the Winchester. Shaun's life is pretty stagnant at this point. He's 28 but directionless. Liz notices this problem and tells him to take a hike after Shaun bungles the reserving of a table for dinner. Dazed, Shaun gets drunk at the Winchester with Ed. It's not until after a few days of their bender that Shaun and Ed notice the walking dead.The zombies are more or less a metaphor for Shaun's life to that point; that he's just drifting from experience to experience without actually making anything of himself. He likes Ed, but he can't rely on him as a friend (Ed is also jobless); no one else in his social circle can stand Ed. Liz's flatmates don't like Shaun too much, because they think he neglects her. But Shaun isn't dislikable, he's just not all that.. there.The arrival of the living dead - their genesis is never explained, but it's moot - gives Shaun a chance to show he's not some senseless slacker who'd rather play video games or hang around in a pub. And it's at this point that the movie mirrors the earlier, more-serious zombie films, as he and his friends try to escape the clutches of the zombies.Shaun's personality doesn't change drastically, however; it's not as if he's suddenly transformed into Indiana Jones. He makes mistakes, but one thing is certain - Shaun. He appears full of life and confidence, inspiring his followers to .. well, to follow.Going from the promos, one would think this was full of nonstop laughs. Now, there were plenty of moments when I did laugh out loud, but a lot of the movie - especially the final 30 minutes or so - is fairly serious. Lighter than your usual run-of-the-mill living-dead movie, but not a hilarious film full of wacky hijinks. In some respect, that may have hurt the movie a little - people crack jokes when it seems more drama would be in order. And some of the characters are pretty darn unlikeable, and that never helps unless they're definitely the bad guys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

An Excellent And Hilarious Zombie Comedy And One Of The Greatest Horror Comedies Of All Time,"Shaun Of The Dead is one of the greatest Horror Comedies of all time and an Excellent Zombie film that is filled with great direction,tons of zombies,hilarious laughs,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script and a terrific film score. All of those elements make Shaun Of The Dead one of my favorite Zombie films and an unforgettable Cult Classic.Set in London,England,Shaun Of The Dead tells the story of Shaun(Simon Pegg),a sales man that doesn't have many ambitions in his life and is having problems with his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield)and trying to sort his life out. Even though Shaun is having problems,they only get worse cause now Shaun has to deal with a Zombie outbreak that's happening in London meaning that Shaun has to fight off the Living Dead and try to get to a local pub and have a cold beer.Shaun Of The Dead is easily one of the funniest Horror Comedies of all time and is the first in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy(or Blood And Ice Cream Trilogy or Cornetto Trilogy)and is a film that hilarious from beginning to end. It's a movie that takes the Zombie movie genre and uses the genre for over the top laughs and funny Humor that just never stops and after you watch the film your stomach will be hurting so much from laughter that happens throughout the film and the laughs making Shaun Of The Dead a classic Horror Comedy that ranks alongside other classic Horror Comedies such as Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn,The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive just to name a few.. One of the main reasons Shaun Of The Dead is such a great film and Cult Classic is because director and co-writer Edgar Wright and lead actor,star and co-writer Simon Pegg have given viewers a silly and hilarious Zombie movie that pays homage and tribute to Zombie movies of the past such as George A. Romero's films and other great Zombie films while at the same time mocking the Zombie and giving viewers a movie that is creative and hilarious and original as well as stylish and imaginative. The Comedy and laughs in the film are funny,wild and over the top with tons of jokes,dialog and moments in the film that are smart and inventive but is also offbeat and weird and the laughs will have viewers in tears thanks to the main characters and the way they reacts to situations whether it's dealing with Zombies or themselves. The Comedy in SOTD is also very subtle and clever with great and fun references to classic Horror and Zombie movies that came before this film and the references will go over most viewers heads when you first watch SOTD but will be recognized and noticeable with multiple viewings. What's also great about SOTD is that there are moments that are played in a straight forward manner so the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. Although SOTD is a Comedy it never forgets that it's a Horror film as well because there is a few moments where the movie can be suspenseful and intense and can make you jump out of your seat. The main character is an amazing character because he is an unlikely hero that would be able to deal with trying to help his friends and loved ones survive the Zombie Apocalypse with all of the problems he's having in his personal life. As the film goes on we see Shaun start to grow as a leader and man and it's done in a funny and some times serious way with great character development that isn't always seen in Zombie films and you root for Shaun to succeed. The Zombies in SOTD are wonderful and are influenced by George A. Romero's films because like in Romero's film's they look like regular people you see on the street. The way the Zombies are used in the film is masterful and hilarious and will you rolling on the floor laughing. The screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is truly brilliant and filled with amazing and hilarious dialog that is memorable and done in a rapid fire pace that is funny and ingenious and will stay with you after you watch it. The violence and gore in SOTD is bloody and grisly at times but is done in a comedic way so you won't take it seriously. The ending of the film is great,funny and surprising and will put a smile on lots of viewers faces. A wonderful conclusion to this film.The whole cast is great in their roles. Simon Pegg is excellent and hilarious as Shaun,the hero of the film,with Pegg bringing laughs and likability to the role. Kate Ashfield is amazing and funny as Liz,Shaun's girlfriend and has great scenes with Pegg. Nick Frost is brilliant and laugh out loud funny as Ed,Shaun's best friend and roommate and has hilarious scenes with Pegg. Lucy Davis is fantastic as Dianne,a friend of Liz's. Dylan Moran is terrific as David,Dianne's jerk boyfriend. Penelope Wilton is delightful as Barbara,Shaun's Mother. Bill Nightly is great Phillip,Shaun's Step Father. Jessica Stevenson is outstanding as Yvonne,Shaun's friend. Peter Serafinowicz is hilarious as Pete,Shaun and Ed's roommate.The direction by Edger Wright is brilliant and stylish,with Wright always moving the camera with tracking shots,zooms,close-ups giving the film a great atmosphere. Amazing direction,Wright.The score by Daniel Mudford and Pete Woodhead is fantastic,suspenseful and eerie while at the same time full of energy matching the tone of the film. Wonderful score by Mudford and Woodhead. There is also great song by Queen called Don't Stop Me Now,which is used in a hilarious sceneIn final word,if you love Edgar Wright,Horror Films,Comedies,Zombie Films or Genre films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Shaun Of The Dead,an Excellent and Hilarious Zombie Horror Comedy and Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Pegg-cellent! Not just all Wright!,"Apologies for the awful summary above...Shaun is a 29-year-old electrical salesman living in London. He shares a house with two friends and has a steady girlfriend, Liz. Shaun shuffles through life oblivious to events and situations surrounding him, such as his failing relationship and the sudden outbreak of zombies. Liz is tired of Shaun's insistence on spending every opportunity that he can in the Winchester pub. Shaun promises to take her to a restaurant but, due to interference from his overpowering step-dad, forgets to book. Shaun reluctantly suggests going to the Winchester and is promptly dumped.It would all be a pretty straightforward, uncomplicated story if it were not for the continuous news coverage played out in the background (Shaun and his friends remain oblivious to this, however) detailing the recent dead-returning-to-life-and-eating-people phenomenon. Soon the zombies are attacking and increasing in numbers, and Shaun has to shake his ineptitude to lead his friends to safety, rescue his mum and get Liz back.The film opens with the (original) Dawn of the Dead soundtrack playing over the Universal logo, which gradually merges into The Specials 'Ghost Town. This sets the tone for the film, as this is as much homage to Romero's Living Dead trilogy as it is to British culture and comedy. It's not an easy mix, but somehow Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright strike an easy balance between them in a brilliant screenplay. The first act is played mainly for laughs and as a set up for the characters, who are particularly well-rounded for a genre film, and to also slowly build the zombie epidemic up around them. The use of radio and television to portray the arrival and eventual epidemic of the zombies is a nice touch and harks back to Romero's Dawn only here the news reports go unnoticed in the background, as people go about their business with little regard for the events surrounding them. So, we're surrounded by zombies anyway; on the bus, in the street, at work  shuffling around oblivious to each other and our problems. This is a point made bluntly, but to good effect in Shaun, again harking back to Romero's film, where the dead represent a nation of zombie-like consumers.The mannerisms of the dead are similar too; Shaun opts for the slow, shuffling zombies as opposed to the new, fast ones that seem to have replaced them in modern cinema. In fact, this is a film that uses Romero as a law. A zombie law. This is Romero's universe, only the events are happening in London instead of Pittsburgh. The comedy works on two levels within Shaun, obviously one level is for humour, but the other level is an increased realism. How many zombie films are there when, having dispatched their first zombie by bludgeoning them with a cricket bat, our hero has to sit down and have a cup of tea? Through the second act and into the third, the tone of Shaun of the Dead changes. The comedy purposely thins out a little as the zombies lay siege on our heroes. In fact the final act of Shaun is downright terrifying, touching, and gory as hell, including a death scene that ranks up there alongside the best. Not to give too much away, but all that's missing is the line 'Choke on 'em!' Shaun of the Dead should appeal to a wide audience. The self titled 'romzomcom' has just that; a romantic story involving Shaun and his ex, whom he strives to win back. Lots and lots of zombies, and enough laugh out loud visual and verbal comedy moments than you can shake a disembodied leg at. So shuffle on down to your local and see this truly unique British film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Zombie shuffle,Rewatch :: Kinda feel the same way about this as I did when I saw it originally years and years ago - it's really great when it's just having laugh (most of the early stuff) and working as a satire of zombie movies. As it get's into the third act though and becomes a bit more of a conventional affair it does suffers a bit. It kind of falls victim to the tropes and cliches it was originally upending. All in all though still really good and one of the more memorable horror-comedy movies out there.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Really Funny.,"i will start of with the plot: On Friday, Shaun is in a rut. At 29, he's coasted through life--and still hasn't gotten very far, usually winding up at the local pub, the Winchester. His roommate Ed looks up to him--when he can take his eyes off the TV, that is. Liz is re-evaluating their relationship, particularly after Shaun fails to do something special for their anniversary on Saturday. That day, there are train delays, people fainting in the streets, TV news reporters on unexplained calamities. No, it can't be--but it is--the dead have risen. Saturday's isolated incidents mushroom into a full-on zombie assault and, once daylight breaks, it's Sunday bloody Sunday. As manners and flesh take a beating, it's time to separate men from meat, humans from zombies, and living from undead. Shaun and Ed grab whatever is at hand to repel the attacking zombies, summoning reserves of strength they didn't know they possessed and straining muscles they forgot they had. Rounding up friends and family, they press on towards the sanctuary of the Winchester. All that stands in their way are hordes of the flesh-eating undead.This movie is not scary at all (like Braindead aka Dead Alive which is scary then this movie) but this movie did have some very gory scenes which i really like.This movie was absolutely hilarious! from start to end, there also added some drama in this movies not too much but mainly focused on the jokes. The zombies make up effect were really good and there was one of deaths scenes that really stood out and it's was really gory, which i really likedThe acting from Simon Pegg, Kate Ashfield, Nick Frost,Lucy Davis. Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton and the rest of the were greatI going to give this movie a 8 out 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Overrated,"Many have excessively praised this movie but this boat left me on the shore wondering what I'd missed... Yes, this film had its moments of hilarity but, overall, it had the look, feel, storyline & passable script of a 'made for TV zombie comedy' - which dragged on: The movie could have been reduced to a very funny 4-5 minute sketch as part of a general comedy show. My girlfriend even fell asleep half way though it...By no means is it the masterpiece of comedy which many are touting. & I suspect it's one of those cult films which every one and their dog simply *has to* like to be part of the 'cool crowd'.Talk of a sequel...?

Worth Seeing,This is a pretty good film for a lighthearted romp with splattering brains. Really...probably the best mix of comedy and gore out there. There's enough character development to get behind the trials and travails of Shaun and his gang. The script and direction are good and Shaun's buddy Ed is a cut up ( and does some cutting up)! Shaun's gal has a great butt! The British twist on the humor and embedded commentary on society give the film more punch. We Americans are finally are shown the proper use of a cricket bat.The most amazing thing for me is how far reaching Romero's little B&W zombie film has become.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Finally, a zombie movie worth watching","Before ""Shaun of the Dead"", I had just about given up hope for the zombie-themed horror film. Apparently, just about every movie made today containing at least one shambling undead creature must be either tedious or so gruesomely violent as to make professional serial killers lose their lunch. ""Shaun"" changed my mind in a hurry.The movie itself is about two losers, Shaun and Ed, who must fight against hordes of living corpses in order to save Shaun's (ex)girlfriend, his mum, and the pub that forms the center of their lives. Just about everything about this variant of the normal zombie horror flick blew my mind. For example:1. Instead of taking place somewhere in the US, the audience sees their heroes running around London for a decent change.2. Very little gore and gun-play; just some blood spurting around and multiple blunt objects being used to their full potential.3. No more heroic stars, no brave cops or security guards to force their way through the zombie hordes. Here, the action is focused around a white collar bum and his lazy stoner friend.This stand against the zombie norm is one of the reasons why I enjoy this film so much; the other major reason being it's just freakin' funny.If you love comedies and you're tired of the same old zombies ripping the same old heads off the same old movie stereotypes, go for ""Shaun of the Dead"".

"""You've got red on you""","This is the best romantic comedy zombie film (""rom com zom"") you'll ever see, and possibly the ONLY you will see, so watch and enjoy Shaun of the Dead now before it becomes a cult classic. And trust me, it will.Stuck with a dead-end job, having no motivation in life and living with a sluggish flatmate who only plays video games or drags him to the pub, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is your typical underachiever. In fact, his lazy attitude and inability to break this pattern drives his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) to break up with him, leaving him in an ever deeper rut than before. Shaun is so depressed with his situation that he does not even notice the ongoing zombie invasion that turns recently-diseased people into the living flesh-eating dead. It is not until the zombies literally show up at his doorstop and try to eat him and his flatmate alive that they pick up on that something is wrong. Priceless.Shaun of the Dead is the most random and simultaneously brilliant parody I have ever seen. Sure, there have been many well-crafted spoofs over the years (Young Frankenstein, Airplane! Army of Darkness, etc.) but where most films concentrate on parodying one genre, this film takes care of spoofing ALL genres--horror, comedy, romance and it does to in a genius way. For example, when Shaun and the rest seek refuge from the zombies at the local pub, barricading themselves in, it turns into a pastiche of From Dusk Till Dawn down to the very weapons they use, positions they stand in and the zombie attacks they suffer. Then you have the prototype of an anti-hero, Shaun, who turns into a Stallone-like tough guy during a short period of time in the pub, wearing a sweaty bandanna across his forehead and holding a rifle in his hand, generally looking like the most badass character in action films.Just the way the dialogue cuts to an action deserves a great deal of credit as it is perfectly handled. Another thing, I often find myself getting annoyed at the reactions of the characters in horror films when they are faced with danger - they either don't look scared enough or they screw up their reaction in other ways - but in Shaun of the Dead, this is perfection. I don't expect I need to comment on the blatant allegory for the zombie generation of our time and the way people in big cities in London are not entirely different from zombies... a part of the reason why Shaun and his friends take time to realise something is wrong.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Dark British Zombie Romantic Comedy Film.,"...and it is excellent. Shaun of the Dead is very unique. Shaun of the Dead is darkly hilarious. Shaun of the Dead is just a necessary movie experience. When the film came out I didn't go thinking it would be a witty, chuckle every ten minutes ""Wallace and Gromit"" kind of thing. Not the case. Shaun of the Dead is certainly witty, but it is more a laugh really hard every 5 seconds kind of thing. The timing in the film is just incredible.

his films get better all the time,"I watched again and although I never really liked it before, it is good but nothing like as good as the Hot Fuzz (2007). Clearly the writers, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are funny, especially in the first part and with the original idea of the zombies. It was also a clearly good notion of including the parents and the girlfriend. When Wright gets on with the Fuzz he clearly has more money and with a better good idea to explain more of the film and the cinematic extras more than the idea on TV. Of course as he quickly becomes a 'director' his films get bigger all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A George Romero movie......with British humor.,"Shaun of the Dead is a unique zombie movie. It's unique because it's also romantic. It's unique because it mixes British humor with American Horror. It's unique because it's a romantic comedy...with zombies.Shaun of the Dead tells a story about two slackers, Ed and Shaun. Shaun is a %50 loser, %50 nice guy. He loves his work as a manager of an electronics store, he loves playing Timesplitters: Future Perfect with his buddy, Ed and also loves hanging out at the Winchester with him. But he gets overstressed by his flatmate Pete, his girlfriend Liz, and also Liz's friend, David. He is also sad because he was chosen with two options: His girlfriend or the pub he hangs out with.Ed, on the other hand, is a pure loser. He is fat, he has no job and he kept playing Timesplitters: Future Perfect for 6 hours a day. He makes Shaun looks stupid, but Shaun didn't realized this till the middle of the movie. He has a good social intelligence, due to the fact that he knows most people hanging out at the pub (Snakehips the womanizer, the ex-porn star and John the barman). He is easily hated by his 2nd flatmate, Pete.Shaun has a girlfriend named Liz. She's a primary school teacher and both of them met in Greece. She lives with David, a lecturer and Diana, a drama school teacher. She gets tired of Shaun hanging out with Ed, so she wants Shaun to go somewhere interesting than the Winchester, so Shaun promised. But, like other promises, this one's a failed promise.So she dumped Shaun, causing Shaun to hang out with Ed at the Winchester, again.The next day, zombies attacked London. Shaun doesn't realized until a zombie girl appeared in the garden. Worrying that his other loved ones may suffer the same thing, Shaun and Ed came to rescue Liz, Shaun mother Barbara, Diana and David, who thinks that he is more smarter than Shaun and the rest of the crew. And so, they headed for somewhere safe, somewhere Ed says: ""Know where the exits are, somewhere familiar, and he can smoke"", and the only place to have it all is: The WInchester.Now, let's get on to the other characters. Diana is a good friend of Liz who is also supportive of Shaun even when she supports David more. David, on the other hand is not supportive of Shaun in all sorts and thinks that he is smarter than Shaun, and this has a very open debate between the book smarts(David) and the street smarts(Shaun). Peter is Shaun's flatmate. He hates Ed and keeps accusing Shaun of defending Ed. He ends up becoming a naked bathtub zombie. Philip is Shaun's grumpy step dad and has always been unkind to Shaun with his Gothic accent and his suspicious behavior. Barbara is Shaun's sweet mum and despite of Shaun's hatred towards Philip, Barbara still loves Philip, even when becoming a zombie.What differs this movie from other zombie films that it is not about the zombies nor the amount of violence unlike Romero's Living Dead and Raimi's Evil Dead series, but it's more about survival and background. It's tells you more about what are you going to do when something like this happens. The background is also important. Just like Ju-On, the surrounding of the whole area is what's more important. When Shaun was drinking tea with his mum, you can hear the car Ed was driving crashing to the post and when Shaun and Ed were drinking at the Winchester the day Shaun broke up with Liz, you can see the zombie walking to the bar door. It's all that matters, you can even see more of it if you watch it.The whole script was good. It has a good humor and the best ever and also has some reference from zombie films to several 80's hip-hop music. SImon Pegg delivers the best in zombie comedy since Peter Jackson's Braindead, and Edgar Wright's direction gave us the best in high-quality film-making. If you're a fan of horror who hate romance, then this movie's for you. If you're a fan of romance who hates horror, then this movie's for you too. If you're a fan of both, then of course this movie's for you. What else i'm gonna say? Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"When Homage Becomes Original, Even Groundbreaking","In the first five minutes of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, director Edgar Wright establishes himself as a great filmmaker for economical reasons alone, showcasing a group of five British twenty-somethings... consisting of a couple-in-trouble, the guy's friend that caused the trouble and her own two influential chums... as if they weren't crowded within the same small section of the local hangout pub...This snappy prologue also works not only for the sake of comedic introductory laughs but establishes the characters in what's a character-driven zombie flick that basically reignited a whole new British New Wave...Most already know the backstory between Wright and his thereafter Cornetto Trilogy leading man Simon Pegg, here as SHAUN and who, from 1999 to 2001, starred in their sit-com-parody-sit-com SPACED alongside his always lovably dense, extremely chubby and affably worthless sidekick Nick Frost... and not since CLERKS has the theme of a regular guy choosing between his BFF and girlfriend been so hilarious and, in this case, even endearing...And beyond the human characters is director Wright wielding his own ever-present, energetically-charged, ultra-stylistic camera-movements flowing alongside the editing in a hyperactive barrage of pinpoint quick cuts, which makes not only the action sequences shine but ignites even common stuff like having a cup of tea, or taking an everyday whiz...Meanwhile even the antagonistic jerks are relatable and human, including Shawn's grouchy flatmate Peter Serafinowicz as Pete along with an even more unlikable yet deep-down understandably envious Dylan Moran, secretly smitten with Shaun's token perfect girlfriend Kate Ashfield who, along with her own best bud Lucy Davis, embodies the comparably straight character forcing Shaun progress in life... yet she's not alone...Along with his monotone step-dead Bill Nighy and sunny mum Penelope Wilton, our unlikely hero, even while he battles an ongoing assault of eclectic zombies, has to both save his friends and grow up, which is a lot to juggle for both SHAUN and the frenzied yet still somehow miraculously concentrated plot-line that, thanks to the Wright/Pegg team-up, succeeds on all levels, and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
And so the trilogy began...,"""We're coming to get you, Barbara!""Shaun of the Dead is one of those films that benefited from the release date since a few weeks earlier the zombie horror flick, Dawn of the Dead hit theaters worldwide. A couple of years before that Danny Boyle scared audiences in England with his successful zombie flick 28 Days Later. Shaun of the Dead works as a spoof to all zombie movies so the distributors had perfect timing which is essential for a comedy. The film also had a pretty strong fan base considering Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had worked with director Edgar Wright in the past in the TV series Spaced. The setting for this film was just perfect and Wright and Pegg did a great job with the script. Thanks to Shaun of the Dead we got to see these actors team up together for another great film: Hot Fuzz (a spoof on pretty much all the 90's action movies) and for the upcoming The World's End which is receiving great reviews from critics. Fans of the TV series Spaced might enjoy some inside references in Shaun of the Dead, but regardless of whether or not you've seen it you will still have a great time with this film because the script is witty and clever while the performances are also all pretty strong. The more zombie movies you've seen the more you will enjoy this because it makes fun of several of those generic stereotypes. I wouldn't say this is a horror flick because there isn't really a scary moment, but it is an intelligent comedy that makes fun of those cheesy moments in horror films (jump scenes where one person shows up all of a sudden with creepy music in the background). Shaun of the Dead is worth your time if you are looking for a good and fun time.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is kind of a slacker who hasn't done much with his life. He is content to spend his days with his roommate Ed (Nick Frost) and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) hanging out at the local pub where he is a frequent customer. The problem is that Liz is tired of the relationship since all they do is hang out with Ed at the pub and she barely gets to have time alone with him. Shaun promises to take her out to a nice restaurant and turn his life around, but the next day he gets distracted by a visit from his stepdad (Bill Nighy) who reminds him he has to go visit his mother (Penelope Wilton) thus forgetting to reserve a table for dinner with his girlfriend. Tired of Shaun's broken promises, Liz decides to break up with him. Shaun realizes it's time to turn his life around, but something strange is happening in his town. All of a sudden dead people are coming back to life and attacking everyone so Shaun realizes this is the perfect opportunity to prove to Liz that he is capable of saving and protecting her from the deadly zombie attacks.Shaun of the Dead works really well thanks to the great chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; you can tell their friendship transcends the big screen and seeing them pair up is what works best in this film. The British gags and cultural references cross borders and the jokes are effective anywhere. This is one film anyone can enjoy because it works on its own. It isn't one of those spoof films which you can only enjoy if you've seen the movie it's making fun of. The fun and the jokes work on their own and the relationship between the characters is also really strong. Shaun of the Dead came to my attention when Quentin Tarantino shared his list of the 20 best films of the last 20 years and this movie appeared on that list. I really enjoyed this movie, but I don't consider it among the best comedies of our era. In my opinion Hot Fuzz was even funnier, but I really look forward to The World's End which looks really promising. Shaun of the Dead is worth checking out if you are one of the few people that haven't seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

"""Shaun of the Dead"" is an important and entertaining critique of contemporary society, which does everything automatically into an established routine","Shaun of the Dead this is the first successful partnership director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg. Here they also met to write the script this entertaining dark comedy that won the English criticism and the public in all fairness. This is probably the best zombie film to date and certainly inspired other recent productions hugely successful and similar quality as the excellent Zombieland (2009). Many consider also a parody of horror movie released the same year, Dawn of the Dead director Zack Snyder, based on the work of George A. Romero. But the title of the film appears to be in fact the only similarity. The terror is Dawn of the Dead, and the comedy is Shaun of the Dead, in a pun on the name of the protagonist.Winchester, England. Shaun (Simon Pegg) has almost 30 years and works as a salesman in a electronics store surrounded by young people who do not respect. He shares a home with Ed (Nick Frost), his best friend who does not work and spends all day playing video games and selling drugs from time to time, and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). He used to always go to the local pub, but Liz (Kate Ashfield), his girlfriend, is tired of there. In addition, Pete and Liz always complain that he is not separated from Ed, despite his silly jokes and his disinterest in doing something useful. To resolve the issue Shaun accepted an appointment with Liz at another restaurant, but forgets to make the reservation. Irritated, she decides to break up with him. Shaun, devastated, get drunk in your favorite pub beside Ed, without noticing that people around them are becoming zombies because of a strange phenomenon. And when Shaun and Ed realize the invasion of zombies, Shaun creates a plan to save Shaun and Ed first save Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and Phil (Bill Nighy), mother and stepfather Shaun, then go to the home of Liz and convince her and her two friends, Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran), to go with them to the ""Winchester"", a local pub. This is where things get complicated and the group sees itself increasingly surrounded by meat eaters during the escape.The film is watered references comics works of pop culture, movies and former directors of zombies, and is happy to create the new show on top of all references. For example, the name of the Italian restaurant that Shaun wants to take Liz called Fulci's (name of an Italian director of films zombie gore, Lucio Fulci). In one of the interviews on the zombie phenomenon on TV, the presenter says that, contrary to what was speculated, the virus was not spread by apes - a reference to the form of contagion shown in 28 Days Later...(2002) director Danny Boyle; Various times during the movie you can see the logo of a pizzeria called ""Bub's Pizzas"" which is next to the convenience store where Shaun makes his purchases. This is a reference to Day of the Dead (1985), The rifle found in the pub is the same model of the weapons used in Night of the Living Dead (1968), The Death of David is a recreation of the death of Captain Rhodes in Movie Day of the Dead (1985), as well as the way Shaun and Liz escape from the basement of the pub in an elevator. We still have the appearance of some personalities such as vocalist Chris Martin and guitarist Jon Buckland, both from Coldplay. Presenters TV news that Shaun and Ed are all watch industry professionals in real life, as English TV presenter Keith Chegwin. Trisha Goddard (who has a sensational program on British TV), Jeremy Thompson (host of ""Sky News"") and Carol Barnes (Anchor ""ITV News"").Beyond appearances, the mixture of genres is the great secret of the formula applied here. In Shaun of the Dead have some moments of drama, action, horror and especially a lot of humor. We often see the same scene mix two or more genres. For example, when they take refuge inside the pub, the scene gets more tense, with the zombies trying to enter the site, the shadows of their hands in desperate windows give the impression that they will get into the site at any time. And when you finally manage to enter the site, there is a sequence of killings hilarious to the tune ""Do not Stop Me Now"" Queen of success. Even with a lot of humor, the film is also a horror movie and does not spare the viewer of some strong scenes and bloody, killing even more of the protagonists.The direction of Edgar Wright is very careful in various aspects. Logo in the opening credits Edgar Wright compares everyday situations with zombies, making an irreverent and efficient social criticism (see the undead boxes in the supermarket, or in line at the bus, or waking up after a good night's sleep). We may note, for example, when the director decides to make a plan sequence showing Shaun leaving his home and going to work in the same always block with a sequence of events daily. Little later, the director repeats the same sequence shot showing the day-to-day Shaun, but with the changes caused by the infestation of zombies in the streets. What attracts most attention is that Shaun is so conditioned to do the same tasks, plus the fact that he was distracted, he does not realize the zombies and change around your neighborhood. Sequences are well choreographed, causing laughter in a natural way, and it serves to show the rapid proliferation of zombies throughout the city of Winchester. In other sequences are hilarious when Shaun and Ed discover new zombies in your backyard (especially when the zombie woman is thrown into a barrel and gets up as if nothing had happened, to the astonishment of the double and also decide when choosing which vinyl record can play the undead. ""Dire Straits? Can play!""); jumping on the trampoline when Shaun jumps the walls in the middle of the route of flight to the pub; leakage of the house of the mother of Shaun and Liz's house; when they fngem be zombies to conceal themselves in the midst of others (especially in the scene that Dianne think Shaun's mother was making zombie face and she says she was distracted only).The cast chosen is the point of support. The comedian Simon Pegg, who also wrote the screenplay here, was known hitherto for participation in TV series, and gained stardom with this interpretation. So much so that later, Pegg had their doors open and can work in Hollywood productions like Mission Impossible 3 (2006) and Ice Age 3 (2009). Your timing is perfect for comedy, and his sentences are hilarious as well as their facial expressions. The partnership with Nick Frost also yields good times. Frost gives Ed the way sloppy and also manages to convey the notion of a faithful friend Shaun. All others also fit very well and have equal importance in the plot, taking your time to shine. Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis are the couple David and Dianne, two characters very well constructed. The unbearable Pete, played by Peter Serafinowicz, also funny shows her personality boring and morose that diverges from the others. Liz likes of Kate Ashfield Shaun, but requires that their behavior is modified. We can see his initial impression of Shaun go changing your courageous decisions throughout the film. Shaun's mother, played by Penelope Wilton, winning the viewer right away with your nice way, loving and humorous way of speaking. Already experienced Night Bill also makes a cameo hilarious as Shaun's stepfather, looking like a zombie in appearance and speaking slowly, without being zombie.Another highlight is the undisputed issue. If at times Edgar Wright prefers to use smart plans sequence, in others, he and editor Chris Dickens prefer using quick cuts and frantic, using language younger music video. Coupled with the instrumental soundtrack thrilling Daniel Mudford and Pete Woodhead, besides the soundtrack that has songs like ""Ghost Town"" by The Specials, ""Kernkraft 400"" Zombie Nation's ""If You Leave Me Now"" Chicago, ""Panic"" of The Smiths, ""Do not Stop Me Now"" by Queen, ""Meltdown"" Ash's, among others. Each song is inserted in a non-free, and the letters of which marry perfectly with the action taking place on screen.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg show that they are, above all, great movie fans of George A. Romero, honoring several classics of the genre, and even creating new situations and invigorating. Shaun of the Dead is an important and entertaining critique of contemporary society, which does everything automatically into an established routine. So much so, that even when o0s zombies begin to appear, the protagonist realizes that zombies dominated the world. The English production knows play with clichés, creating something new and honor the precursors of all. Undoubtedly served as an influence for suessos recent film and TV series like Zombieland and The Walking Dead.

Fun but forgettable,"Great to see Pegg gets to do a Zombie film, I remember reading a while back that 'Dawn of the Dead' was one of his favourites.It has enough to please British audiences and fans of 'Spaced' will enjoy seeing a rehash of the Tim and Mike friendship. The film's essential cynical premise seems to be that living in Britain is like living amongst Zombies anyway. It starts very promisingly and has some great key scenes like fighting off a pair of Zombies using a record collection, critically sorting and choosing which records.Once all the characters get together though, the film starts to sag. The humour thins out and the plot seems to give up going anywhere. Good intelligent dialogue that 'Spaced' fans might be expecting is replaced by characters yelling and swearing. The film's budget is understandably tight but I would have hoped that Wright and Pegg could have had more fun with the genre. Other than Shaun and Ed, the rest of the characters have little opportunity for development, with Moran's character - David being set up for predictable dispatch near the end.A great first film perhaps.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

I thought that Simon and Kate Ashfield's chemistry was great and, as per usual, Edgar Wright's editing was amazing! It did feel like a pretty standard zombie film though which disappointed me as I'm not a big fan of Zombie films but that's more of a me problem than a problem with the film, I do really like ZombieLand though and that's the only other zombie film I've seen so...I guess your main takeaway from this review should be that I don't know what I'm talking about! :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Really wanted to love this film...,"...as I've always loved Zombie films and especially Romero's Dawn of the Dead. The thing that I just can't warm too is Ed. He's such a horrible friend to Shaun, someone who just uses people and leeches off everyone. There's nothing likeable about him at all and that's a shame for someone that's supposed to be the main characters best friend. He brings nothing to the story apart from being selfish and a drain on Shaun. Hot Fuzz is the best of the trilogy by far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
I didn't laugh once.,"Britain excels at a certain type of comedy. Any time there is comedy to be had in the mundanity, tragedy and petty minutae of everyday life, you can be sure that Britain is the country to handle it. Leave the pratfalling to other people - Britain has honed this particular style of comedy for years.So explain how this film got it so badly wrong? I loved The Office, which this film clearly wants to be - but this film seems to have completely missed the point. It is like a film student trying to make a Tarantino-esquire film and eschewing a good script and hip, funny dialogue (you know - the things Tarantino is actually good at) for a series of slow-motion action sequences set to a retro soundtrack. In short, they have missed the best parts of the comedy style (the awkward glances, the tragi-comedy etc.) for broad,""safe"" humour. And it doesn't work.But, people tell me - isn't it great to have a Zombie film that pokes fun at the genre. Isn't it original? No it's not. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was using the genre in a similar way long, long before this film came out. And was far cleverer and more subversive than this film could ever hope to be.I never laughed once during this try-hard-to-be-quirky piece of nonsense. Watch it if you're looking for an average bit of slapstick comedy. If you want something cleverer and more uniquely British watch any number of classic BBC comedies.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The Best Horror/Comedy Movie Ever.,"I heard of this movie a couple times but never saw it cause I thought it would be like all the rest of the ""make fun of horror movies"" type of film. I bought this movie at a used DVD store just because it was on sale and thought I might as well see it. It is by far one of the creepiest AND funniest movies that ever came into the film world. After you see this, you WILL understand why it's on the top 250 list of IMDb.com. The all British cast made this movie even more wonderful than if it was an all American cast. I honestly have never laughed so hard at a movie and yet been so freaked out at the same time. The only little ""problem"" I had was the ending is that it just wasn't how I thought it would have ended but it was pretty funny. None the less it is a good ending and a great movie. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies and comedies. The idea that all of a sudden there is a scary moment and then all of a sudden a joke comes out of no where is the perfect combination, especially for this cast and this production crew. The movie is about an hour and a half long and I only wish there had been a little more, maybe just another half an hour. It would completely be worth it. Every little moment and coincidences are extremely deliberate and it's fits so wonderfully. So once again, in conclusion, and so on and so forth... this movie is a must see for really anybody who can accept the same amount of scary and funny in one movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"splendid first watch, retains some good replay value and cleverness in the script; hilarious spot on parody of zombie movies but tries too hard to be dramatic too","What a classic in the zombie flick subgenre, brilliantly blending clichés and stereotypes rampant in horror movies, especially of the Z kind, then one-ups them. Very gory but not necessarily action-oriented. The focus is comedy and satire, and it excells if you don't mind immature humor and profanity. All aboard! Multiple watches reveal many little Easter Eggs and other points of cleverness woven into the script, from repeating certain lines and themes from earlier in the movie, later on. All of the characters are either just the right amount of likable and unique or the polar opposite. Our protagonists are far from perfect, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost still manage to depitct realistic characters and convey chemistry with each other, abounding with humor. My only major qualm is the need to inject dramatic sequences, which muddies the parody toward the end and drags it down with some annoying arguments between characters that feel redundant and endless. Beside that, the actual ending was brilliant and ties it together as one of the greatest genre parodies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Funny, witty and enjoyable zombie comedy!","Shaun of the Dead is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made. Dawn of the Dead was very gory but not at all funny, whereas Slither was just silly and not that funny - but Shaun of the Dead has everything. It is gory and very witty - a real cult classic. People will enjoy watching thick Ed, troubled Shaun and all the other characters in their crazy scenarios that take them across London. But Shaun of the Dead is also quite a realistic and troubling depiction of an apocalyptic world - made even more realistic by the fact that it builds up fear and chaos as it continues and starts on generally quite a small scale (chronicling the happenings at Shaun and Ed's house), rather than throwing us straight into the action right at the start like on Dawn of the Dead. The first 25 minutes are mainly concentrated on Shaun's social life - but hints are dropped on the zombie plague as the film continues, and despite the fact that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be Shaun of the Dead if it wasn't for the zombies, the film is really about Shaun's life and how quickly your life can change in one day. Instead of zombies getting blasted with shotguns and escaped from with cars, Shaun of the Dead follows the adventures of Shaun's ragtag group through the streets - in a way that probably would happen if something like this were ever to happen. Shaun and his friends didn't have guns or huge malls to defend them - they only had each other, their brains, and cunning plans. The bit where they all pretended to be zombies to get through a zombie crowd was genius and a plan that could be used in real life. Though the end is somewhat very action-packed, Shaun of the Dead is generally a very gritty and shocking film made on a small scale to capture the essence of real suburban life and the emotions and feelings of a couple of people trying to live through something they did not understand or could escape from. What I've been trying to say is - if a zombie plague were to happen in real life, Shaun of the Dead would be the closest thing to a proper survival guide you could get your hands on. I've spent most of my comment trying to be serious about this film when it is actually light-hearted, but I personally believe this is what every horror-comedy (or comedy in general) film should aspire to. With a packed-with-extras DVD release (complete with an interesting trivia track, commentaries, and tons more stuff), Shaun of the Dead is definitely one to get if you see it cheap.

Zombies and romance...,"What a great British mish-mash of fantastic stuff! Haven't had such a laugh in ages. This film is -highly- recommendable. Nevermind if you don't like blood and/or gore - the amount of seriousness in this movie is more or less on par with your standard episode of Tom & Jerry. For once it seems a zombie-flick actually had a budget. There's nothing to complain about in the special effects department, and the visual style of the film is just plain great. If you've seen Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream, and Guy Ritchies Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels you'll probably see some common ground in the visual style - although Shaun of the dead contains nothing of the seriousness of Requiem...Sure... a few hundred liters of blood... but, it's just plain 'ole fun. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Great story and characters,"This film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreak.Shaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction. Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Funny and entertaining,"Shaun of the Dead is one of three ""zombie"" films that I have seen in my life. 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead (the remake) are the other two. SotD is probably the film that I like the least out of these three. That doesn't mean that I think SotD is bad, quite the contrary, I think it's rather good. It is funny, entertaining and, at times, gory. What makes me say that it is only ""rather good"" then? Well, I think the first 30 minutes or so border on boring. There are definitely a few laughs, but nothing more. However, from the moment Shaun and Ed realise something is horribly wrong the movie works on all levels. Some scenes are hilarious (like the one where Ed and Shaun discuss which records to throw at the zombies, *while* the zombies are walking towards them) and some scenes are actually quite touching.Too bad about the slow beginning, but in the end it turned out to be a very entertaining film.

Don't die laughing!,"Even if you are a horror movie fan, you have to admit that many movies in this genre are rather lame, and I happen to be one of those people). Those that are successful (meaning they have gained cult status) usually are so because of their emphasis on humour (Lord of the Rings' director Peter Jackson's splatter-fest Dead Alive comes to mind) than gore or jump-out-of-your-seat terror. Shaun of the Dead, an offering from the UKs Edgar Wright is one such flick. Your local B-movie aficionado would likely mention it in the same sentence as their Troma favorites, even with its mainstream appeal.Shaun of the Dead is essentially a love story with zombies lurking about in the background. Its unlikely hero, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a late 20s slacker who works in an electronics department. He lives a loser's life, and is looked down upon by his co-workers, is estranged from his mother and stepfather who are disappointed in his under-achievement, and his favorite hobby is sitting around playing video games and smoking pot with his flatmate, Ed. The only thing he looks forward to in life is hanging out with his friends at the Winchester, a local pub which is rumored to contain a cache of firearms.Things start to roll when Shaun's girlfriend Liz decides she's had enough of his dithering and lassitude and leave him. Shaun wants to win her back, but isn't sure how. People start acting strangely, staggering around with vacant looks and biting at passers by, though Shaun is oblivious to all this unusual behaviour. To him, it's little different from seeing striving capitalists heading off to their desk jobs. After he finally realizes what is going on, (though no explanation is ever given for the zombie phenomenon), he takes action and decides to somehow save his girlfriend from the living dead and rescue his mother from the stepfather he despises, who has also started to show signs of zombie-fication.As mentioned, the movie has plenty of humour and wit (though one might have to be British to understand a lot of it), with little gore and few scary moments. One particularly funny scene has Shaun's group making its way to the Winchester Pub through a throng of living dead by mimicking their mannerisms, thereby not drawing any attention to themselves. Another involves Shaun and Ed using Shaun's records like ninja throwing stars to stop the dead in their tracks. As befits what is essentially a romantic comedy, the movie has a happy ending, with a surprising epilogue as well. Several Queen classics in the soundtrack make for an additional treat. This movie might even be good for a first date. Make sure you don't die of laughter. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A hilarious start to a hilarious trilogy,"Shaun of the Dead is the first film in Edgar Wright's Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy (followed by Hot Fuzz and The World's End), and as a big fan of British comedy, these films are easily among the best. Suffice it to say this film gets things off to a fantastic start. The film sets the stage for what's to come in the first twenty minutes by having the buildup to the zombie scenes literally happen in the background, almost blink and you miss it, while the human characters go about their lives, leading to some great moments. Even when the zombie stuff starts, it takes a while for the characters to notice, shown by the lead going about his morning like we saw before, except this time, he's walking past zombies without realizing. Then, once the characters do notice what's going on, that's where the fun really starts. A lot of the humor comes from both the creative deaths and how the characters don't seem to let the ongoing outbreak alter their behavior. For example, in one scene, the two leads try throwing records at the zombies and Shaun starts picking and choosing what records he wants to keep and what records he doesn't mind losing despite the life or death situation. Moments like these plus tons of memorable lines make for a good laugh.The key to great British comedy seems to be deadpan delivery from the actors. The more serious they seem to be taking the situation, the funnier the insanity is. The two lead actors of this film, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, are masters of this kind of delivery. They take the already hilarious script and make it even better with their flat deliveries. It also helps that they have stellar chemistry, something that would carry over to the other two films. The rest of the cast is great too and gets plenty of laughs. Even the characters we don't like, such as the girlfriend's male friend and the stepfather, get some decent laughs. Of course, it helps that the stepfather is played by the always great Bill Nighy. There's also a surprisingly decent amount of dramatic moments that the actors handle well.Edgar Wright has a real talent for directing. His edits are fast paced, sharp, and get across a ton of information in very little time. One notable scene is when Shaun is flipping through TV channels and the dialogue on each consecutive channel, regardless of what's on, seem to flow into each other perfectly. Not only does this further establish what's happening, it's also really funny. The zombie makeup and blood effects are well done. And while there isn't a whole lot to say about the music, there is a scene involving Queen's Don't Stop Me Now that's one of the film's highlights.Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a true modern comedy classic that just gets funnier every time. I can't recommend it enough and the same goes for the other Cornetto films. If you're a fan of British comedy, they're as much a must see as the Monty Python movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

Mild Spoof,"In this spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" London is under siege by zombies as a sales clerk heroically attempts to lead his family and friends to safety. The film wants to have it both ways - be a gory horror film and be a comedy, with the result being mild amusement. The funniest moments are the TV reports about zombies and the best way to deal with them. While the concept is initially somewhat funny in that understated British humor style, it soon runs of steam and goes on far too long. Pegg, who co-wrote the screenplay, makes a good nerdy hero.

Fried Gold of Zombie Movies,"When I first saw 'Shaun of the Dead,' I wasn't sure what I was watching. It was recommended to me by a professor who specifically wanted me to watch it because she knew that I'd like it for the British humor, and she wanted someone to talk to about it.'Shaun of the Dead' is a film that can be viewed in many different ways.

It can also be viewed as a clear cut zombie movie with jokes. Sharp writing with clever dialogue make 'Shaun of the Dead' the Austin Powers of zombie movies.

"Zombies, Comedy, Romance...What else could you ask for?","Shaun of the Dead is a truly unique film in the aspect that is seamlessly combines zombie horror with a romantic comedy. What I expected was a funny, but shallow zombie/comedy flick, but underneath the blood and humor, it really is a heartfelt movie.The movie begins like you would expect it to. It was hilarious, with lots of subtle hints of what would happen later. The actors are all fantastic and each one of them is hilarious in their own way. The script is sharp and witty (although a lot of that British humor might have gone way over my head) and the direction was spot-on. What I didn't expect, though, came toward the end. Near the conclusion, the film actually gets pretty heavy. From such themes as keeping those you love alive, but keeping everyone safe and being in complete desperation make this a surprisingly intense movie. I also really really liked the use of Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" and the references to ""Night of the Living Dead"".

Bloody awesome! Best comedy of the year!,"Sometimes a man just needs a little bit of motivation to fix the problems of life, and what better motivation than a bunch of zombies? Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a guy who has just been dump by his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because of his lack of ambitions. Stuck in a dead end job and in a constant fight with his step father, Shaun can only rely on his good old friend Ed (Nick Frost) and the old pub they frequent, the Winchester. When zombies appear and begin to wreak havoc, Shaun decides this may be the chance to prove Liz that he can be a man and goes on a quest to rescue her, and take her to the Winchester.That's basically the plot of Edgar Wright's brilliant romantic-zombie comedy, ""Shaun of the Dead"". Straight from the great sitcom ""Spaced"", Wright & Pegg have written what could be, the best comedy of the year, and one of the funniest movies of all time. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is basically a romantic comedy happening in the middle of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", with all the clichés of both genres, but included in very intelligent and funny ways.Simon Pegg shines in his character as Shaun, with a performance so good that makes the character truly believable as a loser who must grow and get things done. Nick Frost as Ed is the perfect companion to Pegg, and their chemistry is quite great. Shaun and Ed probably will go down in history as one of the best comedy team in movies.The supporting characters are awesome too and nobody gives a bad performance. Brilliant is the work of Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran as Liz' best friends, and while Kate Ashfield is probably the weakest link, her performance is still up to the challenge.The make-up and SFX, essential in a zombie movie, are top-notch and the care taken by director Wright show his truly respect for the genre he is making fun of in his movie. The film delivers its good share of gore and blood and is also filled with references to classic movies of the genre. Horror fans will be pleased with ""Shaun of the Dead"".Overall, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is now a modern classic, joining classics such as ""Brainead"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" as films that set the standards for comedy/horror. 9/10.

Disgusting and entertaining,"I guess I got already inoculated by previous ""zombie"" movies I've seen, all of them coated with serious story lines. Some were convincingly magnificent (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), some are slightly stupid (like 28 weeks later), while others where plain stupid but entertaining (such as Land of the Dead). But when it comes to disgust and entertainment, as far as I can remember, Braindead had made laugh almost to death, while the rest of my friends squirmed and screamed in disgust watching it. This is the first time I saw a British film that made this zombie hype excitingly and worthily watchable. Since I saw Simon Pegg first in Hot Fuzz I know he excelled well more enough in Shaun of the Dead. He's performance here is even deeper. His comedic talent isn't saturated to the extent of impairing his dramatic abilities. Nevertheless the film worked well. It was hilariously charming and plain, simple scary. The cast were also awesome, see Kate Ashfield there for example. She's a straightforward, understanding, simple and frank girlfriend of Shaun (Simon Pegg), but just like Ed, Diane, David and the rest of the cast swayed me with their offhand and persuading performances. The comedy and bit of drama was cool. It mixed well how the story of the film progressed, very much anticipating. But if I were to compare its cheesy factor of horror zombie flick familiarity I guess Braindead was cheesier in that term. But the rest was cool and brilliant. I deem it's cooler than the latter. I've watched this film few times and I get to love the character more and more. It never wears out for my taste.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Zombie gore and British Humor, Humour...","Firstly, there was hardly any way I wouldn't have liked this film. I love zombie movies. I love gore. The only problem with this movie I had was that it could have used more gore and cannibalism. But then again, I'm a zombie, shall we say, connoisseur, and I expect a lot of gore. This movie follows ecstatically the road well paved by George Romero and Peter Jackson's ""Dead"" (Night of the Living, Dawn of, Day of) and Dead-Alive respectively. Plus, with commercial approval from George Romero, Peter Jackson, AND Sam Raimi, hell, how could you go wrong?? I would've wasted money on Alien Vs. Predator if those three had approved of it publicly (although I would have to question their sanity).While there wasn't enough gore for me, there seemed to be plenty for the average movie-goer judging from the reaction of the audience around me. But again, I enjoy Zombie (Zombi 2 in Italia), Dawn of the Dead (both versions), Day of the Dead, and Dead-Alive--and good luck topping the gore of those films and getting away with an R rating.But to all you Zombie fans, you will, as can be expected, enjoy noticing several obvious (and not-so-obvious) references to past Zombie works--mostly Romero's masterpieces.

As the film progresses Shaun knows that he has to win Liz's heart. He risks his life to try and save her, plus moaning David and happy Dianne. This film has a degree of sadness too, like when Shaun's mother is bitten and dies, or when David is maliciously eaten by a group of zombies.

This isn't an ""end of the world"" kind of zombie film, more a ""there goes the neighborhood"" type that changes the character's lives, but doesn't have any real world impact at the end. The zombies were nearly ""Walking Dead"" caliber in realism. Got a little serious at the end (but it's death, after all). Could've been a lot funnier if I was drinking, but overall a fun film.

funny and scary. best uk comedy horror in ages.,"I had been eagerly awaiting this film since I first heard it was on the cards some time ago. Having missed the first series of ""SPACED"", I was introduced to it at a later date and loved the referential nature of the programme(both to itself and previous moments in pop culture and film), and thought it one of the most original comedies of recent times, mainly because of the accessibility of its characters.Usually I go to see comedy or horror with several mates. But I couldn't wait for them to be around for this one. The cinema was about half full & I was laughing out loud with at least two thirds of the audience. I look forward to seeing it again with mates and seeing their reactions. I can guarantee they will find it at least as funny as I did.OK so I came to this as a fairly avid fan of ""SPACED"" and ""Big Train"" previously. But this actually increased my  expectations of the project. I would be interested to hear the opinions of people who never caught these however. Hopefully they will be encouraged to get hold of the DVDs of these.The menace builds quite gradually like the best of the genre, with nods to cinematic history in the soundtrack from the start. Normality prevails at first(a convention, but one that works well)it seems. The ""zombies"" are beautifully inept(more like original Dawn of the Dead than,say, 28 Days Later or ED3) and provide many a comedic moment of indecision/violence.Ed (Mark Frost's character) was a little less comic but more human than Mike in SPACED. An überslob rather than a territorial. All the same, the relationship between him and Simon Pegg's Shaun aped Tim and Mike.Peter Serafinowicz was inspired casting as the twunt of a 3rd flatmate & provides a couple of genuinely scary moments. Bill Nighy is slightly throwaway ( he always reminded me of David Davies of the FA and Midlands Today with that haircut) but as always reliable as Shaun's (step)dad. Also, if you either liked or completely hated Dylan Moran in Black Books or How Do You Want Me you might like this film. Won't spoil the reason why.There's a brilliant cameo bit that I won't spoil in the middle,but I suppose the main difference between this and SPACED is that Jessica Stevenson only plays a minor (albeit crucial) role in this film. I was a bit disappointed not to see Mark Heap or Bill Bailey in it - they would have made great featured zombies(shouldn't be using that word!).Then again, might have been over egging the pudding.To be honest, I don't think I have done the film justice thus far. In summing up, this is up there with Evil Dead 2 and Demons as one of the funniest (intentionally funny) horror movies I have ever seen. It may also be that I missed some of the references, so I look forward to seeing it again after a bit more discussion with afficionado mates.Go see this film if you like comedy or horror. or preferably both.

Original comedy with lots of filming creativity, you'll find yourself rooting for Shaun very quickly.""Shaun"" manages to accomplish so much ... comedy, originality, fear (had me clenching quite a few times), and romance, all wrapped in a commentary about friendship and sticking with your friends until the very end.Is there a better date movie, I don't think so. ""Shaun"" will fool the guys into thinking they're watching a comedy-horror spoof, this suddenly it springs this ""romance"" on you, but it's too late! You're already suckered in too and I figure a few of the ""lily-boys"" might actually shed a tear of two.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Great Gory Fun,"You can tell that the writers of Shaun of the Dead were paying homage to George Romero in his ""Living Dead"" series, especially Dawn of the Dead.Though bloody, the humor throughout was top-notch, so much that the blood wasn't bothersome at all. Of course, it helps if one has an idea how British humour works.I bought the DVD, and can safely say it's a ""keeper"", and a movie I will be watching again and again.Of course, I wish I didn't read all the ""mistakes"" that were found in the movie; Who cares, as long as it doesn't affect the plot!!!

Best horror-comedy I've ever seen...,"Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B- class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.British humor, how I love it! ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is full of it. For everyone to know, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead(as the name implies) , it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the Zombies(or zom-rom-com) a self-proclaimed new genre, who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered). Let me make clear right at the beginning that you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. This is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine. There's a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, some horror and, as I said, LOTS of humor! spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. The movie is clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific. The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant. ""Shaun of the Dead"" has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as my favorite, the old record collection that Shaun (Simon Pegg) and ED (Nick Frost) insanely used to throw at two oncoming zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums they wanted to throw and which they wanted to keep! ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun and Ed to realise anything's wrong is priceless. This is as about as original as it gets. They actually manage to pull off humour, violence, decapitations, action, romance, suspense, sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutes! The ending is hilarious, something you'll have to see for yourself.The acting is just brilliant and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. I've always been a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their real life friendship really helps in their reel life chemistry. Anytime they're together on-screen, they just shine. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.Visually the movie is really good looking. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in the movie. There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean step-dad(you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie).There isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks. From beginning to end, the whole mood and the whole atmosphere continue to deliver and to entertain from moment to moment. This is NOT a spoof film, this is a unique take on the zombie genre from a British viewpoint, with a lot of humor and obvious satire thrown in, for good measure.All in all, this is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. You'll be laughing the whole time. I give it 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

The definition of comedy-horror,"'Shaun of the Dead' is as good as comedy-horrors get in my opinion. It perfectly sums up what this genre is all about - violence, gore, a silly storyline and hilarious characters. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old, but it is a timeless classic.I can't think of many better on-screen doubles than Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They are hilarious in all of the films in which they appear together. This one is probably my personal favourite though, it is brilliantly violent and gory, extremely funny and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.'Shaun of the Dead' is without doubt one of those films that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. It is the definition of the comedy-horror genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
One of best British films Ever.,"This is what i call a film. I haven't laughed as much as the first time i watched Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Simon Pegg has said that this film wasn't a spoof it was a Romantic Comedy with Zombies.Which Probably make this film funnier because if it was a spoof, some parts would have been milked to the limit.Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a bum who spends his life down his loyal pub (The Winchester) with his best mate Ed (Nick Frost) who is a fat lazy slob. His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) Decides to break up with Shaun. But suddenly the dead are coming back to life and Shaun must save Liz and His Mam from the undead.This film is so well written. I love Ed he is a fat slob who we all know and hate. Even when zombies are surrounding him he answers his phone and starts talking to a mate.Highly recommended film . *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"""Shaun"" is anything but dead; one of the best films in recent years","Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of horror-comedies. I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions? Fear and happiness. Horror-comedies mix these two elements, and if done correctly - which is no easy feat - you can have one darn fine movie. And ""Shaun of the Dead"" is just that. I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U.S. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations.Simon Pegg (who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the British TV show ""Spaced"") stars as Shaun, a 30-year-old Brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather (Bill Nighy), among other things. Then there's his slacker best friend, Ed (Nick Frost). When his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumbs Shaun, it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hell.But Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepfather. How? Simple: he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombies.I've always been a fan of movies like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Re-Animator"", and George Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy. As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love ""Shaun of the Dead"". The script, by Edgar Wright and star Pegg, knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror. (When it does bring in horror, the casual moviegoer's stomach will no doubt flip - ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?)The cast is terrific, Pegg especially. You care about the characters, and the only one who I didn't care about was ... uh ... dealt with. Edgar Wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when there's something funny going on, but when there's any horror (especially towards the end of the film), his direction becomes quite dark.What can I say? This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror-comedy in years. I was entertained throughout the entire film. Hilarious and absorbing, ""Shaun"" is anything but dead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Best use of cliché ever!,"2004. Me and a friend. This movie had intrigued me, since it promised to be scary and funny. The only actor I had heard of was Bill Nighy. Nonetheless, we turned up and saw one hell of a great movie.To start on a somewhat negative note, the film is very clichéd. The film's plot seems uninspired. It interweaves the average romcom plot (loser tries to sort out his life with the help of his funny friend) with the typical horror plot (a small group of people try to survive the undead onslaught). But it's done in such a way that it manages to be entertaining. The generic rom-com characters are pulled off in such a way by the players that it doesn't feel like you've seen it a thousand times before, though you haveSimon Pegg shines as the eponymous hero, although the best performance comes from newcomer Nick Frost, in his role as Ed, the ultimate ""useless sidekick to hero"" romcom stereotype. He farts, admits that he loves Shaun's mum, deals drugs, plays TimeSplitters and does bugger-all. As a result he gets the best lines.Despite the fact that the whole movie, in a certain light, seems boring, it has some great zombie action - the most memorable being ""the backyard"" scene. It also has the best references to horror movies, making light of everybody from Dario Argento to Lucio Fulci, from George Romero to Sam Raimi. This has all the makings of a cult classic and I suggest you seek it out if you want something funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Great movie I've seen about six times and still laugh every time,"This movie I saw by accident and went into it with no idea what to expect...a horror/comedy movie....didn't think either would work. BUT I was very wrong, the movie speaking takes a couple minutes to get used to (due to heavy accents) but after that it's a very enjoyable movie over and over with many parts that bring tears to your eyes you laugh so hard.The plot is the typical zombie movie but with a funny angle and good acting. Don't want to really say anymore than that since don't want to give any spoilers. But again would HIGHLY recommend sitting through this movie at least once if you haven't seen it yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Hilarious: three thumbs up!,"Honestly, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and whoever thinks otherwise should be clubbed with a cricket bat!! In this romance/horror/comedy, Shaun (played by Simon Pegg), the loser, is in his own little world until he realizes that the undead are beginning to attack the living. It's bloody and gory at times, but mostly funny. This work of masterpiece is full of great quotes! I guess everyone has their own opinion, but I seriously don't understand the people who don't like this movie...I don't see HOW you can't like it. I must have laughed a thousand times during this film! I think I speak for (almost) everyone when I say this is a hysterically funny movie that you can watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Almost perfect British comedy,I have lost count of how many times I have watched this film now but it is still great every time.It is a good mix of subtle humour and very obvious over the top comedy. The balance is important and they get it spot on so there is something for everyone.The two main characters chemistry is perfect (they are friends in real life) which is an important part to making the film work.The story is fairly basic but it does keep you interested even though it is really a stupid zombie film for which there are hundreds to choose from.This is not really a zombie film but a comedy with zombies in it. There is violence but it mostly for the comedy effect.One of the best comedies ever never mind British comedy; a must see.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Frield Gold!,"""It's just one of those days when you're feeling a little... dead."" I really don't know how to describe Shaun of the Dead, except it's a comedy... with zombies. There's been other movies since it that morphed zombies with comedy like Fido and the great Zombieland. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost lead the cast as two lazy roommates. Together with Simon's ex-girlfriend, mom and another couple they try to survive a zombie apocalypse. What I really love about this movie is the humor isn't to in your face; at least not all the time. Pegg and Frost have great chemistry on screen together and Kate Ashfield is really good too. This is one of those movies that is really easy to love. The dialog is funny and the characters fire back at each other quickly. Sometimes fast dialog comes off as annoying, but here it really works. I'd have to say this is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made; be it a straight horror or a comedy. Most zombie movies feel lame and uninspired because there's only so much you can do with zombies. Movies like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland have really breathed new life into the genre though. Shaun of the Dead is really fun to watch and a truly hilarious movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Nothing more than a glowing review.....,"Shaun of the Dead is easily one of the best films I have seen in recent times. It is outrageously funny, very intelligent, and also touching.I can gurantee that you will want to see it time and time again, just to pick-up the little things that are going on in the background. To call this Spaced with zombies (which I would consider a huge compliment) is selling this film very short. My girlfriend was in tears in parts of film, both from the emotion and the laughs.It is also great to see a film that's not been cynically ""American-ised"" to make it sell better in the States. To tell the truth I find this patronising to the Americans if nothing else (I had a friend from Oaklahoma who saw Spaced as a work of genius).To sum up, go see this Movie, and make it the hit it deserves to be...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Edgar Wright gets the most out of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost,"I could have easily highlighted the performance of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in this review for how good they were - and to some extent I will - but I want to focus on Edgar Wright's direction, because I think that it, beyond the wonderful script and performances, is what makes this movie as funny and entertaining as it is.I reviewed Scott Pilgrim vs. The World a little while back and in that review, I noted Wright's use of quick cuts to add comedic effect and speed up of the pace of the film. He continues to use that in Shaun of the Dead and to even better effect. The quick cuts and close ups of Pegg and Frost are often hilarious because of the way they move from action to reaction quickly. It doesn't give the audience to process any other reaction than the one we see on Simon Pegg's face at that given moment. Speaking of Pegg, his and Frost's performances add another layer to the already funny film. Wright puts Pegg and Frost in positions to show off what makes them hilarious. Their friendship is front and center in the film - even to the point of interfering with Pegg's character's other relationship. One scene in particular that I really enjoyed between the two friends is when the apocalypse first breaks out and they are trying to kill the zombies and realize that you have to aim at the head. Wright immediately cuts quickly to them in the backyard going through a vinyl collection, bantering back and forth, and trying to hit the zombies in the head with the vinyls. It's the combination of the absurdity of these two men trying to navigate something as serious as the zombie apocalypse in combination with Edgar Wright's direction that makes this movie absolutely worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"

I love this movie!,"This movie is so funny! I was at a friends house and we had just watched the grudge, and so we were a little on edge (we didn't really like that movie but you know what I mean) and so we were either going to watch Shaun of the Dead or some more horror movies. this was such a good choice! You cannot take this movie seriously. One of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that it switches genres faster than you can think but you're laughing so hard it doesn't make a difference. I have not seen Dawn of the Dead, but I got the movie anyway. It did help a little that someone told me what it was about, but I still cracked up.I would recommend this movie to anyone, just as long as you have a sense of humor and like a little laugh, if you're totally in love with comedies, you'll be splittin' your sides! This movie made me laugh so hard I almost peed my pants!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
A smashing good time!,"This movie is brilliant because of the many levels of emotions it covers: clever, different, intelligent, fun, moving, sad, hilarious, and thirsty - it made me want a pint! :) Shaun (well played by Simon Pegg) and his best friend, Ed (played hilariously by Nick Frost), are great together. Their chemistry is palpable. Shaun's love interest (a blonde - why are they always blonde?!?) does not do a good job convincing me that she is in love with Shaun. Her two friends accurately portray their relationship and also their relationship to Shaun.At the same time I loved Shaun's ""Mum"" (played flawlessly by Penelope Wilton) Barbara who was so warm playing the sweet loving mother of her little boy. The entire remaining cast is excellent.I shouldn't forget all the extras who did such a fine job portraying the zombies. They were very well done with some good old zombie munching going on. 10/10-Zafoid",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
Best Part: First Half Hour,"The first half hour of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the best part for viewers like me who love movies and wanted to see this cult classic but who don't like seeing human beings disemboweled and cannibalized. The first half hour is also the funniest part. The zombies don't come out in full force until later in the film.The first part of the film brilliantly parodies the conventions of zombie films. ""Shaun"" looks and works like a zombie film, but it's depicting average, working class Britons going about their daily lives. This isn't just funny, it's pointed social commentary. Simon Pegg, the writer / star, is suggesting, with as much depth and more cleverness than Becket, that daily life is a struggle through crushing routine, and that escapes and rewards like booze, cigarettes, video games and friends who suck us into lives of low expectations, dull and blind us all. In the best scene in the movie, the zombies have already taken over, and Shaun doesn't even realize it. He crosses a street full of zombies, enters a store wrecked by zombies, selects his standard snacks from a freezer case covered with handprints, slips in a pool of blood, and never notices a thing.Eventually, of course, the inevitable gore splatters across the screen. Loved ones turn into zombies and must be killed. Friends are eaten alive by zombies. Ravenous zombies menace the few remaining humans. It gets pretty gross and scary, and stops being as funny as it had been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
The Most Insane Creation Ever!,"""Shaun Of The Dead"" is far beyond what one might expect, a typical British comedy laden with outlandish, quirky dialogue and scenario; it's outlandish, outrageous, and absolutely insane working unconventionally as both a satisfying comedy and a gruesome blood fest. It will probably go down as an instant cult classic, offering pokes-a-plenty at a drug-induced, conscience-weary society (enter Shaun, who seems oblivious and impervious to the gory catastrophe which has yet to even affect his daily routine until (one of them) threatens to take over his body), along with today's obsession with ""kill and destroy"" everything which budges in one's path (kill the zombies before they can harm us). The dialogue itself is laden with standard, vivacious British humor and substance (""I love my mum!""; ""There's no ""I"" in team, but there's ""I"" in pie""), and as an American ashamed to admit I have hardly explored this British culture, I found the dialogue original, convivial and refreshing; only in a British comedy can decapitating zombies seem so fun and hilarious! Aside from constantly shelling out some appreciated humor, the film is indeed a disgusting gore-fest, so be warned, those who dispose at the mention of ""blood and guts"": this is probably not your movie. Of course, the premise is rhetorically reminiscent of ""Dawn of the Dead"", strictly a horror film, and this film makes light and dread on the ""town takeover of the zombies"" premise in such a clever, if excessive and obscene, execution. Towards the end, the comedy premise sort of wanes away and the story deviates in various other tones: drama (mother-son bonds), romance (Shaun and Liz inseparable), and horror (the violence at times becomes overwhelming and we lament the characters' apparent doom). Perhaps this constructive deviation is less appreciated than if the film would have retained its initial premise of silly, obscene, grotesque comedy. The ending is routine, if over-the-top, but then again, how else would one expect a zany film as this to conclude? Its silly, fresh (if obscene) hilarious premise collaborating with the ""zombie invasion"" premise, makes ""Shaun of the Dead"" one insane, droll, and zany British comedy, sure to be an international ""guilty pleasure"" hit! *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
"Don't stop me now I'm having a good time,... having a good time","I am not a fan of zombie movies to Say the least therefore I was pleasantly surprised and somewhat thrilled when I saw this for the first time.What can I say but what a show, I laughed from start to finish. Simon Pegg is a very talented writer and comic actor. He is in my opinion the British Woody Allen. I was not familiar with him and Edgar Wrights previous working relationship but this is a classic example of a actor and director being on the same wavelenght and working not for the money but for their sheer love of film making.Pegg plays Shaun whose live is bookended by his best mate Ed (Nick Frost) and his local pub The Winchester. He is dumped by his girl friend on the eve of an Apocalypse. He decides overnight that his girlfriend is the girl from him and he must get his life back on tracks. With the aid of Ed he must rescue his girlfriend, her friends and his mother from certain extinction.Shaun of the Dead is well acted, written and directed. It's supporting cast is fantastic. Nick Frost is brilliant as Ed but in my own opinion it's the performance by Dylan Moran that really shine through as the cowardly David. Kate AShfield plays Peggs girlfriend although she comes across as quite annoying I will admit this girl has talent. The Cast also boasts the best in British Comedy ranging from Matt Lucas, Reece Shearsmith, Tamzin Grieg and many others.Shaun of the dead has got something for every one and it will not disappoint Horror fans. Already a cult success partnership I look forward to Peggs & Wrights further collaborations. Especially if they are as clever and funny as this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Horror"
